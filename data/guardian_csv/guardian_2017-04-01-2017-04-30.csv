It was expected that the winter would be hard. Not being idiots EDF arranged that most of the work was done during the summer and autumn. By the time winter came around most of the plants were back online. France consumed record amounts of electricity, and had large imports from its neighbours (thanks Spain, Switzerland, Germany), but also continued to export to other countries that had problems (you're welcome Italy).
At no point did French nuclear generation fall below 45GW, while imports from Germany were never more that 5GW.
The worst thing that happened was that France was obliged to generate around 5% from it's electricity from coal and oil plants. Of course, at the same time, around 30% of the electricity being imported from Germany was generated from coal.
The record: at 8:15 on 20/1/2017 demand was 93.862GW, 55.6GW nuclear was generated, 14GW hydro, 9.3GW gas, 4.1GW oil, 2.6GW coal, 2.3GW imported from Spain, 1.3GW imported from Germany, 1GW imported from the UK.
I find the idea that somehow between 45 and 55 GW was generated continuously from only half the French nuclear fleet interesting -- it seems to be a claim that the system is massively reliable, and that the average French nuclear reactor can produce between 1.6 and 2 GW (in fact it's between 800MW and 1.4GW).', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1491214714000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'2427556', u'in_reply_to': u'95984563', u'id': u'96001190', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Katrin3', u'text': u'Yes, I admit that it must seem like a strange paradox for many Germans.

Like all the company’s 20,000 employees, they had just been given a bonus of €9,100 (£7,735); sales and profits were soaring; Porsche was investing €1bn in new models; and, in the sparkling southern German spring sunshine, their future as skilled craftsmen looked secure, well rewarded and full of promise.
“I am optimistic. We make the best cars and we have a good employer,” said one man. “I am young, but I have bought a house and next year I hope to buy a Porsche.”
But elsewhere the mood in Stuttgart, the car capital of Europe where the automobile was born in 1886 and where Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Bosch and many major auto suppliers have their HQs, is far from confident. All the social, technological and political trends point to a rapid demise of the polluting internal combustion engine, the coming of electric cars and the end to German car dominance.
In the wake of “Dieselgate”, when VW was found to have cheated emission figures, and the arrival on the car scene of digital companies such as Uber, Tesla and Google, all jockeying to introduce driverless and electric cars, the sedate German industry is waking up to the fact that it may be left behind by the US and China and that if it does nothing its cars could soon seem like antisocial relics.
“The industry is at a crossroads. German car companies have had their heads in the sand. They cannot compete with companies like Tesla, or with China, which will determine the future markets for the car. The Chinese market is 23 million cars a year. In Germany it is 3-4 million,” says Christian Hochfeld, director of Berlin-based transport thinktank Agora.
Because Germany sells its cars largely to China, the knock-on effects of what happens there will be huge, he says. “The plan by the Chinese to clean up pollution in their cities by introducing more and more electric cars will drive the global market. They are starting to build cars around batteries and are getting better and better. In a few years, Chinese cities will have quotas for electric cars, progressively closing down the market for petrol or diesels.”
Climate change, too, will force carmakers to go all-electric or, like Toyota, to use hydrogen. “After the Paris climate agreement in 2015 we know that industry has to be decarbonised to meet carbon targets. Either it does something very serious or it will never meet its targets,” he says.
With one in three of all industrial workers in Stuttgart in the car industry, the unions see the coming decarbonised world as dangerous. An internal combustion engine has about 1,200 parts, an electric motor only 200, suggesting far fewer workers will be needed, says Frederic Speidel, head of strategy at IG Metall, Germany’s biggest union with more than 500,000 car workers.
But rather than resist the coming revolution, Speidel wants the companies to build more environmentally friendly cars and embrace the new electric, digitised auto world. “China is developing whole cities to develop only batteries. The battery will be 40% of the whole value of the car in the future world. Air pollution is dangerous,” he says. “Dieselgate was the industry’s Chernobyl and it has to do something. The classic internal combustion engine will sooner or later disappear.
“The old world is still dominant in Germany but carmakers here are in a very difficult position,” he says. “There is not the demand for the electric car yet, but there is the political necessity. We expect the EU to tighten new emission levels by the end of the year.”
Porsche plans to spend €1bn on an all-electric model, the Mission E, to be on the road by next year. Its vision, says Otmar Bitsche, director of e-mobility, is for one in four of its cars to be all-electric by 2025. On current output, that would mean about 60,000 electric cars a year.
“We think it is possible to sell 20,000 a year in Europe by the end of 2020,” he says. “We are not late getting into the market, but we had to wait for battery technology to improve.”
But Germany lags behind some European countries in the electric car stakes. Norway, with just 5 million people, has more than 100,000, the UK has more than 35,000 registered but Germany, with 80 million people, has only 25,000.
That will change fast, say industry watchers. EU carbon standards, which demand a fleet average of 95g CO2 per km by 2021 and much lower by 2025, will force carmakers to build and sell electric vehicles in large numbers, say analysts.
“What started with plug-ins and hybrids is moving quickly to fully electric and driverless cars,” says a spokesperson for Magna, one the world’s biggest car-parts firms, which supplies Ford and others. It expects hydrogen cars to be a long-term goal.
“Electrification is coming fast. I think one in three of all cars will be hybrids, plugins or full electric by 2030,” says Claus Huisgen, director of global marketing at Getrag, part of the Magna group and the world’s largest supplier of transmission systems. “We are definitely in a transition to the electric car. It is being driven by global trends like urbanisation, by CO2 emissions and by China. Electric is the only way to meet CO2 targets.
“I cannot see the end of the internal combustion engine globally, but the direction is clear. It may be phased out in some regions, like Europe and in mega-cities. China is requiring more and more pure electric cars and hybrids. The train has left the station but the timetable isn’t clear. This is a period of great change.”
But Stuttgart has an immediate car problem. Surrounded by the steep hills of the Neckar valley, it is plagued by congestion, the worst air pollution in Germany and the construction of one of Europe’s biggest infrastructure projects, a €6bn railway station.
“The electric car cannot come fast enough to Stuttgart,” said Katja Kruszynski, part of Bl Neckartor, a citizens’ group taking the state to court for pollution breaches. “Cars dominate this city. It has 600,000 people and about 300,000 cars. This is the heart of the car world,” she says. Last week, as nearly 900,000 cars a day drove through and into the city on four-lane motorways, the Green party mayor, Fritz Kuhn, issued another “feinstaubalarm”, or “fine particulate alert”. But powerless for the moment to restrict traffic, fine drivers or stop anyone burning wood, there was little evidence of anyone leaving their cars at home .
Kuhn, a Green mayor in a car capital, is in a difficult position. He might be expected to crack down on car culture but in Stuttgart he must steer carefully. “We need to reduce the number of cars. But it’s a battle to be ecologically sound. It’s OK for cities like Copenhagen [to ban cars] but they don’t have a car industry. They don’t have powerful car companies.
“The industry here does not know where it wants to go. It says, ‘You cannot ban the diesel’ and economically that is understandable. The head of Mercedes tells me he needs the profits from diesel to have the money to invest in low-carbon cars. But if the industry wants to sell in China it will have to make environmentally friendly cars.”
The free-market opposition FDP party is horrified that, from January, it will be possible for the city to fine about 60,000 highly polluting cars from coming into certain parts of the city on “fine dust” days. Stuttgart broke EU pollution levels on 69 days last year, but there should be no restrictions on drivers, said Hans-Ulrich Rülke, chairman of the FDP group in the state parliament.
“I have been hearing all this talk of electric cars for 20 years. It’s always around the corner. Only 7% of all polluting emissions in Stuttgart come from the exhausts of cars and the problem is mostly dust, from brakes and construction. We reject the idea of diesel restrictions. We have to ensure health, but also the health of the economy. We don’t think banning diesels or any car is the way,” he said.
City planner Wolfgang Forderer, charged with improving transport in Stuttgart, despairs of the car culture but has found money for more bike lanes, electric cars, walking routes, better information about pollution and charging points. “This is the beating heart of the world car industry. The reality is it is very hard to do anything against the car lobby. They are well organised. We are 100% over the pollution limits but persuading people not to use their cars is hard,” he said.
“We must change the way we think about cars. We need alternatives. The whole city of Stuttgart is a bottleneck and we have become completely car-oriented. The car people here say it is only a small part of the problem but it’s not.

That's what ""fiscal conservatives"" like you were saying in the 1930s, and one of the reasons the Great Depression lasted so long.
It is total nonsense.
Here's what a famous Chairman of the US Fed said on the subject of the national debt in testimony given before the US in 1938:
""Isn’t it about time that we learned this simple truth? Is it so hard to understand that when an individual owes money he generally owes it to another individual, but when a nation owes money it owes it to itself? When an individual pays a debt, he pays it to someone else. When a nation pays a debt, it pays it to its own people.""
Yes, isn't it about time we learned this simple truth?
How many times have I tried to explain this to you Neil?

As the 1982 budget was being shaped Treasurer John Howard urged his colleagues to attack the deficit by reducing outlays, severely restricting public sector borrowing and if necessary raising indirect taxes. Unemployment had risen from 5.6 per cent in May 1981 to 6.6 per cent in May 1982 and would reach 10.3 per cent by May 1983. Many of Australia’s problems flowed from the prolonged international recession, but they were exacerbated by a major wages breakout in the second half of 1981 and an inflation rate of over 10 per cent. Interest rates were at very high levels, partly because of strong public sector borrowing, and consumer spending and business investment had stalled. Treasury recommended a 1982–83 budget deficit of no more than $500 million, Howard was prepared to go as high as $1.5 billion and the final figure was $1.67 billion. This was seen as a significant policy split between Fraser and Treasury. The Tax Office suggested that a 10 per cent services tax in areas such as entertainment, short-term accommodation, personal services, and motor vehicle repairs could raise $400 million per year. Cabinet decided to raise about one quarter of that amount by extending sales tax in areas such as travel literature, films, equipment repairs, clothing and furnishings. The budget also reduced the standard tax rate to 30 per cent, increased family allowances and provided a tax rebate for interest payments on mortgages of up to $60,000. Unfortunately the 1982–83 deficit proved to be far worse than predicted, as the cost of unemployment benefits and drought relief rose and tax revenue fell.

Those benefits came either directly or indirectly following action and representation from Unions.
If you are so inclined, you can read my historical posts and see I'm not a massive fan of the modern Australian Union movement. But IMO it's not possible or rational so suggest that these worker and employment benefits would have come without the Australian union movement.
And the Union Movement itself was, in many ways, simply illegal. Any collective action like inciting strikes, having meetings, etc often broke the laws of the day. Or laws that were hastily arranged to stop them.
So every now and then, perhaps we should all say a little thanks to the early Australian and global unionists who jeopardised their livelihood, their families and often their own personal safety, and broke unjust laws of the past.

""Coliberalism affirms the long-standing belief that human progress is the result of cooperative effort based on trust and underpinned by an attitude of selflessness, grounded in empathy.
It is a rejection of the neoliberal concept of trying to organize society on the principle of self-interest and enforced through the market by its monopoly on defining value, which it defines solely in terms of financial profit and loss.
Coliberalism works by relegating the market to being a subset of society rather than being its central institution, as it is under neoliberalism. This has the effect of quarantining the broader community from the withering impact of self-interest while freeing the market to deliver economic benefits with minimum regulation and minimum taxation.
Under coliberalism the traditional process of sharing wealth through salary, wages, taxation and redistribution is expanded to include human creativity and social capital as recognized by direct feedback through Trruster.
Coliberalism frees the market to automate to improve efficiency while sharing the gains more equitably and more broadly on a global basis by rewarding human creativity, ingenuity and social capital building.
While coliberalism is a rejection of the dominion of the market over the individual, it is also a rejection of collectivism in all its forms, which can be broadly defined as the dominion of the state over the individual.

For a mind boggling read of exactly who and how this is all done I suggest this piece:
The incessant wailing from the Business Council of Australia (BCA) – half of whose members are belligerent tax dodgers themselves – shows how out of touch the lobby really is.
Among its members of course are the Big Four accounting firms – EY, PwC, KPMG and Deloitte – the very engineers of corporate tax avoidance globally; beyond the law.
The “Big Four” global accounting firms – PwC, Deloitte, KPMG and Ernst & Young – are the masterminds of multinational tax avoidance, the architects of tax schemes which cost governments and their taxpayers more than $US1 trillion a year. Although presenting as “the guardians of commerce” they are unregulated and unaccountable; they have infiltrated governments
When the Australian Tax Office made thousands redundant in recent years, many went to the Big Four. The gamekeepers had turned poachers. Worldwide, the “revolving doors” between the Big Four, Revenue Authorities, corporate regulators and other government departments delivers pervasive influence and render it harder for government agencies to prosecute wrongdoing.
 Essex University Professor of Accounting, Prem Sikka, put it in an oped in The Guardian, “They create sham transactions, phoney losses and phantom assets to enable their clients to dodge taxes”. Yet no accountancy firm has ever been disciplined by any professional accountancy body. Same deal in Australia.
As governments have splashed millions to combat predatory schemes, they have never sought to recover a cent from the scheme promoters; continuing to hand them highly lucrative taxpayer funded contracts instead.

This remains true while there are many buyers, many sellers and perfect knowledge. However, this is not necessarily true of all markets today. Advertising, inequality in the distribution of wealth, monopolistic and oligopolistic practices, and political action, all distort many markets now, labour markets for instance. Also, there are some resources that are so rare but so essential for everyone, and for the future where markets may not be the ideal. As well, in some markets, the outcome of consumption is so adverse that it impacts the whole society and the environment. This means that the market, in some cases, is not necessarily the best mechanism for distribution, the Government on behalf of the nation is.
Markets may be the BEST way to DISTRIBUTE limited resources, but markets are not necessarily the best way TO USE limited resources. Also, markets may not necessarily be the best way to AVERT the nasty consequences, the negative externalities, that can come from the consumption of certain products. As well, if the Private sector cannot generate enough jobs to reduce unemployment, then the Government must, and that doesn't mean beating up the unemployed, it means providing jobs by doing what is essential.
Markets and private enterprise work fine in the short term for discretionary consumption. Having the consumer pay works well for the unnecessary and the here and now. But for the necessary, non-discretionary spending that we all need to do; and for the future a generation hence, markets don't work very well. This is because the market place of the future is not the market place of today; and if something is essential that we all need, then markets may not be ideal either. For the essential, there is infinite demand which means private suppliers can charge what ever price they like. Only the Government planning for what is needed, where the taxpayer pays for the essential and for the future, works; that is, if we are to protect the equity and the egalitarianism that is the foundation of all modern democracies. Also, when dealing with what needs to happen, it is a cost that has to be paid for by the whole economy, otherwise what is the point of being a nation. If it is essential, sometimes it is cheaper for the whole economy if the consumer pays, and sometimes it is cheaper if the taxpayer pays. The total cost over a generation should be the determining factor.
This simply means neoliberalism/neo-conservatism has always been a flawed dogma that has been formulated to benefit the wealthy few at the expense of everyone else. It's like the LNP's policy of tax cuts leading to jobs and growth. However, what is not explained is how this will increase demand and hence lead to more jobs. The LNP's idea seems to be lowering the company tax rate will attract more foreign investment and this will somehow lead to more jobs. An alternate view might be, protecting the real incomes of workers and relating the lowest paid worker's income to the income of the CEO, would work too. It would increase consumer confidence and that should lead to an increase in demand which would increase jobs as well. The LNP ideology of small Government and low taxes for the wealthy leaves you wondering how they view the nation. Is it just for their own benefit at the expense of everyone else? 
The ideology of pure neoliberalism is a myth.

But rather than provoke cries of communism and class warfare, for anyone who has been paying attention over the past decade, the correct response to McManus and Keating’s assertions should be “well, duh”.
McManus’s speech, in which she not only rang the death knell for neoliberalism but reiterated the right for unions to resist unjust laws (pretty much a central tenet of unions ever since unions were first illegally formed in the 1800s) drew the expected shrieks from the right. The Australian’s editorial, for example, referred to it as “class warfare”, and Peter Dutton called her a “modern-day communist”.
It’s always class warfare when those representing the low paid worry about inequality. When the most powerful business executives in Australia come to parliament and demand their companies get a tax cut – as occurred on the same day as McManus’s speech – class warfare is never mentioned. 
That’s because neoliberals see company tax cuts as good for workers. A lower company tax, so the theory goes, leads to increased investment, which in turns increases productivity and leads to better pay for workers. It’s a nice theory, and one that works nicely so long as you ignore that over the past decade productivity has risen while real wages have barely grown. 
The great thing about neoliberalism (a bit of a dopey term, that really just means “small government-pro-market” policies) is that it always works so long as you ignore all the times it doesn’t. In the 1980s, neoliberal economic reforms did work well, if you ignore the 1987 stock market crash and the deepest post-second world war recession Australia has ever seen.
The great period of moderation from the early 1990s onwards, where monetary policy took over the role of stimulating the economy from government spending, also worked well so long as you ignore rising inequality, declining levels of infrastructure, housing affordability, the global financial crisis and the growth of radicalism which has seen racism and xenophobia come into major parties, and a situation where a senator of this country can actually lament in a mainstream newspaper that “many Jews want to suppress Holocaust denialism”.
And the reality is we didn’t need to wait for the GFC to know there were problems with letting the market rule. In climate change, we have the biggest market failure in the history of economics. 
For pro-free marketers climate change is a nasty bur in their shoe. If you accept climate change could lead to rising sea levels, coastal inundation, dislocation of large masses of people, increased intensity of tropical storms and droughts, and grave risks to food and water supply, then you have to accept the market failed to account for such impacts and not only allowed, but ensured they would happen.
Little wonder many free marketeer thinktanks and political parties have instead embraced lunatic theories about climate change being a conspiracy involving the UN, Nasa, every university in the world, China, all major meteorological bodies, the World Bank and the makers of tin foil hats. 
Delusion is preferable to admitting fault. 
The love of neoliberalism also sees in Australia an odd nostalgia for the 1980s – a time where under the Hawke government “reform” flourished. Much like the belief in the infallibility of the small government/pro-market policy, the conservative nostalgia for the 1980s only makes sense if you ignore many things.
Yes, when the Hawke government took power in 1983 it brought with it a smaller government outlook – where balancing the budget was crucial, and where lowering tariffs, privatising assets and letting the market operate was championed. But it was also a government that introduced the capital gains tax, the fringe benefit tax, the petroleum resources rent tax, Medicare and the Accord. 
It was also a long time ago. We are now as close to the 1983 election of the Hawke government as people at that time were to the 1949 election of the Menzies government.
Arguing Hawke and Keating’s approach to the economy is the path to follow is roughly as sensible as someone in the 1980s suggesting Ben Chifley’s policy to nationalise the banks was worth exploring. 
Policy moves forward and good policy should react to failures. And right now there is a lot of failure.
From 1990 to 2007 the seven largest economies in the world grew on average by 2.3% each year; since 2010 (which leaves out the two horror GFC years of 2008 and 2009) that growth has averaged just 1.7%. 
In Australia over the same two periods the average growth level has gone from 3.3% to 2.6%. Things have flatlined so greatly since the GFC that the Treasury now views Australia’s long-term average growth level as 2.75% rather than the previous level of 3%.
And remember this is at a period where interest rates and wages growth are at record lows and industrial disputes at near record lows. 
So when Paul Keating this week responded to McManus’ statement by saying that “since 2008 ... we have a comatose world economy held together by debt and central bank money”, he was stating the bleeding obvious. 
Such has been the record of the world economy over the past 10 years that you would start to question Keating’s intelligence were he not to assert that “liberal economics has run into a dead end and has had no answer to the contemporary malaise”.
It is a view even the IMF – the former arch champions of neoliberalism – are also arguing. Last year researchers for the IMF argued the benefits from austerity measures (the most beloved neoliberal measure) were “fairly difficult to establish” but that “the costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent”.
That doesn’t mean we need to return to the 1970s, but neither does it mean we regard all the movements since the 1980s as positive – whether it be the push for ever lower company taxes, greater industrial relations flexibility, reduced government spending, falling real Newstart payments, failed work-for-the-dole schemes, taxation policy that rewards property speculation and lack of government intrusion to deal with climate change either through a price on carbon or investments in renewable energy and the energy market. 
Sally McManus isn’t being radical when she argues that neoliberalism has run its course, she is merely responding to evidence.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/apr/02/flogging-the-dead-horse-of-neoliberalism-isnt-going-to-improve-the-economy

Gannon has been accused of contradicting clear AMA policy on clean air and going back on his pledge to be less political than his predecessor, but the head of Australia’s peak medical body has denied both accusations.
The AMA’s former vice president Dr Stephen Parnis told the Doctors for the Environment Australia conference on Sunday that Gannon’s comments were “a wilful distortion of AMA policy”.
On Wednesday Gannon told Guardian Australia the health benefits of closing down brown coal power plants need to be considered alongside the health impacts of unemployment and blackouts.
While he said the closure of the coal-fired plant was “good news” for children with asthma, the elderly and people who suffered respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, “there is also the health effects of unemployment that need to be considered”. 
“The Australian Medical Association has clear positions about the risk of providing energy supply through fossil fuels and specifically the risk of brown coal, but somewhere in this we would call for common sense,” he said.
“We need stable base-load power as well, and we need grown-up conversations about gas and nuclear power while technology is developed to deliver renewable energy.”
The AMA has received several letters of complaint from its members, including threats to quit the organisation, and accusations that Gannon has gone back on his pledge to be less political than his predecessor.
One letter accused the AMA of supporting political statements instead of an “evidence-based approach” to health.
“Yes, doctors know that unemployment is destructive to health, but [that] didn’t prevent the AMA from making a stand against the tobacco industry, with resultant lack of jobs,” the letter said.
“Unless this issue is addressed urgently, the world is likely to overshoot the 2C guardrail of warming, creating huge health, social and economic disruption. I would hope the AMA looks at the science rather than the politics, and actually leads rather than follows the politicians from both our major political parties.”
A response by the AMA’s director of public health, Simon Tatz, sought to reassure that the AMA “believes that climate change poses a significant worldwide threat to health, and urgent action is required to reduce this potential harm”.
“While I can understand your concern at the comments that were recently made, I urge you to consider the AMA’s stated policy positions on climate change and human health,” Tatz said. 
On Sunday Parnis said Gannon’s comments were a “wilful distortion of AMA policy” and could be interpreted as “trying to put a handbrake on the health benefits of what was a commercial decision to close the Hazelwood power station”.
“I have some hesitation in saying that, but I think it was a distortion, a misrepresentation of the AMA policy, of which I remain very proud,” he said.
Parnis also suggested Gannon had not acknowledged the health effects of the power station on the people of the La Trobe valley over decades, which Gannon has disputed.
Parnis had not spoken publicly about the AMA since he left his role as vice president in May, but told Guardian Australia he though the issue was too important to stay quiet.
Parnis oversaw the renewal and review of the clean air policy in 2015 and told Guardian Australia he “took exception” to Gannon’s comments, as did a number of other members.
“It’s hard to be clear about the level of antipathy towards what was said,” he said. “There is a spectrum of opinion in a broad church like the AMA, but I certainly didn’t hear anyone happy with them.”
Gannon said he was aware of the complaints, but said neither he nor the AMA equated the loss of jobs at Hazelwood with the environmental and health benefits that would come from its closure.
“The AMA is one of the leading advocates on the issue of climate health,” he said. “It’s just that the AMA has a global view on all of these issues, and I think we can walk and chew gum at same time.”
Gannon said he was pointing out there were health impacts from unemployment and carbon abatement, but was at no stage suggesting it was of equal priority to the health benefits of closing a power station which relied on “the dirtiest form of coal”. 
“We need to be cleverer and smarter about carbon abatement and the necessary changes in society to reduce the impacts of climate change,” he said.
“The necessary changes in changing our energy mix and reducing pollution will have victims and we just need to think about that.”
Asked to elaborate on his earlier comments suggesting the right balance had not yet been struck before closing Hazelwood, Gannon said a safe base-load power had to be ensured as Australia moved towards a greater renewable proportion in the energy mix, and cited the South Australian blackout.
“We just need a secure energy supply, and that does not for one minute diminish very clear AMA policy which is there,” he said. 
“Every member that telephoned or emailed the AMA was responded to and they were pointed in the direction of our policy which talks about all of this – the need to reduce the carbon footprint of our society.”
Gannon said he wasn’t being political as the power plant was being shut down by a French multinational corporation, and said while climate change was “highly political” he had not been taking a political line.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/apr/02/doctors-reject-ama-chiefs-stance-on-hazelwood-closure-and-health

And it starts with water | Judith D Schwartz,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/03/climate-change-water-fossil-fuel,0,"It’s easy for all concerned about air, water and nature to descend into despair as we watch brazen rollbacks of environmental legislation in the US. Just last week, developments included an executive order to rewrite US carbon emissions rules, jeopardising the country’s ability to uphold its Paris climate talk commitment; the end of a moratorium on new coal leases; and the green-lighting of a pesticide claimed to cause harm to children. But as apathy is not an option, let’s try to think beyond the usual strategies. For one, we can recognise that the way we talk about our environmental challenges has interfered with our ability to truly grapple with them: that we limit ourselves by creating too simple a story. Specifically, the story we tell about climate.
Now I’m not speaking of climate-change denial. For at this juncture, with wild temperature swings and record-breaking weather becoming the norm, outright denial amounts to a kind of temper tantrum, a primitive railing against the inconvenience and indignity of elemental change. Rather, I mean the way that we understand climate change, the story we tell ourselves.
In a popular TED talk, Nigerian-born author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie introduced the concept of the “single story”: the tendency to uncritically embrace received wisdom. While she referenced social and ethnic narratives, the “single story”, and its inherent risks of limiting perspective, applies to other beliefs as well. By shifting to a more complex, multifaceted story we can envision solutions that better reflect the realities of climate and how the natural world processes heat.
Our characterisation of climate change – the “single story” – is this: “Climate change is global warming caused by too much CO2 in the atmosphere due to the burning of fossil fuels. We stop climate change by making the transition to renewable energy.” This is certainly a key aspect of the story, and we absolutely need to shift away from fossil fuels … like, 20 years ago. But there are several problems with this narrative. One is the uncomfortable fact that even if, by some miracle, we could immediately cut emissions to zero, due to inertia in the system it would take more than a century for CO2 levels to drop to 350 parts per million, which is considered the safe threshold. Plus, here’s what we don’t talk about when we talk about climate: we can all go solar and drive electric cars and still have the problems – the unprecedented heat waves, the wacky weather – that we now associate with CO2-driven climate change.
Climate is not a function of one sole metric; it is not a single story. And this is where we find opportunities.
When faced with an environmental predicament, it can be useful to inquire as to how nature has approached similar scenarios. For instance, in the case of wildfire, one can ask what processes used to keep that landscape hydrated and therefore resilient to fire. We learn that in the American west, beavers created wetlands and acted as “shock absorbers” that minimised fire risks. And when we ask what maintains our climate, the answer is water.
Were it not for the blanket of water vapour that buffers the Earth, our planet would be too cold to inhabit. The phase changes of water – from solid to liquid to gas, and back – represent an extraordinary transfer of heat. According to Australian microbiologist Walter Jehne, water-based processes in the atmosphere and the oceans, over land and across ice, govern some 95% of Earth’s natural heat dynamics. It is the sheer immensity of water’s role in climate that led scientists to conclude that humans could not have interfered with it. And yet, once we understand how water works – and how water intersects with factors we can influence, such as land use and plant cover – we can help to restore the processes that sustain the heat and energy balance, and therefore sustain our climate.
Water doesn’t move and transfigure on its own: much of its movement is determined by biology, particularly by plants. Consider transpiration, in which plants draw up water and release it as vapour. This is a cooling mechanism, as it consumes and dissipates heat from the sun. According to Czech botanist Jan Pokorný, on a sunny day a good-sized tree may transpire more than 100 litres (21 gallons) of water – a process that represents three times the cooling power of an airconditioning system in a five-star hotel room. Brazilian scientist Antonio Donato Nobre says that collectively, the trees of the Amazon rainforest create a “vertical river” even greater than the Amazon river itself. This is moisture in motion, embodying and conveying heat.
The “single story” has been that climate change will affect the availability of water. The more complex – and complete – story is that water can also have an effect on climate. And that this is activated by plants. Peter Andrews, a farmer and author in Australia, made a statement that has stuck with me: “Plants manage water. And in managing water, they manage heat.” Worth noting: we have de-vegetated a quarter of the planet – including destroying most of our natural forests.
When we talk about “energy”, certainly in terms of policy, we usually mean what fuels our cars and heats our homes. Let’s look at energy in a very basic sense, as in what happens when sunlight meets the ground. Say you have pavement, or land marked by degraded, exposed soil – the condition of much of the world’s surface. When the sun beams down on that bare soil, solar energy is absorbed; it becomes sensible heat, or heat you can feel. Now amble over to a nice meadow, or well-managed rangeland with a thick carpet of grasses. Here solar energy touches down on plants that are transpiring. The solar heat is dispersed and becomes latent heat, embodied in water vapour, to be condensed and released as rain.
There is nothing magic about any of this: throughout human history – the climatically benign period known as the Holocene – climate moderation has derived from functioning ecosystems. The important thing to realise is that we can restore ecosystems, these environments that have nurtured and sustained us, and bring heat and water dynamics back into balance. Because natural processes are so entwined, every step toward regeneration brings multiple co-benefits: more plants mean more photosynthesis, which means more carbon pulled from the atmosphere into the soil, where it adds fertility; every 1% increase in soil organic carbon represents an additional 250,000 litres per hectare that can be held on the land; the more water held on the land, the greater resilience to floods and drought.
Here’s another climate subplot worth mulling over: Walter Jehne points out that based on data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, every square metre of Earth’s surface receives an average of 342 watts of solar energy a day. Because of how humans have altered the environment, we now radiate back about 339 watts per square metre – a difference of less than 1%. If we managed our ecology better, how might we make up that three-watt differential? How about if we had a lot more plant cover and a lot less bare ground?
One challenge to reckoning with climate change is that despite all the weather anomalies we’ve been seeing, it’s difficult to confidently link climate change to any one event. This perpetuates the notion that climate change is an abstraction to be pushed off into the future, and leads to cognitive dissonance in that it seems impossible to “prove” what we know to be so. Let me now introduce an alternate definition of climate change: “manifestations of distorted carbon, water and energy cycles”. That doesn’t negate the single story of fossil fuel-borne carbon but broadens it in a way that creates opportunities beyond fighting fossil fuel interests. At this moment of reckless distraction and denial, it is crucial to find meaningful paths forward.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/03/climate-change-water-fossil-fuel

The water issue and earthquakes [which damage the well lining] should be covered by UK environment agency- my point is that no fracked gas in the UK despite the best efforts of government over the last 7 or so years has boiled a kettle.
BQENDNot quite - In 1996, British Gas hydraulically fractured in the Elswick Gas field in Lancashire (4.5km from Cuadrilla’s Preese Hall well). Gas has been produced from it ever since.
Here's a picture of it.

http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/660/media/images/73178000/jpg/_73178229_fracking.jpg
and
The magnitude of seismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing is affected by pressure changes in the shale formation near to the well. The hydraulic fracturing process fundamentally constrains these pressure changes (Zoback 2012):The Cuadrilla-commissioned report into the seismic events at Preese Hall suggested the following thresholds (de Pater and Baisch 2011):• Magnitude smaller than 0 ML.Regular operations.• Magnitude between 0 and 1.7 ML.Continue monitoring after injection for at least two days until the seismicity rate falls below one event per day.• Magnitude greater than 1.7 ML.Stop injection and employ flowback, while continuing monitoring.
Had the above thresholds been in place for Cuadrilla’s operations, no mitigating action would have been taken preceding the 2.3 ML event on 1st April 2011(Green et al 2012). The report commissioned by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) into the seismic events at Preese Hall proposed a more precautionary set of lower magnitude thresholds (Green et al 2012).

Yes, it's good to plant new biomass, but much of the environmental impact comes from the reduction in soil carbon from harvesting the biomass.
It's been mentioned in this thread that the wood that's used is 'leftovers'. Some biomass that's burned comes from off-cuts and wastes, but if you consider how much biomass we expect to have to burn or process to generate an appreciable fraction of the world's energy, it's clear that we can't do that from offcuts alone. There is already bickering about whether all of Drax's wood is actually off-cuts, or whether the fraction called off-cuts has been inflated to satisfy demand.
If you want to generate lots of energy (electricity or biofuels) from forests, I think we need a better understanding of the true carbon footprint and how different aspects of the operation affect it. It seems truly murky to me at the moment.

Energy use from renewables rose to 16.7% of Europe’s total, up from 15% in 2013, and accounted for 77% of the continent’s new power capacity.
But the clean energy burst is still not moving fast enough to prevent a “lock-in” of already-commissioned fossil fuel capacity, which will otherwise transform into stranded assets.
It was also unevenly spread across Europe, with renewables expanding to take up 30% of the power load in many Scandinavian countries, but only 5% in Malta.
The UK had Europe’s seventh best record for the intensity of its greenhouse gasemissions, but was a mid-table performer in terms of emissions per capita, according to figures compiled by the European Environment Agency (EEA).
Mihai Tomescu, who authored the EEA study, said Europe’s renewable roll-out was accelerating, but not fast enough to halt global warming at 2C.
“The current level of effort needs to be stepped up and this is not necessarily going to happen without additional focus,” he told the Guardian.
The EEA’s report suggests that the EU is broadly on track to achieve its goals of 20% emissions cuts and 20% renewable energy share by 2020.
But a more challenging target for 2050 – of reducing emissions by at least 80% – will require acceleration after 2030, when tough decisions about phasing out internal combustion engines and oil supplies will have to be taken.
James Watson, the chief executive of SolarPower Europe, which represents Europe’s solar photovoltaic industry, said that today’s figures were in line with a 50GW spike in global solar capacity last year.
 “This is a good start and we must be positive about that but if we are truly to meet our obligations under the Paris agreement, we will need to see a much faster growth of renewables and a commensurate, much faster reduction of fossil fuels, and coal power in particular,” he said.
Renewables have replaced 100m tonnes of oil equivalent electricity generation this decade, but will only need to replace 20m tonnes in the 10 years ahead, according to SolarPower Europe’s analysis.
Tomescu noted that Europe’s growth in renewable energy was already coinciding with a drop in fossil fuel consumption. “In broad terms, we are talking about a substitution and this has an impact not only on import dependency but also avoided greenhouse gas emissions,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/03/renewables-cut-europes-carbon-emissions-by-10-in-2015-says-eea

While a handful of prominent Conservatives, such as the former environment secretary Owen Paterson, have argued that leaving the EU will allow Britain to revamp its rules on the subject, the survey found huge support for the status quo.
The Populus-conducted polling found Conservative voters wanted to keep not just relatively uncontroversial protections such as beach standards, but also EU fishing quotas and targets for renewable energy production.
Onshore wind farms won majority support, while the survey found that even two-thirds of leave-supporting Tory voters were proud of the UK’s international role in protecting the environment.
Rebecca Pow, the Conservative MP for Taunton Deane, who works with Bright Blue on environmental issues, said the findings were not a surprise to her.
“I have found huge support among Conservatives from old to young for protecting our precious environment,” she said. “In this Brexit world we should adopt wholesale the current EU environment legislation relating to areas including water, wildlife, habitats, beaches and climate change and tailor it to our particular needs, as time goes on.
“Conservatives have always cared for and been custodians of the environment but this report demonstrates we can be even bolder in our future approach to this area and I shall be working to encourage this endeavour.” 
The polling found support of 90% or more for the maintenance or strengthening of regulations connected to water quality and beach cleanliness, habitats protections, and targets for curbing air pollution and combating increasing household waste.
Renewable energy generation targets saw 85% backing, with nearly two-thirds supporting existing fishing quotas and a ban on the production of genetically modified crops.
The survey found 60% of those polled accept the scientific consensus on human-caused climate change, while more than half of the voters ranked renewable energy generation as one of their top priorities. Two-thirds backed policies to phase out coal from electricity generation.
Even more of those asked support measures to oblige all homes being sold to meet a minimum energy performance standard (70%) and to tighten regulations on new diesel engines (74%).
Sam Hall, a senior researcher at Bright Blue who wrote the report based on the polling, said that as parliament prepared to debate the so-called “great repeal bill”, which would shift EU rules into UK law, “there is no mandate from Conservatives to dilute current environmental regulations”.
He said: “Most Conservatives do care about climate change and the natural environment. They support ambitious environmental policies, including closing Britain’s remaining coal-fired power stations to introducing new low-emission zones in air pollution hotspots. There is a clear mandate from its own voters for the Conservative government to adopt a more ambitious, conservative agenda on the environment.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/04/tory-environmental-regulations-brexit-renewable-energy

You've missed one. The real reason is that they seek attention.
I've been dealing with anti-science deniers online since 1985, the days of dial-up BBS systems and USENET. 
There are strongly entrenched anti-science groups, the biological evolution deniers, the big-bang cosmology deniers, the moon landing deniers, the spherical earth deniers, there is even a significant group who deny that gravity exists and claim that black holes are just dogmatic scientists conspiring worldwide to pretend that gravity exists (that one is called ""electric universe""
Climate science is just the latest field of science where denial is now fashionable. 
The people who claim that UFOs are real or that they've been abducted by aliens have what is called ""fantasy prone personality"" .
The science deniers have what I call ""drama prone personality"" Anything they don't like/don't understand/isn't convenient or simply contains too many vowels for their liking, becomes the stage for an epic drama of the denier against the world, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Indian, Israeli, Australian, Pakistani, Brazilian, Ecuadoran, Icelandic, Swiss, Canadian...scientists and institutions from around the world all manufacturing bad science or silently allowing bad science to go unchallenged...only the drama queens stand for ""truth""
The churches and the religious politicians (i.e. the Republican party in the USA) haven't just encouraged these dogmatic fantasies and psychosis, they have actually groomed them and today it's a requirement for advancement in the Republican party: You must deny biological evolution, abiogenesis, big-bang cosmology, and climate science, otherwise your chances of advancement or promotion or election are slim to none.
Their real accomplishment of churches and Republicans is that they use the fanatical energy of the drama prone personalities, the young earth creationists and climate science deniers and biological evolution deniers and the big-bang deniers (and the vast majority of climate science deniers belong to two or more of those other groups) They use them to get elected, to get donations to the church/party so they can spread the anti-science message farther.
There's a reason they've been trying (with success in backwards places like the deep south, Kansas, etc. to force creationism into biology textbooks and to force climate science denial into science text books. It increases their power. Back in the late 70's and early 80's the evangelicals openly stated their goals were to stack as many local government offices as they can, textbook selection committees, school administrations, even things like water boards (fluoride is a global to control your mind) with evangelical Christians..
Dogmatic fundamentalism feeding off the efforts of fanatical drama queens who will flood every free internet forum there is with endless fantasies about how hundreds of millions of people are spending hundreds of billions of dollars just to suppress the ""real truth"", which only the drama queens represent.
Read every denier post on here or any other forum. Is there *any* post they ever make that cannot be simply explained by egocentric/narcissistic/megalomanical histrionics? 
Occam's Razor. All of the published science is available via the internet, so ignorance isn't causing it. It's trivial to get a legitimate challenge to the science published, so a lack of appropriate venue isn't causing it. 
If there's no rational reason why they would make these claims of global conspiracy set against them, then it must be an irrational reason: The irrational acts of the child who intentionally infuriates their parents because a beating is far better than no attention at all
Is it more likely that there is some unpublished evidence that all of science is completely wrong and a handful of people on the internet are right? Or that a handful of people on the internet suffer from a too common psychological defect?
They post their idiocy on the internet because it draws attention to themselves, because it makes them ""special"", it fills a void in their lives. Politicians and religious leaders are well aware of how fanatical such attention starved people are and they've harnessed all that wasted energy and are using it spread the ""us vs. them"" mentality that politicians and religions thrive on. 
It's that simple. They just want attention.

this is a query I have raised repeatedly, especially when the usual suspects claim that peer X is wrong, I politely ask why, and in what paper(s) can we find the detail demonstrating the correct analysis of the data/methods/conclusion.
Often they are looking at papers from years ago, not the latest research. 
An example is Mann et all 99 (aka MBH 99) the hockey stick, which occupies an OCD niche in the denialist mindset.
Given that the original paper is nearly two decades old, and has been replicated repeatedly, by now the true skeptic using the normal scientific process would have published in a peer reviewed journal in the normal way.

Before the current warming trend began, temperatures in the Holocene (the last 11,000 years) were declining. 
....this period of low insolation and associated cool conditions should continue for about another 1,000 years.
after 1900 the overall decline in temperature sharply reversed
This rate of increase of CO2 is unprecedented, even in comparison with the massive injection of carbon into the atmosphere 55 million years ago that led to the major PETM warming event, and is likely to lead to a similar rise in both temperature and sea level.

The second important piece of evidence is clear: there is no viable alternative explanation. 
In the scientific literature, no serious alternative hypothesis has been proposed to explain the observed global warming.
Other possible causes, such as solar activity, volcanic activity, cosmic rays, or orbital cycles, are well observed, but they do not show trends capable of explaining the observed warming

It rightly rests on the presupposition that the core beliefs of the Republican movement preclude its members seeing beyond their own horizon. What interests me is how the shutters are held down so effectively. It is all very well to say that ignorance is bliss, but are these people all totally bliss-bound? I doubt it. One suspects something murkier at the bottom of their pond! 
You would think that the brute fact that we will all be gone within a decade or two, if we go on doing nothing to geo-engineer our way out of the vortex we are falling into, would make them realise that their attachment to a fixed view, so long held to good effect, in a highly dynamic changing situation is highly likely to become a liability. If there is no mindful movement to accommodate an unfolding set of changes the resulting loss of real power, which must be based ultimately in reality, will automatically generate a vacuum.
My point about the military is that they are fully informed. They are also deeply enmeshed in the military-industrial money-go-round too, but that aside, when things start to seriously fall apart, with a step change in temperature etc., I suspect it will be almost impossible for them to not be pulled into the vacuum created the thoroughly fixated mentally disconnect of groups like these Republicans. Falling into a vacuum is not complicated: vide Trump!
Once the crops start to fail seriously and the food riots break out, the collapse of law and order will give the military no choice: they will have to engage. America is a revolutionary nation which is very used to having all the power in the hands of the few, so this transition will be much more simple to execute than in any more egalitarian or democratic society.
If a step change in temperature occurs, of say plus 4 degrees C, which is highly likely given the methane release likely from the vanishing ice cover on both the Arctic sea and the vast areas of tundra above the Arctic circle, then we will have a very small window of opportunity in which to do something. Only by military law could we move fast enough, but as the battle will be to deliver a techno-fix in time, there will have to be a visionary leader, like Churchill, to bridge the gap between knowledge and power.

There is plenty of evidence that human activity contributes to climate change. It is certain that CO2 rises have a forcing effect.
The question is how much warming overall a doubling of CO2 will have. We do not know with any precision. And the question is how much recent rises in CO2 have contributed to recent warming. We also do not know that with any precision.

I'm not at all clear how the gas itself can heat up effectively merely by radiation from the sun's rays
BQEND
I think that you are missing what the set-up is supposed to do.
Step 1: you want to have an object that is being heated by radiation.
(We can do this with a lightbulb for more controlled conditions these days- though you'd really want an old fashioned filament bulb for best results. )
the idea is that you have a surface area that takes incoming energy / heat from radiation so that the surface of a plate (just meaning a flat sheet as an example of the object). The plate will warm until equilibrium is reached.
If we did this in a vacuum then the surface's equilibrium temperature would be decided by the outgoing radiation alone. 
STEP 2: We want to measure the temperature of the plate
We want to see how the plate's temperature changes before and after
STEP 3: We want to add various gases to the vessel and compare the difference. 
Now we'd start with a vacuum (or near to one to be more precise) 
In this case we have an equilibrium temperature which includes conduction. This would give a simple temperature gradient between the surface and the outside temperature of the vessel. 
This has a resistor analogy. 
*** We are still only interested in the temperature of the plate ***
In the case of the light bulb we have issues of the incoming energy being absorbed and lessened too but I will ignore this issue which would arise potentially with some gases for this conversation.
the conduction and convection issues would be very similar between the gases. 
This can be confirmed with:
STEP 4: a plate heated to the same temperature as the vacuum but with a gas and no light bulb. 
You can then measure the time it takes for equilibrium to result
STEP 5: from the vacuum equilibrium add the gases initially cooler than the current plate temperature. 
With CO2 STEP 5 would lead to the temperature of the plate increasing above the equilibrium temperature.
**In this case we have the plate and thermometer as one.

The difference between convection and conduction of the different gases is insignificant with respect to the effects that are being measured. At the conditions being discussed the differences are minimal.

After all, the greenhouse effect is primarily the transfer of radiation to the ground followed by re-radiation at longer wavelengths coupled with convection in the air in contact with that surface to heat the interior of the greenhouse.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1491498772000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'11108528', u'in_reply_to': u'96233615', u'id': u'96237234', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'TTauriStellarbody', u'text': u'BQSTART

I don't really understand the full experimental details. For instance, I don't like the idea that measurements were made in direct sunlight on a thermometer whose bulb was coated in soot - this would heat up to a greater or lesser degree depending on the convection and conductive properties of the surrounding gases.
BQEND
The measurements have to be made in direct sunlight!
The coating should be black to maximise the radiative heating!
You are now discussing the thermodynamic model in purely abstract terms without being familiar with how things compare. 
The difference between convection and conduction of the different gases is insignificant with respect to the effects that are being measured. At the conditions being discussed the differences are minimal. 
The key points point of interest from modelling would be the bulb surface temperature and the temperature at the outside of the flask. With the induced convection still it will only accelerate reaching equilibrium.
BQSTART
The cannister would quite likely heat up by radiation to a higher surface temperature than the ambient air.
BQEND
Not differently though. 
Whether her contribution was significant is irrelevant - the result of experiment confirms that CO2 absorbs radiation and re-radiates. She didn't have the knowledge to fully understand the subject matter. The fact that she was a woman limited her access to science labs and funding. 
So while Fourier (1822) Analytical theory of heat and Tyndall were more influential, Tyndall didn't start his research until 1859: 
https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Tyndall/
The thing is by this point the concepts would have definitely being been speculated on. 
Foote's findings did contribute to the GHG theory history. 40 years is a very long time in science . Especially in the 1800s.

BQEND
I am slightly more awake now. 
The experiment definitely isn't going to be effected to the extent that you suggested by SHC.
The thing is you need to remember the difference to a what a thermometer is and the temperature throughout the fluid.
The temperature being measured is neither the temperature of the gas in the cylinder nor is it coming from external conduction. 
* The measured temperature is over 51C which means that we are definitely hotter than ambient conditions. 
* conduction from the outer glass would be slower to get to the thermometer in the tube if the CO2 has a higher SHC so would be a lower temperature not a higher.
* It is the illumination of the thermometer bulb which is where the incoming radiation is interacting to result in a temperature increase. 
* this heat is transferred potentially by the outgoing radiation and by conduction. The conduction cooling difference even without being able to confirm the impurities is not sufficient to account for the magnitudes involved. 
* what is happening is that the back radiation from the heated bulb increases the incoming radiation giving a higher BBR temperature.
The results despite some control issues with the experiment are entirely consistent with the claim of observing the GHG effect = although she has it inside out in some of her explanation.

The latest theatrical House 'Science' committee hearing | Dana Nuccitelli,article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/apr/04/inconceivable-the-latest-theatrical-house-science-committee-hearing,0,"Last week, the House “Science” committee held one of its regular hearings to dispute the validity of climate science research. Chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX) articulated the purpose of the hearing when speaking at a recent Heartland Institute climate science denial conference:
Next week we’re going to have a hearing on our favorite subject of climate change and also on the scientific method, which has been repeatedly ignored by the so-called self-professed climate scientists
For that, Smith was rightly called out by Jeffrey Mervis at Science magazine:
the chairman of the science committee in the U.S. House of Representatives acknowledged that the committee is now a tool to advance his political agenda rather than a forum to examine important issues facing the U.S. research community.
Climate scientist Michael Mann was one of the witnesses testifying in last week’s hearing. In the event’s defining exchange, Mann quoted The Princess Bride, and then proceeded to quote Mervis’ condemnation of Lamar Smith:
Smith responded by asserting “that is not known as an objective writer or magazine,” to which the scientific community collectively gasped in horror. This is the magazine associated with Science which, along with Nature, are the two most highly-respected peer-reviewed scientific journals in the world. Mervis has been writing about science policy for Science magazine for 24 years. Lamar Smith, on the other hand is a contributor to Breitbart, entered a Wall Street Journal op-ed into the congressional record, and said this shortly after President Trump’s inauguration:
Unfortunately, as is usually the case in these hearings, despite being presented with the opportunity to learn from climate experts, most of the committee members seemed more interested in expressing their beliefs, however uninformed they might be.
At the 2:04:05 mark in the hearing video, Rep. Dan Webster (R-FL) provided a perfect example of this behavior. He began by asking witness Judith Curry what causes ice ages (Milankovich cycles, which we’ve known for nearly 100 years), so that he could make the point that natural factors caused past climate changes – a point that usually leads to a common logical fallacy (presented here in cartoon form).
Webster proceeded to claim it was “the standard belief of most scientists” in the 1970s that the Earth was headed into an ice age. This is another long-debunked myth; in reality, most climate scientists in the 1970s were predicting impending global warming. 
However, some scientists had projected that if the amount of sulfur dioxide pollution in the atmosphere were to quadruple, that would block enough sunlight to cause dramatic cooling. But since that pollution was also causing acid rain, governments developed regulations like the Clean Air Act, and sulfur levels soon declined. 
The scientists’ projection wasn’t wrong; rather, the scenario didn’t happen because we took action to prevent it, much like if we take sufficient action to cut carbon pollution, we can prevent dangerous global warming. But Rep. Webster spent most of his allotted time expressing his ideologically-convenient beliefs about how clueless climate scientists are, rather than learning from the experts sitting in front of him. Dr. Mann could easily have explained this myth, but wasn’t given the opportunity.
Curry spent most of her time exaggerating climate uncertainties, as she has done for years. In his first question to the witnesses, Lamar Smith made it clear that’s why she was invited (emphasis added):
 What are the uncertainties, complexities, biases involved with climate science or the study of climate science that need to be considered before we can actually make informed decisions about what to do about climate science? 
To be clear, it’s been decades since we’ve known enough about climate science to understand the need to take action to mitigate its risks. In fact, greater uncertainty translates into greater urgency. When driving a car on a foggy night, slowing down is the wise response to impaired vision; putting the pedal to the metal because of uncertainty as to whether there’s a brick wall ahead would be stupid.
In fact, as Mann explained at the 1:09:36 mark in the video, many climate impacts are happening faster than expected. The brick wall is coming into view. Even one of the Republicans’ own witnesses, Roger Pielke Jr. argued at the 1:57:05 mark for Congress to act:
My view – which may not be popular among anyone here – is that scientific uncertainty is not going to be eliminated on this topic before we have to act ... you guys might think about a low carbon tax
Rep. Randy Weber (R-TX) half-jokingly called this “blasphemy.” There was also a consensus among the witnesses that the Trump administration’s proposed slashing of climate research funding would be damaging and counter-productive. If Republicans want to argue that we don’t know enough to take action on climate change, cutting research funding would be grossly hypocritical. That’s like turning off the headlights and putting on sunglasses.
Speaking of consensus, Mann was the only witness who accurately represented the conclusions of 97% of climate science research – a point that was frequently raised during the hearing. Fellow witness John Christy, for example, is among the less than 3% of publishing climate scientists who minimize human-caused global warming. His testimony focused on wrongly claiming that climate models have been falsified, using a flawed, debunked graph.
Eventually, Lamar Smith claimed “there is no consensus; the 97% was derived from a small sample of a small sample.” My colleagues and I have a new paper addressing this claim that will be soon be published, so we’ll return to this myth within the next few weeks.
There was one particularly McCarthyesque exchange at the 1:28:50 mark in which Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA) inquired:
 Dr. Mann, are you affiliated or associated with an association called the Union of Concerned Scientists?
Dr. Mann, are you affiliated or associated with an organization called the Climate Accountability Institute? 
This brought to mind a scene from The American President:
Higgins’ concern is that members of the Climate Accountability Institute have suggested that if documents reveal that ExxonMobil knew of the threats its product poses (they did – we now know Exxon knew), like the tobacco industry, the company could be sued under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. 
Rep. Higgins doesn’t like this idea and confronted Mann, who is a scientific advisor to many climate organizations, including the Climate Accountability Institute. However, 17 state attorneys general have already formed a coalition to investigate ExxonMobil’s activities and determine if it’s guilty of fraud, so it’s difficult to understand why Higgins would attack Dr. Mann about this in what was supposed to be a scientific hearing.
Unfortunately, last week’s hearing confirmed that far too many Republican Party leaders are more interested in protecting the profits of big oil and coal companies than preserving a livable climate for future generations.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/apr/04/inconceivable-the-latest-theatrical-house-science-committee-hearing

May I differ on this point ? Forests can be managed to pursue several objectives at the same time : CO2 stocking, biodiversity conservation, water regulation, and wood production. In Europe there are many examples of well managed near-natural forests (mixed deciduous stands in Central and West Europe or mixed conifer stands in the Alps) where the income for the owner from harvesting mature trees, and the right for locals to harvest some wood, encourages a general consensus for forest conservation. In the tropics trees are growing 12/12 months (so at least double than in Europe) and the cost of forest operators maybe ten time less. So if well managed mixed forests may be economically viable in Europe, they should be >10x viable in the tropics.

Most importantly, 3C may be the ""tipping point"" where global warming could run out of control, leaving us powerless to intervene as planetary temperatures soar. The centre of this predicted disaster is the Amazon, where the tropical rainforest, which today extends over millions of square kilometres, would burn down in a firestorm of epic proportions. Computer model projections show worsening droughts making Amazonian trees, which have no evolved resistance to fire, much more susceptible to burning. Once this drying trend passes a critical threshold, any spark could light the firestorm which destroys almost the entire rainforest ecosystem. Once the trees have gone, desert will appear and the carbon released by the forests' burning will be joined by still more from the world's soils. This could boost global temperatures by a further 1.5ºC - tippping us straight into the four-degree world.

However, since we are talking about illegal deforestation and that technically it requires simply leaving the forest alone to conserve it. 
The ratio of these two numbers doesn't mean much. It is extortion to some extent to suggest that you need to give us more money or we'll chop down our forests.

In some places, such as Brazil and Indonesia, the amount spent by their governments on subsidising agriculture is more than 100 times higher than the international funding provided to those countries for forest conservation. It sends out a contradictory message if a government is signing up to zero deforestation commitments on one hand, whilst simultaneously making deforestation more attractive to farmers.
Some countries are taking positive steps, however. Ecuador, for example, has 27 different subsidies to support palm oil production. Once they found out that some of these subsidies can harm forests, the ministers of environment and agriculture got together and agreed to review the country’s fiscal policy framework, to better align it with sustainable development. We need more of these types of holistic, coherent policy reforms. Tim Christophersen, UN-REDD team leader, UN Environment, Nairobi, Kenya @TimChristo
Forest dwellers are best placed be the first ones to indicate threats and call for help. In the past, radio units were installed in some indigenous communities in the Brazilian Amazon and they did wonders. I think the more we invest in getting low cost tech resources like this to people living in forests, the more we will get in return to fight deforestation. There are 20 million people living in the Brazilian Amazon, we should support their role in protecting their forests. They are the best park rangers as their cultures and livelihoods depend on healthy forests. Yet support rarely reaches them. Rachel Biderman, director for World Resources Institute Brazil, World Resources Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil @rachel_biderman
There is a lack of understanding about the pressures and demands being placed on forests and dialogue around alternative sustainable options. For example, we know that in sub-saharan Africa the vast majority of wood is used for household energy – this puts enormous pressure on local forests and reflects the really tough choices poor local communities have to make every day. Elsewhere the choice is often between keeping forests standing or removing them for agriculture to take place. It appears a binary choice but it should not be. Going forward we need to think about how these pressures can be best absorbed - having a full and frank dialogue with all the people involved is essential. Ian Gray, coordinator, Forest Investment Program, Washington DC, USA
It’s essential for the protection and restoration of tropical forests to actively dispute the false dichotomy between environmental stewardship and economic development. 
Even in the short term the evidence is that countries are generally much better off – in terms of the productivity of their agriculture, in terms of local environmental benefits, in terms of social justice – through well-managed land use that combines forest protection and restoration with sustainable management of forests and higher productivity agriculture, than with the model now often prevailing. 
Several governments are realising this and taking measures to change the paradigm. Brazil’s remarkable reduction in deforestation in the Amazon went hand in hand with impressive agricultural growth. Per Pharo, director, The Norwegian Climate and Forest Initiative, Oslo, Norway
If companies want to meet the zero deforestation target by 2020, they need to increase their ambitions and be more effective at implementation. They have to set up effective monitoring systems that are transparent, so consumers can hold them accountable. Governments also have a role to play in supporting companies meet these targets. For example, Brazil has a lot of data that would help companies to control their whole supply chain, but it is not available. The commercialisation of illegally sourced cattle is an example. The information that would allow companies to monitor indirect suppliers is not shared with them. Cristiane Mazzetti, Greenpeace Amazon campaigner, Greenpeace Brazil, Manaus, Brazil @crmazzet
Greenpeace has consistently provided accurate and genuine guidance
Companies need to activate partners in forested countries to closely monitor their supply chains. They cannot do it by satellite images only. NGOs, communities and indigenous groups can all help in monitoring what is going on close to the ground, but companies need to invest some money if they want the job done properly. Rachel Biderman
In a previous role I was responsible for implementing such commitments for a large multinational firm and I can tell you from direct experience the primary bottleneck is cost. Sustainable supply chains, especially in forest products, are expensive. A verified sustainable source generally costs about three times more than a traditional source. However, there are some environmental NGOs who are amazing partners in helping develop unique approaches to building sustainable forest product supply chains. Greenpeace for example, has consistently provided accurate and genuine guidance. Guardian commenter Cateernaut
Brazil has shown the effectiveness of indigenous territories in maintaining forest cover. The Xingu reserve can be seen from space! But national policy action is needed to give those territories the status of legally recognised protected areas backed up by the state. Similarly, the Katingan Project in central Kalimantan, Indonesia has been effective in controlling peat fires but in order to operate, the project needs a government permit, as well as protection from ill-thought-out national policies. Thus, local and national action should go hand-in-hand. Frances Seymour, senior fellow, Center for Global Development, Washington DC, USA @FrancesJSeymour @CGDev
Incentive-based forest protection schemes can work if the incentives are sufficiently strong. But presently there is not enough funding around for that to happen. There is also a very important question of who to incentivise. Under the UN Climate Change Convention the answer has been that countries must be incentivised because this is a public policy issue. Then countries must decide how to structure their efforts: taxes, enforcement, regulations or incentives, but most likely a mix of all. 
Deforestation is rising again in the Amazon and there is a good case to be made that this has been caused by less vigilance on enforcement, not over-reliance on incentives. Bottom line: laws and regulations that are well enforced are essential to protect forests. Without this, any incentive structure is bound to fail. Per Pharo

The direction our politics is entirely down the UK population. 
The two main stream parties are Labour and the Tories. 
The other parties got fewer votes and subsequently fewer MP's. 
So we could have a new direction very easily. 
The reason the Tories keep winning is simple: 1) They reduce taxes. 2) They are more careful about spending tax payers money. 3) They are good on defence.4) They keep UK businesses competitive. This is important when it comes to Globalisation impacts. 5) They want a free NHS. 6) They take the centre ground on many issues. 7) They are pro-Trident. 
Now I would change my vote away from the Tories if another party had these core values and the Tories lost them. 
Labour when in government actually had most of these qualities except the first two points. They were very spend thrift. 
The EU, is an awful supranational bureaucracy. The EU has many problems but it won't address them: 1) The Euro2) Schengan 3) The migrant crisis 4) The refugee crisis 5) Greece 6) Spain7) Italy 8) Portugal 9) Lack of democratic accountability. 10) EU funds on vanity projects.11) The EU is becoming less competitive and other countries are doing much better outside the block.

“the ultimate goal of this whole process should be to … set the wealth creators free”. (Wealth creators: code for the very rich.)
BQENDI'm not sure why this guy is taking
The Daily Telegraph so seriously. But he is wrong about the definition of ""wealth creators"".
As a country, we need wealth. It is what pays our salaries. It is what supports our consumer-led society. It is what pays the taxes that the government then redistributes to the population. To criticise ""wealth creators"" as being a bad thing is ridiculous - unless the author is suggesting we go back to a feudal, barter system. One that has no concept of a welfare state, profit-driven innovation, exchangeable currency or financial security. 
So the ""wealth creators"" are those enterprises that take in £X worth of raw materials, apply £Y of their own ""special sauce"" and produce £X + £Y + £profit of saleable product. In other words: companies that add value.There is nothing evil in that process. It produces value by satisfying demand and allowing others, further along the chain, to do likewise. Ending up ultimately with happy consumers, a working health service, schools, security services, a transportation system, utilities delivered to our homes and a much longer, healthier, more comfortable lifespan than those feudal peasants could ever dream of.
What we do need to guard against is the abuses that creep in when companies get too big. Standard Oil is the textbook example. A company that crushed competition, exploited its workers and made an absolute fortune for the Rockefellers. Luckily we have a European Union that holds the welfare of workers in high regard - to the extent where the majority of its rules and regualations are designed to protect the rights, safety and freedoms of workers.
So it's just a little odd that it is the working class, more than any other, that has been the most ardent supporter of removing those rights from a BREXITed UK.

Anyone who questions it puts themselves outside the circle of respectable opinion. The sacred value is used to obscure the intentions of those who champion it. Today, the value is freedom. Freedom is a word that powerful people use to shut down thought.
When thinktanks and the billionaire press call for freedom, they are careful not to specify whose freedoms they mean. Freedom for some, they suggest, means freedom for all. In certain cases, this is true. You can exercise freedom of thought, for instance, without harming others. In other cases, one person’s freedom is another’s captivity.
When corporations free themselves from trade unions, they curtail the freedoms of their workers. When the very rich free themselves from tax, other people suffer through failing public services. When financiers are free to design exotic financial instruments, the rest of us pay for the crises they cause.
Above all, billionaires and the organisations they run demand freedom from something they call “red tape”. What they mean by red tape is public protection. An article in the Telegraph last week was headlined “Cut the EU red tape choking Britain after Brexit to set the country free from the shackles of Brussels”. Yes, we are choking, but not on red tape. We are choking because the government flouts European rules on air quality. The resulting air pollution frees thousands of souls from their bodies.
Ripping down such public protections means freedom for billionaires and corporations from the constraints of democracy. This is what Brexit – and Donald Trump – are all about. The freedom we were promised is the freedom of the very rich to exploit us.
To be fair to the Telegraph, which is running a campaign to deregulate the entire economy once Britain has left the EU, it is, unusually, almost explicit about who the beneficiaries are. It explains that “the ultimate goal of this whole process should be to … set the wealth creators free”. (Wealth creators: code for the very rich.) Among the potential prizes it lists are changes to the banana grading system, allowing strongly curved bananas to be categorised as Class 1, a return to incandescent lightbulbs and the freedom to kill great crested newts.
I suspect that the Barclay brothers, the billionaires who own the Telegraph, couldn’t give a monkey’s about bananas. But as their business empire incorporates hotels, shipping, car sales, home shopping and deliveries, they might be intensely interested in the European working time directive and other aspects of employment law, tax directives, environmental impact assessments, the consumer rights directive, maritime safety laws and a host of similar public protections.
If the government agrees to a “bonfire of red tape”, we would win bent bananas and newt-squashing prerogatives. On the other hand, we could lose our rights to fair employment, an enduring living world, clean air, clean water, public safety, consumer protection, functioning public services, and the other distinguishing features of civilisation. Tough choice, isn’t it?
The overriding of the safety mechanism on a ride at Alton Towers led to two young women having their legs amputated
As if to hammer the point home, the Sunday Telegraph interviewed Nick Varney, chief executive of Merlin Entertainments, in an article claiming that the “red tape burden” was too heavy for listed companies. He described some of the public protections that companies have to observe as “bloody baggage”. The article failed to connect these remarks to his company’s own bloody baggage, caused by its unilateral decision to cut red tape. As a result of overriding the safety mechanism on one of its rides at Alton Towers – which was operating, against the guidelines, during high winds – 16 people were injured, including two young women who had their legs amputated. That’s why we need public protections of the kind the Telegraph wants to destroy.
The same ethos, with the same justification, pervades the Trump administration. The new head of the environmental protection agency, Scott Pruitt, is seeking to annul the rules protecting rivers from pollution, workers from exposure to pesticides, and everyone from climate breakdown. It’s not as if the agency was overzealous before: one of the reasons for the mass poisoning in Flint, Michigan, was its catastrophic failure to protect people from the contamination of drinking water by lead: a failure that now afflicts 18 million Americans.
As well as trying to dismantle the government’s climate change programme, Trump is waging war on even the most obscure forms of protection. For instance, he intends to remove funds from the tiny US chemical safety board, which investigates lethal industrial incidents. Discovering what happened and why would impede freedom.
On neither side of the Atlantic are these efforts unopposed. Trump’s assault on public protections has already provoked dozens of lawsuits. The European council has told the UK government that if it wants to trade with the EU on favourable terms after Brexit, companies here cannot cut their costs by dumping them on the rest of society.
This drives the leading Brexiters berserk. As a result of the pollution paradox (the dirtiest corporations have to spend the most money on politics, so the political system comes to be owned by them), politicians like Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have an incentive to champion the freedom of irresponsible companies. But it also puts them in a bind. Their primary argument for deregulation is that it makes businesses more competitive. If it means those businesses can’t trade with the EU, the case falls apart.
They will try to light the bonfire anyway, as this is a question of power and culture as well as money. You don’t need to listen for long to the very rich to realise that many see themselves as the “independents” Friedrich Hayek celebrated in The Constitution of Liberty, or as John Galt, who led a millionaires’ strike against the government in Ayn Rand’s novel, Atlas Shrugged. Like Hayek, they regard freedom from democracy as an absolute right, regardless of the costs this may inflict on others, or even themselves.
When we confront a system of propaganda, our first task is to decode it. This begins by interrogating its sacred value. Whenever we hear the word freedom, we should ask ourselves, “Freedom for whom, at whose expense?”

Sherri Goodman, a former US deputy undersecretary of defence, argues the impact of climate change – rising seas, extreme weather, prolonged droughts – will be a “threat multiplier” for security challenges, and could be the spark that ignites conflict and drives new waves of mass forced migration.
The Asia-Pacific region was acutely vulnerable, she said.
“You may be on the frontlines here in Australia for climate refugees,” she told the Guardian in Sydney. “The first wave will be those who have to flee the low-lying Pacific islands, because many of them will be uninhabitable, even in our lifetimes.”
“But you’re also in ‘disaster alley’ here in the Asia-Pacific region and while there have begun to be efforts to reduce risks of disasters, I’m concerned that we’re not acting as quickly as we should to protect our societies from those risks, which is going to mean more migration.”
Goodman cited the example of the ongoing civil war in Syria, which has produced more than five million refugees over six years of fighting.
But the political conflict in Syria was exacerbated by a long-running drought which drove people into food insecurity, poverty and rapid, unsustainable urbanisation.
“From 2006 to 2010, 60% of Syria had its worst long-term drought and crop failures since civilisation began,” Goodman says. “About 800,000 people in rural areas lost their livelihood by 2009. Three million people were driven into extreme poverty, and 1.5 million migrated to cities.”
“Those conditions enable terrorists like the Islamic State of Boko Haram in parts of Nigeria or al-Qaida in Iraq to rise and take advantage of desperate people in desperate circumstances.”
Goodman is careful not to posit climate change as the sole cause of future conflicts, but argues it will be a contributory, compounding factor.
“Climate is a threat multiplier because it aggravates others tensions and conflicts that already exist.
“Climate-exacerbated water insecurities could eventually become a tipping [point] to wider conflict or instability in the region. We see this now playing out in various ways around the world, but particularly here in the Asia-Pacific region.”
Regionally, Goodman sees the example of Pakistan and India, where historical enmity, long-running religious, political and cultural fractures, and territorial disputes over Kashmir, could be reignited by conflict over water or other resources.
Low-lying Bangladesh, the eighth-most populous country in the world with more than 160 million people, has been identified as being extremely vulnerable to climate change, on some measures the most vulnerable country in the world.
“Another extreme weather event, combined with sea-level rise and storm surge, could send upwards up 10 million people or more along that low-lying coastline in Bangladesh fleeing towards higher ground, which is towards India, which is building a massive wall to keep Bangladeshis out.
“I think that could create consequences for which we’re currently unprepared. India shows no signs of wanting or being able to absorb those numbers of refugees. And then where do they flee? These are mostly people who can’t afford to get on a cruise ship and leave. And if they can’t flee by land into India does that mean they, there’s either a massive loss of life or head off in rickety boats, where they might lose their lives at sea.”
In 2008, the then president of the Maldives, Mohamed Nasheed, speculated about buying land in Australia in order to house his country’s population when the archipelago nation was consumed by the rising Indian Ocean.
Under the global standard for refugee protection, the 1951 refugee convention, there is no such thing as a “climate change refugee”.
The refugee convention, written in the aftermath of the massive displacement caused by the second world war, only recognises refugees displaced from their home countries, and suffering a “well-founded fear of persecution” on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion.
Some regional treaties – such as Latin America’s Cartagena declaration – have a broader definition, recognising as refugees people displaced by “circumstances which have seriously disturbed public order”, which is taken to include natural disasters and food insecurity.
Goodman argues national governments, and supranational organisations, will need to redraw, or add to, the current global protection framework. 
“We do need to rethink the governance for refugees better to reflect the types of refugees we face today. Current governance structures are just inadequate for the modern era.”
Governments and militaries around the world are becoming increasingly cognisant of the national security threat posed by climate change.
In his confirmation hearing in January, the US’s new secretary of defence, James Mattis, said climate change posed a current security threat to America.
“Climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today. It is appropriate for the combatant commands to incorporate drivers of instability that impact the security environment in their areas into their planning.”
In 2015, Australia’s Climate Council released a report, co-authored by the former chief of the Australian defence force, Chris Barrie, that argued climate change “poses a significant and growing threat to human and societal wellbeing, threatening food, water, health and national security”.
In 2016, the army chief, Angus Campbell, made climate security a focus of the annual chief of army’s exercise. He said climate change was “immediately relevant” for militaries and “the scale of climate change problems, their unpredictability, and the level of support required from land forces are key issues for us to better understand”.
The Centre for Policy Development policy director, Rob Sturrock, co-authored a report in 2015 arguing that Australia’s struggle to deal with climate vulnerabilities domestically and across the region was the country’s “longest conflict”. 
The report recommended the federal government appoint a climate security advisory council, connecting the defence, environment and foreign affairs departments to develop a national climate security strategy.
Goodman, founder of the CNA Military Advisory Board, is speaking this week in Sydney at the Lowy Institute, Canberra at the ANU, and Melbourne at the Breakthrough Institute at screenings of The Age of Consequences documentary, about the security threat posed by climate change.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/05/disaster-alley-australia-could-be-set-to-receive-new-wave-of-climate-refugees

So, with correct software settings, the wind power would have helped to stabilise things and reduce the effect of the damage. Which would be a good thing, as far as I can tell.
The SA government had no control over those software settings. They were controlled by the AEMO. The whole idea of the NEM and AEMO and AEMC was to get state governments out of the electricity market and give control to national bodies.
 As far as I can tell, the SA government had very little control at all. All they seem to be able to do is control feed-in tariffs for rooftop solar, and provide financial assistance to projects that were proposed by private companies. They have no control over the distribution system.

I don't fully agree that the report says that the renewable mix had no effect on the state blackout.

There were definitely silly factors involved in the tripping that I don't expect to happen again as they have been fixed.
I would like to wager the next time there is similar weather in SA, that the reliance on wind generation that particular day is a lot lower - which would be reasonable.

1. Peta Credlin has publicly come out and said that she and Tony knew all along that the Carbon Tax made no difference to any voter's hip-pocket. Tony just thought that was a good debating point.

The Australia Institute has taken out a full-page advertisement in Wednesday’s Australian Financial Review calling on the government to act before the peaks in electricity demand hit next summer.
The group says demand peaks can be reduced by “changing market rules to allow very large consumers such as smelters to profit from demand management, such as via the proposed five-minute settlement rule.”
It says the government should adopt software systems to aggregate large numbers of commercial and industrial consumers into virtual peak plants that will provide safe and scheduled reductions in load, on commercially competitive terms.
The group also says new markets need to be built for additional services to reflect changing demands and technology.
The call to action is backed by the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill. With national energy politics locked in a bitter partisan battle, the SA government recently unveiled a $550m plan to boost energy self-sufficiency in the state.
Weatherill told Guardian Australia: “It’s clear there’s now broad acceptance the national energy market is broken.”
“We’re supportive of the measures advanced in the letter, and we’ve been advocating for them at the national level,” the premier said.
Weatherill said South Australia would also continue to press the Turnbull government to introduce an emissions intensity trading scheme for the electricity market.
The Turnbull government has ruled out pursuing carbon trading despite a growing consensus among business, scientific and energy experts that an intensity scheme would create certainty for investors and lower emissions at least cost to households and businesses.
The push is also backed by the leader of the NXT, Nick Xenophon – who used a company tax deal with the Turnbull government last week to extract some undertakings on energy policy.
Xenophon said the Australia Institute, and the signatories to the open letter had “a positive role to play in suggesting changes to market rules.”
“I think this is an important contribution to the debate,” he said.
The Australia Institute’s executive director, Ben Oquist, says the problems in Australia’s energy market require a medium-term fix, but that doesn’t preclude the government taking immediate remedial action.
“While major new energy infrastructure can take years to finance and build, there are several actions that Australian governments could adopt immediately and in the medium term that would lower costs, enhance security and reduce emissions,” Oquist said.
He said the five minute settlement rule had the backing of the Australian Energy Market Operator and the Australian Energy Regulator, as well as other key industry and energy experts.
“It’s a straightforward change with wide-ranging benefits, most important of which will be create conditions to attract investment from fast responding energy technologies, such as batteries,” Oquist said.
The current rules see generators bid to supply power to the national market in five-minute intervals, but prices are determined over 30-minute intervals.
Critics of the current system say it is open to gaming by generators, who can create price spikes at the opening of a trading period before lowering their bids at the tail end of the interval – which has the practical effect of increasing wholesale prices.
Proponents of a change to a five-minute rule says the current process doesn’t allow sufficient capacity for battery technology to be part of a solution to smoothing out price spikes.
The Australian Energy Market Commission is considering submissions on potential rule changes, and is expected to provide a preliminary view this month.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/apr/05/open-letter-urges-malcolm-turnbull-to-deliver-energy-market-reforms

Theory1 and modelling2 predict that hurricane intensity should increase with increasing global mean temperatures, but work on the detection of trends in hurricane activity has focused mostly on their frequency3, 4 and shows no trend. Here I define an index of the potential destructiveness of hurricanes based on the total dissipation of power, integrated over the lifetime of the cyclone, and show that this index has increased markedly since the mid-1970s.

Help welcome',article,http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/apr/05/after-the-flood-no-tourists-please-help-welcome,0,"Light to moderate traffic is easing along the Pacific motorway connecting the Gold Coast and the Tweed, with no particular sign of storm damage or delays. But in Chinderah, just inside New South Wales and just off the highway, John Anderson is in full-tilt disaster recovery mode, contending with the aftermath of the flooding rains that ex-cyclone Debbie sent south.
At the Gateway Lifestyle Tweed Shores over-50s community, in between dealing with a stream of tradies coming in and out the office door – “Righto mate, do what you’ve gotta do, we’ll pay for it” – Anderson describes how last week the water went through “probably 140” cabin-style homes in this complex that he manages.
“On Thursday the tide met the downstream flooding and we were inundated with a metre, metre and a half of water – not a flood, but slowly rising water.” 
By Friday afternoon evacuation was well under way “for those residents happy to go”.
“Gas bottles ripped off their moorings, leaking gas, electricity in residences filled with salt water,” Anderson recalls. “By 10 o’clock Saturday night the park was basically isolated and only accessible by rubber ducky.” He and his wife, Beth, opted to stay and keep an eye on things, sleeping on foam mattresses on the upper level of their manufactured home, with water swilling around on the floor below, until they could get out and about to assess the damage.
Days later, there’s still so much to be done before things even faintly resemble normality. A jotting on the desk blotter says “Copper gas line missing – gone”. Anderson’s mobile rings and flashes up the caller details: “Shade Sail Andrew”.
Out front of the park is a pile of ruined possessions that stretches for maybe 100 metres down the road. “It represents in a lot of cases everything that people own, or did own.” The villas are about 85% privately owned, 15% rented. “Some people are insured, a lot are not because of the cost, being flood-prone.”
Anderson lauds a “magnificent response from the community, individuals” who are pitching in to help out. The ladies from nearby Cudgen public school have been turning up with hot food, and in the top bit of the Gateway park where the water couldn’t reach “we had ladies there cooking sausage rolls and bringing them round. Just the most magnificent response.” 
A short drive away in Tumbulgum it’s clear from the comprehensive inventory of household goods in jumbled heaps at the end of every driveway that some people lost more or less everything. A woman throws her hands up in resignation as a man adds more ruined belongings to one such growing pile. Everywhere is silt and sludge. At the entry to Riverside Drive a chalked sign says “Please stop to help residents”. Nearby a woman, looking newly arrived on the scene, unloads from her car a little yellow water blaster. It seems hopelessly dinky for the mammoth job at hand, but every bit helps and you know she will not go unthanked.
Compounding the heartbreak for Tumbulgum is the death on its doorstep of Stephanie King, 43, her son Jacob, 7, and daugher Ella Jane, 11, after their car plunged off Dulguigan Road and into the swollen Tweed on Monday afternoon. Daughter Chloe May, 8, managed to escape from the sinking car. I arrive on the other side of the river at 11.45am on Tuesday and line up with the rest of the media in a sludgy riverside park. We are being kept at bay as police divers continue their work after having to stop overnight. Even at this distance the water can be seen roiling with bubbles from their difficult work in the murk.
Our neighbour rowed us back next door so we could have dinner with them
Pixie Bennett clutches a Jack Daniels in a can as she stands near me watching the recovery effort. Like everyone else she was stranded by the waters and stripped of everything that she couldn’t get upstairs.
“Sorry we’re drinking in the middle of the day but we’re still in shock – it’s a double whammy for the little town of Tumbulgum,” she says, nodding towards the emergency services at work on the opposite bank. She moved her car on to a high bridge before the water came but lost boxes of possessions when the water rose “two steps from the top of our 13 steps”. A plastic box floated past and she grabbed it, to find a Barbie doll’s clothes packed inside. “Our neighbour rowed over in a canoe and rowed us back next door so we could have dinner with them.”
Further back from the river in Bawden Street, earthmoving contractor Ben May is opening the jaws of his Bobcat loader, plunging it into those roadside piles, clamping down on whatever he can pick up – a fridge, a hot water system – and then mechanically hoiking it into his tip-truck. He’s guided by concreter Geoff Percy, a 16-year Tumbulgum resident.
Good over-the-road mates, they have both been badly hit – “I lost my ute, lots of white goods, it was about seven feet deep through here on Friday” – but have turned away from their own troubles to help others. “Nah, we’ll be right,” says Percy. The tip-truck went under but once the water receded “Ben just changed all the oils and got it going. We’ll do this load and then head further up the street.” 
The words and phrases that come out at these times – like “resilience” and “community spirit” – can sound like cliches until you walk into the sort of situation that gives rise to them.
Two ancient pinball machines sit outside a neighbour’s place waiting for disposal. In their heyday, “Duotron” and “Firepower” cost you 20 cents a go. The owner bustles back and forth clearing up, not wanting to be photographed. “He’s had enough,” says Percy. “Here for 18 years. He’s leaving. Had enough of the floods.” 
Three quarters of an hour after I arrived, the grim task down by the riverside is more or less done. The bodies have been removed and a crane waits to fish out the still-sunken family car. For a while this site has been the focus of the east coast flood story. Now the cameras will swing north to Rockhampton, where the Fitzroy river is approaching its flood peak.
Everyone in Tumbulgum has been at it for days cleaning up. But it looks like they have only just started. It smells like a muddy cattleyard from my country boyhood. Leaving town there’s a hedgerow of household debris tangled in trees along the riverbank.
On the road towards Murwillumbah, through Condong, the same scene repeats itself over and over. Flood-ravaged sugarcane paddocks, pile after roadside pile of everything from barbecues to microwaves to baby strollers to chests of drawers and other buggered stuff. It is like an endless waterlogged forlorn jumble sale. Where will the council ever bury it all?
The makeshift sign in bedraggled Condong is a bit more firm than the one in Tumbulgum. “No tourists please. Help welcome.” Understandable in the circumstances.
A floodline can be a thin topographical boundary between chaos and business as usual. This is brought home when I pull into Murwillumbah. Nearest the river there are familiar scenes of mopping up. Competition for parking spaces pushes me further up the main street than I would have otherwise gone, until I find a spot in front of the old-fashioned Austral Cafe (Established 1919). 
They found some of his gear on South Stradbroke Island
Inside, not so far above that fateful floodline, I get to enjoy a midday breakfast of bacon, eggs, and toast varnished with butter, all in perfectly dry surroundings. The walls are fittingly decorated with historical pictures of the district’s past floods and fires, putting the current events in context.
There’s friendly chatter and laughter amid the tinkle of cutlery on crockery in the Austral. But snatches of the day’s inevitable conversations reach me as well. “They found some of his gear on South Stradbroke Island” … “It went floating past the boat ramp” … “He slept through it, which is probably for the best” … “That’s the hardest part. I mean we’re lucky, but …”
I think about the people in Tumbulgum making the most of their sausages on bread and whatever else neighbours have chucked together, volunteers have brought, or providence has left unspoiled. I hope they can dine somewhere like this when it’s all over.
 The scenic route back from Murwillumbah to the Gold Coast is over the “Queensland road” that crosses the mountains via Tomewin to the Currumbin Valley. The road is damaged and open to “local traffic only”, but when a Falcon station wagon hoons impatiently past me and around the road closed sign, I decide to chance it. I have taken the route plenty of times on my motorbike, I know it well, I’m in an all-wheel drive, it can’t be too bad. And a trek back to the motorway through that landscape of muddied piles of ex-goods and former chattels doesn’t appeal.
It’s a mistake. The weather that caused all the devastation down below has left fallen trees, debris and landslips littering the road up here. Council crews are doing what they can to clear the way through, but like everywhere in these parts they are mere days into what looks like weeks or months of work.
At one blockage I wait behind a campervan for a bit, but then people start getting out of their cars, so I pull a U-turn. On the way down there’s a Toyota 4WD lying on its roof at the bottom of an embankment. The Stop/Go man with one of the road gangs says things are better on the Numbinbah Valley Road, another of my favourite motorbike routes back to the Gold Coast. There are bad patches, he reckons, but you can get through.
And the road is indeed passable, but only just. It is still partly blocked or extremely damaged in sections. I find myself having to steer around tonnes of earth that a saturated hillside has disgorged into my path, or skirt patches where chunks of bitumen have been torn out by whooshing waters, or dodge areas where the road verges have collapsed away, leaving gashes that could swallow the car. On this familiar route it would be easy to lapse into an accustomed pace and come to grief. I remind myself to take it easy.
Flooding has wrecked the road in areas where you wouldn’t even have noticed a waterway before
There’s a rural version of the recovery effort that is happening back in the Tweed Valley. Unsalvageable belongings being put out for collection, busted fences being put right. In one spot a little Suzuki ute is being used to pay out a coil of barbed wire along a boundary. Flooding has wrecked the road in areas where you wouldn’t even have noticed a waterway before. Trees lie flattened in creek beds.
Not far short of Numinbah village there’s been a huge cascade of boulders that looks like it should have swept the whole road away. It’s down to one lane, marked by temporary guide posts. From the ridge above, the little waterfall that no doubt swelled to a roar and caused all this damage has shrunk back down to an innocuous trickle over the rocks.
Things aren’t fantastic further west in the Scenic Rim country either. Beaudesert’s state MP, Jon Krause, has been on ABC 612 radio reminding us that rural communities are likewise dealing with the effects of this natural disaster. Crops have been lost and ruined paddocks will take a lot of work to rehabilitate before they can be planted again. 
Pretty soon I’m back in suburban Nerang and not far from home. There’s the odd tree lying on the ground here and there, whipped down in the high winds of the previous days, roots having given up their grip on the soaked ground. We’d already had more than a week of downpours when the remnants of Debbie arrived and upped the tempo. 
In the park across the road from my house a council crew is mucking out the kids’ sandpit. But that’s about as devastated as it gets round here. The park is part of the local stormwater drainage system, and when the rain arrives the boogie boards come out.
Last year we put on a new roof on our late 70s, early 80s brick-veneer bungalow, and consequently had to follow the 21st-century regulations. That meant threading steel cyclone rods down through the walls, tying the roof to the concrete slab foundation.
Many of the houses around us in this brick-and-tile suburb are of a similar era, but still have their original roofs. Which means they don’t have those rods. This time around the winds were less than cyclonic. If more of north Queensland’s most extreme weather comes south in future years as feared, we may see those structures tested. To the north, the south and the west of us, there are thousands of people dealing with such consequences in the here and now.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/apr/05/after-the-flood-no-tourists-please-help-welcome

He may have meant violets growing under withered and bleached nettle stems, but for me, today, there are shining white violets “bleaching” on the hedge bank in one of the last cold, grey, “thin” mornings in March.
Even though there are beautifully subtle violet violets scattered in the mossy shadows under trees and through the emerging leaves beneath hedges, the eye is drawn to the white ones. I wonder if bees prefer white violets to violet-coloured violets? The more common forms have ultraviolet markings on their petals called bee guides, which look like veins filled with iodine and must be as vivid as rope lights to insects. 
Violets are hermaphrodites anyway, so they don’t rely on pollinators, which, given the scarcity of bees at this time of year, and their continued decline in Britain, is just as well.
This is the blackthorn winter, that moment at the end of March when a snow of white flowers – from blackthorn, wild damson and cherry to wood anemone and white sweet violets – pulses through woods and hedgerows. This marks the becoming time of spring, when fragments of those seasonal signatures – wildflowers and birdsong, bumblebees and lambs – begin to join into a coherence, or at least the fantasy of one, that feels like spring.
I wonder what Clare’s springs were like, when the populations of birds, insects and wildflowers were so much stronger and seasonal differences more acute. What would he make of this? 
Violets have a built-in nostalgia, a belonging to something that is only ever new and so always fleeting and longed for. “Keep love for youth, and violets for the spring,” wrote the poet Christina Rossetti (in Autumn Violets). 
Violets really do gladden the heart and, like love, they need nurturing; Clare for one could not help but follow his instincts as a gardener, to clear the winter debris from around the violets “And give them room to grow”.

Then good news! That article in The Ecologist is complete bullshit! (Does anyone still take The Ecologist seriously, after Zak Goldsmith turned it into a lifestyle magazine and then Oliver Tickell tried to turn it
into
 infowars?)
The source of that article is not the CCC, its Storm van Leeuwen and Benjamin Sovacool.
Mr. van Leeuwen ""published"" his (non peer reviewed) study
here. I particularly enjoy the insignia with the giant nuclear ball about to crush the tiny cowering human (I wonder how he feels about nuclear power?). About the study itself, I have nothing to add beyond the fact that his methodology is
demonstrably wrong.
Sovacool, the other authority behind that article, liked the study so much he included it three times (out of a total of 19 results) in his meta-analysis. Is the van Leeuwen study the one with the highest carbon output? Why yes it is. Does the completely unjustifiable triple counting of a demonstrably dodgy result skew the results a touch? Yes again.Most people hurl the Sovacool study across the room at this point, but I'd just like to add that the second most C02 heavy result of those 19 (well, 4th, I guess) is from Tokimatsu et al. (2006), which is quoted as claiming a range of 10-200 gCO2 e/kWh. While this might seem like an estimate range, it is in fact a time  range. 200 gCO2 e/kWh comes from Japan's first ever reactor, built in the 60s, 10 gCO2 e/kWh from modern reactors built in the 90s. Which of those two figures would you say is the more relevant to new build nuclear?Little added bonus - Sovacool claims that estimates range from 1.4 -288 gCO2 e/kWh in order to push the idea that there is no scientific consensus on emissions. Where does the 288 come from, given that no individual estimate even comes close to that? He breaks each study down into building, decommissioning, and so on, then adds the biggest values for each (from completely incompatible studies) in order to get to 288. He never explains where the 288 comes from, but its right there in table 5, if you're interested.

Thanks for the clarification.

No worries. The Sovacool paper gets brought up every now and then, so I went and had a look at it a while back. It is... a hell of a thing.

BQSTART
if you decided to scrap all coal/oil/gas power stations asap and replace with nuclear, the gain in atmospheric CO2 and methane would peak more quickly and be higher
BQEND
Sounds like they might be referring to the study talked about
here which tries to look at opportunity cost. It is also... not good.

BQSTART
Also it's very expensive
BQEND
There is no cheap way out of the mess we're in.

a system for storing waste properly needs to be set up and constantly monitored.

TigerRepellingRock - Sovacool, the other authority behind that article, liked the study so much he included it three times (out of a total of 19 results) in his meta-analysis.
BQEND
Sovacool spends his time getting anti-nuclear numerical claims published as academic papers.It's not going terribly well. His most recent effort has been retracted, because it was drivel:
BQSTART
Authorial statement of article withdrawal  Andrew Lawrence, Benjamin Sovacool & Andrew Stirling Climate Policy, Vol. 16, 2016 - Issue 5 
Lawrence, A., Sovacool, B., & Stirling, A. (2016). Nuclear energy and path dependence in Europe’s ‘Energy union’: Coherence or continued divergence? Climate Policy, 16(5), 622–641, 
It is with great regret that we, the authors, have withdrawn this article from publication in Climate Policy.
The grounds for this are that it has come to our attention that two serious errors were committed by the first author (AL) on this paper. The second (BS) and third (AS) authors entirely failed to identify and correct these errors prior to publication. Of course, all three authors share joint responsibility for this paper, and apologize to readers of Climate Policy for our omission of oversight.
Together, the errors have the effect of invalidating this particular analysis concerning the relative performance of nuclear-committed European countries in wider climate change.

His employer, the University of Sussex, also had to publish a retraction:

The surprise announcement was made at a press conference in Brussels on Wednesday, 442 years after the continent’s first pit was sunk by Sir George Bruce of Carnock, in Scotland.
National energy companies from every EU nation – except Poland and Greece – have signed up to the initiative, which will overhaul the bloc’s energy-generating future.
A press release from Eurelectric, which represents 3,500 utilities with a combined value of over €200bn, reaffirmed a pledge to deliver on the Paris climate agreement, and vowed a moratorium on new investments in coal plants after 2020. 
“26 of 28 member states have stated that they will not invest in new coal plants after 2020” said Kristian Ruby, Eurelectric’s secretary-general. “History will judge this message we are bringing here today. It is a clear message that speaks for itself, and should be seen in close relation to the Paris agreement and our commitment to provide 100% carbon-neutral electricity by 2050.”
“Europe’s energy companies are putting their money where their mouths are,” he added. 
Coal has been central to Europe’s development, powering the industrial revolution, trades union history, and even the EU’s precursor, the European coal and steel community.
But it also emits more carbon dioxide than any other fossil fuel, plus deadly toxins such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter, which are responsible for more than 20,000 deaths each year.
Wendel Trio, the director of Climate Action Network Europe, hailed the new move as “the beginning of the end for coal”. 
“It is now clear that there is no future for coal in the EU,” he said. “The question is: what is the date for its phase out in the EU, and how hard will the coal industry fight to keep plants open, even if they are no longer economically viable?”
The coal industry though was sceptical about the utilities’ announcement. Brian Ricketts, the secretary-general of the Euracoal trade group said: “Steam engines were replaced by something better,cheaper and more productive – electric motors and diesel engines. When we see a new energy system – with lots of energy storage – that works at an affordable price, then coal, oil and gas will not be needed. In the meantime, we still rely on conventional sources.”
Renewable industry sources also welcomed the news, albeit with the caveat that it would allow continued new investments in the industry for another three years.
“The debate about coal is over,” one industry insider told the Guardian. “This is the only way that we can go forward with decarbonisation. But it would be good to see a phase out of existing coal plants.” 
The energy utilities’ initiative faced initial resistance in Germany which is relying on coal to bridge a move away from nuclear energy to renewables under the “energiewende” transition.
In the end though, only Poland which depends on coal for around 90% of its electricity and Greece, which still plans new coal plants, bucked what is becoming a global trend.
New coal plant constructions fell by almost two thirds across the world in 2016, with the EU and US leading the way in retiring in existing coal capacity.
The move is also in line with a pathway for meeting the 2C target laid out by climate scientists last month, as a way of limiting future stranded asset risks.
Europe will have to phase out all of its coal plants by 2030 or else “vastly overshoot” its Paris climate pledges, climate experts say.
António Mexia, the CEO of Portuguese energy giant EDP and president of the Eurelectric trade association, said: “The power sector is determined to lead the energy transition and back our commitment to the low-carbon economy with concrete action.”
“With power supply becoming increasingly clean, electric technologies are an obvious choice for replacing fossil fuel based systems, for instance in the transport sector to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”
“The challenge for policy makers in the next two years will be to target the political instruments, ensure that they are complementary and advance decarbonisation and electrification at the same time,” said Ruby. 
Ruby called for a ratcheting up of the cap on CO2 emissions under the EU’s emissions trading system, to speed the transition to a low carbon economy.

 Led by New York state, the coalition said the administration has a legal duty to regulate emissions of the gases scientists believe cause global climate change.
 “The law is clear: the EPA must limit carbon pollution from power plants,” the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said in a statement announcing the challenge.
 Trump signed an executive order last week targeting climate change regulations ushered in by President Obama, saying they hinder US energy production and jobs without providing meaningful environmental benefits.
 The order’s main target was Obama’s Clean Power Plan, a law that would require states to slash carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, but which was never implemented because it was challenged in court by 26 Republican-led states.
 Trump’s order directed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to review the regulation to decide whether to “suspend, rescind, or revise it”. Shortly after, the EPA filed a legal motion asking the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit to delay ongoing court proceedings on the regulation to allow for the review.
 The New York-led coalition’s motion on Wednesday asked the court to throw out the EPA’s request to delay court proceedings, saying the delay “would waste the substantial resources already expended in this litigation”.
 “This case is ripe for decision now, and nothing that EPA has proposed to do obviates the need for this court’s review,” according to the statement.
 The coalition includes attorneys general from California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington – along with the District of Columbia and a number of smaller localities.

We are at risk of pushing our climate system toward abrupt, unpredictable, and potentially irreversible changes with highly damaging impacts. 
Earth’s climate is on a path to warm beyond the range of what has been experienced over the past millions of years. 
The range of uncertainty for the warming along the current emissions path is wide enough to encompass massively disruptive consequences to societies and ecosystems.

Scientific paradigms are built on multiple thousands of pieces of research.
Gravity, evolution, plate tectonics, climate change.
All of them are well-established scientific paradigms.
All are based on the same three elements - Coherence - Consilience - and - Consensus.
Coherence - a theory that coherently explains the multiple observed lines of empirical evidence.
Consilience - the predicted and projected changes being confirmed across multiple scientific disciplines.
Consensus - agreement amongst scientific researchers from many different academic disciplines that the first two C's are correct, and that no alternate theory can adequately explain this.
The current paradigm on climate accounts for the research-based evidence.
Of course it can't predict every short-term fluctuation, any more than plate tectonics predicts the timing and scale of every earthquake or volcanic eruption.
Climate science is very much like plate tectonics, in that it gives an overall framework to investigations of processes in a range of earth systems.
To change the paradigm someone would need to produce plenty of research-based evidence that does not fit the paradigm, and to offer an alternative paradigm that explains all the previous evidence plus the new evidence.

""Due to nuclear reactions in stars, like our sun, over time they become brighter,"" adds co-author Dan Lunt, Professor of Climate Science at the University of Bristol. ""This means that, although carbon dioxide concentrations were high hundreds of millions of years ago, the net warming effect of CO2 and sunlight was less. Our new CO2 compilation appears on average to have gradually declined over time by about 3-4 ppm per million years. This may not sound like much, but it is actually just about enough to cancel out the warming effect caused by the sun brightening through time, so in the long-term it appears the net effect of both was pretty much constant on average.""

This event is known as Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE2) because it was first recognised by abundant black shale sediments that indicate that the ocean floors had little or no oxygen, allowing the accumulation of large amounts of carbon from plants and animals. As well as all that carbon burial, this event also saw rapid and extreme climate warming with increases of 6-9C within a few tens of thousands of years.

It’s no coincidence that dead zones occur downriver of places where human population density is high (darkest brown). Some of the fertilizer we apply to crops is washed into streams and rivers. Fertilizer-laden runoff triggers explosive planktonic algae growth in coastal areas. The algae die and rain down into deep waters, where their remains are like fertilizer for microbes. The microbes decompose the organic matter, using up the oxygen. Mass killing of fish and other sea life often results.

Uncertainty is not our friend regarding impact projections.
BQENDPascal's wager makes its customary appearance.
Erik, it would be easier to discuss this if you were able to say:
-- where do you think global temperature will be in 2100?-- what do you think a safe level of global emissions from 2030 onwards will be (in tons)-- what do you think must be done to get down to that level?

Can you prove me wrong about that?
BQENDDon't have to. You're just repeating over and over again that you are right and that everyone agrees with you.
You seem to have found another way of expressing this, by calling the theory, whatever it is, that you accept to be 'a paradigm', but it adds nothing to its plausibility.
There is nothing happening in climate research which would count as putting multiple strands of evidence together to produce a new model of climate. There are a lot of theories about various aspect of climate, some very well proven, others wildly speculative. 
What you are trying to claim is that the theory, or rather prediction, that on current CO2 emission trends we can expect warming of well over 2C, is to be regarded as beyond criticism. And has received no serious criticism. And that the value of this warming is fairly precise and generally agreed.
None of these things are true, as an objective reading of the scientific literature would tell you. Even reading the IPCC detail would tell you that.
You'd be more convincing of you stated what it is that you think is certain more precisely. But then of course you would have the problem that the evidence for it would turn out to be limited at best, and the consensus on it non-existent.
As to the claim, which one anticipates coming in response, that all these learned societies have endorsed something or other? Who cares? There is no evidence, either peer reviewed or not, that so called 'expert' judgment of such bodies has any particular insight into truth. They have no track record.
The theory that we face civilisation destroying warming from a doubling of CO2 levels is one that its advocates have to prove, just like any other scientific theory. So far they have not done that.
Its not a doubling you say? OK, what is it? A tripling?

Einstein and Darwin are examples of people who produced paradigm shifts in science.
Others were Dalton's atomic theory, and Mendeleev's periodic table.
A major paradigm shift happened about 50 years ago when geologists drew multiple strands of evidence together to produce the plate tectonic model.
Previous paradigms were dropped, because evidence from earlier geological research, and from this newer research, was interpreted best by plate tectonics.
There is no sign at all of that process happening over AGW, because there is no evidence accumulating that would initiate a paradigm shift.

But potentially even more problematic than sea level rise is changing ocean chemistry. We're all familiar with ocean acidification, but perhaps not the ramifications of oceanic anoxia (lack of O2).
A recent paper indicated we could take this climate beyond what created the worst mass extinction of all, the end-Permian event which turned Earth into basically a lifeless rock for millions of years. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/04/170404124402.htm
Why did so many species perish during that period? Here’s a paper which tried to answer that question titled “Massive release of hydrogen sulfide to the surface ocean and atmosphere during intervals of oceanic anoxia”
BQSTART
Simple calculations show that if deep-water H2S concentrations increased beyond a critical threshold during oceanic anoxic intervals of Earth history, the chemocline separating sulfidic deep waters from oxygenated surface waters could have risen abruptly to the ocean surface (a chemocline upward excursion). 
Atmospheric photochemical modeling indicates that resulting fluxes of H2S to the atmosphere (>2000 times the small modern flux from volcanoes) would likely have led to toxic levels of H2S in the atmosphere.
Moreover, the ozone shield would have been destroyed, and methane levels would have risen to >100 ppm.
We thus propose (1) chemocline upward excursion as a kill mechanism during the end-Permian, Late Devonian, and Cenomanian–Turonian extinctions, and (2) persistently high atmospheric H2S levels as a factor that impeded evolution of eukaryotic life on land during the Proterozoic.

Some of the questions are crude and you could well see some of this sea level rise end up well above sea level with new inland lakes and seas.
You also see from the geological record the following: ""Atmospheric CO2 is currently just below 400 parts per million (ppm) on average. It last reached similar levels during the Pliocene (5.3-2.6 million years ago). At that time, temperatures rose to levels 2-3°C warmer than today, and sea level rose by up to 20m in places. Sea level takes a few hundred years to reach equilibrium in response to changes in atmospheric CO2 and temperature, which may explain why sea level has not yet risen to the same levels seen in the Pliocene.

""Recent estimates suggest CO2 levels reached as much as 415 parts per million (ppm) during the Pliocene. With that came global average temperatures that eventually reached 3 or 4 degrees C (5.4-7.2 degrees F) higher than today’s and as much as 10 degrees C (18 degrees F) warmer at the poles.

Experts are attributing it to uncommonly strong counter-clockwise winds that are drawing the icebergs south, and perhaps also global warming, which is accelerating the process by which chunks of the Greenland ice sheet break off and float away.
As of Monday, there were about 450 icebergs near the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, up from 37 a week earlier, according to the US Coast Guard’s international ice patrol in New London, Connecticut. Those kinds of numbers are usually not seen until late May or early June. The average for this time of year is about 80.
In the waters close to where the Titanic went down in 1912, the icebergs are forcing ships to take precautions.
Instead of cutting straight across the ocean, trans-Atlantic vessels are taking detours that can add around 650km (400 miles) to the trip. That’s a day and a half of added travel time for many large cargo ships.
Close to the Newfoundland coast, cargo ships owned by Oceanex are throttling way back to three or four knots as they make their way to their home port in St John’s, which can add up to a day to the trip, said executive chairman Captain Sid Hynes.
One ship was pulled out of service for repairs after hitting a chunk of ice, he said. 
 “It makes everything more expensive,” Hynes said. “You’re burning more fuel, it’s taking a longer time, and it’s hard on the equipment.” He called it a “very unusual year”.
US Coast Guard Commander Gabrielle McGrath, who leads the ice patrol, said she had never seen such a drastic increase in such a short time. Adding to the danger, three icebergs were discovered outside the boundaries of the area the Coast Guard had advised mariners to avoid, she said.
McGrath is predicting a fourth consecutive “extreme ice season” with more than 600 icebergs in the shipping lanes.
Most icebergs entering the North Atlantic have “calved” off the Greenland ice sheet. Michael Mann, director of the earth system science center at Pennsylvania State University, said it was possible climate change was leading to more icebergs in the shipping lanes, but wind patterns were also important.
In 2014, there were 1,546 icebergs in the shipping lanes – the sixth most severe season on record since 1900, according to the patrol. There were 1,165 icebergs in 2015 and 687 in 2016.
The international ice patrol was formed after the sinking of the Titanic to monitor iceberg danger in the North Atlantic and warn ships. It conducts reconnaissance flights that are used to produce charts.
In 104 years, no ship that has heeded the warnings has struck an iceberg, according to the ice patrol.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/06/huge-fleet-icebergs-north-atlantic-shipping-lanes

If you are seeking sincere and honest debate, please quote me specifically and then show the evidence the debunks anything I claimed./blockquote> 
No thanks, I've already satisfied myself there's nothing to your claims, despite neither of us having expertise in corals, and 'debating' something irrelevant wastes time from actually raising action on thermal bleaching and its causes. 
Among other things, how does your theory that dessication from lower sea levels mediates the ENSO effects in the GBR explain the lack of mass bleaching before 1980 when sea levels were lower, or the mass bleaching in 2002 when sea levels were relatively high? You basically discount the record sea temperatures as a factor in coral mortality despite the well-observed link, and presumably have ignored the clear temporal and spatial correlations with heat stress available on the HotWhopper site. Meanwhile you suggest that the heterogeneity (unevenness) of bleaching is not explained by the dominant warming paradigm, when this is apparently accounted for by upwelling of colder waters by Hughes's team. Then you link to tide tables? Are you serious?
Rather than a direct quotation, anyone reading your article would assume that Hughes et al was based solely on surveys by aeroplane (when it was verified by underwater measurements), that the mortality was a surface phenomenon contradicting the photos most of us have seen of dead finger corals, and that the northern reefs are alive and well. All three of those conclusions would sadly be false. If you want to correct your article to clarify that you aren't saying any of those things, please go ahead. Then maybe it would be possible to talk ""sincerely and honestly"" about anything that remains.

Please radiohead, ""Unrelated research""? Really? Not very honest.
BQEND
Yes, unrelated research. What you hang your article on is a paper in Geosciences that is about North Sulawesi, Indonesia, nothing to do with the Great Barrier Reef. Furthermore, the sea-level effect that has you so excited is not bleaching. The paper refers to thermally-induced bleaching as a separate cause of mortality. In fact you only have to read the first line of the abstract ""The 2015–2016 El-Niño and related ocean warming has generated significant coral bleaching and mortality worldwide."" to realise the authors aren't disputing the warming effect on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR).
Having read your article, it seems a bit ripe for you to be asking for honesty.
BQSTART
The research I highlight explains exactly how low tides and high irradiance increass bleaching and mortality as well as other research that shows how landscape changes that increase nutrient loading increase bleaching frequency. 
You can not refute any of those studies but instead link to a known skeptic basher who has been debunked https://goo.gl/HLNVrY
BQEND
Um, that's not a debunking. That's you calling an author ""Slandering Sou"". What it seems you don't like is someone pointing out that there's a general pattern in your minimising the effects of greenhouse-gas-induced global warming. Now while that doesn't of itself mean what you have written about coral has no merit, and I started reading your article without knowing that, it does seem something of a double standard that you are trying to invalidate the rebuttal by ""HotWhopper"" by an ad hominem attack unrelated to the subject of the GBR. You really don't help any case you might have by publishing on and linking to ""Watt's Up With That?"", often seen as the most notorious climate denial site which just tries to spread confusion. I've wasted hours before trying to decipher articles published there before realising finally working out how berserk the ideas were. You might also like to make a declaration of any conflict of interest (I have none).
But as regards nutrient loading, you quote the disappointing finding by Hughes et al (2017) of ""no support for the hypothesis that good water quality confers resistance to bleaching"". You then say ""However this contradicts an abundance of regional studies attributing increased coral disease and bleaching to high nutrient loading."" Why did you include this logical error? There's more than one cause of coral mortality, and even if high nutrient levels can adaptively aggravate temporary bleaching, that doesn't mean that the northern reef didn't reach an absolute temperature limit for viability, no matter how pristine or limpid the waters. And despite what's reported in Bunaken national park about surface effects of ENSO and other local effects like the ship embarrassment, the global story is one of warming-induced bleaching and death (""'Devastating' coral loss in South China Sea"" refers to Mass coral mortality under local amplification of 2 °C ocean warming) This is accepted by all researchers: I'm not attempting to ""refute any of those studies"", I'm just criticising misreading and abuse of them. As one of the authors of the Indonesian study you linked to told HotWhopper, ""if someone is manipulating and transforming the content of paper to push his ideas, that's an ethical issue. I can just condemn this.""
I'm not by the way saying there shouldn't be efforts to reduce run-off, disturbance by coal ports, overfishing or contain crown-of-thorns starfish. But the obvious concern is that these will never be enough, so the more that's done to contain global warming and ocean acidification as soon as possible, the greater the chance of survival of some of the most biodiverse ecosystems. It's not as if this effect hasn't been predicted beforehand - see Freeler et al. Limiting global warming to 2 °C is unlikely to save most coral reefs and Fig 7 at SkS which is presumably from one of Done et al. 2003; Donner et al. 2005; Hoegh-Guldberg 1999.

The corals in Ningaloo Reef are 'super corals', when it comes to resistance to heated oceans, in part, because of the necessity for their adaptation to withstand exposure at low tide.

The plan, proposed by the tourism industry and the Reef and Rainforest Research Centre, seeks to protect six reefs with high economic or environmental value near Cairns and Port Douglas.
It would involve using low-energy technology to push adjacent cold water from a depth of about 40 metres to the surface. The aim is to use the cooler waters to alleviate bleaching, which is caused by global warming-induced rises in sea surface temperatures.
The plan has been submitted to the federal government, and proponents say it is a measure that could prevent localised bleaching to valuable parts of the reef. “With the amount of bleaching that we currently have, the reef is going to change, that will affect the number of species that actually survive,” Reef and Rainforest Research Centre managing director, Sheriden Morris, told Guardian Australia.
“While this is highly localised, it may have the benefit of maintaining some complex communities in the face of some of the pressures that the reef is facing,” he said.
But others have warned the proposal would waste money and time to, at best, temporarily save small pockets of the reef, while vast swaths are lost to bleaching elsewhere. 
A former Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority director Jon Day said the government should be trying everything it could, but the idea that such an approach would save the reef from bleaching was “ridiculous”.
Day, a protected area planner and manager, said solutions to the bleaching event must look at the entirety of the Great Barrier Reef system. “We should be taking broad-area results,” Day said.
“But instead we do these sort-of band-aid, small localised scale things, which in terms of trying to maintain tourism sites might actually work, but we’re going to actually lose the whole reef and spend a lot of money on these things.
“We probably need to be trying everything, but this idea that this is going to be the solution to the bleaching is just ridiculous, it might be something that helps in localised areas, but we’ve got to be looking at the whole of the GBR system.”
 The University of Technology Sydney’s lead reef researcher, marine biologist David Suggett, said the proposal would probably be ineffective without strong action on climate change. 
Suggett also raised concerns about potentially damaging effects to the reef. He said the colder water would be more acidic, and would contain more inorganic nitrogen and phosphate. Pumping it to the surface would probably cause just as much damage to the reef as warmer waters do.
“Cold water has lots of evils, as well as benefits,” Suggett said. “So we might be cooling them, but at the same time we’re probably manipulating them in ways that could be as detrimental.
“We have to remember that climate change is just a lot more than warming waters, we have ocean acidification, we have hypoxia, so a loss of oxygen. All of these factors, mean just cooling the reef itself is not the solution.”
Proponents say they are not planning to pump up waters from any great depths, meaning the risk of nitrogen or acidity are low. 
James Cook University’s Jon Brodie, a professorial fellow at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, was frank in his assessment of the proposal. He conceded the idea sounded silly but said it could work and was worth trying.
“It’s an absolutely silly idea when you read it, but we’re in silly times, so it looks like it could be a goer,” Brodie said.
He has been trying to save the reef for much of his career. He said the federal government had sat on its hands, and its current attempts to improve water quality were not working. “We’ve given up. It’s been my life managing water quality, we’ve failed,” he said.

If you read my words, you will see that ""non-violent"" protest is specified.
1500 were arrested during the Franklin River blockade (1976-83), mostly for sitting or standing in places that obstructed work. A huge amount of training was conducted with the protesters to ensure that the protests would remain non-violent, that they knew how to diffuse tensions with workers and police etc. BTW, the protest was successful.

Our current exports of seabourne thermal coal are about 200 million tonnes
You seem pretty good on google and wikipedia, I'm sure you can verify this number
Therefore in theory we could ramp up coal exports to meet this demand

In view of rising production of the dry fuel, India plans to completely stop thermal coal imports in 2-3 years that would result in annual savings of Rs 40,000 crore, Union Minister Piyush Goyal today said.
BQEND
And, in case you weren't aware, Indian coal imports are already declining quickly.

Are we willing to fight for a wonder of the world? | Jeff Sparrow,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/07/its-either-adani-or-the-great-barrier-reef-are-we-willing-to-fight-for-a-wonder-of-the-world,0,"Over the last years, as the slow motion catastrophe known as climate change gathered momentum, many have people consoled themselves by imagining a tipping point, a specific manifestation of the crisis so grotesque and so extreme as to force our leaders to respond.
The damage now evident throughout the Great Barrier Reef should dispel any illusion that such a point exists.
The reef’s a natural wonder: a complex miracle assembled over half a million years. As an instantly recognisable incarnation of the oceanic sublime, it provokes us to think about the less immediately photogenic aspects of our threatened marine ecosystems. We might struggle to imagine acidification or habitat destruction or coastal pollution but the bleaching of healthy coral makes palpable the less visible damage being done elsewhere.
It’s not unreasonable, then, to see the reef as a red line, to expect its degradation to provoke some kind of acknowledgement of the state of the planet.
Well, a few weeks ago the Greens’ Peter Whish-Wilson read to the Senate a widely-circulated tweet from reef specialist Professor Terry Hughes.
“I showed the results of aerial surveys of #bleaching on the #GreatBarrierReef to my students, And then we wept.”

The chamber responded with loud derision, as if the grief of a climate scientist constituted some tremendous joke got up for their especial amusement. Amid the jeers and hoots, Liberal frontbencher minister Simon Birmingham mockingly suggested that Whish-Wilson needed a hanky.
The hilarity with which the senators responded to environmental disaster epitomised an administration whose leading members recently distinguished themselves by fondling lumps of coal during a debate in the lower chamber.
Yet the undergraduate antics of the conservatives, shameful as they are, pall in comparison to the Queensland Labor government’s decision to back the Adani corporation’s bid to open the $21.7bn Carmichael mine near Rockhampton, in one of the biggest coal extraction projects anywhere in the planet.
In March this year, 46 scientists co-authored a paper for the prestigious journal Nature in which they argued that only halting climate change would save the Great Barrier Reef.
Think about that – and then consider that, if the Carmichael mine goes ahead, it will unleash some 128m tons of carbon dioxide each year of its operation – the equivalent of a quarter of Australia’s total emissions from fuel combustion – even as the huge infrastructure constructed for the project (a terminal located within the reef heritage area) will, we’re told, make other mines suddenly viable, potentially opening a new era for coal mining in the sunshine state.
Despite the universally appalled response from environmentalists, the Queensland Labor government has declared the project “critical infrastructure” – and granted Adani unlimited water access for the next 60 years.
In the past, activists sometimes suggested that climate politics transcended the old divisions between left and right. Even the greediest tycoon lived on the same planet as the rest of us. On that basis, the argument went, they could be won over in the fight to preserve it. 
In reality, the environment’s always been a class issue. Climate change will devastate the poor – and the rich and the powerful will barely notice.
Insulated by money, you can still treat nature as an inexhaustible resource to be endlessly abused, as per Donald Trump’s sons casually amusing themselves by slaughtering elephants and civets in Zimbabwe.
When Pauline Hanson splashed about  off Great Keppel Island and then declared the Great Barrier Reef to be fine, the stunt hinted at a deeper truth. The politicians and tycoons with their stock options and property portfolios will still find pleasant locales for their holidays, no matter how degraded the oceans become. They have as little personal stake in combatting climate change as they do in fighting for housing affordability.
Much has been made of the declining prices fetched by coal, with some arguing that, as renewables become more affordable, the free market itself will drive a shift to clean energy. But what’s happening in Queensland shows that capitalism doesn’t work like that.
In the real world, the market isn’t akin to lemonade stands competing on street corners. As huge multinationals, the major polluters wield extensive power. The fossil fuel industry learned about climate change 40 years ago – and spent four decades preparing a political response.
As a result, coal exerts far more influence in the corridors of Canberra than, say, the tourism operators dependent on the reef.
Within the Liberal party, in particular, fossil fuels have become talismanic, as that parliamentary coal-stroking session exemplified.
If Islamic State (Isis) pledged to bomb the Great Barrier Reef, the Coalition would demand soldiers installed on every kilometre of the iconic coastline. But because the threat’s environmental, the conservatives see inaction almost as matter of principle.
In any case, the market necessarily operates within a system of competing national and regional governments. Witness Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s response to protesters heckling her in India about the Adani mine.
“All of you have jobs,” she said, “and there are regional Queenslanders that are fighting for jobs. Ten thousand regional jobs.”
The project might not be viable in the long term but, in the short term, it provides an economic boost to an impoverished region (even if the actual economic benefits have been overstated) – and for a politician that’s all that matters.
The same logic drives Turnbull’s defence of coal, a commodity Australia possesses in abundance. As Andrew Norton from the International Institute for Environment and Development notes, “climate change is a highly inconvenient truth for nationalism, as it is unsolvable at the national level and requires collective action between states and between different national and local communities.”
That’s why rightwing populism has become increasingly entwined with climate denialism, with, for instance, France’s far-right National Front denouncing international environmental talks as a “communist project”.
You’d be naïve to expect any serious action on climate any time soon
In the US, most of the Republican party now shares Trump’s scepticism about climate change (something he famously dubbed a hoax “created by and for the Chinese to make US manufacturing noncompetitive”).
In Australia, Pauline Hanson’s embraced denialism with the same fervour she adopted Islamophobia – and in both instances she’s dragged the right of the Liberal party with her.
In other words, you’d be naïve to expect any serious action on climate any time soon. That’s why the inconceivable seems now depressingly likely: one of the great wonders of the world slowly dying before our eyes.
As goes the reef, so goes the planet. The trajectory that Spaceship Earth’s currently traversing has been carefully plotted – and the course is set on disaster.
Yet the mounting resistance to Adani offers a glimmer of hope. Bob Brown’s described the struggle against the mine as potentially the Franklin River campaign for a new generation. It’s worth thinking about what that means.
Without the great social struggles of the past we would have lost most of the nation’s important ecological sites. As I’ve noted elsewhere, as late as the 1960s, the Queensland government saw the reef almost solely as a site for resource extraction, leasing over 20m hectares of it for oil extraction in 1967. At the time, Rhodes Airbridge, a professor of geology from Columbia University explained that the reef should be exploited “immediately and to the hilt”.
Likewise, the Liberal premier of Tasmania, Robin Grey, famously dismissed the Franklin River as “brown ditch, leech-ridden, unattractive to the majority of people”.
In a sense, then, protests did not so much save the Great Barrier Reef and the Franklin River as create them, as the campaigns taught Australians to value a country they’d never really seen before. 
In the same way, a mass struggle against Adani might help us to think about global warming in a different way, to appreciate the reef as part of the global environment. If the nationalism of rightwing populism inevitably feeds climate scepticism, protest against fossil fuels pushes in the direction of internationalism, fostering a common interest across national borders against the corporations and politicians despoiling the planet.
We all know resistance to be necessary. We need the kind of campaign that makes it feel possible.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/07/its-either-adani-or-the-great-barrier-reef-are-we-willing-to-fight-for-a-wonder-of-the-world

If you want to know the risks associated with living in a particular area, just talk to the insurance companies who will give their assessment. Risks continue to change.

That is its purpose. 
Not many people, for example, have house fires. (Thus is to distinguish between a house fire where a single house burns and bushfires where dozens, even hundreds of houses are damaged.) Provided you maintain your property reasonably (which you are required to do as part of your insurance contract), a house fire is essentially pure bad luck. It could happen to anyone. The chance of it happening to you is small, but if it does, it is catastrophic. Insurance exists to cover you against that risk. Most of us pay a (relatively) small amount each year to be free of that worry, and so that those few of us unlucky enough to have a fire can rebuild their lives.
Now consider the case of bushfire. (Flood is similar.) Here, the risk is not random. People who get burned out by bushfires, by and large, have chosen to live in a high-risk bushfire area. Why should you, as someone who has chosen to live somewhere more sensible, pay to rebuild the houses of risk-takers? You should not, of course. That is not what insurance is for. Insurance is for sharing risk between equal citizens. It is not, repeat not, a way of getting sensible people to pay for the folly and greed of risk takers.
(To clarify, this is not to say that people in fire or flood-risk areas should not be able to have insurance, simply to say that they have chosen a high-risk site, and it is up to them to fund their own premiums. (Which won't be cheap.) Their risk-taking is neither the fault.nor the responsibility of people who choose not to take avoidable risks.)
(Note also that poorer people tend to congregate in high-risk areas, simply because they can't afford to live in a safer suburb.

Is insurance an essential service or a discretionary service? If we say it's discretionary, who picks up the human cost of the uninsured in the aftermath of a natural disaster? If we say it's essential and provides a safety-net for the community, that we need it to provide a 'public good', then can that need be effectively met by a purely market-based system, focused primarily on private profit?
Are there societal needs for some types of insurance that are too critical to leave to market forces? Is the market the only way to deliver insurance services for the community? Is the market mechanism functional or dysfunctional when the premium for flood insurance in Lismore is $30,000? Should we see this as a 'price signal', incenting people to relocate their lives to less risky parts of Australia? Does it actually incent them, or do they just go uninsured? And if they go uninsured, how are the human costs of any subsequent floods met? By the taxpayer?
Can the deficiencies of the market in delivering essential societal services, like flood insurance, be addressed through imposing rigorous, strong regulation? Do we persist with market-based models for delivering essential services because they are appropriate and 'natural', or because they are ideologically dominant and promoted by vested commercial interests?

Some of it is historical subdivision approvals done before more sophisticated flood mapping was available. Once approved, no matter when, you can't wind back that right, unless you pay compensation. Small rural councils and even some city councils can't afford these costs.
As mentioned above, sometimes Council refuses and the developer takes them to court. The Courts often take a black letter law approach, or seek to ""manage"" the development (e.g. engineering) through conditioning. There was a classic case on the Gold Coast recently where the court imposed conditions of approval included keeping a larder of canned foods and putting a helicopter landing pad on the roof. How do you stop this risks when courts are willing to adopt such measures.
I would concede that town planning often has a very permissive approach when a more conservative approach would be better. In other words there is a belief that you can condition the development to achieve the outcomes (i.e. safety), rather than just refusing the application because the potential risks for loss of life and property is just not acceptable, conditions or no conditions.
I was doing master planning for an area that included bushfire hazard areas and I took the conservative approach. Well the amount of grief that we took for that decision was staggering.

The insurance bill for damage caused by the cyclone, which struck near Airlie Beach on 28 March before causing widespread damage in northern Queensland and extensive and ongoing flooding in the state’s south-east and northern New South Wales, reached $410m on Thursday and is predicted to top $1bn.
A number of homes and businesses, particularly in the NSW town of Lismore, were reportedly uninsured or without flood insurance, because premiums for flood insurance had climbed as high as $30,000 a year.
It has sparked renewed calls for a review of the insurance regulations covering natural disasters.
But Justine Bell-James, an expert in environmental and insurance law from the University of Queensland, said moving to reduce premiums just pushed the cost of recovery on to government and would not reduce the scale of the damage.
“If we are just covering the cost of the premium that isn’t going to improve anything in the future,” Bell-James told Guardian Australia. “All the other costs – loss of income, loss of residence, psychological damage, are still going to occur. We are going to have the same problems in the future with insurance premiums going higher and higher.”
Bell-James said funding should instead go toward mitigation measures such as flood levees and ensuring houses are built to a cyclone standard.
That was the conclusion of a Productivity Commission report following the 2011 Queensland floods, which recommended the federal government increase disaster mitigation funding to $200m a year, and also the conclusion drawn by the northern Australia insurance premiums taskforce in 2016.
Bell-James said existing mitigation measures – such as the flood levee in Lismore, which was breached when flood waters reached the town last week – should also be reviewed to ensure they can withstand more severe flood and storm events under climate change.
“We use the language of a one-in-100-year flood, but what that really means is there’s a 1% chance of that flood happening any given year,” she said. “Under climate change, that could increase to a 5% or even 10% chance.” 
Insurance Council of Australia spokesman Campbell Fuller said government intervention in the insurance market “would have little impact on affordability, would risk encouraging inappropriate development, and would expose taxpayers to billions of dollars of losses”.
Fuller said the industry was pushing for a greater government spend in permanent mitigation measures, including a stricter land use planning and building codes. He also defended the availability of flood insurance, saying 96% of all household policies included flood insurance, up from 3% prior to the 2011 floods. 
“The premium charged reflects the flood or other natural hazard risk to each property based on the latest available government data and the insurer’s underwriting criteria,” he said. 
Insurance premiums in northern Queensland increased by 80% between 2005/2006 and 2012/2013, the period covering Cyclone Larry, the Mackay storm, Cyclone Yasi, and the Brisbane floods, according to a 2014 report by Australian government actuary Peter Martin. Premiums for Brisbane in the same period increased by 45%, while premiums in Sydney and Melbourne increased 12%.
Choice spokesman Tom Godfrey said the price increase was unsustainable and left many people in the highest-risk areas unable to afford insurance. “When homeowners can’t afford insurance in disaster prone areas, there’s clearly a big problem with the market,” he said.
Susan Quinn, insurance policy expert from the Consumer Action Law Centre, said there was currently no requirement that coverage offered by insurance companies is appropriate for the person seeking insurance, so long as the limits of the policy were clearly set out in the policy documents, which 80% of people do not read. 
“Ultimately that assumption is that you buy insurance and automatically assume that is going to cover you for the things that might happen to your house, but that’s not guaranteed under law,” she said.
Quinn said updating the minimum standard cover definition, which was set in 1984, and requiring insurance companies to explicitly state when they are offering less than standard cover, would make things fairer for consumers.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/apr/07/subsidised-insurance-for-people-in-cyclone-or-flood-prone-areas-a-bad-idea-say-experts

The Commonwealth Bank is conducting a “detailed climate policy review” that will be released publicly pending board approval, and NAB has a working group reviewing the risks from global temperatures rising two degrees. 
ANZ is conducting portfolio analysis to identify changes in the financial position of business customers in sectors “most exposed” to climate change. It is also working with the Bureau of Meteorology to understand variability in average annual rainfall over recent decades to understand how climate change is affecting Australia’s traditional farming areas.
Executives from the three banks shared this information with the House of Representatives’ standing committee on economics, as part of a review of the four major banks. The revelations, written in response to questions on notice from the committee, were published on the federal parliamentary website on Friday afternoon.
It comes two months after the banking regulator warned climate change posed a material risk to Australia’s financial system, and urged companies to start adapting. 
Geoff Summerhayes from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra), in a major speech to the Insurance Council of Australia’s annual forum in February, warned it planned to start running stress tests of the financial system to see if it would survive various adverse climate shocks.
He pointed to the Paris Climate Agreement, ratified by Australia in November, as a significant policy moment for all governments, including Australia’s.
Summerhayes said the Paris Agreement provided an “unmistakable signal” about the future direction of policy and adjustments that companies, markets and economies “will need to make”.
The revelations from CBA and NAB come after ANZ’s chief executive, Shayne Elliott, said last month he was examining the impact of sea level rise and other climate impacts on housing mortgage risk.
Adam Bandt, the Greens’ climate and energy spokesman, has welcomed the revelations. He also questioned why Westpac has not ruled out funding Adani’s giant Carmichael coalmine in Queensland given its competitors’ concerns about climate change.
“Following ANZ’s revelation that sea-level rises might make it tougher to grant a mortgage, CBA and NAB seem to be examining whether to follow suit,” Bandt said. “The penny doesn’t seem to have fully dropped, because banks like Westpac still think they can commit to a two degree target but leave the door open to expanding coal mines.
“Westpac’s refusal to rule out funding Adani is especially concerning; as the bank seems to think it can have its climate cake and eat it too. But the days of dealing with climate change simply by putting a polar bear in your ad are long gone.” 
Last year, financial activists Market Forces said Australia’s big four banks could act on their stated ambition to help achieve a 2C warming target simply by giving no new loans to coal projects.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/apr/07/climate-change-three-of-australias-big-four-banks-reviewing-exposure-to-fossil-fuels

That prior article dealt with the increase of extreme precipitation events as the Earth warms. I termed the relationship a thermodynamic one; it was driven by local thermodynamic processes. But extreme weather can also occur because of large-scale changes to the atmosphere and oceans. This issue is the topic of another just-published paper that makes a convincing case for a whole new type of influence of humans on extreme weather. In a certain sense, this study confirms what was previously reported here and here. With the march of science, the tools, methods, and evidence get better each year.
Before getting into the study, a little background. The jet stream(s) are high-speed rivers of air that flow in the upper atmosphere. There’s more than one jet stream; they blow west to east and they mark the separation of zones of different temperatures. A good primer on jet streams is available here. 
If you were to stand at the northern pole and travel southwards, you would experience a gradual increase in temperature. However, when you reached the first jet stream (the Polar Jet), temperatures would rapidly become warmer. That is, the Polar Jet separates two different temperature air regions. Typically, if you are north of the jet stream, you are in a colder zone whereas if you are south of the stream, it is warmer. Sometimes, the jet streams undulate as they encircle the planet and these undulations move. So, sometimes you happen to be in a position north and sometimes south of the stream, even though your location is fixed. 
The interface between warm and cold temperatures creates a lot of weather-pattern changes. In addition, if the undulations of the streams become fixed, it means your weather patterns will get stuck. For instance, you could find yourself in an upward undulation for weeks or longer and experience warm and potentially dry weather. Alternatively, if your location is north of a stuck jet undulation, you may experience persistent cold weather. Perhaps even more importantly, these stuck waves can become larger in their magnitude.
So, scientists really want to know what affects these undulations – both their magnitudes and their persistence. We also want to know whether these undulations will change in a warming planet. This is precisely where the new study comes in. The researchers used both weather observations and climate models to answer these questions. What they found was very interesting. 
Using measurements, the authors documented what conditions led to extreme weather patterns that persisted for extended durations. They found that many occur when the jet stream becomes stationary with the undulations stuck in place. They also saw that under certain situations, the jet stream undulations do not dissipate in time; they become trapped in a wave guide. 
Interestingly, this pattern of a stuck jet stream would occur when the number of undulations was between six and eight. When these circumstances all lined up, according to study co-author Stefan Rahmstorf:
the same weather persists for weeks on end in one region, then sunny days can turn into a serious heat wave and drought, and lasting rains can lead to flooding
And this is also how humans come into the story. As humans emit greenhouse gases, the planet warms. We know that, we predicted it, and it is occurring. However, the warming is not uniform. The Arctic, for instance, is warming more rapidly than the rest of the planet. As a result, the temperature difference between the Arctic and the rest of the world is reducing. It is this temperature difference that maintains the jet stream patterns. As stated by lead author, Michael Mann: 
The warming of the Arctic, the polar amplification of warming, plays a key role here. The surface and lower atmosphere are warming more in the arctic than anywhere else on the globe. That pattern projects onto the very temperature gradient profile that we identify as supporting atmospheric waveguide conditions. 
The authors compared the observations to computer models and they found similar patterns. The authors went on to say in a press release:
Using the simulations, we demonstrate that rising greenhouse gases are responsible for the increase ... We are now able to connect the dots when it comes to human-caused global warming and an array of extreme recent weather events.
This is really where the science is. We know humans are causing climate change and we know that weather will change as this process evolves. What we really want to know is how human-caused climate change will influence extreme weather. It’s extreme weather like droughts, floods, heat waves, etc. that cause high social and economic costs. These authors have concluded a convincing study that connects the dots. Perhaps the study is best summarized by Michael Mann, who said:
We came as close as one can to demonstrating a direct link between climate change and a large family of extreme recent weather events.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/apr/07/new-study-links-carbon-pollution-to-extreme-weather

In the petition filed with the National Green Tribunal, a special court for environment-related cases, Ridhima Pandey said the government had failed to implement its environment laws.
 “As a young person [Ridhima] is part of a class that amongst all Indians is most vulnerable to changes in climate, yet are not part of the decision making process,” the 52-page petition reads. It calls on the tribunal to direct the government “to take effective, science-based action to reduce and minimise the adverse impacts of climate change”.
Speaking to the Independent in the UK, Ridhima said: “My government has failed to take steps to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which are causing extreme climate conditions. This will impact both me and future generations. 
“My country has huge potential to reduce the use of fossil fuels, and because of the government’s inaction I approached the National Green Tribunal.”
India’s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and the Central Pollution Control Board have been asked to respond within two weeks.
 India has four of the 10 worst cities in the world in terms of air pollution. Together, India and China accounted for more than half the total number of global deaths attributable to air pollution in 2015, according to a recent study.
Greenpeace released a report in January estimating that nearly 1.2 million Indians die each year owing to high concentrations of airborne pollutants such as dust, mould spores, arsenic, lead, nickel and the carcinogen chromium.
At the time, India’s environment minister declared the report inconclusive, adding: “There is no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct correlation-ship of death exclusively with air pollution.”
 Despite several laws to protect India’s forests, clean up its rivers and improve air quality, critics are concerned that implementation is poor and economic growth often takes precedence over the environment.
 Flash floods and landslides in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand, where Ridhima lives, killed hundreds of people and left tens of thousands homeless in 2013.
 The devastation affected Ridhima, the daughter of an environmental activist, according to Rahul Choudhary, a lawyer representing her. “For someone so young, she is very aware of the issue of climate change and she is very concerned about how it will impact her in future,” he said.
 “She wanted to do something that can have a meaningful effect, and we suggested she could file a petition against the government.”
India is taking some action on air quality. As a signatory to the Paris agreement on climate change, it is committed to ensuring that at least 40% of its electricity is generated from non-fossil-fuel sources by 2030.
 In her petition, Ridhima asks the court to order the government to assess industrial projects for climate-related issues, prepare a “carbon budget” to limit carbon dioxide emissions, and create a national climate recovery plan.
 “That a young girl is doing so much to draw the government’s attention is something. We hope the case puts some pressure on the government to act,” said Choudhary.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/07/nine-year-old-ridhima-pandey-sues-indian-government-over-climate-change-inaction

“This drought emergency is over, but the next drought could be around the corner,” Brown said in a statement. “Conservation must remain a way of life.” 
The governor lifted the drought emergency in all California counties except Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Tuolumne, where emergency drinking water projects will continue to help address diminished groundwater supplies.
The governor’s order, which came as a springtime storm bears down on the waterlogged state, keeps in place some conservation measures.
Water conservation will become a way of life in the nation’s most populous state, said Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the state water resources control board, who led conservation planning. Officials already have started charting long-term rules to make California more resilient as climate change makes weather patterns more severe. 
 “There’s a greater appreciation of just how precious water is,” she said. “We’ve got to plan for longer droughts.” 
Cities and water districts throughout the state will be required to continue reporting their water use each month, said the governor’s order, which also bans wasteful practices, such as hosing off sidewalks and running sprinklers when it rains. New rules are expected to make such bans permanent. Officials say they will work aggressively to stop leaks that waste water.
The drought strained native fish that migrate up rivers, killed millions of trees, and forced farmers in the country’s leading agricultural state to rely heavily on groundwater, with some tearing out orchards. It also dried up wells, forcing hundreds of families in rural areas to drink bottled water and bathe from buckets.
Brown declared the drought emergency in 2014, and officials later ordered mandatory conservation for the first time in state history. Regulators last year relaxed the rules after a rainfall was close to normal. 
But monster storms this winter erased nearly all signs of drought, blanketing the Sierra Nevada with deep snow, California’s key water source, and boosting reservoirs. 
Susan Atkins of the charity Self-Help Enterprises said the drought was not over for more than 900 families who have large water tanks in their yards because their wells dried up during the years-long drought. 
Most of them are in Tulare County, a farming powerhouse in central California’s San Joaquin Valley. Atkins said she still received calls from people whose wells were running dry and needed a tank and bottled water. 
“In no way is it over,” she said of the drought. “We will run out of money before we run out of people that need help.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/07/california-drought-over-jerry-brown-future-climate-change

You’ll learn all sorts of interesting things without effort because he’s a natural storyteller with a particular gift of understatement that is often laugh-out-loud funny – which you don’t expect from a bee book.
The second thing is that this endearing account of his search for rare bees is also an unofficial travel guide to some extremely appealing places that I don’t even want to mention here, lest they fill up with other adventurous readers this summer, because I’m planning to follow in Goulson’s footsteps to at least one of them. OK: Poland. Also, an amazing-sounding lodge in Ecuador. You’ll have to buy it for more details.
And the third thing is that camouflaged throughout this very entertaining and accessible book about rare bumblebees are some pretty shocking facts about the environment. But there is never the feeling – at least not until literally the last two pages – that Goulson is on a soapbox; he’s too skilful for that, he just lets the evidence speak for itself. So here and there – amid the incantatory poetry of the natural world, the names of flowers, the habits of the animals – are some bits of information that work like the equivalent of the cartoon frying pan in the face.
For instance, I’m thoroughly enjoying the chapter in which he’s searching for the shrill carder bee in the foothills of the Tatra mountains. I’m drinking beer and eating pierogi with him, taking in vivid details of farming methods that are about 100 years behind those of the UK – when all of a sudden we’re into the common agricultural policy and for the first time all those fragments of information make awful sense, because Dave Goulson is so very good at showing how the macro (the laws or the lack of them, the things that are so ungraspably large and hard to think about, such as climate change) affect the micro.
How following the second world war the laudable intention to increase food production led to “the destruction of the European countryside to make way for industrial farming, created huge surpluses of food, flooded the world with cheap subsidised produce, and gave EU farmers an artificial advantage over farmers in developing countries, thus condemning millions of farmers elsewhere in the world to a life of poverty”.
Sit on the fence, why don’t you. But I do really like that he doesn’t, even though he tempers his own thoughts with the rational allowance that “there are often no right answers in conservation”. No matter what scale he’s thinking on, the bee is our key to a greater understanding of the natural world as we humans affect it with our unpredictable and chaotic antics.
I’m worried I’ll make this book sound dry and boring, or depressing – it’s anything but. It’s warmly personal, and stuffed full of the inescapable poetry and beauty of the natural world, as well as details of his many packed lunches, dinners and various beers. He doesn’t so much wear his erudition lightly as pack it away somewhere at the bottom, under the sandwiches. But it is most definitely there. You’ll effortlessly learn about the link between agriculture and empire, between neonicotinoid pesticides, monocultural farming and the decline of honeybees – and about the price of creating a global network of protected areas for most of the endangered species on earth.
Jorn Scharlemann, Goulson’s colleague at Sussex University, recently put this at £42bn a year, which sounds astronomical but, as he points out, “is just 20% of the global annual spend on fizzy drinks, and less than half of what is paid out each year in bonuses to bankers in Wall Street’s investment banks” – to say nothing of the cost of waging wars.
Dave Goulson is generous, he credits his colleagues and PhD students – and he frequently draws on his vivid adventurous childhood, which is always imaginatively close to hand and inspires his writing with unselfconscious freshness. Adventure is not only a word he uses a lot, but something he prizes and wants for everyone. Going on Bee Quest with him puts the natural world within our reach – to enjoy but also to protect. There’s no two ways about it, we have to act in some way, and now, or it will continue to be paved over, sprayed into submission, and restricted to oblivion. But despite this underlying serious awareness, this is a truly positive and empowering read – you close it better informed, filled with poetry, pies and ready to get out there and make a difference.

tropospheric warming accompanied by stratospheric cooling has also been measured.

thins also known and widely discussed in scientific circles.For example, CO2e is often used a term to combine all the carbon based GHGs together. This includes methane which is another more potent GHG, that fortunately has a shorter dwell time in the atmosphere.
Similarly, changes in albedo are discussed.
As for the impacts, they too are discussed, whether they be the impact on human societies directly due to changes in hydrological cycles such as increased or decreased rainfall, increased extreme precipitation events and drought.

How can water vapour fall out of the sky when it's constantly being replaced?
BQEND
Water vapour is a condensing gas - it falls out of the atmosphere as precipitation.
The normal hydrological cycle was in balance. The water vapour that condensed as precipitation, was replaced by water vapour that evaporated into the atmosphere.
Now we have warmed the Earth due to CO2e emissions, the atmosphere can hold a greater % of water vapour. And as we know, water vapour is a GHG.
However it has a very short residence time in the atmosphere (days/weeks), so once the warming ceases to increase, so will the % water vapour increase, the excess will be removed, and a new balance restored.
Therefore, its contribution is not deemed as important in the long run as CO2, which has a much longer residence time in the atmosphere and its effects will be with us for centuries even if we stopped adding more now.

Off shore Wind does cost a fortune compared with nuclear £165 per Mw/Hr buy in compared with £95 but it is coming down. It also costs an absolute fortune to bring ashore. the scale of construction costs per Mw/ hr is far more than Nuclear.
BQEND
That isn't the full business case though is it ?
If it were that simple, then we should have had new nuclear being built over the last few decades. The original plans by the Conservatives under Thatcher were for more nuclear. They abandoned those plans, and not for ideological reasons unless you think Thatcher et al were easily cowed by tofu eating yoghurt weavers.
We haven't, and nor are other countries racing to build lots of new nuclear. 
BQSTART
the fact that other forms have been phased out far too early. There is absolutely no engineering reason for introducing wind if these plant were not shut.
BQEND
Engineering issues are only one component of the business case for any source of energy generation.
Environmental and commercial factors also are key components.
As for shutting older fossil fuel sources too soon, that is another example of short sighted and dysfunctional energy policy we have in the UK. It also plays out in the start/stop subsidies for renewables.
BQSTART
As to a repository for nuclear waste it is incredible that non scientists are insistent that glass and lead encapsulation and concrete in used coal mines is considered unsafe in geologically stable areas such as the UK.
BQEND
Incorrect.There are multiple problems with such a simplistic solution.
It is also not just confined to the UK. AFAIK the only long term repository in construction is in Finland, and they're not accepting foreign waste. So in all the countries globally, none of have a long term solution available currently, nor in the near term future. 
Therefore, no costings or other associated issues can be quantified.
BQSTART
It certainly pays the foreign energy suppliers to shut efficient plant here and sell it from domestic production.
BQEND
Another example of dysfunctional domestic policy.
However, no other comparable country is not investing heavily in renewables, such as wind or solar.
So just because successive UK governments could not organise a party in a brewery, does not mean that renewables are not a viable component of the future energy grid.
At the same time, comparable countries are also backing off Nuclear, and going for renewables.
There's a pattern here, that goes beyond our own domestic (dysfunctional) policy.

Wind farms have made a significant impact in limiting carbon emissions from other sources of power generation in Great Britain. 
Power from wind farms prevented the creation of almost 36 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions from sources such as coal and gas, in a six-year period.
This is the equivalent of taking 2.3 million cars off the road, University analysis of nationwide output shows.
Detailed researchThe figures from 2008-2014, analysed in the most accurate study of its kind to date, suggest that a greater investment in wind energy could help meet Scottish and UK government targets for carbon emissions reduction.
Engineers from the University analysed National Grid figures for the power generated by various sources including wind, coal and gas.
Their data detailed generator energy output figures for every half hour, creating a comprehensive picture of how demand over time was met by power from the various sources.
Real dataTheir study improves on previous estimates because it uses real, rather than estimated, energy output figures.
It takes into account the inefficiency of individual conventional generators, researchers say.
The calculations are complex because energy demand is met from a mix of sources at any one time.

To echo what geofarce said, it is to demonstrate that the deniers are lying when they come up with their comical conspiracy theory that AGW is a left wing conspiracy.
As normal people know, the science behind AGW dates back 150+ years and uses basic physics and chemistry.
This article demonstrates that the potential solutions to AGW are compatible with a modern capitalist economy.
Both these points are disputed by the deniers who are by and large right wing.
So to have one of their own more senior politicians be supportive further highlights the isolation of their position is, both scientifically, economically and politically.

Incorrect.H2O is a well known GHG, and its effects are present in the scientific literature. 
Even though it is the most prevalent GHG, its effect is less of an interest in AGW, as its is a condensing GHG - it literally will fall out of the atmosphere in the space of weeks, so any increase from mankind's output is ephemeral.
CO2 on the other hand is a non-condensing GHG, with a dwell time of decades to centuries, so will have a greater impact for a longer time.

If you keep spending absolute fortunes in wind farms what are you going to do when there is insufficient or too much wind.?
BQEND
As normal people understand, wind will be a component of a mixed power grid. Nor does it cost a fortune compared with nuclear power plants. This is why wind has been rolled out, whilst there has been much angst over a single new nuclear power plant in the UK.
Similarly, normal people know that the energy grid will be designed to cope with peaks and troughs of energy being fed in from multiple energy generation sources.
Going hand in hand with this, there are already advanced plans for multiple connectors between European countries, and more speculative ones with say iceland. This will help iron out the peaks and troughs across the continent as a whole.
This sort of planning is normal, and will overcome the silly claims of the anti-renewables that the wind does not blow al the time.

Nuclear power produces no CO2
BQEND
Incorrect.Nuclear is a low carbon fuel.
However it is not a zero carbon fuel, as it requires large scale construction of the power plants, mining activity for the uranium, energy to process the uranium and transport it, and then we have an open ended commitment to the safe storage of radioactive waste which is yet to be solved - there is no long term repository for UK nuclear waste currently.

This was a controversial statement at a time when solar energy, for example, was a costly technology better suited to spacecraft than British rooftops. And indeed the argument can still be heard that reducing greenhouse gas emissions will ruin our economies – even that it will return us to a pre-industrial living standard.
A quarter of a century later, the approach that we took has been richly vindicated. As research published on Monday by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit demonstrates, in that period the average Briton has grown richer faster than citizens of any other G7 nation; at the same time, his or her carbon footprint has fallen faster than in any other G7 nation. While it would be stretching reality to argue that Britain’s economic success has been driven by its climate change policies, no one can seriously argue any more that our climate policies have generated economic harm.
I would argue that there are three principal factors why Britain tops the G7 league in terms of growing our economy while reducing our carbon emissions. We started earlier than most, we have been consistent, and we have used market forces wherever possible. Certainly our decision now looks to have been a prudent investment. British companies in low-carbon goods and services already turn over an estimated £83bn per year; and with Brexit opening the door for a new era of free trade with major countries in Asia and Latin America, most of which are pursuing their own clean energy transitions, this sector has the potential to become a major engine of trade and growth.
When I was negotiating the UN climate convention 25 years ago, the reality was that we did not know what it would cost to fulfil the treaty’s goal of preventing “dangerous” climate change. Science had not clearly told us what degree of global warming would be “dangerous”; nor did any government have a fully fledged plan for reversing the upward tide of carbon emissions.
We acted in the absence of perfect information because we had to. Margaret Thatcher had warned world leaders three years previously that humanity was “changing the environment of our planet in damaging and dangerous ways”, and that the only route to curbing it was a global treaty that did not constrain economic growth – because only growing economies would be able to afford the investment necessary to restrain greenhouse gas emissions. To a certain extent, her global climate treaty was a leap of faith in both the probity and the innovative capacity of humankind.
Since 1992 science has shown us ever more clearly what “dangerous” climate change looks like. Meanwhile, evidence has been growing that a transition to a low-carbon economy is economically feasible, and will bring added benefits such as cleaner air in major cities. These two factors drove all governments to conclude the Paris agreement in 2015.
Figueres is to be commended for her vision. The rationale remains what the British government put forward 25 years ago
Globally, carbon emissions have remained flat for the past three years, even as the world economy has grown by 7.5%. China and India are fast reversing their previous policies of building greater fleets of coal-fired power stations. Replacing our own use of coal with gas and renewable energy has brought UK carbon emissions down to a level last seen during the general strike of 1926.
Yet neither these remarkable developments nor the Paris agreement will secure a stable climate. The latest science tells us that greenhouse gas emissions need to start declining by 2020 at the latest in order to give reasonable confidence that global warming will stay well below the 2C limit, the target governments adopted in Paris. So, having halted the once unstoppable tide, the next logical step is to reverse it – and quickly. This is the mission on which a new initiative launched by Christiana Figueres, until recently the UN’s top climate official, will embark this coming week.
Figueres is to be commended for her vision. The rationale remains exactly that which the British government put forward 25 years ago: thatunchecked, climate change presents unacceptable risks for the future.

Pollutants left over from the northern hemisphere winter cause increased ozone at ground level. Coastal areas are most vulnerable and the problem tends to move south through spring.
During March, ozone on Shetland reached four on the UK’s 10-point warning scale. Heavy fertiliser use and spreading manure that was stored over winter causes big releases of ammonia each spring. This reacts chemically with pollution from traffic and industry to create particles that can stay in the air for a week or more. These caused pollution to reach eight on the UK’s 10-point scale across England in February, and six during March.
Industry and new vehicles have to meet ever tightening emission standards, but targets for controlling ammonia from farming are less ambitious. Over-use of fertiliser costs farmers money. It harms our rivers and our air and releases powerful greenhouse gases. Ammonia from farming decreased substantially in the early 1990s, but progress has stalled since. In Turkey and eastern Europe it has increased, while Denmark halved ammonia emissions between 2000 and 2010 showing what can be done.
The particles from the ammonia, traffic and industry mixture can drift a long way. Around one third of the health impacts from western Europe’s particle pollution occurs in other parts of the world, but this is not the only way that we export pollution. Based on goods traded in 2007, western Europe’s consumption of Chinese products causes around 55,000 early deaths from air pollution deaths across China each year.

The drift / current patterns could be really disturbing for the process of Photosynthesis within the Algae that symbiotically feed themselves and the Coral. Most interesting is the 9 year delay before reaching Australia & Indonesia and the fact that a section of Mururoa Atoll has collapsed.. Add Runit island, some others too & Fukushima's continued instability and a few other muddying factors like run off and it would seem to me, that to place all faith in one cause would be very naive.

""These simulations provide a better understanding of the consequences of a passive radioactive tracer release from Mururoa atoll, quantitatively through the concentra-tion ﬁgures and qualitatively by monitoring the geographical location of the spot cores. Our simulations show spot displacement to be strongly dependent on depth.On the surface, in the top 100—200 m, the core moves towards the southeast, sinking gradually at the same time; its concentration is reduced by a factor of more than 10in10 yr. It does not reach the South American coastline, since it follows the sub-tropicalgyre’s rotary motion, moving rapidly towards the north-west. When injected deeperdown to approximately 800 m, the core moves west at constant depth. For a near350 m depth release, it ﬁnally reaches the Australian coastline after 9 yr, with a con-centration approximately 10times lower than the initial value. Deeper down, below800 m, tracer motion is no longer signiﬁcant in the time-frame considered. ******************Further below, the northern branch current is reaching Polynesia and, at a depth of 364 m(Fig. 2b), the velocity is of the order of 2 cm s\towards the west.

Either way , educate me rather than assume superiority .. i just understand this:-
Definition of a Photon""A photon is the quantum of electromagnetic radiation. The term quantum is the smallest elemental unit of a quantity, or the smallest discrete amount of something. Thus, one quantum of electromagnetic energy is called a photon. The plural of quantum is quanta.
The concept of photons and quanta comes from quantum mechanics and quantum theory. Quantum mechanics is a mathematical model that describes the behavior of particles on an atomic and subatomic scale. It demonstrates that matter and energy are quantized, or come in small discrete bundles, on the smallest scales imaginable. A photon propagates at the speed of light.
(For Illustration of wave-particle duality, follow link)
A photon describes the particle properties of an electromagnetic wave instead of the overall wave itself. In other words, we can picture an electromagnetic wave as being made up of individual particles called photons. Both representations are correct and reciprocal views of electromagnetic waves. For example, light exhibits wave properties under conditions of refraction or interference. Particle properties are exhibited under conditions of emission or absorption of light.""
http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-a-photon-definition-energy-wavelength.html
Planck's constant (for planks, like you & me:)""the energy of a photon equals Planck's constant times the frequency of the radiation. Mathematically, this is given by the equation E = hf. Planck's constant is the fundamental constant of quantum ""

but what should I call these cyclic effects and such actions as volcanoes?
BQENDForcings are external to the climate system. So a volcano especially something like a large igneous province (LIP) will be an external forcing.
When the variability is internal to the ocean atmosphere system it is refered to as ""internal variability"". This is almost always moving energy around the system, not creating energy or retaining more energy from an external source.

BQSTART
1.2.2 Natural Variability of Climate Internally and externally induced climate variability Climate variations, both in the mean state and in other statistics such as, for example, the occurrence of extreme events, may result from radiative forcing, but also from internal interactions between components of the climate system. A distinction can therefore be made between externally and internally induced natural climate variability and change.
BQEND
BQSTART
But even without changes in external forcing, the climate may vary naturally, because, in a system of components with very different response times and non-linear interactions, the components are never in equilibrium and are constantly varying. An example of such internal climate variation is the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), resulting from the interaction between atmosphere and ocean in the tropical Pacific.

""I think we are too cavalier and hubristic in our attitudes toward waste and endless production ... think of all those Starbucks cups thrown away in a day around the world. It is a disgrace! In America, Australia, Europe etc.""
You must be speaking for yourself when you talk about cavalier and hubristic attitude to waste. My landfill bin is the lightest of my two bins. Science is the least hubristic of disciplines as it deals with reality, including that of waste. As explained above you can apply your understanding of science to make a good cup of coffee. In much of Australia you can obtain a good ceramic cup of coffee from the more ubiquitous local coffee shop with resorting to some rarely seem American chain.
I bought some new clothes recently as the old ones are wearing out. The largest consumer of electricity in my house is a small but efficient air conditioner which we use during hot summer days when the wet bulb temperature exceeds 35 degrees C. Its energy demand are covered by solar panels. Hot water can be provided by a rooftop direct solar heating. There is no need to heat the house in this climate. Possums eat vegetable peelings and trimmings. The scrub turkey does the composting. The tap water is fine.

As explained above your first mistake was base your understanding of science on faith. Your second seems to have been basing your interpretation of science on the popular press rather than scientific journals.
I'm old too and as a young scientist was around during all the science related topics- some beatups, all obviously misunderstood by you at least - that you have listed in apostrophes. I'll talk about them one by one.
First what you call ""global cooling'. The globe has been cooling for 9,000 years and, if the current global greenhouse warming had not occurred, would have continued to cool for another 50,000 years until the next ice age or glacial began.In the early 1970s there were reports in popular magazines that this global cooling would soon lead to an ice ice. This seemed highly improbable to most scientists who studied the last glacial as the current interglacial had not been going for long enough yet. So you mistook a beat up in the press which failed to report the scientific consensus for the ""science you had faith in"" -a bit silly really.
Acid rain was a problem in Sweden a country built on acidic granitic rocks and the acidic sandstone based forests of Germany. Sulphur dioxide from the burning of British thermal coal was falling as acid rain in the countries to the east brought in by rain bearing wind off the Atlantic. Coniferous forest experienced die back and Swedish lakes became acidic. We don't hear about acid rain now because lime scrubbers were introduced to remove the sulphur dioxide from the stacks. Science solved the problem.
The 'hole in the ozone' layer occurred largely over the region around the South Pole and to a lesser around the North Pole. Chemically stable chlorofluorocarbon compounds destroyed the ozone layer,high in the atmosphere, which protects life on Earth from the more energetic end of the ultraviolet spectrum. At its height the large southern hole extended into southern Australia and was a concern in a country with the worlds highest incidence of skin cancer. Discontinuation of the use of CFCs as refrigerants and aerosol propellants led to the hole reducing in size. This was achieved by international agreements and cooperation. The hole has not completely gone away and I still get sun burnt more easily in the Mediterranean Climate of Melbourne than in the Subtropical climate of Brisbane. Science and government regulations all over the world are solving the hole in the ozone layer problem. They've made great progress.
Not sure where your 'no snow by 2000' refers to. I live in a state that got snow in 2013 on parts near 1,000 metres altitude and 30 years before that on much the same parts. Australian ski resorts even in the south have a very short and very variable ski season. If you're booking a ski holiday some time in advance, New Zealand is a better bet. Reduced snow cover played a part in the recent Californian drought reducing spring meltwater stream flows. 
 Climate is the sum of weather over thirty years. Change the climate and you change the mix of weather you get. Near the high latitude jet streams this can result in mire extreme winter blizzards and more snow at least for that Arctic or Antarctic blast.
 Such a blast caused the 2013 snow in Queensland and heavier snow in the Blue Mountains behinds Sydney. In the latter case two weeks after the snow hot dry spring weather caused bushfires in the same area.

The same Terry Hughes who only 10 months ago, had a paper withdrawn because it was so bad! 
Dr Reichelt said the authority had withdrawn from a joint ­announcement on coral bleaching with Professor Hughes this week “because we didn’t think it told the whole story”. The taskforce said mass bleaching had killed 35 per cent of corals on the northern and central Great Barrier Reef.Dr Reichelt said maps accompanying the research had been misleading, exaggerating the ­impact. “I don’t know whether it was a deliberate sleight of hand or lack of geographic knowledge but it certainly suits the purpose of the people who sent it out,” he said.“This is a frightening enough story with the facts, you don’t need to dress them up. We don’t want to be seen as saying there is no ­problem out there but we do want people to understand there is a lot of the reef that is unscathed.”Dr Reichelt said there had been widespread misinterpretation of how much of the reef had died.“We’ve seen headlines stating that 93 per cent of the reef is prac­tic­ally dead,” he said.“We’ve also seen reports that 35 per cent, or even 50 per cent, of the entire reef is now gone.

I am not a denier exactly, it is just I am not a believer.
The globe is the word used to denote the planet on which we live which is roughly spherical or globular, that is a globe. Warming occurs when there is an increase in temperature of a body or change in state from solid to liquid or liquid to gas. On our planet or globe we have observed very fast warming of our atmosphere and oceans since the 19th century.
This is warming is a physical reality based on evidence. When I made my cup of coffee I turned on the jug and observed that the water had warmed to boiling point. There is no need for belief when making coffee as the warming to 100 degrees C is evidence based. Similarly there is need for belief with global warming since the 19th century because the warming is evidence based.
So no one needs to be a believer if you understand reality of making coffee and the reality of climate science. Are you saying you don't believe in reality?
""I am an agnostic in that I am not sure who to believe or who is right"".
An agnostic is a person who believes that nothing is known or can be known about the existence or nature of a thing they call 'God"". This god thing has nothing to do with the making of coffee or global warming. 
As coffee making and global warming are evidence based there is no need for belief to determine the right way to make coffee the right interpretation of the existence and nature of global warming. Understanding of the science and the evidence on which its based will give you the right cup of coffee and the right answer as to the reality and cause of global warming. It's not about who or belief it about the evidence and the quality of the experiment by which that evidence is collected. That information can be obtained by reading peer reviewed scientific papers published in proper scientific journals.
""- so I don't take a position beyond 'well, if we/I don't know for sure then taking a position of try to do the least harm seems the most advisable'"". 
When it comes to reality evidence based science is the best way to be as sure as you can be about what's going on. If you don't know, for sure as you can be about, the existence,nature and cause of global warming it's because you haven't read and understood the evidence based science published in peer reviewed scientific papers published in proper scientific journals.

BQENDENSO, the el Nino Southern Oscillation.
It oscillates between states. In its positive phase it is called the el Nino and temporarily warms the global average lower troposphere temperature.
In its negative phase it is called the ls Nina and temporarily cools the global average lower troposphere temperature.
It does not appear to affect the long term climate, defined by 30 years on a global scale.
Also forcings for global climate are usually defined as external to the system such as volcanoes, the sun, the orbit. Internal variability is not a forcing.
In fact a couple of years ago when we had a few negative phases we had to push hard to convince the other crowd the ENSO was not a forcing.

So easy to avoid. Sadly, we must get used to it, there is much more and much worse to come. 
We have at least another few centuries of things getting worse no matter what we do, and especially if we continue ignoring the issue as we are. That's many hundreds of next years, and many hundreds of thousands of next days to report on the next few thousand disasters and next few hundred million lives lost or destroyed. All desperately sad and all easy to avoid, not that we will choose to avoid them.
Of course (sarcastically) other media outlets must bring balance to the reporting by hinting that it is all a 'maybe' pushed by the 'greenies' and never must we point any finger at those that make these things our reality, and that is our corruptible democratic political system which is really just one giant department store for our big business employers to choose a future that suits their profit margin rather than one that does not involve destroying our planet along with ourselves to get there. And sadly, all voted for by many of us.
Unless we get very lucky and morality strikes our fossil fuel CEOs, the only other choice is to realise that it is our political system that must change. And that is only if we can first convince our friends, colleagues and family that the stress of doing all that work is necessary and needed because climate change is actually real and catastrophic and needs their help. 
And that depends on the very few of us being strong and determined enough to take the months and years needed to overcome the wall of disgust, indignance, alienation and abhorrence to which any mention of the climate often receives from even friends and family, thanks to the clever and cruel work already done and still being done by the mainstream propaganda engine of the fossil fuel machine.

This body of water is the beating heart of the positive phase of the ENSO, and its movement would be capable of raising north Australian water temperatures. 
Another angle to think about, we know coral can survive warmer waters than currently in Australia, but that is like saying mamals can survive colder weather than on the African veldt. When there are thousands of years to adjust biota can migrate and the reef change its species. This clearly happened during the change from glacial to interglacial.

The findings have caused alarm among scientists, who say the proximity of the 2016 and 2017 bleaching events is unprecedented for the reef, and will give damaged coral little chance to recover. 
Scientists with the Australian Research Council’s Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies last week completed aerial surveys of the world’s largest living structure, scoring bleaching at 800 individual coral reefs across 8,000km.
The results show the two consecutive mass bleaching events have affected a 1,500km stretch, leaving only the reef’s southern third unscathed. 
Where last year’s bleaching was concentrated in the reef’s northern third, the 2017 event spread further south, and was most intense in the middle section of the Great Barrier Reef. This year’s mass bleaching, second in severity only to 2016, has occurred even in the absence of an El Niño event.
Mass bleaching – a phenomenon caused by global warming-induced rises to sea surface temperatures – has occurred on the reef four times in recorded history. 
Prof Terry Hughes, who led the surveys, said the length of time coral needed to recover – about 10 years for fast-growing types – raised serious concerns about the increasing frequency of mass bleaching events. 
“The significance of bleaching this year is that it’s back to back, so there’s been zero time for recovery,” Hughes told the Guardian. “It’s too early yet to tell what the full death toll will be from this year’s bleaching, but clearly it will extend 500km south of last year’s bleaching.”
Last year, in the worst-affected areas to the reef’s north, roughly two-thirds of shallow-water corals were lost.
Hughes has warned Australia now faces a closing window to save the reef by taking decisive action on climate change.
The 2017 bleaching is likely to be compounded by other stresses on the reef, including the destructive crown-of-thorns starfish and poor water quality. The category-four tropical cyclone Debbie came too late and too far south for its cooling effect to alleviate bleaching.
But Hughes said its slow movement across the reef was likely to have caused destruction to coral along a path up to 100km wide. “It added to the woes of the bleaching. It came too late to stop the bleaching, and it came to the wrong place,” he said.
The University of Technology Sydney’s lead reef researcher, marine biologist David Suggett, said that to properly recover, affected reefs needed to be connected to those left untouched by bleaching.
He said Hughes’ survey results showed such connectivity was in jeopardy. “It’s that connection ultimately that will drive the rate and extent of recovery,” Suggett said. “So if bleaching events are moving around the [Great Barrier Reef] system on an annual basis, it does really undermine any potential resilience through connectivity between neighbouring reefs.”
Some reef scientists are now becoming despondent. Water quality expert, Jon Brodie, told the Guardian the reef was now in a “terminal stage”. Brodie has devoted much of his life to improving water quality on the reef, one of a suite of measures used to stop bleaching.
He said measures to improve water quality, which were a central tenet of the Australian government’s rescue effort, were failing.
“We’ve given up. It’s been my life managing water quality, we’ve failed,” Brodie said. “Even though we’ve spent a lot of money, we’ve had no success.”
Brodie used strong language to describe the threats to the reef in 2017. He said the compounding effect of back-to-back bleaching, Cyclone Debbie, and run-off from nearby catchments should not be understated.
“Last year was bad enough, this year is a disaster year,” Brodie said. “The federal government is doing nothing really, and the current programs, the water quality management is having very limited success. It’s unsuccessful.”
Others remain optimistic, out of necessity. Jon Day was a director of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority for 16 years until retiring in 2014. 
Every moment we waste, and every dollar we waste, isn’t helping the issue
Day, whose expertise lies in protected area planning and management, said the federal government’s approach to protecting the reef was sorely lacking. He said it was taking too relaxed an approach to fishing, run-off and pollution from farming, and the dumping of maintenance dredge spoil.
The government was far short of the $8.2bn investment needed to meet water quality targets, he said, and Australia was on track to fail its short-term 2018 water quality targets, let alone achieve more ambitious long-term goals. 
“You’ve got to be optimistic, I think we have to be,” Day said. “But every moment we waste, and every dollar we waste, isn’t helping the issue. We’ve been denying it for so long, and now we’re starting to accept it. But we’re spending insufficient amounts addressing the problem.”
The Queensland tourism industry raised questions about the reliability of the survey, saying scientists had previously made exaggerated claims about mortality rates and bleaching. 
“There is no doubt that we have had a significant bleaching event off Cairns this time around,” said Col McKenzie, of the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators.
“The far north probably did a little bit better, Port Douglas to Townsille has seen some significant bleaching,” he said. “Fortunately we haven’t seen much mortality at this time, and fortunately the temperatures have fallen.”
McKenzie said more money needed to be invested in water quality measures, and criticised what he saw as a piecemeal and uncoordinated approach to water quality projects up and down the coast.

Clearly you don't understand democracy, now while there is an argument to be made in favor of compulsory voting as we have it here in both the USA and the Brexit vote those actively playing the game there all tacitly agreed to abide by the result under the rules of the ballots.

Oh I forgot your little joke about how prohibition is actually effective:
BQEND
No joke what I say is both reasonable and a fair understanding of the situation.

BQSTART
 How many illegal hand guns do you think are in circulation in this country? There can not be very many at all, a couple of thousand would be a pretty generous estimate but I suspect far fewer actually which given both the size of the country and our population amounts to a pretty effective prohibition. 
Well certainly law-abiding peaceful people don't have any after the ban!!!What you neglect to mention is that the entirety of the 'couple of thousand' are owned by armed criminals who are far more likely to rely on the asymmetry of the situation to rob people than they would if they thought they might get shot!
BQEND
A couple of points, the number crimes in which illegal hand guns have been used are very low indeed which rather definitely undermines your claims here, often when we have had gun crimes the weapons used are often cut down long arms precisely because we have so few hand guns in circulation.
BQSTART
I honestly thought you must have been kidding. Surely(DING!) everyone learns in middle school that the prohibition of alcohol in the US in the 20s created the mafia and drove people to hard liquor like 'moonshine' instead of good old-fashioned wine and beer.

BQEND
there is a VERY big difference between making grog and making a hand gun, the former can be produced with common household items by any one but the latter requires high quality engineering and skilled craftsmen. Your comparison fails right there.

A common mistake. There are a million motives for buying and selling things. Some people will buy a copy of a newspaper because they're in it. Some people will sell their shares of Starbucks because they're disgusted at their attitudes and behaviour. Others will buy badges and hats that have particular words written on them while still others will buy the same badges and hats because they believe their value will rise in the future.Human action is rich and diverse. 
What you're saying reduces ultimately to this:
Human beings, except for the state, lack all noble motivations and care only about their own personal material enrichment. The state is a unique exception and if given the power to decide the entire fate of the GBR, without fear of competition or interference from anyone else, can be trusted to do the right thing at all times without prejudice to personal profit, power or advancement.

I'm proposing that the GBR be privately owned so that the people who stand to benefit from it (in all manner of ways including but not limited to tourism and research/documentaries) have an incentive to maintain it in good condition, whereas at the present time governments have an incentive not to because crises are good for obtaining public consent for increased funding and any future catastrophe will reflect badly on someone else, not on you
BQEND.
And I am saying we all ready own it and we have done so ever since this country became an independent nation in 1901. Your model is simply barmy.
BQSTART
Oh I'm not suggesting prohibition can't work, only that the incentive for a private owner to prevent poaching is greater than the incentive for the government to do so. I don't have time to fact-check your assertion so I'll just grant it. Fine, good. I still seem to see a large crisis however.

This is just simply false. Whatever the causes of the bleaching, be they chemical or purely temperature driven, local solutions can be produced. If that weren't the case, greenhouses wouldn't work and neither would umbrellas.

""Politics"" is just the word people use when they want to pretend their stated intention to screw you over is just a difference of opinion.
BQEND
Nonsense politics is the art of getting any agreement for collective action towards a common goal. In a democracy its about negotiation and persuasion, something you don't seem to understand at all. 
BQSTART
Let's keep it simple. I repeat one last time: if a resource is privately owned, two things will happen:
BQEND
You simply can not predict what will happen when you are dealing with an equation with more than 20 million variables 
BQSTART
1. Those who don't care about it will prefer to sell it to those who do, in order to make money
BQEND
As I said earlier and you pointedly ignored what is to stop those who think they can make more money by grinding up the coral to make cement offering more for each share than those who might want to preserve it? After all you do claim you want NO restrictions or controls on how any share holder deals with this property didn't you?
BQSTART
2. Those who do care about it and own it will take enthusiastic steps to keep it nice, whether for aesthetic/spiritual/political reasons or reasons of profit (eg. tourism/research revenue)
BQEND
If the motive is profit then keeping it nice may not even be on the agenda 
BQSTART
It's staggeringly simple and wildly effective but because most people hate private property per se they'd rather see endless government failures and the loss of the resource, just so long as no-one makes a buck.
BQEND
That may be what you imagine would happen but there is simply NO way that you can know that is how things would work out at all.

You're thinking of someone else, or you chose to misread my comment. For the sake of clarity, that's not what I'm proposing in the slightest. I'm proposing that the GBR be privately owned so that the people who stand to benefit from it (in all manner of ways including but not limited to tourism and research/documentaries) have an incentive to maintain it in good condition, whereas at the present time governments have an incentive not to because crises are good for obtaining public consent for increased funding and any future catastrophe will reflect badly on someone else, not on you.
BQSTART
Large areas of the reef very successfully prohibit fishing and have done so for many years
BQEND
Oh I'm not suggesting prohibition can't work, only that the incentive for a private owner to prevent poaching is greater than the incentive for the government to do so. I don't have time to fact-check your assertion so I'll just grant it. Fine, good. I still seem to see a large crisis however.

This is just simply false. Whatever the causes of the bleaching, be they chemical or purely temperature driven, local solutions can be produced. If that weren't the case, greenhouses wouldn't work and neither would umbrellas.

""Politics"" is just the word people use when they want to pretend their stated intention to screw you over is just a difference of opinion.
Let's keep it simple. I repeat one last time: if a resource is privately owned, two things will happen: 
1. Those who don't care about it will prefer to sell it to those who do, in order to make money2. Those who do care about it and own it will take enthusiastic steps to keep it nice, whether for aesthetic/spiritual/political reasons or reasons of profit (eg. tourism/research revenue)

It does not have to be a choice between a successful government prohibition (the first in history!) or the apocalypse. That is just a myth propagated by those who benefit from attempted state solutions, namely the state, its employees and the public intellectuals who cheerlead for the state.

Global average temperatures over land have plummeted by more than 1C since the middle of this year – their biggest and steepest fall on record... 
The news comes amid mounting evidence that the recent run of world record high temperatures is about to end...
Some scientists, including Dr Gavin Schmidt, head of Nasa’s climate division, have claimed that the recent highs were mainly the result of long-term global warming. Others have argued that the records were caused by El Nino, a complex natural phenomenon that takes place every few years, and has nothing to do with greenhouse gas emissions by humans...
The new fall in temperatures suggests they were right... it is almost certain that next year, large falls will also be measured over the oceans, and by weather station thermometers on the surface of the planet – exactly as happened after the end of the last very strong El Nino in 1998. If so, some experts will be forced to eat their words.

I have just read the Business Council Australia's policy on climate change, of which large mining companies are members, and their statement on climate change basically says that it is not up to business to take the lead on climate change policy, it is up to the COAL-ition government. Scott Morecoal, Josh Fryingtheearth and Turn-bulls---t, on the other hand, are sitting back and expecting the Business Council to take the lead on action on climate change.
When the business sector, the mining sector, economists, right wing think tanks, the social services sector, the health sector, international bodies and climate scientists are ALL on the same page, and begging this COAL-ition government to introduce an Emissions Intensity Scheme, and this COAL-ition ignores them ALL, we know that the COAL-ition truly are a bunch of neanderthals, who would rather see the world and humanity go the way of the dinosaur, than do anything that will effectively and efficiently, with least pain to Australia's fiscal outlook and economics, reduce Australia's greenhous gas emissions. The COAL-ition would rather see climate change disaster, after climate change disaster, occur at home and all over the world, killing millions of people, then give a pitiful handout to the survivors trying to get back on their feet, thereby take credit for being caring and empathetic, than prevent the worst of climate change occuring in the first place. It is, afterall, much more spectacular for photo opps, for the PM to be filmed sweeping water out of someone's business, (for all of 30 seconds), than to have judiciously implemented strategies to prevent the water inundation in the first place. The COAL-ition is getting off on seeing people ruined and then riding in on their pork barrels to be the savours of the day!
More people have died in Australia from climate change, than have ever died from terrorism or shark attacks put together. Yet terrorism protection receives $B's of funding, shark drum lines and nets are funded with $M's, yet real, effective, and efficient, climate change mitigation strategies, receive nothing, zero, zip, zilch.
The COAL-ition has sold itself to the devil that is COAL!
Brace yourselves, Australia, this COAL-ition is going to ride Australia into the ground as we are left behind in the renewable energy boom, and left with stranded assets that public money has paid for. No such thing as a movement to a sustainable green economy! This COAL-ition government is determined to take us down every last coal mine it can give approval to, for the next 60 years.

Tenement applications for drilling and mining covered vast swathes of the reef, with both government and industry enthusiastically backing the plans for mass exploitation.
In the face of the reef’s impending doom a motley collection of ordinary Australians shared a common determination that something had to be done. But the odds didn’t look good. The poet turned campaigner Judith Wright wrote that “if it had not been for the public backing for protection of the reef that we knew existed, we might have given up hope”.
The optimism of the poet was well founded. First in the hundreds, then in the tens of thousands, a people’s movement grew to defend the reef. Everyday Aussies turned activists and campaigners. Scientists and lawyers came forward with vital expertise. At a crucial moment the Queensland Trades and Labour Council approved a total black-ban by all affiliated unions on oil drilling on the Great Barrier Reef.
As hard as is now to believe, the Murdoch-owned Australian opined that the ban would have an unprecedented measure of public support and would probably succeed. It deserved to. Only finally did the politicians follow the will of the people. Through the power and determination of the Australian people, the greatest marine park in human history was established and the Great Barrier Reef lived to fight another day.
Inherently democratic in its size and closeness to the shore, the Great Barrier Reef is truly the people’s reef. Looking back on the first great struggle for the reef between the Australian people and the fossil fuel industry, Wright wrote that “if disasters in the shape of weather, accident and climate change lie ahead, the work done already has shown what can be done to shield it from such dangers and has proved that people will agree, in the event, to supplying the help it needs”.
Unhappily, those disasters are now upon us. Global warming brought the great bleaching of 2015-16 and the dreadful and unprecedented sequel over the summer that has just finished. Our reef is in dire trouble.
But while the people’s reef is grievously wounded, it is still very much alive. And life fights for life. Innumerable animals are now doing what creatures do, navigating the hazards of life as best they can to survive and reproduce in the warming waters. Given time and the right conditions, the people’s reef can recover and life will flourish again.
So how this time around do we supply the help the reef needs? The big lie propagated by Australian government and big business is that it is possible to turn things around for the reef without tackling global warming. As scientists have made clear, it isn’t – we have to stop climate pollution to give our reef a chance.
It is true that Australia can’t save the reef alone because climate change is a global problem. But that does not mean we are powerless to act and we should not be deterred. Because when you love something deeply – as we Australians cherish our people’s reef – then you do all that is within your power to save that thing which you hold so dear. And there is much that is within our power to do.
So what is to be done? The answer does not lie in false techno-fixes or the faux-democratic farrago of the government-business funded Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef. Australia’s greatest contribution to global warming is through our coal, exported and burned in foreign power stations. So our most determined Australian efforts to save the reef must be directed to closing down the coalmining industry, while ensuring decent new jobs and fair transitions for all affected workers and communities.
Again, the balance of power seems loaded against us. First the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, and now the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, have betrayed both the reef and the trust of the Australian people by snivelling across the seas, pledging allegiance to the Carmichael coalmine. All too often, the rest of big business is complicit in the crisis by explicitly or tacitly supporting the coal industry. Financial institutions such as CommBank continue to invest in the fossil fuel projects that are bringing disaster to the reef.
But, once we are roused, never underestimate the power and determination of the Australian people to defend our iconic animals and the natural beauty of our lands and seas. The extraordinary success of the Stop Adani Roadshow – which sold out across the eastern Australian capital cities reaching an audience of thousands – is just a glimpse of the popular will to fight the coal industry for the future of our reef.
We have the opportunity to write our own story, not of despair but of defiance. If we, the people of Australia, stand determined together against coalmining and the rest of the fossil fuel industry then the future of our reef is not bleak but hopeful.
The roadmap to full recovery for our reef will be decades or even centuries in the making. And it is going to get worse before it gets better. But we, the Australian people, can again agree to supply the help it needs, to give the reef we love the best chance of future flourishing. Now is the time to get involved.

Why not so much ?
Because we live in a high thermal mass concrete and brick unit with neighbours above, below and two sides (party walls/floors/ceilings) - so we only have minimal wall exposure to outside temperatures (indoor neighbours are much more likely to be paying to maintain comfortable temperatures inside the same as us).
So I'll submit - a major cost of heating or cooling can be exposed uninsulated walls - in Europe they may have superinsulated walls 25cm thick - in Australia many brick veneer houses were built with NO insulation - so are too hot in summer and too cold in winter - in Canberra -3C winters the heating bills were scary !

For a multi residential building (Class 2), a minimum of 5-stars (out of 10) is the minimum for any one unit while the building must have a minimum average of 6 stars. NSW is a little different with BASIX and usually has much lower scores than those in other states. Plus there are 69 different climate zones which, compared to the NCC (8 climate zones) gives a much more accurate result. 
To say that ""If we need air conditioning, we've designed it wrong"" is, unfortunately a bit much. The thermal performance of any one unit compared to another in the same building will always be different. Units directly above carparks, rooftop units, south facing or north facing, surrounding structures and even the height above ground all contribute to vastly different results. I would say it would be impossible to build a 10-star, multi residential building given these limitations. 
I've never seen a 10 star unit (no air con required), although I have seen a few 9's and 9.5's but very rarely. Getting to 10 stars is usually limited by the law of diminishing returns which means you have to put in so many more hours of design and planning for even the smallest gains at high star ratings, and it is understandable that developers do not want to double the length of their project just to eliminate the need for an air conditioner.

During late January and early February 2009, temperature records were toppled across Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.
Then, on 7 February, 24 of Victoria’s 35 long-term stations recorded record high temperatures: Melbourne reached 46.4C while Hopetoun broke a state record with 48.8C.
These extreme temperatures were said to have caused an estimated 374 deaths in Victoria. 
And it could happen again. Research from the University of Melbourne shows that many Melbourne apartments aren’t designed to withstand heatwave conditions and could become dangerously hot for residents.
As temperatures continue to soar each summer, the researchers are calling for an upgrade to the Australian building code to include measures of apartment overheating during design, and for retrofit improvements to vulnerable apartments – and to bring the guidelines in line with international practice in a warming climate.
Using data from the 2009 January-February heatwave, the researchers modelled the performance of six apartment designs typical to Melbourne. The apartments were run without artificial cooling, to see “what happens from a health and safety perspective if the air conditioner breaks or the grid power goes out”, according to the lead researcher, Chris Jensen.
All apartments failed the international “summer comfort” standards from the UK, France, Germany and the United States. 
Housing comfort isn’t simply a matter of being a little hot and bothered: heat stress claims more Australian lives than all other natural hazards. But the building code of Australia contains no standards to guard against this. Standards now focus on reducing energy requirements for cooling rather than directly addressing measures of heat stress.
After the deaths of 14,800 people from heat stress in France in 2003, the French building code now requires that buildings can maintain a “comfortable” indoor temperature without the need for active cooling systems. It stipulates that room temperatures do not exceed 28C for more than 260 hours throughout a year. 
Jensen says modelling the effects of retrofit strategies, such as changing thermal mass, insulation, light-coloured walls and natural ventilation, resulted in even the worst-performing apartment improving enough to meet two of the four international standards. 
“There is one fairly glaringly obvious outcome: that proper use of natural ventilation by the occupants was reported both in the literature and in the study to be highly effective and very under-used,” he says. 
Jensen says the study could be expanded to analyse apartments across the country, although other areas have different heatwave profiles. “The further north you are in Australia, the less temperature variation there is – further inland also has higher variations, so one would expect Mildura to be pretty severe (but there are basically no apartments).”
He says it would be worthwhile considering other states: “I would expect Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne to be the worst, possibly Canberra as well, but … it is subject to there being apartments, and a weather pattern with severe heatwaves.”
The research confirms the thinking behind measures taken by a growing number of progressive Australian architects. Maintaining a comfortable temperature without using air conditioning was a priority when designing the Brunswick apartment building the Commons for Jeremy McLeod, an architect and founding director of Breathe Architecture.
“It’s really important to have well-performing windows,” McLeod says. “We paid more for that and it helped us increase our star rating. It also helped our thermal modelling, which told us we could then take out the air conditioning.”
He says the key message from the study is that cooling strategies should be applied together, adding that thermal mass and natural ventilation have worked well at the Commons. 
“We have incredibly stable temperatures through winter and summer and to be able to get through the [January 2014] heatwave with no air conditioning, I think was incredible.”
As a result, they’re putting more thermal mass into their new Nightingale housing model. 
“Everyone has been naive, so people have been ignoring climate change – they thought they could deal with it with bigger and bigger air conditioners,” McLeod says. “Until what happened in South Australia last year, no one had pondered the possibility that our grid would fail, and of course you need to allow for that possibility.”
He’s investigating the idea of heat refuges in co-housing – for example, a basement communal room with a high-efficiency air conditioner that can run on solar in emergencies. 
Andrew Maynard, co-director of Austin Maynard Architects, isn’t surprised by the results of the study. “We know the health risks from some of the studies coming out about suburban living, but then to see that these things just turn into ovens and cook people, that’s alarming,” he says. The recommendations are encouraging, he adds. “There’s a way out.” 
Maynard says the liveability of apartments in Australia suffers because they’re seen as commodities rather than homes. 
“We need to remember that what’s legislated will be the norm. Why would they put expensive external shading on a western facade when they can just throw in a cheap air conditioner? We absolutely need to legislate this stuff because it’s the only reason developers would do any of it.” 
He says their designs consider building orientation, maximise passive sunlight in winter and minimise it during summer, and optimise through-breezes. They know that if they need to introduce air conditioning “we’ve somehow designed it wrong”.
Another priority is helping residents understand how to passively manage the buildings’ temperature themselves. This understanding is important when people are looking at apartments, to drive demand for sustainable design, Maynard says. 
Dimitri Kapetas, a co-director and designer at Fremantle-based architecture group EHDO, says their projects draw inspiration from designs in similar climates. An example is the Persian wind-catcher, which can be combined with an underground canal, using air pressure differences to draw air down over the water and reduce the temperature. 
“You can almost get it down to iced temperatures; I’ve been to a couple in North India and it was freezing down there on a 40C day,” Kapetas says. 
Diluted versions of these ideas can easily be applied to new buildings, he says.
“If you put a water source and/or vegetation in front of a large opening in a building on the south-western side – where the cool breeze comes from in Fremantle – and a small, high opening at the other end of the house, the breeze drops around 1-2C,” Kapetas says.
For Western Australia’s first Nightingale project, they plan to make the warmer winds from the north-east travel over water and vegetation to cool before they hit the building.
The design will also involve a six- to seven-metre-wide “green street” that channels wind through deciduous trees, with little wind-catchers to funnel the air into the apartments on either side. All apartments will have two north-to-south windows.
“I don’t want to be preachy,” says Kapetas, “but those [suggestions in the report] are things that should almost just be standard design … there are really simple things that can be done for not much more cost.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/10/hot-apartments-if-we-need-air-conditioning-weve-designed-it-wrong

I've been doing thermal modelling of residential dwellings for over 3 years and I have never, ever seen such a dramatic saving from the solar absorbance of the roof alone. Perhaps 4-5% if there is no ceiling cavity and minimal insulation in the ceiling/roof construction and it's a single storey dwelling but in a typical home with a roof cavity with sarking and ceiling insulation, 1-2% tops.

One part of the house that seems to be attracting more than its fair share of attention is the roof. Replacing a standard roof with a lovingly cultivated green roof of plants or adorning it with increasingly trendy solar panels can do wonders for reducing a building’s carbon footprint. 
Rooftop solar panels are an obvious option for many, and increasingly affordable. The average price of a residential solar photovoltaic (PV) system has been steadily dropping, from $2.40 per watt in 2012 to $1.58 per watt in March this year, according to Solar Choice’s PV price index. On the commercial front, too, prices are at an all-time low of just $1.23 per watt. 
Add to this the advent of affordable battery storage systems, and Tesla’s plans to roll out roof tiles that dispense with the need for separate solar panels over the coming months, and rooftop solar has never been more attractive. 
But a building’s rooftop can be used for more than just harvesting the sun’s rays. Indeed, cool roofs aim to do exactly the opposite, reflecting as much of the sun’s energy as possible. A flat roof in the midday sun receives about 1,000 watts of sunlight per square metre. A dark roof will absorb most of this energy, heating the roof and underlying building, as well as the surrounding air. Air conditioners that suck in this hot air can further exacerbate a building’s cooling requirements. 
“If you have a cool roof, that problem can be eliminated,” says Geoff Smith from the University of Technology Sydney, a specialist in green roofing technologies. 
The easiest way to reflect the sun’s rays is to paint a roof white – something the Greeks have been doing for centuries. A white roof reflects around 85% of the sunlight that hits it – at least when it’s clean – and heats to just a few degrees warmer than the outside air temperature. A black roof, by contrast, can heat to more than 80C, according to sustainable construction expert Chris Jensen from the University of Melbourne. 
“On a black tile roof, you could fry an egg, and on a cool roof you could walk on it in your bare feet,” says Jensen, “that’s the magnitude of the difference.” 
Recently, Smith’s group and others have produced roof coatings that keep roof temperatures even lower than the ambient temperature. They achieve this by reflecting sunlight using thin plastic sheets – akin to a plastic food wrap – often combined with layers of silver and other reflective nanoparticles. 
But there’s a catch. “These experiments might look marvellous in the scientific literature,” says Smith, but in most cases, they “just won’t work in practice.” That’s because most of these super-reflective coverings look essentially like a mirror. For a sloped residential house, the result would be an eyesore, if not a danger to nearby road users. 
Unlike green roofs, which can require considerable infrastructure to support and maintain, cool roofs can be achieved with a painted-on coating to an already existing roof. While white reflects the most visible light, coloured roofs can also be made cooler by coating with materials designed to reflect light in the infrared spectrum, which also contributes to how hot a roof gets. When combined with an elastomeric weatherproof coating, upgrading to a cool roof can add years to the life of an ageing roof, says Jensen.
The benefits of a cool roof extend beyond the building it sits upon. The heated air that sits above dark roofs is a large contributor to the urban heat island effect, which can put urban temperatures three to four degrees warmer than surrounding areas. Modelling of urban heating in Chicago estimated that the air temperature above cool roofs would be reduced by 7-8C compared with conventional roofs. Cool roofs even outperformed green roofs – by about a degree.
The energy savings are also large. Increasing a roof’s reflectivity from 10-20% to around 60% can cut a building’s cooling costs by more than 20%. But not all buildings benefit – a high-rise apartment or office block won’t reap anywhere near the same benefits as a sprawling low-rise warehouse, shopping centre or airport, or even a single-story dwelling. As an added bonus, work by Jensen and his colleagues has shown that solar panels installed on a cool roof produce almost 7% more electricity on a typical day than those installed on a conventional roof.
At a global level, the impact is nothing to be scoffed at. In 2009, researchers at the Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory in the US estimated that some 24 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year could be offset if the world’s cities adopted cool roofs – not bad considering that urban areas constitute just 1% of Earth’s land area. The offset for a single house with a 100 sqm roof area is around 6 tonnes of carbon dioxide – a decent chunk of the 26 tonnes per capita of greenhouse gases that Australians are currently emitting. 
One criticism of cool roofs is that the benefits of cooling in summer can be outweighed by an increased demand for heating in winter. But according to Smith, roofs are rarely the main culprit for heat loss in Australian buildings. Sealing leaks is far more effective in preventing heat loss, according to modelling that he and colleagues conducted in 2012.
One of the main challenges, says Smith, is confronting the aesthetics. Although lighter-coloured roofs are becoming more popular in the hotter climate of Queensland, he says, “a lot of people shy off the idea of a white roof.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/13/cool-roofs-beating-the-midday-sun-with-a-slap-of-white-paint

While you can indeed have convection from the surface, the most direct anomaly comes from the change in the radiation which impacts the upper layers the most. In places with enough ice melt this can cool the surface waters. 
The greatest general change in warming though is on the surface. While you are given the energy as heat from an integral from the Argo buoys as your link references it still is a comparatively small change in temperature compared to the sea surface anomaly.
If it weren't 1C of rise would be nearer 0.93m of sea level without ice melt. 
Another statistic that is thrown around is a misleading one about where the heat is going which declares ~90% of the heat has entered the Oceans. IF you run the numbers though, you'll find that this is actually stating 90% of the *accounted for* heat has entered the Oceans. You'd still expect significant energy to be going into the deeper layers of the land which is how borehole proxies work.
Some of this stuff requires resorting to first principles and a lot of the ocean modelling is very sparse with regards real long-term data. 
But when you add more IR radiation to the surface of the Ocean, if it leads to warming then the density decreases which in turn makes it less likely for larger vertical mixing.
You cannot trivially show what changes can happen to convection even with sophisticated computer modelling.
If you look at the actual pH data though you can see that diffusion is still dominating the changes to mixing

Environmentalists aren't without dogmatic, anti-science beliefs that are just as irrational as the climate science deniers dogmatic, anti-science beliefs. 
If environmentalists want to make strong arguments they shouldn't declare it ""ridiculous"" that they might be engaged in anti-science. They almost always are, even if they aren't when it comes to defending/applying science when it comes to global climate.
They should openly acknowledge their own personal bias and they should try to understand that the Republican denials of climate science are based on exactly the same motivations and rationalizations that the environmentalists insistence that aromatherapy or supernatural creation of the universe or extraterrestrial visitors are.
If you demand against all the evidence and reason and in defiance of all the well known and well tested laws of physics that gods are real and one of them crapped out the universe and waved her magic wand to create human ""souls"" then you haven't got a leg to stand on when Republicans claim that climate science is just a global conspiracy.

Way to exhibit that you do not understand science at all.
The burden of evidence is on the claimant. It is not for an audience to provide debunking of any and all wingnut, evidence-free claims that come down the pike. That your fanciful contentions fail is entirely your own fault.

I do think that this persistent refusal to look at the Chinese emission plans and their consequences, in terms of your own theory, is comparable to the previous wilful blindness of the left in the West in the face of the great disasters of Russian and Chinese policy - the famine and purges of Russia, and the great famine in China.
Its the same underlying phenomenon. People have a political agenda which requires them either to condemn what China is doing, or else get into denial about it. And they choose denial.
In this way they are able to believe that the Paris Agreement, despite providing for China to carry out its plans of raising its emissions from 10 billion to 15 billion tons a year, is going to save the planet, and that only denialists have any reservations about it.
Since they also believe that the world needs to get its emissions to around 5 billion tons a year, this gives them a problem. They also have a problem because the Chinese plans are in the public domain. And because the rest of the world reducing while China, India and the developing world increases will not lead to the reductions they claim to believe are necessary.

Among other matters that they discussed was the ice thickness and possible explanations for the Arctic winter's low extent. Here is one of their comments:
""For many years, scientists have pondered how much of the sharp decline in summer sea ice extent and volume is due to “top down” forcing—a warmer atmosphere leading to more summer melt and less winter growth, versus “bottom up” forcing, in which ocean heat is brought to bear on the underside of the ice. There is a great deal of heat in the Arctic Ocean from waters that are imported from the Atlantic. As fairly warm and salty Atlantic water enters the Arctic Ocean it dives underneath the relatively fresh Arctic Ocean surface layer. Because the fresh surface layer has a fairly low density, the vertical structure of the Arctic Ocean is very stable. As such, it is hard to mix this Atlantic heat upwards to melt ice or keep it from forming in the first place. However, new work by an international team led by Igor Polyakov of the University of Alaska Fairbanks provides strong evidence that Atlantic layer heat is now playing a prominent role in reducing winter ice formation in the Eurasian Basin, which is manifested as more summer ice loss. According to their analysis, the ice loss due to the influence of Atlantic layer heat is comparable in magnitude to the top down forcing by the atmosphere.""

A view about what the greens are covertly advocating is not a view about AGW. Its a view about what the greens are advocating. They are different.
What steps would I take to prevent AGW. It depends how great the warming is. If its over 8C per doubling of CO2, I would drop everything and try to persuade the world as a whole to get its emissions under 5 billion tons a year within five years, and just accept the disruption to social life that would bring.
I don't think there would be any real chance of success, but that is what would be appropriate for the world. And that really would mean global de-industrialisation.
If the warming is under 2C, then I would stop promoting wind and solar and bio, but still want to phase out coal globally. That would mean China, who is mining and burning more than the rest of the world put together. It would also mean nuclear electricity. It would mean putting the renewables subsidies into research.
And I'd want to do other things which would improve the environment we live in, but as a side effect may make some reductions to local CO2 emissions. For instance, closing some city streets to traffic and making them pedestrian and bike only. Banning diesels, reducing car use, investing in rail, stuff like that.
What do I think the most likely number is? 1.5 - 2C. So I do not deny AGW, though this view, based on the latest observational studies, will be called denial by the ultras. I think CO2 emissions do have a forcing effect, but that there is no evidence this is or will be amplified by feedbacks.

No shit. Is the god of the Westboro Baptist Church the same god as the one worshiped by the Catholics? Is it the same god that is worshiped by the Baptists. Is that god the same god that is worshiped by Seventh Day Adventists? 
Either you're putting yourself in the position of deciding which gods are real and which are ""false"" gods, or else there are different gods.

""Religion and philosophy allow for science to be mixed. "" 
No, they do not. The only difference between theology and philosophy is that in philosophy, all arguments must be rational and logically sound. In theology, irrational and illogical arguments are permitted whenever and wherever they are required. 
""CP Snow for example. Many of the people held at the top of their field still belief in God. It might be an example of believing in something that doesn't have sufficient evidence to support it but it is not the same as denial either.""
a) appeal to authorityb) appeal to popularityc) theism doesn't simply lack ""sufficient"" evidence, it lack any evidence to support it and it contradicts *every* scrap of testable evidence ever gathered by human beingsd) It *is* denial, it is a rejection of the basic principles of science. It is a rejection in spite of the evidence. 
""...the question arises do you adhere by the big bang theory rather than say the steady state theory of the universe? You implied that you did above.""
Evidence. Reason and evidence. 
""If so then you still have lots of questions to answer as to what happened before? Why it could only happen once? And then you also need to account for kinds of other factors like dark energy and dark matter?""
This is where you make it really embarrassingly clear that you don't understand science in general and are painfully ignorant of modern cosmology...in exactly the same way that climate science deniers are painfully ignorant of modern climate science. 
Basic, fundamental fact about science: It doesn't answer why questions. Why a duck? Why blue and not red? Science answers how, not why. 
Attempting to introduce red herrings and using argument from ignorance is the standard religious apologist tool. I don't think you're using it intentionally like they do, but that just makes it all the more embarrassing.  ""You don't see the similarity to the God belief of a creator and the current scientific theory of the big bang?""
Are you really playing the climate science denier card of denying the overwhelming evidence that supports the big bang theory enough that it is not just the leading theory, just like AGW it is the *ONLY* theory that fits all the available evidence, and that evidence and that fit is overwhelming. Just like AGW theory, there are details of the big bang such as what type of inflation occurred, but the basic facts that the universe emerged from an extremely tiny, extremely hot and extremely dense region is the overwhelming scientific consensus. 
""Then perhaps you should note that the person who proposed it was a Catholic priest:""
Then perhaps you should note that his religion had absolutely fuck-all to do with his science, just as Isaac Newton's views on the occult or his anti-trinitarianism had fuck-all to do with his testable science. 
Do you accept the testable science of Jews? I'm fine with it. So why are you implying that testable science of Catholics is somehow religious in nature?

As far as the energy mix and how much of it can be made up of renewables, including biofuels, Germany is currently running on about a third water/solar/wind/bio mix. As more wind power comes on line, brown coal and nuclear power are taken off the grid. Gas is the easiest match for wind energy as it can be brought up to full capacity or run down according to demand.

Ocean temperatures will continue to climb while earth remains in energy imbalance. Average global warming thus far has been 1.16C (1750 to 2015, ref James Hansen). Accounting for the solar cycle returning to maximum, the current energy imbalance is +0.75W/sq.m, sensitivity is 0.75C/W/sq.m, therefore the warming in the pipeline is 0.75*0.75 = 0.56C.

The Great Barrier Reef is bleaching for the second year in a row and now, according to the results of helicopter surveys released on Monday, it is the middle part (all 300 miles-plus of it) that is suffering the awful reef stress that comes courtesy of a warming ocean.
Coral bleaching is incredibly serious. In especially warm summers, the complex balance between the symbiotic algae and the coral becomes disrupted. To save themselves, the coral expels the algae in the hope of better times ahead. In this state, the coral becomes whitened. That’s what bleaching is.
Without the algae to synthesise most of its energy, the coral operates on a kind of “standby” mode. It is vulnerable in this state. Only one third of the entire Great Barrier Reef remains unbleached. The bell, it seems, is tolling for one of the most biologically active parts of planet Earth.
I watched this Great Barrier Reef story unfold, and what started out as quite a conservative bit of science reporting quickly morphed into something else. By midday, many news outlets started running with the line that the Great Barrier Reef was now in a “terminal stage” – a phrase used by one (understandably frustrated) expert in the Guardian’s coverage of the story and recycled into all sorts of other online reports, which then did loops on Twitter.
“Oh Christ,” I thought, “James Delingpole is going to love this.” Skip forward a few hours and the columnist did his thing on Breitbart – don’t go looking for it, but let’s just say I was proved right. For a bleached reef is not a dead reef as you no doubt know – and the climate-change deniers have enjoyed the chance to throw around more allegations of “scaremongering” and their accusations that “Greenies don’t do science” – which is, of course, ridiculous.
Such backlash from climate-change deniers like Delingpole is inevitable. But in this case, I think the conservation hand really was overplayed. Is the Great Barrier Reef really in terminal decline? Is it really done and dusted? I don’t think so. Because coral bleaching, though incredibly serious and concerning, quite simply is not death. (Indeed the scientists involved in the study themselves said: “Bleached corals are not necessarily dead corals …”). Coral reefs can recover. There is reason for hope, therefore. Hope, but not complacency.
Looking at other reefs around the world offers us some perspective. Of 21 reefs monitored by scientists in the Seychelles, for instance, 12 have since recovered after a coral bleaching episode in 1998. (The other nine? Now seaweed-covered ruins). In Palau, many reefs recovered within a decade after being hit by the same 1998 temperature spike. Likewise, in an isolated reef system in Western Australia, that same bleaching episode also affected 90% of the corals. For six years the reef remained bleached, but by 2010 it had recovered.
This isn’t to say that all reefs can recover. But given time and enough protection from other threats, there is hope.
Though bleaching events have never been known to occur back-to-back (for example in 2016 and 2017) as they have in parts of the Great Barrier Reef this year, the reef has recovered from bleaching events before in 1998 and 2002 – and no doubt before that. It can recover, given time and the security a commitment to global carbon emission targets would bring. It can, and must, survive this latest episode of bleaching. After all, the Great Barrier Reef is worth £3.5bn to the Australian economy each year, and keeps 69,000 people in work. As well as being a bubbling, spiralling three-dimensional maze of biological interactions, it’s also an economic nest-egg for Australia. What sort of government would want to squander that?
So it’s not terminal, yet. Instead, the bleaching is an indicator that yet another wild place is taking a battering. That yet another flag is waving. That the climate is changing. That the incredible symbiosis of algae and coral is breaking down. We must act immediately.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/12/great-barrier-reef-dead-coral-bleaching-recover

However there is a documented early survey carried out by ornithologist Richard Barrington in which he collected corpses killed at lights on light ships and lighthouses in the early 1890's from Irish light-keepers (Barrington, Richard M. (1900) The Migration of Birds at Irish Light Stations). These birds had to be on migration rather than on territory. Of the 16 corpses we re-documented randomly in our own database only four were killed in March and the mean date was 9 April. We also found cuckoo corpses were also correspondingly later in the Barrington survey than they are today on mainland Britain (May rather than April) based on calls despite there having been little change here in first cuckoo calling dates over two centuries. I offer no explanation except that all is not what we see at first glance.

Chiffchaffs are on the up; climate change has warmed their advance northwards, and here in the south they seem to be filling every copse, every patch of scrubland. They are often heard, but far less frequently seen.
On my five-mile morning run along the river and past the gravel pits, six birds sang. At the top of a wooded hill, a seventh. On the down slope, I stopped under the trees to locate caller number eight. I thought I was directly beneath it, but I drew blanks among several trees, hundreds of branches, and thousands of twigs unfurling their leaves.
Bird guides tell us that this bird sings its name, a disyllabic “chiff-chaff, chiff-chaff”. The first two birds of the morning stuck to the script of this see-saw mnemonic, tempting me to rock my head in time with the beat. However, caller number three was one of a sizeable minority offering up a loose waltz in its opening salvo – “chiff, chaff-chaff”. Hilltop bird seven was what I would call a chopper, leaving the tiniest pauses between notes hurled out with dramatic emphasis: “Chiff! Chaff! Chiff! Chaff!”
The day before, a bird in the willows overlooking Bedford’s medieval fish ponds had sung with even more startling originality, breaking out from the percussive norm to end each phrase with a frantic-sounding “cheree-cheree”. A conventional see-saw chiffchaff sang in opposition from bushes at the other end of grassy trenches, the remnants of the old ponds. What would the opposite sex think of this difference? Would it be heard as an alluring improviser or an aberrant to be shunned?
I pinpointed the eighth bird in the topmost branches. This singer was a compulsive fidget, shuffling its feet and turning one way, then the other, a mobile speaker wanting to spread its song about. Down below, I stood listening carefully, trying to separate the chiff from the chaff.

Las lluvias fueron de un volúmen diez veces mayor que el habitual, incrementaron los caudales y causaron inundaciones generalizadas e inmensos deslaves que arrasaron con barrios marginales.
Más de 100 personas han muerto, casi 158,000 han sido desplazadas, y 210,000 hogares han sido dañados, según el Centro de Operaciones de Emergencia Nacional de Perú. La infraestructura se llevó un golpe fuerte: se derrumbaron 260 puentes y casi 3,000km de caminos han quedado inutilizables, dejando sin comunicación a cientos de pueblos y ciudades.
La temporada de lluvias del Perú cae por lo general en el primer trimestre del año. También se le conoce como la “temporada de deslaves”, pero pocos recuerdan huaycos, como se les conoce en el idioma Quechua local, de una intensidad y una escala como esta. Mientras que el servicio de meterología del Perú reportaba en marzo lluvias sin precedente en el norte del país, los ríos que normalmente están secos se convirtieron en torrentes furiosos – y nunca antes había vivido tanta gente en su camino.
El país está mal preparado para las temporadas de inundaciones, incluso cuando éstas son más clementes. Pero la brutalidad de la temporada este año en Perú ha puesto en evidencia la infraestructura desigual, el crecimiento desordenado e informal y la muchas veces inexistente planeación urbana en el Perú.
“En medio del desastre se ha abierto una gran oportunidad para el país,” dijo a The Guardian Jorge Nieto, ministro de defensa de Perú, en el pueblo Huamey, afectado por las inundaciones. “Creo que hemos aprendido por las malas que este país necesita una reconstrucción de proporciones históricas.”
Nieto, que ha estado al frente de los esfuerzos de rescate y despliegue de las fuerzas armadas a través del país, dijo que las ciudades y pueblos carecen de defensas básicas contra las inundaciones, y que los ríos que fluyen de los Andes hasta el Pacífico, que son aproximadamente 30, necesitarían ser canalizados, en particular en zonas urbanas.
Ya que el Perú se sacude entre sequías e inundaciones, también deberían instalarse reservorios en las montañas, dijo Nieto, para que el agua de lluvia pueda ser almacenada en el país cuando hay escasez. “De esa manera garantizaríamos nuestro suministro de agua para que las lluvias sean una bendición y no un problema,” agregó.
El desastre natural, al que los meteorólogos están llamando un “El Niño de la costa” ha causado daños equivalentes a $3.1 billones (£2.5 billones), llevándose 0.5% del PNB proyectado para el país en 2017, de 3.4% a 2.9%.
La reconstrucción costaría alrededor de $9 billones, dijo el presidente Kuczynski la semana pasada. La primera fase pagaría la “reconstrucción inmediata” de ciudades y pueblos. La segunda fase, más larga, implicaría construir infraestructura para hacer del Perú un país más “moderno y organizado”, al enfrentarse con la probabilidad de más eventos climáticos impredecibles y extremos. 
Las inundaciones también amenazaron de manera temporal al suministro de agua en la capital peruana. Más de 25 deslaves, que arrastraron troncos de árboles, ganado muerto y escombros de casas destruídas, obstruyeron las plantas de tratamiento en el río Rimac, con lo cual, la comisión del agua, Sedapal, se vio obligada a suspender la captación y tratamiento de aguas durante cinco días.
Lima, la segunda ciudad más grande del mundo ubicada en un desierto después de El Cairo, está más acostumbrada a tener escasez que un exceso de agua, y la infraestructura de la ciudad fue “insuficiente” para lidiar con el diluvio, admite el director del consejo de Sedapal, Rudecino Vega.
“Hace tres meses, el gobierno se estaba preparando para una sequía. Semanas más tarde, hemos tenido una cantidad de lluvia que es el diametral opuesto de una sequía,” comentó a The Guardian.
Obligadas por la pobreza, muchas personas se han asentado en donde nadie querría vivir
Poco después de que el presidente Kuczynski se comprometió a brindar a los peruanos 100% de cobertura de agua, 24 horas al día, antes del fin de los cinco años de su presidencia, el desastre natural puso de manifiesto con “brutal claridad” la insuficiencia de la infraestructura de suministro de agua. Alrededor de 1 millón de peruanos en Lima carecen de acceso al agua potable.
“La gente está viviendo en lugares donde no deberían,” dijo Kuczysnki el mes pasado, refiriéndose a las decenas de miles de víctimas que vivían en las zonas afectadas por las inundaciones. “Tenemos que controlar a las municipalidades para que no permitan el tráfico de tierras en barrancos y montes. Estamos viendo los resultados,” insistió.
Alrededor de medio millón de personas habitan en las llanuras aluviales en el Perú, de acuerdo con un reporte por la Autoridad Nacional del Agua. La migración masiva de las zonas rurales a las ciudades significa que las personas “se han asentado en donde quiera que han podido en zonas marginales donde nadie querría vivir si no se vieran obligados por la pobreza,” dice Ernesto Ráez, ecologista tropical y otrora consejero del Ministerio del Ambiente en Perú.
La reconstrucción de partes de Lima y otros pueblos y ciudades en la costa de Perú debe ser “adaptativa o correctiva”, dice Ráez, y podría implicar la reubicación de cientos de miles, o hasta millones, de personas. El cambio climático traerá condiciones meteorológicas extremas con más frecuencia.
Las Naciones Unidas también ha advertido que el Perú deberá invertir en sistemas de alerta para peligros múltiples y asegurar que sus ciudadanos comprendan mejor los riesgos de tales desastres. “Este es un evento único a gran escala que necesita ser visto en el contexto del calentamiento del planeta, donde los episodios de variabilidad extrema del tiempo se están haciendo más evidentes,” dice Robert Glasser, representante especial del secretario general de las Naciones Unidas para la reducción del riesgo de desastres.
“Para tener éxito en la prevención de desastres como éste, y para reducir las pérdidas a causa de los desastres, necesitamos asegurar que haya una mucha mayor comprensión de la naturaleza del riesgo de desastres en la sociedad. Esto incluye un mejor entendimiento del impacto del cambio climático y cómo altera los patrones climáticos locales.”

Absolutely. Xenophobic ignorants like you should not be allowed in the country. I totally agree. I have only one lingering doubt: what exactly is this curatella you mention? In English, the word does not exist, except as the scientiific name (in Latin, of course) of a type or tree, the curatella americana. In Italian, it means offal. Then again, your syntax and spelling clearly show that you knowledge of the English language is quite limited. Which is hardly surprising: limited knowledge of subjects you nevertheless insist on commenting seems to be your personal trademark. Oh, by the way: Jay Reyner loves Peruvian cuisine.

I see that your ignorance of Latin American affairs is not limited to Peru. The whole enchilada about the crisis in Venezuela being actually an ""economic war"" created in the shadows by a perverse oligarchy conspiring with the support of the gringo imperialists is a fairy tale that no Venezuelan takes seriously. Which may explain why they gave the opposition a two thirds majority in Parliament in the last elections. Which in turn may explain why ever since then Maduro has made sure that there were no more elections in the country, and declared the Parliament illegal. Which may explain why the political situations in the two countries are absolutely non comparable, contrarily to what you stated in the first of your rather comical and baseless xenophobic posts.
Next time, try spending a couple of months in Dallas, and eat at Mc Donald's. The food is great and the people are very friendly.

Ten times the usual amount of rain has fallen on Peru’s coast, swelling rivers which caused widespread flooding, and triggering huge landslides which tore through shanty towns.
More than 100 people have died, nearly 158,000 are displaced and 210,000 homes are damaged, according to Peru’s emergency operations centre. The country’s infrastructure took a big hit: 260 bridges collapsed and nearly 3,000km of roads are unusable, cutting off hundreds of villages and towns.
Peru’s rainy season falls broadly in the first quarter of every year. It is also known as “landslide season”, but few can remember huaycos, as they are known in the local Quechua language, of such intensity and scale. As Peru’s weather service reported record rains in the north of the country in March, usually dry rivers turned into raging torrents – and never have so many people lived in their path.
The country is ill-prepared for seasonal floods at the best of times, let alone those of such brutality that have laid bare Peru’s patchy infrastructure, its disorderly and informal growth, and its often non-existent urban planning. 
“In the midst of disaster a big opportunity has opened up for the country,” Jorge Nieto, Peru’s defence minister, told the Guardian in the flood-hit town of Huarmey. “I believe we’ve learned the hard way that this country needs a reconstruction of historic proportions.”
Nieto, who has been leading recovery efforts and deploying armed forces across the country, said cities and towns lacked basic flood defences, and that the 30-odd rivers which flow from the Andes to the Pacific would need to channelled, particularly in urban areas. 
As Peru lurches between drought and floods, reservoirs should also be installed in the mountains, Nieto said, so that rainwater can be stored in the water-stressed country. “That way we would guarantee our water supply so that the rains become a blessing, rather than a problem,” he added.
The natural disaster, which meteorologists are calling a “coastal El Niño” has caused $3.1bn (£2.5bn) worth of damage, chipping 0.5% off the country’s projected GDP for 2017 from 3.4% to 2.9%.
The reconstruction will cost around $9bn, President Kuczynski said last week. The first stage would pay for the “immediate reconstruction” of cities and towns. The second, longer phase would involve building infrastructure to make Peru a more “modern and organised” country, faced with the likelihood of more unpredictable and extreme climate events.
The floods also temporarily threatened the water supply in Peru’s capital. More than 25 landslides, carrying tree trunks, dead livestock and rubble from destroyed homes clogged water treatment plants on the Rimac river, forcing the waterboard, Sedapal, to suspend the intake and treatment of water for five days.
The second-biggest desert city after Cairo, Lima is more used to having too little water than too much, and the city’s water infrastructure was “insufficient” to deal with the deluge, admits Sedapal’s board director, Rudecindo Vega.
“Three months ago, the government was preparing for a drought. Weeks later, we have had a quantity of rain that is exactly the opposite of a drought,” he told the Guardian.
The natural disaster highlights with “brutal clarity” Lima’s insufficient water provision infrastructure just as President Kuczynski had made a commitment to provide Peruvians with 100% water coverage, 24 hours a day, by the end of his five-year term. Around 1 million Peruvians in Lima lack access to running water.
People have squatted where nobody would want to live if they were not forced to by poverty
“People are living in places where they shouldn’t,” Kuczysnki said last month, referring to the tens of thousands of flood victims who lived in areas hit by landslides. “We have to control the local councils so they don’t allow land trafficking in gullies and on hills. We are seeing the results,” he insisted.
Around half a million people live in floodplains in Peru, according to a report by the Autoridad Nacional del Agua, Peru’s water agency. Mass migration from rural areas to cities means that people have “squatted wherever they can in marginal areas where nobody would want to live if they were not forced to by poverty,” says Ernesto Ráez, a tropical ecologist and former adviser to Peru’s environment ministry.
The reconstruction of parts of Lima and other towns and cities on Peru’s coast must be “adaptive or corrective” says Ráez, and could involve the relocation of hundreds of thousands, even millions, of people. Climate change will mean extreme weather is more frequent.
The United Nations has also warned that Peru must invest in multi-hazard warning systems and ensure its citizens better understand the risks of such disasters. “This is a large-scale singular event which needs to be viewed in the context of a warming planet, where episodes of extreme weather variability are becoming more evident,” says Robert Glasser, the UN special representative of the secretary-general for disaster risk reduction.
“If we are to succeed in preventing disasters like this, and to reduce disaster losses, then we need to ensure there is a much broader understanding of the nature of disaster risk in society. This includes better understanding of the impacts of climate change and how it alters local weather patterns.”

TRUMP: Well, sometimes you have to use some imagination. I mean, I see people with jobs that are so bad -- friends of mine, they have such bad jobs. I say, ""Why don't you move?"" They could move. They're afraid to move. They're afraid to do something. 
You know, I know people that love being in the mines. They love it. And then there are people that don't. They really should try to get out. I mean, there are a lot of great stories about that.

Also your argument is based on the presumption that the developing world economies will continue to grow and that that growth will be based on the use of fossil fuels. I am not sure that that argument bears close examination, economic forecasts for Africa in particular predict a significant shift to the use of renewables. China is heavily investing in such power sources in Africa. As for the rest of your argument, perhaps you might like to consider who has control of many of the natural resources, i.e., coal and oil in the developing world it certainly isn't them, just look at what Shell etc., are doing.

Pruitt said the new “back to basics” agenda for the EPA would focus on devolving oversight of clean air and water to individual states, and bolstering jobs in industries such as coal, oil and gas.
This new agenda for the EPA, bitterly opposed by many of the agency’s staff, was unveiled at the Harvey mine in Sycamore, Pennsylvania, on Thursday. Pruitt, who was presented with an honorary mining helmet, said the federal government’s “war” on coal was over in a speech to assembled miners.
“The coal industry was nearly devastated by years of regulatory overreach, but with new direction from President Trump, we are helping to turn things around for these miners and for many other hardworking Americans,” said Pruitt.
“Back to basics means returning EPA to its core mission: protecting the environment by engaging with state, local, and tribal partners to create sensible regulations that enhance economic growth.”
The new vision involves scrapping or rewriting rules that combat climate change, water pollution and vehicle emissions. A task force has been set up within the EPA to identify further regulations to be revamped. 
Though Pruitt insisted that clean air and water will be maintained in this purge, the choice of venue for the announcement was jarring. 
Consol Energy, which operates the Bailey Mine complex which includes the Harvey mine, was fined $3m in August for discharging contaminated wastewater into streams that flow into the Ohio river. In the settlement with the EPA and the justice department, it emerged that the mining operation exceeded effluent limits at least 188 times between 2006 and 2015. 
Consol said it has improved its pollution control systems and that is “committed to being a good neighbor” to nearby communities. The company has indicated that it wants to exit the coal business entirely after jettisoning seven mines in the past four years.
Bruce Niles, campaign director for Sierra Club’s “beyond coal” campaign said: “Pruitt’s record shows that he has put the profits of polluters before the safety of the public by attacking clean air and clean water safeguards over and over again. 
“This toxic backdrop for Pruitt’s latest publicity stunt only proves his true priorities are with polluters, not people’s health.”
Coal miners were also present when Donald Trump signed an executive order last month that called on Pruitt to review the Clean Power Plan, the cornerstone emissions reduction policy of Barack Obama’s presidency. Trump has vowed to scrap the plan, which Pruitt opposed in the courts while attorney general of Oklahoma.
Pruitt has accused the Obama administration of advancing an “ideological agenda that expanded the reach of the federal government” and has promised to restore what he has called “core EPA originalism” by protecting air and water quality while helping create jobs.
In practice, this has involved the attempted rollback of various regulations, including the venting of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, halting new vehicle emissions requirements and rewriting a limit on ozone pollution, which causes urban smog. 
During his time in Oklahoma, Pruitt sued the EPA 14 times in opposition to its rules around pollutants, including mercury and smog.
Pruitt has repeatedly questioned mainstream scientific understanding of climate change. The EPA’s scientific integrity watchdog is currently investigating comments made by Pruitt that rejected the overwhelming scientific evidence that carbon dioxide is a key driver of global warming. 
In March, Pruitt told CNBC that he “would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see”. The EPA’s scientific integrity policy demands that staff accurately represent scientific findings. The agency’s own website, in common with almost all climate scientists, states that CO2 is the “primary greenhouse gas that is contributing to recent climate change”.
The EPA administrator also recently decided to reject the conclusion of his own agency’s scientists who recommended that a widely used pesticide, chlorpyrifos, should be banned from farms. 
EPA scientists warned that the pesticides could cause severe harm to children and farm workers, but Pruitt said chlorpyrifos would not be banned in order to provide “regulatory certainty” to businesses.
The EPA has been targeted by the Trump administration for stringent budget cuts. The agency has drawn up a plan that would lay off 25% of its employees and scrap 56 programs, including pesticide safety, lead toxicity and environmental justice. There would be new funding, however, for a 24-hour security detail for Pruitt.

The new global framework, with 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) at its core, commits to promoting development in an integrated way – economically, socially and environmentally – in all countries, ensuring that no one is left behind.
Our recently published report identifies six megatrends that will shape the trajectories of – and could potentially undermine – progress on the SDGs. In the current context of a looming retreat from multilateralism, the choices governments and societies make to manage these long-term trends will be fundamental to whether the world can get onto a pathway of sustainable development.
Substantial progress has been achieved in multiple dimensions of poverty in the past decades, including the reduction of absolute poverty, decline in child and maternal mortality rates, and improved access to clean water and sanitation facilities. Income inequality between countries has also been falling, mainly due to the rapid growth in large developing countries.
Despite these gains, the progress has been uneven and considerable challenges remain. These include rising income disparities within countries, persistent gender inequality and the recent resurgence of poverty across regions due to economic shocks and escalating conflicts. The Multidimensional Poverty Index, which measures deprivation in health, education and living standards, counted 1.6 billion people living in multidimensional poverty in 2016 – nearly twice the number of people living in extreme poverty measured by income alone.
Progress towards eliminating poverty is more difficult during times of uncertain economic prospects, the report suggests. This is further complicated by weak labour market conditions, demographic changes, and conflicts and insecurity. Evidence shows that while economic growth is essential for reducing poverty, a critical link between growth and the reduction of poverty and inequalities is related to the nature and quality of growth, and a balanced distribution of gains across all segments of society.
The implementation of the 2030 Agenda will be affected by demographic dynamics, including population growth, ageing, migration and urbanisation. In 2015, 12.3% of the global population reached the age of 60 or over (pdf), with rapid ageing expected to occur in Europe, North America, Asia and Latin America. In Africa, by contrast, populations are young, which provides an opportunity for a demographic dividend.
 It has become easier for people to move, and factors such as poverty, unemployment, conflicts and natural hazards compel people to leave their homes in search of better lives. International migration has reached record levels (pdf), accounting for 244 million migrants worldwide in 2015. If managed well, migration will continue to bring profound benefits to sending countries through remittances, knowledge and networks, and to receiving countries by filling acute labour shortages and contributions in terms of taxes and care services.
Internal migration is also growing, driving fast increases in urbanisation. On one hand, urbanisation fosters growth and provides a higher quality of life, with cities accounting for more than 80% of global GDP (pdf). On the other, it raises concerns about urban poverty, social tensions and disparities, changes in family patterns, and environmental risks.
Major environmental challenges identified by the report include degradation of air and land, water scarcity, deforestation, marine pollution and a decline in biodiversity. Some of the underlying factors behind environmental degradation include population growth, polluting technologies, and overexploitation of ecosystems driven by unsustainable consumption and production patterns.
The first year of SDG implementation was marked by the slowest rate of economic growth since 2009
The world is already witnessing the impact of climate change on natural systems. This is translated into the increasing frequency and severity of natural hazards (pdf), which lead to more disasters due to population growth (pdf) and patterns of economic development. Climate change is also projected to undermine food security, exacerbate existing health threats, adversely affect water availability and lead to increased displacement.
In the coming decades, it is likely that this trend will continue, with more losses expected in livelihoods and assets. This underlines the link between poverty and vulnerability to natural hazards. It also exposes inequity, as countries and populations likely to be most harmed by climate change impacts are often the least responsible for causing them, and have limited capacity and resources to cope with the consequences.
The report discusses various shocks and crises including economic and financial shocks, disasters, conflicts and disease outbreaks that have undermined the precarious livelihoods of millions of people and can affect progress towards sustainable development. Over the past decades, global forced displacement, for example, increased by 75% due to conflicts, violence and human rights violations.
The first year of SDG implementation was marked by the slowest rate of economic growth since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis (pdf), weak investment growth and stagnant global trade. While progress has been made in reducing the global unemployment rate, nearly 201 million people worldwide (pdf) were estimated to be unemployed in 2016, including 71 million young people. Global economic prospects remain subject to various risks, including increasing policy uncertainty in major advanced and emerging economies, financial market disruptions and heightened geopolitical tensions.
At the same time, remarkable achievements have been made in combating major infectious diseases and reducing hunger over the past decades, which can be attributed to political commitment, strong global partnerships and sound social protection policies. Despite this, the world continues to face significant challenges in addressing health issues and under-nutrition, with nearly 800 million people suffering from hunger worldwide, and high risks of famine.
To achieve the SDGs, development finance strategies need to go beyond filling financing gaps. While official development assistance will remain a vital source of external public finance for the poorest and most vulnerable countries, it will not be sufficient. All sources of finance – public and private, domestic and international – need to be mobilised. In particular, effective domestic resource mobilisation will be at the core (pdf) of financing sustainable development.
There is no shortage of capital in the global economy
While resources allocated for development objectives are not adequate, there is no shortage of capital in the global economy. The challenge is to enhance the impact of available resources, while catalysing additional sources of finance into investments in long-term sustainable development.
It is critical to better align private sector incentives with sustainable development objectives through strengthened policies and sound institutional, legal and regulatory frameworks. As a positive trend, the private sector’s involvement in philanthropic giving, corporate social responsibility initiatives, impact investing, and inclusive business approaches has been expanding.
A number of innovative multi-stakeholder partnerships such as the Global Fund and new financing mechanisms for development including green bonds have emerged since 2000. It will be essential to scale up the proven mechanisms in size, scope and geographical reach.
Technology is an important means for implementing the SDGs. The biggest technological advancements over the past decades have occurred in health, education and the environment. For example, the development of new vaccines against infectious diseases is estimated to save nearly 3 million lives every year. Online courses and interactive applications expand access to education around the globe, providing new ways of learning, teaching and collaborative work. Renewable energy technologies are critical in addressing climate change and its negative impacts.
While technologies have provided innovative solutions to many development problems, they have also added new challenges and risks, including security and privacy concerns, polarising opportunities and job replacement. Forecasts suggest that computers could do the work of 140 million knowledge workers by 2025, while 30% of middle-income jobs could be eliminated (pdf) due to innovation in artificial intelligence.
The multiple crises and disasters in recent decades have highlighted unpredictability and volatility in the global economy, continued uncertainties and disruptions in people’s lives, and the vulnerability of development progress to external shocks. Against this backdrop, there is a challenge – and an opportunity – for a sophisticated policy response of preparedness, investment and cooperation.
The report points to four main factors that are crucial in addressing these trends: the importance of evidence in decision-making; policy coherence across the global goals and at different levels of policymaking and implementation; collective action to maximise the positive dynamics in these areas and minimise risk; and broad-based inclusive participation.

OK Chris; if it will make you happy, I will explain. It's a regular occurrence on here, that I see people asking other people if they're feeling OK, or if they're upset about something, at some random point in the conversation. This appears to be a rhetorical question, designed to make others following the discussion (the imagined ""audience"", no doubt) persuaded to the idea that there's something wrong with the person being asked. That perhaps this person is angry, and ranting, upset - and so not to be taken seriously. It's a method some people use to very subtly undermine confidence in their ""opponent"" to their own advantage. Hence the smiley face assures you, in advance, that I'm happy and calm. It is, as I said, a preventative measure, to stop others using this dubious device against me. :-)

Your ""original"" post is a simple distraction from the main question

No no, you've gone wrong immediately. There is no ""question"" in the first place. There is an article. I've written a comment relating to that, my original post. The idea of how forums work is that people write these original posts (OP is the commonly-used internet slang for the person who writes the original post in a thread, the Original Poster) so that others, who are interested in that particular topic, can choose to respond if they are interested. This is why you have the option to write out a new comment (original post) or ""reply"" to somebody else, beneath that original post.
So far from it being me who is distracting attention away from anything, it is actually the people responding under this original post (like yourself), who are distracting attention away from the original post, when they write posts such as you have done - which demonstrate no understanding of what I said in it, or which seek to change the subject onto something else. You see Chris, if you want to talk about something else, you can make your very own original post! The option is below the main article text.

Your statement ""There are no questions at hand"". Your ""original"" post is a simple distraction from the main question of warming's cause and effects which if it does not interest you, I really can't see why you come here. The minor matter of which frequencies play what roles at what depths is the diversion you are fixed on for some reason. If you deny that warming is happening on a global scale then you are at odds with the records and body of research on climate, oceanography, meteorology and glaciology. If you accept the scientific record then you have to propose a mechanism to explain the rapidity and extent of the climatic changes. 
But why should you worry about climate if it doesn't interest you? So which is it? Are you really convinced by a single claim about the limits of a single comment on some blog you linked? If so, you would have accepted that the incoming solar heat is bound to be part of the warmth affecting sea, land and ice and realized that the calculations of wavelength and depth on moving seawater must not have been adequately reproduced in whatever experiment was done.

You misrepresent me, Mrs M - I haven't acknowledged any point of yours.

No one seems to be able to offer any credible alternative explanation as to why the oceans are in fact warming.

Over the year, it snows more than it melts, but calving of icebergs also adds to the total mass budget of the ice sheet.

There are other sub-systems that looks they are doing the same at present, such as the GBR that now is bathing in a mean temperature that even a strong la nina can do little to fix other than temporarily. 
The most violent and rapid transitions known to us - DO-events - took decades if not a century to propagate even inside the hemisphere. Even when looking at data from the same depth in the same ice-core there are decade-scale transitions between different signals for the same event. 
This planet has a huge inertia. That we are actually witnessing these things on decadal time-scales at present is bewildering enough. 
In 1981 an influential paper was published in Nature called ""Detecting CO2-induced climatic change"". They hypothesised that it could be possible to notice AGW in natural systems (above natural variability) 20 years later - in year 2000. 
Now we are in 2017 and we are not ""possibly"" witnessing AGW in selected datasets. We are seeing everywhere. It is now being fingerprinted even in something as chaotic as in the atmosphere. We are eyeballing AGW from one decade to the next. 
There is no need for a year of inflection. We are living in it. 
If everyone on this planet steps on the breaking-pedal as hard as we can NOW there is a chance that this ""inflection"" is rested to a relative halt by the year 2100. When a cycle runs into a wall everything happens fast. With a train it takes minutes. With a planet it takes even longer. And we still have working brakes while we live through this crash. The only thing lacking is the will to push said brakes. 
All scientific knowledge tell us that the entire planet will NOT go into runaway mode if we act fast. Some sub-systems may have been partly or totally committed/lost for generations and centuries already. But that is not the same as saying we are on a wild ride into some sort of finite ending. It just means that the future has hopes of restoring much of it - after generations of pain. Breaking now reduce that future pain. Not braking now gives a wilful additional pain to the future because we do not bother. 
We have not crossed a line of no brakes. To think that is simply self pity and an excuse for not caring. 
Morally it is then better to say ""I waste CO2 on myself now because I want to make spices die out forever, and to make humanity to be in even more pain long after I am dead"". That is at least honest.

The water temperatures off the East coast of Australia have been going up with dramatic effects for the Great Barrier Reef. The overall ss-temperatures for the East Coast of the US seem to be rising. Perhaps you can give an example of falling temperatures in some waters. I would imagine the local effect of outlet glaciers calving would account for the cold anomalies off the southern tip of Greenland. 
The various frequencies of the spectrum and their effects on sea-surface temperatures should be a factor in warming among others but open seas clearly absorb more heat than ice covered ones. Current transportation would play a greater role in surface temperatures than the minor differences in frequency absorption in waters of different salinity.

This melting can be a problem, particularly if the melting ice starts its life on land. That’s because the melt water flows into the oceans, contributing to rising sea levels. Right now there are three main reasons that sea levels are rising. First, as ocean waters heat, they expand. Second, melting of ice in Antarctica flows into the ocean. Third, melting of ice on Greenland flows into the ocean. There is other melting, like mountain glaciers, but they are minor factors.
Okay, so how much is melting of Greenland contributing to sea level rise? Estimates are that about 270 gigatons of water per year are melting. The melting of an ice sheet like that atop Greenland can occur from the surface as air temperatures and sunlight warm the upper layer of ice. It can also occur from the edges as ice shelves collapse and fall into the oceans in large chunks.
For ice-shelf collapse, there’s a complex process that occurs at the bottom of the ice. Part of the ice is floating out over water and part of it is grounded on land. Warm water can get underneath the ice, lift it up, and melt the ice from below. 
The bedrock underneath the ice sheet is not flat or gradually changing. There are undulations that rise and fall and change the water-ice-ground connection. Topology called “retrograde” can make it easier for ice to melt and can increase the rate of ice shelf collapse. So, scientists have a real interest in learning about the topology of the land underneath ice sheets so they can better predict ice collapse and sea level rise. 
This brings us to a new study published by the American Geophysical Union in a journal called Geophysical Letters Review. The scientists use gravitometry to obtain a high-quality picture of the land underneath a very fast moving part of Greenland ice called the Jacobshavn Isbrae. Basically, the scientists flew gravity sensors across the ice at low altitudes and low velocity. These sensors are called accelerometers and they can be used to determine the x, y, and z gravity components. The measurements of the gravity allowed them to attain the local height of the subsurface with greater accuracy than previously known. 
As stated in the paper, the motivation for this work was clear: 
the fjord bathymetry and glacier bed topography of the lower portion of Jacobshavn Isbrae have remained poorly known. At least not sufficiently to provide reliable information for ice sheet numerical models. 
They found that the trough underneath the ice was not symmetrically shaped; the northern part of the trough was deeper than the southern part. Further, the trough was estimated to be 300-400 meters deeper than previously thought. They also showed that the trough is retrograde, which means that it favors a fast retreat of the glacier in the coming years and decades.
Greenland ice is a great analogy for the Earth’s climate. It has inertia, meaning it acts slowly but once it gets going, it’s hard to stop. When the Greenland ice sheet starts to go, it may take a while to melt but it is nearly impossible to stop. Predicting how fast this melt will take is interesting from a scientific vantage point but there are also enormous social and economic consequences. Right now, 150 million people live within a meter (3 feet) of today’s sea level. 
Greenland by itself has enough ice to cause many meters of sea level rise. If you live near the coast, the question of “when” is really important. This paper suggests that “when” may be sooner than we hoped.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/apr/14/new-study-shows-worrisome-signs-for-greenland-ice

May I suggest that the 'people-at-large' would have to step in in order to hinder unethical scientists from disseminating fake science? At the moment, without the people-at large stepping in, it is all too easy for unethical scientists to disseminate fake science. They are doing it regularly, practically all the time.
Essentially, thepeople-at-large would need to learn how to understand and use this 'systems thinking' in order successfully to hinder the unethical scientists from doing the dirty on science. 
'Systems thinking by the people-at-large became possible for the first time with the seminal contributions by the late John N. Warfield to 'systems modeling'. More information about Warfield's profound insights into systems modeling is available at http://www.jnwarfield.com and at the 'John N. Warfield Collection', held at the library of George Mason University where Warfield was Professor Emeritus - see http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=gmu/vifgm00008.xml;query=; . 
Unfortunately most systems scientists and all management 'scientists' failed to understand the implications of Warfield's insights into systems science, and his developments unfortunately lie largely unknown and unused today.
Some further developments from Warfield's inventions of practical tools for systems modeling now enable systems thinking by the people-at-large to be practiced on issues and problems confronted by them from day to day. 
In brief, these developments enable individuals and groups to choose any 'Mission' and learn how to integrate their available good ideas about the Mission to create Action Planning to help accomplish the chosen Mission. Any kind of 'feasible' Mission may be chosen, for example: ""To raise stronger barriers to the unethical scientists who seek to disseminate fake science"". 
These systems tools are understandable by any high-school student within a couple of hours and may be mastered sufficiently to put them to work on any Mission of interest within a couple of weeks (at most). I can demonstrate that systems thinking is in fact far easier to understand and practice than are 'the three Rs', which every high-school is expected to master before he/she passes out of school.

One does sincerely hope that the Union of Concerned Scientists would be successful in their laudable efforts.
The late John N. Warfield had developed highly practical and usable tools to enable systems modeling, which could lead to real systems thinking by the people-at-large, on issues relevant to their daily lives: individual issues; organisational issues; societal issues. For instance: just what may be the implications of concerns like global warming and climate change to the people-at-large?
More information about Warfield's seminal contributions to systems science is available at http://www.jnwarfield.com and at the 'John N. Warfield Collection', held at the library of George Mason University, where Warfield was Professor Emeritus - see http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=gmu/vifgm00008.xml;query=; . Unfortunately, most systems scientists and all management 'scientists' failed to understand the profound implications of I call 'Warfield modeling' - and his developments alas lie largely unknown and unused today. 
Why does not a progressive channel of news and views like the Guardian seek to understand just what such systems thinking by the people-at-large may be and then how precisely to enable how it may be learned and practiced, on the great many very real societal issues and problems we confront in all aspects of our lives?? 
For example, on the issues such as those the 'Union of Concerned Scientists' seeks to highlight in its 'March for Science'? (I personally would like to be a strong supporter of this March - but I do believe that such marches alone may not be sufficient to create the changes we must see in 'the way things are').', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1492471576000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'which', u'effect': u'real systems thinking by the people'}], u'author_id': u'17609202', u'in_reply_to': u'96725879', u'id': u'96733989', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'cidcid', u'text': u'BQSTART

We’ve had enough of Trump’s war on facts | Kenneth Kimmell,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/15/why-scientists-are-fighting-back-we-have-had-enough-of-trump-war-on-facts,0,"Next Saturday, in Washington, DC, and in hundreds of rallies around the world, scientists and their supporters will stage what is likely to be the largest gathering of its kind in history. The March for Science, an idea hatched by a few enthusiastic people on Reddit, has mobilised scientists and their supporters as never before.
As a colleague observed: “You know you’re in trouble when scientists take to the streets.” He’s right. I’ve worked closely with scientists for decades and, by training and temperament, they tend to be happiest in the lab, testing and retesting experiment results – among the last groups of people you might expect to find protesting.
So, why are they grabbing placards now? Because an unprecedented attack on science, scientists and evidence-based policymaking is underway in the US federal government.
Nowhere is the attack more ferocious than on the issue of global warming, where the Trump administration has taken a wrecking ball to the modest but important policies put in place by President Obama. First among them is the Obama administration’s signature Clean Power Plan, the nation’s first-ever limit on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, which Trump has vowed to repeal. He has also pledged to “reopen” (which could well mean “weaken”) hard-won vehicle fuel economy standards that have already begun lowering carbon emissions and oil consumption. Meanwhile, in a tragic example of wilful blindness, Trump has abolished a rule requiring federal agencies to consider how large federal projects affect climate change and how climate impacts, such as sea level rises and drought, might affect the long-term viability of the projects themselves. This is akin to erecting a building on a fault zone without considering earthquakes.
Thankfully, bureaucratic hurdles make it hard to accomplish these goals with a stroke of the president’s pen. But if the administration succeeds, it may increase by billions of tons the emission of global warming gases and other pollutants that endanger our health; burden our children with much higher costs of fighting climate change; cede the United States’ clean energy prominence to other countries and make it much harder to meet the goals the US set as part of the 2015 international Paris agreement on climate.
There is nothing subtle about Trump’s antipathy to science. As a candidate, he dismissed decades of established scientific evidence by calling global warming a “hoax” and he has displayed an unprecedented disregard for facts and evidence throughout his brief presidency, even on matters as trivial as the size of the crowd at his inauguration.
He picked cabinet members for crucial posts who prominently display their ignorance about or disdain for science. Scott Pruitt, his choice to lead the US Environmental Protection Agency, has stated publicly that he does not accept that carbon dioxide emissions are a primary cause of climate change. Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, thinks funding research on global warming is a waste of taxpayer dollars.
The anti-science approach extends far beyond climate science. In one of Pruitt’s first official acts, for example, he overruled the recommendation of his own agency’s scientists, based on years of meticulous research, to ban a pesticide shown to cause nerve damage, one that poses a clear risk to children, farmworkers and rural drinking water supplies. What’s more, Trump hasn’t even yet followed in the time-honoured tradition of appointing a presidential science adviser. His proposed budget cuts government science across the board, reducing vital research and data gathering on topics such as sustainable farming methods, weather prediction, the fate and transport of air pollutants and clean energy technologies.
The attack on science is coming not only from the Trump administration. Private groups, such as the fossil-fuel funded Heartland Institute, have mailed extraordinarily misleading booklets entitled Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming (sic), vowing to make sure that every school science teacher receives this disinformation presumably to weaken the consensus the climate change is real and burning fossil fuels is its primary cause.
Even more worrisome, Congress is using a radical tool called the Congressional Review Act to eliminate numerous public safeguards that took years to develop and is actively working to pass bills that make it harder for federal agencies to issue science-based safeguards for public health and safety. One bill, for example, would prevent academic scientists – but not industry-funded scientists – on federal advisory boards from weighing in on scientific issues within their expertise.These attacks are profoundly unacceptable to many scientists and collective outrage over them has propelled the March for Science and the People’s Climate March planned for the following Saturday.
Yet something even bigger also seems to be brewing. For a long time, many of us have believed that facts speak for themselves, and scientists could remain on the sidelines to avoid “politicising” their work. The recent election and its aftermath have clearly triggered a dramatic re-evaluation of these norms. We have learned – the hard way – that we can’t take respect for facts and science for granted and a large and growing “fact-based” community is rising up. This grouping includes those who rushed to airports to protest against the ban on Muslim immigration and the public and private attorneys who demonstrated in court that the policy had no facts to support it. It includes those who have packed town hall meetings to block a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and shown that the replacement bill fixed no problem at all (except perhaps the tax increases that were levied on the rich to pay for expanded healthcare).
This fact-based community includes journalists who are calling out falsehoods despite being branded enemies of the American people. It includes political leaders from both parties who have insisted upon a thorough investigation into allegations of Russian influence over the election and taken seriously the information assembled by career intelligence officials.
What unites these disparate acts is the principle that demonstrable facts and evidence – not fake news, alternative facts, supposition or innuendo – must form the backbone of public decisions. It is what separates a democracy from a theocracy, monarchy, or dictatorship, all forms of government in which “the truth” is whatever the ruler says it is.
My organisation, the Union of Concerned Scientists, with its more than 500,000 members and supporters, has joined with allies from the climate, environmental justice and labour movements to help organise both the March for Science and the People’s Climate March.
As the demonstrations are likely to show, an enormous number of people understand what is stake. The greatest attack on science in memory may wind up spurring the greatest mobilisation of scientists, and allies far and wide, we have ever seen.

When the reef was rocked by an unprecedented second mass bleaching event in the space of a year, the coral hardest-hit by heat stress lay mostly in the tourist-heavy latitudes between Cairns and Townsville.
But despite last year’s damage compounded by new cases dotted across 800 reefs in a 1,500km stretch, not a single reef tourism operator has been forced to seek out new ground to take visitors.
The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which licenses operators to visit designated reef sites, confirmed it has received one request to change a permit. And that was not because of bleaching but Cyclone Debbie further south, which damaged that other hub of reef tourism, the Whitsundays after it escaped the bleaching.
If we get another year of this, we’ll be in an absolute world of hurt
By an accident of geography, the tourist operators say, the most wondrous sites for public viewing, which tend to fall on the edge of the continental shelf near cooler, deeper waters, are the ones also spared the worst damage from bleaching.
For now at least.
“Look, if we get another year of this, we’ll be in an absolute world of hurt and I know that,” Col McKenzie, chief executive of the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators says.
Just 7% of the reef is set aside for tourism. But McKenzie says he is frustrated that “the story being put out there that there’s been severe bleaching throughout the whole area: it’s just not true”.
Aerial surveys released by scientists on 10 April showed back-to-back bleaching had occurred in a range along two-thirds of the world’s largest living structure. It indicated bleaching levels of more than 60% of coral this time were concentrated in reefs between Port Douglas and Townsville. It was the fourth mass bleaching to hit the reef in recorded history – all since 1998 – and coral scientists are alarmed the increasing regularity of these events gives stressed coral precious little chance to recover.
After last year’s bleaching, which killed off 22% of coral mainly in the isolated northern section of the reef, US magazine Outside went so far as to run an obituary on the reef: “25 million BC - 2016”.
The latest findings prompted further grim forecasts for the reef, which water quality expert Jon Brodie said was now in a “terminal stage”. 
While acknowledging significant bleaching in their region of the reef, tourism operators want this to be reported with more precision. For example, McKenzie says, there could be more emphasis on the fact bleached coral is not necessarily dead, and bleaching across two-thirds of the reef does not equate to two-thirds of the reef being entirely bleached.
McKenzie says the industry “can’t afford to lie” by talking up its designated sites and then showing tourists a place where “all the coral’s dead and there’s nothing but algae”.
“You will not have a business in 12 months. Social media will kill you. We have to tell people what’s there.”
The “smart operators” are highlighting the moderate cases of bleaching for tourists and talking about it, McKenzie says.
“But most of the tourists come back and they’ve seen this fluorescent coral and they’re really excited with how bright and vibrant it is. They don’t realise that that fluorescent coral is in the process of being very, very sick.” At least the fluorescent coral, as opposed to the more-stressed stark white coral, has a better chance of bouncing back, he says.
McKenzie’s concerns about the portrayal of a dying reef are shared by Claire Zwick, a former GBRMPA boat skipper and now co-owner of Coral Sea Dreaming in Cairns.
Coral Sea Dreaming has 28 permitted sites, the largest number of any Cairns operator, “a pretty cool thing to be able to boast”, Zwick says.
Even after the bleaching event of last year, as far as my eye can see, coral
Zwick, who did coral bleaching surveys in the past with GBRMPA, says some of those sites last year had 90% bleaching in stages 1 to 3, with “the hardest hit being our middle reef sites” closer to shore from the continental shelf. 
She estimates her staff saw 1-3% of corals averaged across their sites die last year, with similar levels of bleaching this year.
But she wants the world to know that “the reef is still alive and beautiful”.
From her company’s prized mooring at Michaelmus Cay, for example, she says she can see “100% coral cover – magic”.
“That was even after the bleaching event of last year, as far as my eye can see, coral.”
Zwick is a self-described conservationist who is very concerned about the climate impact of Adani’s proposed north Queensland coalmine and hopes it does not go ahead.
She was among more than 170 businesses and individuals who signed an open letter to the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, calling for the scrapping of the mine and urgent climate change action after last year’s bleaching.
Zwick wants climate change action not just on coal exports but in energy use in Australian households.
Her grave concern is that while some corals prove resilient to warmer seas, the “butterfly effect” of others dying off will trigger “a huge reduction in richness of species on the reef”.
“While everyone can sit here and say, ‘The reef’s fine, it can withstand it’ – well, yeah, it can, but they’re not looking at the big picture.”
But Zwick says reef tourism operators have a “pretty weak voice” politically. This is in part because the industry is largely made up of small to medium businesses where “everybody’s working seven days a week and it’s really hard to fit in a political agenda”, she says.
Tony Fontes, a Whitsundays reef tour operator who also signed the open letter to Turnbull, says the industry can only wish it had the influence of the mining lobby when it comes to decisions that affect the reef.
But with $5.2bn in income and 64,000 jobs attributed to the reef, the tourism industry could gain a large amount of sway “if they could get their act together and jump and down as a unit”, Fontes says.
“It’s just a matter of getting them to operate together, that’s like herding bunch of cats,” he says.
Meanwhile, Fontes, like many others in the Whitsundays, is busy “mopping up my house” as the Easter tourism season sinks into oblivion with visitors staying away in droves in the cyclone’s wake.
“It’s going to be hard to catch up,” he says. 
Despite the bleaching, and dire forecasts of the reef’s survival, visitors keep coming in record numbers.
The past year saw those escorted into the marine park by a commercial operator – as recorded in the number of people paying their $6.50 environmental management levy – again top 2 million, according to the Queensland Tourism Industry Council.
The council’s chief executive, Daniel Gschwind, says the reef is now “possibly more famous than Australia”.
“Everybody has heard of it, most people want to come and visit some time, many people report fond memories of it,” he says.
We’re not shy about showing visitors what it can look like
“I can’t readily think of many more iconic landscapes, or seascapes, than the reef.”
Gschwind says it is not “an excuse or a defence” for not grappling with the conservation imperative to point out that “some reefs being visited are to an extent affected by bleaching but not to the point where you wouldn’t take visitors anymore”. 
“In fact, we’re not shy about showing visitors what it can look like. 
“We are very committed to the conservation of the reef but we clearly also want to make sure that the information and the description of the bleaching is accurate and not deterring visitors from continuing to visit.
“And also, by the way, not discourage people from continuing to put the effort into conservation and reach the conclusion that all is lost, we might as well give up.”
The QTIC has joined forces with environmental groups and the National Farmers Federation to lobby the federal government for more funding for reef conservation by pitching the reef as economic infrastructure that requires significant upkeep.
Gschwind says he would like to think the tourism industry now has a louder voice in Canberra on the reef given its well-publicised environmental damage is “hard to ignore and hard to hide”.
This would only grow louder if another bleaching event follows closely, for example.
“We should have a political voice on behalf of the community because what we defend is a public asset,” he says.
Gschwind acknowledges the future for tourism industry also points towards advocacy on global climate goals.
“The reef is often referred to as the canary in the mine shaft and I think we have an opportunity, if not an obligation, to encourage the global community to do the right thing not just to keep the reef alive but to allow us all to continue living on this planet, because the reef is only an indicator of what’s in store for all of us if we don’t get it right.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/17/great-barrier-reef-tourism-caught-between-commerce-and-conservation-alarm

BQEND
1/ He does say ""an almost unbroken line"", which pretty obviously means broken in places. I agree this is a bit suss since the break is almost all of the Great Australian Bight, which is a fair chunk of coastline.
2/ However, he is talking about the coast from Monkey Mia and down around and back up to Mackay. Over that stretch, and excepting the Bight, it is true to say that annual rainfall has dropped by as much as 100mm. He doesn't say ""100 mm everywhere"" so I'm not quite sure what you're complaining about. And the areas that are drying are highly significant: West Australian wheat belt, several state capitals, etc.
Except for the typo, which should obviously be millimetres instead of millilitres. But you can always email him and ask for a correction there. I'm sure he'd be happy to do that.
3/ The ""one 30mm sq image"" is clickable, and expands to a whacking great PNG. As I'm sure you know, or you wouldn't have been able to see any of the detail you commented on.

 Try following the links..
BQEND There was no ""link"" to the temp in ""This one shows that....."" so that's very sloppy journalism and unhelpful.
OK, I found the ""map"" Hamish alluded to by myself. one 30mm sq image in the middle of everything else? That's not a valid ""ref"", that's an excuse for a ref. 
Besides you're still wrong. His text does not match linked images given. 
This is the historical precipitation map. Annual rainfall has dropped, it shows, across this enormous stretch of coastline, by as much as 100 millilitres since 1951. That's not a true accurate representation of the ""image/data"" at all. IT shows over +25% of the coastline rainfall increasing. Barely 5% of the coast shows anything near 100mm decrease in rainfall. 
And if that isn't enough his quote says millilitres .. like wtf is that typo all about, if it isn't ""poor journalism"" by default? 
His ""images"" refs are very poor journalism imho. My comment about his article stands, especially You wont stop Adani on ridiculous assumptions. or sloppy un-referenced ""emotive"" science writing that SWITCHES THE FOCUS onto if but maybe in 2100.

Apart from that, it's a mix of what seppowatcher and Goosifer said. The project was planned, and money started being sunk into it, back when it really would have been lucrative. Since money has been sunk into it, it's on the books as an asset. Naturally they are reluctant to write this off until they really have to.

This is the historical precipitation map. Annual rainfall has dropped, it shows, across this enormous stretch of coastline, by as much as 100 millilitres since 1951.
In another map, concentric rings of increasingly angry red emanate from the centre of the continent. This one shows that, assuming we keep going as we are, the temperature in our country will increase by as much as 5C by the end of the century. Eight, if we’re unlucky. 
This, by the way, is not the marketing material of some lefty environmental organisation. This is the product of thousands of the world’s top climate scientists, using some of the most sophisticated computer models ever built, to generate projections so fine-grained they simulate even the amount of moisture in every parcel of soil on the planet, and in the poles, the thickness of every chunk of sea ice. 
These models give a glimpse of the Australia we are creating. They show the nation’s wheatbelts, from Esperance to the Wimmera, dried to a crisp. They show the Queensland coast being thrashed more relentlessly by fiercer storms. They show a rash of summer bushfires that make Black Saturday look like candles on a cake. But they do not show the reef. By the end of the century, we will have boiled it to death. 
This is the Australia we are creating. Even more, it is the Australia we will have to accept if the Adani mine is approved. 
Research published last year by four Oxford economists and scientists concluded that to keep climate change to below 2C, no new coal plants can be built after 2017 unless they have zero emissions. That means perfectly efficient carbon capture and storage would have to be deployed on every coal plant in the world – an absurd fantasy.
The paper also finds we already have in place sufficient “capital stock” – the global network of mines and electricity generators – to push us over 2C. At the same time, global coal demand has already peaked and is now falling, China and India have frozen construction on over 100 coal plants, and the economics of energy are pointing only in one direction: renewables. 
This points to a stark lose-lose equation for potential new mines like Adani’s: either we burn their coal and induce dangerous climate change, or we don’t and waste billions of dollars. 
Unless, of course, we take the third option: don’t build the thing. This is not, then, just another coalmine. It is a turning point. If we build Adani, we commit to irreparably harming Australia’s precious environment. If we don’t, we might still have a chance to save it. This is where we as a nation decide if we will be Asia’s rockpit for another 50 years, or a prosperous nation for the next 500. 
Research just released shows that to avoid dangerous climate change, we need anthropogenic emissions to halve every decade. Building the biggest coalmine in history, when there is already a global glut and sufficient investment to tip us over the edge, is not what responsible conservative governments should be doing. They should be conserving all that is precious to us. Serving us. Instead, they are preparing to betray us. 
If the world in 2077 is still burning as much coal as we are today, and the financial model of the Adani assumes it will, Australia as we know it – our wheatbelts, our reefs, our cities, and our lifestyles – will cease to exist. 
Our government, sworn to protect the nation, should be doing everything it can to avert this looming crisis, not be falling over themselves to pay for the executioner’s bullet. If the government approves this monstrous mine, and the banks fund it, it will be committing environmental treason against every Australian who values our farmers, our coasts, our bush, and our way of life. We are about to choose Adani or Australia. 
The argument against Adani achieves that rare distinction of finding purchase among all parts of society: patriots and cosmopolitans, environmentalists and economists, parochialists and internationalists, the job-hungry regions and the growth-hungry cities. We must all stop this affront to our nation. We must choose Australia.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/17/adani-is-not-just-another-coalmine-it-is-a-turning-point-for-the-nation

You're ignorantly thinking of number of children as number of children who reach maturity. There's more than one number involved. There is birth rate, infant mortality, and child morality, as well as overall average lifespan, that make up the rate of population growth. It's a function of living and dying. 
Families is the past had larger families BECAUSE many of those children never reached maturity. They'd have 5, 6,.. 8, even 10 children just in order to ensure their genetic line continued. And often that would be the father and multiple wives because more than one of the wives would end up dying in childbirth.
Humans in modern developed nations have less than 2 children per couple because (a) they have a reasonable assurance that their children will reach maturity, (b) women wait until later in life to have children, and (c) many women choose to not have children altogether.
Humans in developing nations don't have these health assurances and education, and often lack access to birth control. Thus they naturally tend to have more children. It was the same in the US only a generation or two earlier. (My own grandmother had 7 children, adopted another, and lost two of them within her lifetime.)
If you look at Africa, or any other area of the world with people living at a sustenance level, they're not starving (say, New Guinea). They continue to reproduce. Women are fertile. But they continue to have high birth rates because of infant and child mortality rates.

The behavior of large and complex aggregates of elementary particles, it turns out, is not to be understood in terms of a simple extrapolation of the properties of a few particles. Instead, at each level of complexity entirely new properties appear, and the understanding of the new behaviors requires research which I think is as fundamental in its nature as any other. That is, it seems to me that one may array the sciences roughly linearly in a hierarchy, according to the idea: The elementary entities of science X obey the laws of science Y ... But this hierarchy does not imply that science X is ""just applied Y*"".

You may fetishise narrow aspects of physics, but professional physicists these days appear to have stopped doing so. Following Anderson there is no need for the generalization/law of 'supply and demand' to be part of physics because it is dealing with a different level of scale and complexity.
Again, are you are suggesting that when more people want a limited supply of good the exchange value will not change, that competition for said resource will stay the same? Can you give one or two examples of this happening (must be an essential resource because we are talking about food here)?

It was probably actually disease, infant mortality and occasional famines that probably did it. An organism that is too underfed to breed is unlikely to last so long unless they can access enough food that then enables them to breed again - and humans can breed quite well even in adverse conditions.
If your plan is to restrict food supply so that people are too weak to biologically reproduce then they are going to be dying at a very high rate if they are under those conditions long term (immune system weakness and malnutrition). Production rate will also fall with all these people dying and being very weak, facilitating more starvation.

Look, it's pretty simple really. AGW has not been proven. It is a theory. 
There are many problems with the AGW theory. One can point at CO2 lagging behind temperatures. One can point to the periods where there was higher CO2 and lower temps, one can point to data being ""adjusted"" without informing us of the adjustments. One can point to data being left out that doesn't fit with what is being put forth. One can look at the method that the believers use to silence anyone that disagrees. One can point out that AGW research gets FAR more money than has been given to any research to the contrary. One can point out that the arguments regarding what has happened in the past rarely show how precise those measurements are (not only in number of years in each point but also in how accurate each proxies data can be expected to be). One can point out that our planet has NEVER been where it is now in regards to location in the universe. One can point out that CO2 is one of the least effective greenhouse gasses, while water vapor is one of the most effective and the most abundant greenhouse gas. One can point out that none of the predictions that have been made have come to fruition (remember at one point scientists said we would be in an Ice age by now). One could ask questions regarding the impact of the magnetosphere on climate and how the regular flipping of the magnetic poles interacts with solar winds. One could point out that the decreasing power of the magnetosphere would increase the amount of solar energy being absorbed by the planet. One could point out that our solar system is in a new (apparently higher energy) portion of space. I even read one article where a physicist ran the math and stated that it was impossible for the current model to be correct. 
The heart of the question is does man harm the environment. That is a simple to answer question. Yes. We can see that in the smog that hung around the cities before the clean air act.

What I am trying to say is that incremental change to where we need to be was possible 25 years ago. Averting global suicide is still possible, but we no longer have the luxury of incremental change, which I have demonstrated is a myth.
If you watch the video I linked to, the Union of Concerned Scientists talked about aiming for a 20% reduction in carbon emissions by 2000. They saw this as quite a modest target and a compromise, but entirely possible with the technology which existed 25 years ago, whilst maintaining economic growth. The reality is that instead of reducing carbon emissions by 20%, we greatly increased our carbon emissions by 2000, and carried on increasing carbon emissions thereafter.
The consequence of this is that a vast amount of extra carbon emissions have been emitted into the atmosphere. Our whole economy and society has become ever more reliant on profligate energy use and the burning off fossil fuels. This makes effectively addressing the problem a massively much bigger task.
Once again, the original plan was incremental reductions of our carbon emissions and a slow changeover to renewables, more energy efficiency etc. This would be a fine plan if this is what had been happening. Instead those in charge of our economies pressed the pedal to the metal increasing carbon emissions.
The rationale i.e. the justification of our leaders for hugely upping our industrial production and concomitant carbon emissions was that we were building up wealth to address the causes of climate change and to rapidly switch to carbon neutral energy sources. Where is this big pool of wealth to do this? According to what we were told 20-25 years ago, there should by now be some massive pool of wealth where we can finance this rapid changeover necessary. The reality is that the world's billionaires have got much, much wealthier by a massive amount. It is crystal clear what this was about, and it was the biggest swindle and fraud in history. 
I am doing this because I want positive change, and not a catastrophic collapse of our economy and therefore our organized society, which is what will happen if we don't get realistic pretty soon. The longer we put off taking urgent action, the bigger the task. Incremental change will no longer solve the problem. It would of solved the problem if we had started actually implementing this incremental change when we were supposed to of. This is not doom and gloom, it is reality.
As I keep saying, there a many different forms of denial. The most insidious type of denial, is convincing ourselves we have got the problem in hand, when we have not.
Ideas such as you can't say this because it's ""doom and gloom"" or it's ""alarmism"" are the reason we've been heading further up the creek with a paddle, and not doing what is necessary.

The authors found that on our current path, by mid-century humans will be causing the fastest climate change in approximately 50 million years, and if we burn all available fossil fuels, we’ll cause the fastest change in the entire 420 million year record.
The study relates to a scientific conundrum known as the “faint young sun paradox” – that early in Earth’s history, solar output was 30% less intense than it is today, and yet the planet was warm enough to have a liquid ocean. A stronger greenhouse effect due to higher carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere may be one explanation.
Over time, solar output has grown stronger, and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have fallen due to an effect known as “weathering” of rocks and an increase in plant life. The authors of this study found that over the past 420 million years, the slow heating of the sun and slow decline of the greenhouse effect have roughly offset each other, leading to a fairly stable long-term global climate.
In particular, as shown in the first chart above, Earth’s climate has been fairly stable over the past several million years. The wiggles in the blue line represent transitions in and out of ice ages, due to wobbles in the Earth’s orbit around the sun, amplified by changes in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (these are known as Milankovich cycles).
The bottom frame in the chart shows the change in forcing (global energy imbalance) caused by the combination of changes in solar activity and the greenhouse effect. When the line is flat, the Earth’s energy balance is stable, and thus so is its climate. When there’s a steep change, something is upsetting that balance and causing a rapid climate change. The five colored lines toward the end of the chart show potential pathways we’ll follow, depending on how much fossil fuels humans burn over the coming decades.
In every case the line is already quite steep due to the hundreds of billions of tons of carbon pollution humans have dumped into the atmosphere thus far. The size of the global energy imbalance we’ve caused is already on par with those previous blue wiggles – Earth’s ice age transitions. If we keep burning lots of fossil fuels, we could soon cause higher carbon dioxide levels and faster climate change than the Earth has seen in 50 million years. If we burn all available fossil fuel reserves (the black “Wink12k” line), we’ll see faster climate change than in the entire 420 million year record.
It’s an alarming proposition. Climate deniers will often argue against taking action to curb carbon pollution because climate changed naturally in the past and carbon dioxide levels were higher in the past. One Republican congressman repeated these talking points in the latest House “Science” committee hearing. While both arguments are technically true, they miss several important points. 
First, the rate at which we’re currently causing climate change is alarmingly fast – much faster than in most natural climate change events. Second, similar past rapid climate changes have caused mass extinction events. Third, the sun’s cooler past helped keep temperatures lower. 
As renowned climate scientist Wallace Broecker once said, “The climate system is an angry beast, and we are poking at it with sticks.”
As this new study shows, our poking sticks are getting bigger and bigger, and we’re poking the beast faster and faster. Meanwhile, climate deniers are egging us on because the beast has been angered in the past, and we’re not sure just how soon it will decide to maul us.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/apr/17/humans-on-the-verge-of-causing-earths-fastest-climate-change-in-50m-years

BQSTART
A pervasive, tight correlation between CO2 and temperature is found both at coarse (10 my timescales) and fine resolutions up to the temporal limits of the data set (million-year timescales), indicating that CO2, operating in combination with many other factors such as solar luminosity and paleogeography, has imparted strong control over global temperatures for much of the Phanerozoic.

Regardless of what changes take place I believe it is the fact that they are happening so quickly compared with natural climate change that is the problem. Species cannot adapt to rapid changes in climate and that may include the human species.
Tackling anthropomorphic climate change is humanities biggest challenge. It is something we all must engage. We can make a difference as individuals. We should pressure our political representatives on these issues. Changing our own lives makes a difference as well as we become ambassadors for having a smaller carbon footprint.

From an article titled Tail Risk vs Alarmism, by Dr. Kerry Emanuel, the Cecil and Ida Green professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he has been on the faculty since 1981.
“The accusation of “alarmism” is quite effective in making scientists skittish in conveying tail risk, and talking about the tail of the distribution is a sure recipe to be so labelled.”
And from an article in the NY Times titled The Secrets in Greenland's Ice Sheet, where the journalist is speaking with the NASA glaciologist Eric Rignot:
“When I mentioned that some climate scientists had told me in confidence over the years that they held more pessimistic views than they felt comfortable expressing in public, Rignot shrugged with a smile and said, ‘‘They are chicken.’’”

The abrupt and unexpected disappearance of the Slims river, which spanned up to 150 metres at its widest points, is the first observed case of “river piracy”, in which the flow of one river is suddenly diverted into another.
For hundreds of years, the Slims carried meltwater northwards from the vast Kaskawulsh glacier in Canada’s Yukon territory into the Kluane river, then into the Yukon river towards the Bering Sea. But in spring 2016, a period of intense melting of the glacier meant the drainage gradient was tipped in favour of a second river, redirecting the meltwater to the Gulf of Alaska, thousands of miles from its original destination.
The continental-scale rearrangement was documented by a team of scientists who had been monitoring the incremental retreat of the glacier for years. But on a 2016 fieldwork expedition they were confronted with a landscape that had been radically transformed.
“We went to the area intending to continue our measurements in the Slims river, but found the riverbed more or less dry,” said James Best, a geologist at the University of Illinois. “The delta top that we’d been sailing over in a small boat was now a dust storm. In terms of landscape change it was incredibly dramatic.”
Dan Shugar, a geoscientist at the University of Washington Tacoma and the paper’s lead author, added: “The water was somewhat treacherous to approach, because you’re walking on these old river sediments that were really goopy and would suck you in. And day by day we could see the water level dropping.”
The team flew a helicopter over the glacier and used drones to investigate what was happening in the other valley, which is less accessible.
“We found that all of the water that was coming out from the front of the glacier, rather than it being split between two rivers, it was going into just one,” said Best.
While the Slims had been reduced to a mere trickle, the reverse had happened to the south-flowing Alsek river, a popular whitewater rafting river that is a Unesco world heritage site. The previous year, the two rivers had been comparable in size, but the Alsek was now 60 to 70 times larger than the Slims, flow measurements revealed.
The data also showed how abrupt the change had been, with the Slims’ flow dropping precipitously from the 26 to 29 May 2016.
Geologists have previously found evidence of river piracy having taken place in the distant past. “But nobody to our knowledge has documented it happening in our lifetimes,” said Shugar. “People had looked at the geological record, thousands or millions of years ago, not the 21st century, where it’s happening under our noses.”
Prof Lonnie Thompson, a paleoclimatologist at Ohio State University who was not involved in the work, said the observations highlight how incremental temperature increases can produce sudden and drastic environmental impacts. “There are definitely thresholds which, once passed in nature, everything abruptly changes,” he said.
Between 1956 and 2007, the Kaskawulsh glacier retreated by 600-700m. In 2016, there was a sudden acceleration of the retreat, and the pulse of meltwater led to a new channel being carved through a large ice field. The new channel was able to deliver water to the Alsek’s tributary whose steeper gradient resulted in the Slims headwater being suddenly rerouted along a new southwards trajectory.
In a geological instant, the local landscape was redrawn.
Where the Slims once flowed, Dall sheep from Kluane National Park are now making their way down to eat the fresh vegetation, venturing into territory where they can legally be hunted. The formerly clear air is now often turned into a dusty haze as powerful winds whip up the exposed riverbed sediment. Fish populations are being redistributed and lake chemistry is being altered. Waterfront land, which includes the small communities of Burwash Landing and Destruction Bay, is now further from shore.
A statistical analysis, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, suggests that the dramatic changes can almost certainly be attributed to anthropogenic climate change. The calculations put chance of the piracy having occured due to natural variability at 0.5%. “So it’s 99.5% that it occurred due to warming over the industrial era,” said Best.
The Yukon region is extremely sparsely inhabited, but future river piracy could have catastrophic effects on towns, villages and ecosystems that have sprung up around available water, according to an analysis accompanying the paper, by Rachel Headley, a geologist at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside. “If a river changes course so drastically that the drainage basin no longer reaches its original outlet, this change might eventually impact human and biological communities that have grown around the river’s original outlet,” she said.
Thompson, who has documented glacial retreat on Mount Kilimanjaro, predicts that there will be an acceleration in the observations of river piracy events as glaciers retreat globally. 
“I think we could see similar divergence in streams in the Himalayas as well as throughout the Third Pole region, the Andes of Peru, other sites in northern Canada and Alaska,” he said. “Often these events occur in remote and poor parts of our planet and thus go largely unnoticed by the larger population but greatly impact the livelihood of many families downstream.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/17/receding-glacier-causes-immense-canadian-river-to-vanish-in-four-days-climate-change

The March for Science, a demonstration modeled in part on January’s huge Women’s March, will inundate Washington DC’s national mall with a jumble of marine biologists, birdwatchers, climate researchers and others enraged by what they see as an assault by Trump’s administration upon evidence-based thinking and scientists themselves.
The march is a visceral response to a presidency that has set about the evisceration of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and many of its science-based rules, the dismissal of basic climate change tenets by the president and his appointees and a proposed budget that would remove around $7bn from science programs, ranging from cancer research to oceanography to Nasa’s monitoring of the Earth.
Many scientists at federal agencies, concerned their work may be sidelined or censored for political purposes, will take the unusual step of publicly damning the administration. 
“It’s important for scientists to get out of the lab and talk about what’s important,” said Andrew Rosenberg, who spent a decade at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and is now at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “You don’t check your citizenship at the door when you get a PhD. No one would tell an architect they can’t have a view on HUD [the Department of Housing and Urban Development]. That would be nonsense.”
Rosenberg said younger scientists, in particular, are increasingly rejecting a stance of studied silence when faced with what they see as threats to their profession.
“They don’t accept that they have to wait until tenure, comfortable in a lab to maybe then speak out,” he said. “Academia is less appealing to many of them these days, so they want to know how they can have an impact now. They aren’t content that people will just read their papers in academic journals. I think retreating to your lab and hoping it will all go away is not going to be the best strategy.”
The idea to march was first tossed around on a Reddit thread in January. One of those on the discussion, University of Texas postdoctoral fellow Jonathan Berman, decided to put the idea into motion. A day or two after being set up, a Facebook page promoting the march had attracted more than 300,0000 members. 
The march now has dozens of people grappling with the logistics of the DC march and more than 500 companion events around the world. More than 100 organizations have lent their support, including the institutional heft of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world’s largest general scientific organization, and the American Geophysical Union. 
Retreating to your lab and hoping it will all go away is not going to be the best strategy
In March, Bill Nye, the bow-tied embodiment of science for many Americans, and Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician who alerted the world to soaring levels of lead in the blood of children in Flint, Michigan, were named as honorary co-chairs.
Organizers won’t commit to an expected number of protestors but are downplaying expectations that it will be anywhere near the scale of the Women’s March. The tone is expected to waver between pro-science and anti-Trump. The march will dovetail with the People’s Climate March, which will take place a week later.
Signs reading “Make America Smart Again” and “What do we want? Evidence-based policy. When do we want it? After peer review” are expected to make an appearance at the science march. Copies of the Lorax will be handed out. There may well be a sea of brain-like knitted hats.
“There will be plenty of ridiculous signs, it will be a lot of fun with serious moments too,” said Ayana Johnson, a marine biologist who became an organizer after seeing fellow scientists downloading climate data in case the administration removed it from public view. “I found that horrifying. That for me was the real alarm, but everyone has their own story.”
The satellite marches around the world suggest Trump isn’t the sole cause of scientists’ unease. Globally, there is a “trend of anti-intellectualism”, said Johnson, where politicians play to voters’ base emotions rather than provide evidence-based policy. 
“We have gotten ourselves into this situation because the public doesn’t understand how science benefits us in our everyday lives,” Johnson admitted. “We haven’t done a good job communicating the value of the work we do.”
Some scientists, while sharing much of the anguish of the marchers, have questioned whether a protest in the heart of DC will in fact be counterproductive. Trump is probably more likely to respond to the march with an angry tweet than rethink cuts to cancer research, while Republicans who believe scientists are merely green-tinged activists with fancy titles will feel vindicated.
“The march won’t change any minds in the Trump administration and it won’t convince rural and working class America that science is relevant to their lives,” said Robert Young, an expert in coastal geology at Western Carolina University.
We're in this situation because the public doesn’t understand how science benefits us in our everyday lives
“The march is on Earth Day, which plays into conservative and climate skeptic thinking that scientists are just environmentalists. Just watch how it will be covered by Fox News and conservative bloggers.”
Young said he doesn’t think scientists should just “sit on their hands” and is similarly troubled that, for example, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt doesn’t accept the widespread understanding that carbon dioxide is a primary driver of global warming.
“But we’ve convinced all the people we are going to convince,” Young said. “We can march and shout our heads off, but that won’t engage with people who have not bought the message. 
“We need more face-to-face interaction in local communities. We should do AM radio talkshows. That can be quite a challenge, but that’s the radio that my family and my wife’s family listen to and they are regular working-class Americans. We need to meet these folks where they live.”
While the public largely tells pollsters that it supports scientists and their work, there is underlying friction. Innovations in technology have helped drive automation of some jobs, while our ever-improving understanding of our environment has led to restrictions on some polluting industries. Trump tapped into this simmering angst and scientists’ challenge may well be explaining how their breakthroughs can help all of us.
The March for Science “will exacerbate rather than address these tensions” according to Jason Lloyd, a program manager for the Consortium for Science, Policy, &amp; Outcomes at Arizona State University.
“The biggest issue confronting science is not a malicious and incompetent executive,” Lloyd wrote for Slate. “The critical challenge ... is figuring out how scientists can build an enduring relationship with all segments of the American public, so that discounting, defunding or vilifying scientists’ important work is politically intolerable.”
Even some of the march’s supporters concede that the event won’t change administration thinking overnight. But even people who specialize in cool, rational thinking occasionally need to wail their frustration.
“Scientists are very worried that we are losing science from the public sphere,” said Rosenberg. “I don’t think these events will prove a turning point but in Congress and in the states this will matter. Our representatives need to know that voters care about science.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/18/donald-trumps-march-for-science-washington-climate-change

Here is a quick introduction for interested laypeople. 
https://geosci.uchicago.edu/~rtp1/papers/PhysTodayRT2011.pdf
If you can not do that - the standing theory wins and you will lose every time. Also because this theory allows the magic of microwave ovens, for example. You not liking the fact that CO2 is exited by infrared radiation does not allow the magic of microwave popcorn. 
Microwave popcorn will win this argument every day. Even the majority of non-scientists will agree - you must first figure out how we can keep microwave popcorn before your argument that the understanding of the radiative transfer theory is a misunderstanding/lie will gain traction. 
This is the problem that much of the sceptical arguments face. They must falsify the science of AGW without taking microwave popcorn (and a ""few"" other things) away from humanity. 
Anything proving that microwave popcorn is a scientific lie is obviously wrong based on lots of observations - but it is also evil since it makes astronomy more or less blind. 
This is the challenge: Not only are you claiming that climate scientists are lying, you are also claiming that astronomers and popcorn-eaters are lying. If you succeed in your falsification you may end up as the least popular person ever. 
If you are successful in making no action to emissions and your argument that micro-popcorn is impossible is wrong, you risk to be even more unpopular as an entire planet's climate system goes giddy up by following the laws of physics. 
It is finally important that you remember that there is nothing artificial about how the climate responds. The climate system does not ""blame"" or consider where the forcing comes from. The climate system is in essence here doing one thing - sort out the regions being in positive and in negative radiation balance constrained by a planet that rotates and with a peculiar distribution of oceans and continents.

- anti-nuclear- anti-GM- and a vaccine ""sceptic""
As a second example, Robert Kennedy Jr. led the campaign to close the Indian Point nuclear power station, and he's also an anti-vaccine crackpot who's lined up to lead Donald Trump's vaccine ""safety"" commission, where he'll be applying the same pseudoscientific thinking to vaccines that he's applied to nuclear.

* proximity of beer* Will wear a back-pack at all times (a high number in urban settings will be ortlieb water-proof back-packs, padded for laptop). * hiking boots or teva sandals with high frequency. If not - any other type of shoes will be sensible and comfortable. * shorts in any temperature above freezing.* t-shirts. Or fleece if below zero. Will have gore-tex jacket that is totally beaten up and wearer will be happy to tell where and when different clay-stains where obtained. Some will wear a down-jacket even at high temperatures, simply because said jacket has become a part of their anatomy. * Everyone with a natural stride length of exactly one meter in any terrain after years of field-surveying. * If you see someone in the group with comfortable trousers and shoes, jacket, shirt and strangely mismatched tie you must also pay attention. Chances are that you have spotted an Earth Scientist who has been to a formal meeting. * Also notice that you may see a surprisingly high number of females. Much higher than you would normally consider for a group of physical scientists. This should not confuse you, as Earth Science has among the most gender-balanced work-forces in physical science. Notice that they as their male colleges wear comfortable shoes, allowing for an instant climb of a mountain/wading of a river/crossing of a glacier suddenly would be necessary. 
If you see all of the above in a group at the 22nd - you have spotted Earth Scientists in the wild. Notice that they seems to be busy talking intensely to each others in small groups - and how it looks to be completely unrelated to why they are gathered in a larger group. 
* If near a multi-lained highway and you see a whole group wearing what is mentioned above crossing the road at risk of own lives - you have witnessed a group of Earth Scientists on excursion or field-course. Nominally to look at the outcrops on both sides of said road. On the 22nd they are more likely to be migrating to a march with the same lack of attention for own safety. * Someone standing on some view-point, peak, hilltop, next to a river or on a bench in Central Park pointing. This is an Earth scientist explaining how the landscape were formed. Probably talking about thalweg sinuosity or Penck-planation, hanging valleys or whatever being in view. * They have a tendency to turn into the wind and mutter words like ""katabatic, inversion, convective, occluding (etc)"" or on happy days shout ""Föhn!"" while facing said wind. * Someone sitting with laptop at cafe (with beer) and typing very strange code in white letters on a whole lot of different windows with black background and producing lots and lots of amateurish looking plots. Most likely an Earth Scientist - but be aware - this can also be a game-programmer.
White lab-coats are never seen in the wild. 
I hope this little list will help to identify scientists marching for freedom of facts without political intervention on the 22nd. 
PS - look for caps. And sunglasses attached to chums. There will also be a high number of really flimsy-looking small shoulder-bags around in all sorts of colours and shapes. If you dare to approach them, these flimsy-looking things will have some logo on them - and then a lot of text that barely can be read any longer. Usually reading ""European geophysical union assembly - Nice, France 1998"" or something similar. 
See something like this? Go and give them a thumbs up or a hug. Or even better - join them.

We are at risk of pushing our climate system toward abrupt, unpredictable, and potentially irreversible changes with highly damaging impacts. 
Earth’s climate is on a path to warm beyond the range of what has been experienced over the past millions of years.
The range of uncertainty for the warming along the current emissions path is wide enough to encompass massively disruptive consequences to societies and ecosystems: as global temperatures rise, there is a real risk, however small, that one or more critical parts of the Earth’s climate system will experience abrupt, unpredictable and potentially irreversible changes. 
Disturbingly, scientists do not know how much warming is required to trigger such changes to the climate system.

So you are unhappy with the level of certainty of climate science. Let me tell you, uncertainty is not our friend and here's why.
From a conversation a couple of months ago with Michael Mann and the glaciologist Richard Alley, see below. A few comments by Alley:
BQSTART
If we don’t change our ways we’re expecting something like 3 feet of sea level rise in the next century, and it could be 2 and it could be 4 and it could be 20. 
The chance that we will cross thresholds that commit us to loss of big chunks of West Antarctica and huge sea level rise is real.
So when you start doing “Well you’re not sure,” but there’s a chance of really bad things and the uncertainties are mostly on the bad side, could be a little better or a little worse or a lot worse, but we’ll be breaking things.

Until recently the last 10-12,000 years were remarkably stable and roughly coincided with the development of agriculture, cities and civilization. I’m not saying that relatively stable climate is necessary for civilization, but it is interesting that the two time periods roughly coincide.
For much of the roughly 200,000 years that modern humans have been around, prior to the above period, you can see large climate oscillations which were driven by very weak orbital forcings.

What began as a small Facebook group in the US capital, Washington DC has spiralled into a global phenomenon that will now see marches and other events in more than 500 locations around the world, from Seattle to Seoul.
It is great news that so many people are prepared to stand up and defend the need for evidence-based thinking and the scientific method. But it is also a sad comment on our times that a March for Science is needed at all. Post-truth populism has infected democracies around the world, scientific objectivity is under threat from multiple sources and there seems a real danger of falling into a modern dystopian dark age.
It is clear that the old days of scientists staying in the lab, publishing papers in scholarly journals, and otherwise letting the facts speak for themselves are over. As the Harvard science historian Naomi Oreskes reminds us: “The facts don’t speak for themselves because we live in a world where so many people are trying to silence facts.” In her book, Merchants of Doubt, Oreskes wrote about these efforts from the tobacco industry onwards; science denialist attempts that are paralleled in today’s climate sceptic, anti-vaccine and anti-GMO movements.
These campaigners against truth take great pains to deny the existence of scientific consensus on their different issues. The fact that 97% of the peer-reviewed literature on climate change supports the consensus that most of global warming is human-induced is dismissed as mere elitism. But as Dr Sarah Evanega, director of the Alliance for Science at Cornell, writes: “The values we defend are those of the Enlightenment, not the establishment.” Expertise is real, and we reject it at our peril. 
Perhaps the most inspiring aspect of the March for Science, and what may prove to be its most enduring legacy, is its truly global nature. Science is not western; it is everywhere and for everyone. I have worked with Alliance for Science colleagues to help get marches off the ground in Bangladesh, Nigeria, Uganda, Venezuela, Chile and other places. In between long Skype calls about logistics, fundraising, and media outreach I watched the lights flash on as the number of marches on the global map kept on increasing. It was like watching the world light up with knowledge.
Bangladesh March for Science’s lead organiser Arif Hossain says: “I am marching to let the world know that we are united for science in Bangladesh. We have 160 million people to feed in the changed climate, and together we will make a better day with science and innovation.”
Although the issues of most concern vary in different locations, appreciation of the need for science is global. As Nkechi Isaac, an organiser of the March for Science in Abuja, Nigeria, says: “Science is revolutionary. It holds the key to constant development and improvement for addressing climate change, food shortage and challenges in medicine. Science holds the solution to our food security.”
Nigerians can testify to the tragic effects of anti-science activism. Efforts to eradicate polio in the country were held up for years because of conspiracy theories spread by those suspicious of modern medicine and vaccines. People die when science is denied. 
So here’s what we will be marching for. It’s time to enter the post-post-truth era. And there is no time to lose.

Trump’s top advisers were set to meet on Tuesday to provide the president with a recommendation ahead of a G7 meeting in May. However, a White House official said the meeting had been postponed due to conflicting schedules. It is unclear when it will now take place.
Trump has already signed executive orders to start the demolition of the clean power plan, throw open federal land to coal mining, and halt new vehicle emissions standards but has so far not acted on his campaign pledge to “cancel” the Paris compromise.
His aides are understood to be split on whether the US should stay in the voluntary agreement, which was fully ratified last year. Barack Obama pledged that the US would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% by 2025, based on 2005 levels, as part of a landmark global effort that for the first time required emissions reduction goals from all nations, including the large developing emitters China and India.
Trump’s adviser Steve Bannon and the Environmental Protection Agency head, Scott Pruitt, are both in favour of ditching the Paris agreement. Last week, Pruitt called the agreement a “bad deal” for the US that imposes a burden that other countries do not have to bear. 
However, the weight of opinion may be in favour of those who support the agreement. Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, both advisers to the president, have positioned themselves as defenders of the agreement, while Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, has supported the idea of “keeping a seat at the table”. Other advisers at the meeting were expected to include Rick Perry, the energy secretary; Gary Cohen, an economic adviser; and HR McMaster, the national security adviser.
Support for the Paris deal has come from seemingly unlikely quarters – the oil giant ExxonMobil wrote to the White House to advocate it as an “effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change”. BP and Shell have also previously endorsed the Paris deal, along with dozens of other businesses including Gap, General Mills and the Kellogg Company. 
A group of Republicans in Congress also warned against withdrawing from the agreement. The Florida congressman Carlos Curbelo, in his role as co-chair of the Climate Solutions Caucus, said it was “imperative that we maintain our seat at the table”.
“The world’s leading nations must work together to not only reduce the impact carbon emissions have on climate change, but also mitigate and prepare for the effects, which communities like ours are dealing with every day,” Curbelo said in a joint statement with Ted Deutch, a Democrat who is his fellow co-chair. 
“It’s our hope the administration will take a responsible approach on this issue.” 
Proponents of remaining in the deal cite the severe diplomatic fallout of leaving, which could damage the US position on other issues, as well as the imperative to cut emissions to avoid dangerous climate change.
“Withdrawing from the Paris agreement would send a clear message that America is an unreliable partner that fails to live up to its commitments,” said Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, chief program officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group.
Withdrawing ... would send a clear message that America is an unreliable partner that fails to live up to commitments
 “It will also handicap the competitiveness of American businesses in clean energy – a $1.3tn yearly global market. It is essential that the US not withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.”
Conservative and free market groups have rallied to urge Trump to follow through with his pledge to exit the agreement. Among those organizations is the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian thinktank that includes Myron Ebell, who was part of Trump’s EPA transition team. The group has launched an online ad that tells Trump: “Don’t listen to the swamp. Keep your promise. Withdraw from the Paris climate treaty.” 
If Trump decides to exit the deal, it will require a three-year notice period before the process begins. In order to speed up the process, he could remove the US from the overall UN climate change framework or submit the deal to the Senate to be ratified as a treaty, where it will probably fail. 
A third, and perhaps most likely, option is to remain in the agreement in name only, retaining a modicum of US prestige abroad while dismantling Obama-era rules designed to reduce emissions. The US will face no penalty for not meeting its emissions targets, although some other countries have raised the possibility of imposing a “carbon tariff” on American goods.
Regardless of whether the US stays within the Paris deal, its chances of making deep cuts in its emissions have receded since Trump took office. Without the clean power plan, more stringent emissions standards on vehicles and gas and oil drilling operations or any sort of tax on greenhouse gases – a plan recently floated by some Republicans – the US will pull back from the effort to help avoid more severe heatwaves, droughts, the disappearance of coral reefs and coastal inundation.
“Regardless of what Trump does on Paris, he has abrogated our position,” said Tom Steyer, a leading hedge fund manager and climate campaigner. “This is an administration trying as hard as possible to bring back coal mining; they have given up American leadership on energy and climate. They have already walked away.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/18/trump-paris-climate-agreement-climate-change

Derwin is investing up to $2m in an effort to persuade Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, to speak out against Donald Trump’s climate change policy and resign from his positions in groups advising Trump on business and manufacturing jobs. On Monday, Derwin launched the website ElonDumpTrump.com laying out his argument that Musk’s role in the administration is inconsistent with his role as a leader on climate change.
Full page ads will run in the New York Times, Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle and San Jose Mercury News on Sunday. Television ads will air during Morning Joe, Meet the Press and Full Frontal with Samantha Bee. Over the past month, Derwin has deployed mobile billboards around the offices of Musk’s various companies with messages including “Elon: The Trump Won’t Wash Off” and “SpaceX: Is Mars Worth Global Warming Here?”
He is also asking owners of Tesla vehicles to sign a petition and send personal messages to Musk. Those on the waitlist for Tesla’s coveted vehicles are encouraged to withdraw – an action Derwin took when he learned of Musk’s ties to Trump. (Derwin said that he lost his deposit and donated the $150,000 cost of the car to the American Civil Liberties Union.)
So far, Derwin estimates that he has spent $750,000 on the campaign. If Musk accedes to his demands, he has pledged to donate $1m to a charity of Musk’s choice. 
The Elon Dump Trump campaign is just one of several nascent efforts to pressure the tech industry to push back against the Trump administration, but it may be the best funded. Derwin said he experienced a windfall due to the post-election stock market rally. 
“Donald Trump’s election has made me a lot of money,” he said. “I consider that blood money. I’ll use it to oppose Trump.” 
While Derwin thinks that Trump’s presidency is “a travesty” on multiple levels, he is particularly outraged by his rollback of climate change regulations. The fact that Musk has posed for photo-ops with Trump is particularly galling, Derwin said, because Musk is “recognized as being a leader on climate change”. 
“I want Musk to speak up against Donald Trump’s climate change policies,” he said. “His failure to do so sends the message that it’s not really a big deal and not worth his time.” 
Though Musk has yet to respond to Derwin’s call, Tesla is certainly paying attention. Sam Teller, director of the office of the CEO at SpaceX and Tesla, contacted Derwin by phone after his billboards started popping up. 
Teller told Derwin that Musk’s “sincerity shouldn’t be questioned” on climate change, and that speaking out against him was the wrong thing to do, according to Derwin. Last week, Derwin was invited to a meeting at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, where he sat down with Teller, Tesla general counsel Todd Maron, and Tesla’s vice-president of business development, Diarmuid O’Connell. 
Though Derwin voluntarily agreed to keep the contents of the meeting confidential, he did say that “it didn’t accomplish anything”. As for the presence of Maron, Derwin said, “I was a lawyer and still am … When you take a lawyer to a meeting like that, it’s intended to send a signal.”
Tesla did not respond to repeated inquiries about its interactions with Derwin. Asked for comment on Musk’s view of Trump’s climate change policy, a Tesla spokesman initially shared a statement by Musk from early February, when he was first under pressure to withdraw from Trump’s business advisory group.
On Wednesday, a Tesla spokesman provided the following additional statement: “It’s quite ironic that the reason being given for attacking Elon is to help the environment. Tesla’s entire reason for existing is to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. If someone wants to spend money to promote a pro-environment objective, we can think of better ways to do that than attacking the people who are most committed to that very purpose. Mr Derwin believes those who want a more sustainable future should not have a seat at the table. We obviously disagree.”
In the weeks since Musk met with Trump, the president has rolled back fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, signed an executive order to undo Barack Obama’s clean power plan, and proposed a budget that would gut the Environmental Protection Agency’s climate change, pollution and energy efficiency programs.

Terrorist groups will exploit the natural disasters and water and food shortages expected to result from climate change and allow them to recruit more easily, operate more freely and control civilian populations, argues the report by Berlin thinktank Adelphi.
“Terrorist groups are increasingly using natural resources – such as water – as a weapon of war, controlling access to it, and further compounding, and exacerbating resource scarcities,” Lukas Rüttinger writes in the report, titled Insurgency, Terrorism and Organised Crime in a Warming World.
“The scarcer resources become, the more power is given to those who control them, especially in regions where people are particularly reliant on natural resources for their livelihoods.
“As climate change affects food security and the availability of water and land, affected people will become more vulnerable not only to negative climate impacts but also to recruitment by terrorist groups offering alternative livelihoods and economic incentives.”
The Adelphi report cites several examples where the impacts of climate change are already spurring or exacerbating terrorism.
In the drought-ravaged region around Lake Chad in central Africa, food and water shortages, near-economic collapse, and weak governments are providing a ripe recruiting ground for Islamist fundamentalist group Boko Haram.
“In north-eastern Nigeria, the region closest to Lake Chad and where Boko Haram is strongest, 71.5% of the population live in poverty and more than 50% are malnourished … This kind of economic deprivation provides an ideal breeding ground for recruitment by Boko Haram.”
In Syria, the now six-year civil war and rise of Isis was, not caused, but exacerbated by one of the worst and widest droughts in the country’s history, which drove hundreds of thousands from the land, and sent millions into extreme poverty and food insecurity.
Isis is using water as a weapon of war, the report argues, controlling dams to harm enemies and expand its own territory. 
“In 2015, Islamic State closed the gates of the Ramadi dam to more easily attack regime forces further downstream. Weaponisation of water can also take the form of using it as a source of funding by taxing it, as Isis did in Raqqa. In other instances, Isis did not cut the supply, but rather used water to flood land in order to expel people from their homes.”
And in Afghanistan, a country riven by internecine conflicts and acutely vulnerable to climate change, more than half of local conflicts are over land and water. Diminishing rainfall and advancing desertification are likely to spark further violent clashes between nomads and pastoralists over access to pastures and water and food.
Rüttinger told the Guardian climate change alone did not cause terrorism, but “creates an environment where terrorism can thrive” and exacerbates existing tensions and conflicts.
Former US deputy undersecretary of defence Sherri Goodman told the Guardian this month that climate change was a “threat multiplier” for unstable regions around the world, but that its impacts would be felt globally, and by countries distant from the source conflict.
“Climate is a threat multiplier because it aggravates others tensions and conflicts that already exist.”
Militaries around the world, across the Americas, UK, Europe, and the Asia Pacific, have highlighted the “threat multiplier” impact of climate change and extreme weather events.
The Global Military Advisory Council on Climate Change has warned the impact of global warming will drive massive refugee movements of an “unimaginable scale”, and that climate represents “the greatest security threat of the 21st century”.
The US secretary of defence, James Matthis, told his confirmation hearing in January climate change posed a real and current security threat to American troops.
“Climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today. It is appropriate for the combatant commands to incorporate drivers of instability that impact the security environment in their areas into their planning.”
In March, the United Nations, in passing a resolution on the Lake Chad crisis, emphasised the “interconnectedness” of the climate and security challenges in the region, emphasising “the adverse effects of climate change and ecological changes among other factors on the stability of the region”.

Since then a UK-wide warning system has been put in place that will inform people when the temperature is likely to exceed 30C for a day and a night. Weather forecast warnings of an imminent heatwave ask that vulnerable people take steps to keep cool.
Hospitals and care homes are supposed to provide a “cool room” for those most at risk. The last such warning was given in August 2016.
But scientists are concerned that this is nowhere near enough to protect the public because, even in moderately warm weather, some places can become dangerously hot. Researchers at Loughborough University forecast: “Overheating in UK homes is a public health disaster waiting to happen.”
They say this is partly because the government has concentrated its regulations on insulating homes to keep people warm in winter, thereby making them more likely to overheat in summer. This plus poor design of houses and more high-rise building has made many homes uncomfortably warm even in mild summers. Tests show that hospital wards and homes for the elderly are among the most dangerous places in a heatwave.
Loughborough says new regulations are required to improve design. This means providing easy-to-open windows and shading to keep out the sun. A public education plan is also needed so people know to open windows at night to let in cool air and close them during the day to keep the heat out.

I say 'illogicality' for TWO reasons.
First, just because a Bad Man (eg the CEO of an energy conglomerate) says something you don't like - but which serves HIS purpose - it doesn't mean that he HAS to be lying (even though he MAY well be). To suggest otherwise is to adopt the mindset of the nursery playground. When the Nazis attributed the Katyn Forest massacre of Polish officers to the Russians, nobody believed them, either (arguably, for good reason).
Moral: sometimes even Bad Men speak the Truth.
Second, and more importantly, you would EXPECT that same CEO to attack the science behind Global Warming Alarmism, whether it was bogus OR genuine:
If it was GENUINE - he would attack it because it threatened the Corporation's profits, possibly enlisting the aid of scientists to provide a counter-argument.

Calm down, Dear - or you'll burst a blood vessel.
Despite the near-hysteria in your tone, I actually agree with that sentiment.
It's just that it applies to those people BEHIND the Great Global Warming Fraud, rather than the RATIONAL and FEARLESS scientists opposing it.
At least you didn't mention the dread (non-scientific) term 'consensus' , much beloved of the late Great Thinker and Global Science expert B Obama (America's first half-white President - lest you've already forgotten). 
Which is a bit of a pity, frankly, for Climate Realists such as myself (who see Pollution as an ENORMOUS problem, but the vanishingly small effect of CO2, harmless but vital, as NO 'problem' at all).
Why 'a pity' ? Because whenever these dolts mention a 'consensus', they have no idea that such a thing - even were it not inherently INIMICAL to the thinking behind the Scientific Method - doesn't even exist (in the way they like to pretend it does).
But perhaps you think that people like Willy Soon and David Legates are taking money from our Dark Masters ?
(NOT a very 'scientific' argument)
Wrong again, for it is people like YOU - fundamentally decent but misguided - who are the ones helping to facilitate an authoritarian Global Governance, justified by a non-existent Global Threat.

The concept of AGW is a scientific paradigm, like plate tectonics or evolution.
The concept that global warming is being caused by human activity has - like other scientific paradigms - :
....... coherence - consilience - and - consensus ......
Coherence - a theory that coherently explains the multiple observed lines of empirical evidence across multiple aspects of the climate system.
Consilience - the predicted and projected changes being confirmed across multiple scientific disciplines observing the multiple aspects of the climate system.
Consensus - agreement amongst scientific researchers from many different academic disciplines that the first two C's are correct, and that no alternate theory can adequately explain this.
AGW is now like plate tectonics, it's an over-arching concept (a paradigm) that frames how science deals with specific phenomena in the behaviour of certain earth systems.
Concepts become scientific theories by the accumulation of evidence that can only be explained in one way.
Any other idea would need to explain at least as much evidence in a different way.
Which would include the huge mass of evidence from the geological record.
To falsify the ""climate paradigm"", so-called climate sceptics need to find enough evidence that does not fit the paradigm, publish it in peer-reviewed research papers in the professional literature, and propose a new paradigm that fits all the old and new evidence.
So-called climate sceptics don't even bother to try doing that.

Of course he refused to appoint a Minister of Science after his chum, Sophie Mirabella, a fellow climate change denier, lost her seat yet that loss was in fact a gain for Australian science since she would have been an even greater disaster for the sciences and the institutions like the universities and the CSIRO than the absence of a Minister for Science.Not to be outdone, Barnaby Joyce has set about destroying the science-based Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority and not surprisingly the chief executive, Dr. Kareena Arthy has resigned after saying in senate estimates in February that one in five regulatory scientists had already quit the APVMA as it forged ahead with the move away from Canberra.Similarly, in October 2016, Dr. Paul Grimes, then head of the Department of Agriculture, (Joyce's Ministry) resigned following, as Dr. Grimes said in a letter to Joyce ""a breakdown in our working relationship"". Joyce was clearly unwilling to tolerate a highly qualified public servant who disagreed with him on central matters such as climate change and kicked him out.Abbott and Joyce have used their positions of authority to deliberately undermine the credibility of science with statements such as Abbott's notorious ""climate change is crap"", ""carbon dioxide is weightless"" and ""I am, as you know, hugely unconvinced by the so-called settled science on climate change"" etc while Joyce has said to Andrew Bolt that “Look….I just – I’m always sceptical of the idea that the way that anybody’s going to change the climate – and I’m driving in this morning and we’re driving through a frost – is with bureaucrats and taxes.“All that does is….it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy.

So Abbott as Prime Minister says that science is crap while Joyce as Deputy Prime Minister says that scientists have created a myth about climate change in order to line their pockets.Is it any wonder that the stupid and credulous have their doubts about the value of science when the so-called leaders of the country say that science is rubbish conducted by frauds?', u'recommendation_count': u'11', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1492755073000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'12900980', u'id': u'96983957', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'jilliL', u'text': u'Just for the record, this is about way more than climate change - or even environmental protection.

Instead of taking a principled opposition on the grounds of science, he said, the Labor party would probably do a photo opportunity pouring the concrete.
“In 1983, Labor was pushed to take a bit of a stand because it thought the issue was important,” he said. “Now I think Labor would do it the other way. Jobs are the thing.”
Jones, who is now an honorary professor at Melbourne University and a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science, the Australian College of Educators, Australian Academy of Humanities, Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia, and the Australian Society of Technological Sciences and Engineering, will speak at the global March for Science in Melbourne on Saturday.
He told Guardian Australia he was marching in support of the scientific method and in support of rational thought and evidence as things that still mattered in society.
Jones said politics had shifted to the point where science and facts were considered to be of equal or lesser value than opinions and intuition, and of considerably less value than potential votes. 
“I always thought that higher levels of education and access to technology would have such a dramatic impact that people would then look at the world in a different way,” he said. “They would be more thoughtful, more engaged. In fact, it hasn’t been like that.
“The big question for a lot of people now is: how do you feel about something? It’s not ‘what are the objective facts’, it’s ‘how do you feel about climate change?’ And people say, ‘Oh, well, I don’t think I like it because if I have to pay more for fuel that will be a bad thing.’
“When you have a conflict between politics and science, politics is always going to win.”
Twelve Australian cities are participating in the global march, beginning with Launceston at 10.30am then Brisbane, Townsville and Canberra at 11am. 
The march in Sydney will begin at 12pm at Martin Place while marchers in Melbourne will gather at the State Library of Victoria at 1pm.
The speakers in Sydney will include the former Liberal party leader and Q&amp;A favourite Dr John Hewson, along with public health professor Simon Chapman and prominent feminist academic Eva Cox.
Peter Ellerton, a lecturer in critical thinking for the University of Queensland, told Guardian Australia he would be marching in Brisbane because “the credibility of science as a way of interpreting the world is under threat”.
“You have always had an anti-intelligentsia undercurrent, or some sense in which people imagine that their own thinking is sufficient to determine these truths for themselves, and they don’t need this body of work to tell them otherwise,” Ellerton said.
In recent years, he said, that had become more overt. “There’s a move away from evidence-based policy in general, politically.
“What we have is a whole bunch of people who promote reasons why we don’t have to accept science. There’s a whole industry … it’s like some people think it seems sexy to say that you are a sceptic.”
The problem, Ellerton said, was that there were two steps to being a sceptic. 
“The first is to doubt and question, and the second is to listen to the answer,” he said. “Sometimes that requires some intellectual hard yards and I think some people who call themselves sceptics don’t want to do those hard yards. Calling themselves sceptics is a badge of honour they haven’t earned.”
The global March for Science began as a thread on Reddit and is modelled on January’s massive Women’s March. 
Thousands of scientists are expected to march on the national mall in Washington DC on 22 April, which is also Earth Day and, coincidentally, the first day of World Penguin Weekend. 
Marches are expected to be held in at least 54 countries.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/21/facts-over-feelings-australians-join-global-march-for-science

Humans aren’t sufficiently coded — genetically, culturally or technologically — to pass natural selection tests in environs undergoing exponentially accelerating complexity for X number of years. X approaches … that is, think we lose the selection arms race with accruing complexity; we are unable navigate the alien, ever-unprecedented environs that complexity continues to generate.
The New Natural Selection TestsNatural selection tests have become more complex for many species. Genetic codes remain on the exam; human culture codes have been added.

However, methane makes up only 7% or so of that volume, human farts add 210M liters of methane per day...of course 9% is CO2, so that adds another 270M liters of greenhouse gases per day, or ~175B liters per year.
So I suppose I'd have to say that besides the fossil fuels contributions we make to global warming, farts add their share, too, although apparently termites have us beat by a large margin.

This is not saying that the agriculture sector is not important. 15% for all that feeds all humans (in essence) is a big sector. And awareness about it is important and deserves attention. And there are large low-hanging fruits to be collected in terms of cuts to methane. Rice production, for example - a lot to be gathered with simple means.

Are you claiming to be a sceptic on climate change?
The concept of AGW is a scientific paradigm, like plate tectonics or evolution.
The concept that global warming is being caused by human activity has - like other scientific paradigms - :
....... coherence - consilience - and - consensus ......
Coherence - a theory that coherently explains the multiple observed lines of empirical evidence across multiple aspects of the climate system.
Consilience - the predicted and projected changes being confirmed across multiple scientific disciplines observing the multiple aspects of the climate system.
Consensus - agreement amongst scientific researchers from many different academic disciplines that the first two C's are correct, and that no alternate theory can adequately explain this.
AGW is now like plate tectonics, it's an over-arching concept (a paradigm) that frames how science deals with specific phenomena in the behaviour of certain earth systems.
Concepts become scientific theories by the accumulation of evidence that can only be explained in one way.
Any other idea would need to explain at least as much evidence in a different way.
Which would include the huge mass of evidence from the geological record.
To falsify the ""climate paradigm"", so-called climate sceptics need to find enough evidence that does not fit the paradigm, publish it in peer-reviewed research papers in the professional literature, and propose a new paradigm that fits all the old and new evidence.
So-called climate sceptics don't even bother to try doing that.
Professor Russell Coope, who was the first to discover abrupt climate change events in the geological record of the 'ice age', said that people are messing with the trigger that causes climate change, and the consequences are likely to be 'ferocious'.

An El Niño is “characterized by unusually warm ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific.” El Niños generally lead to global temperature records, as the short-term El Niño warming adds to the underlying long-term global warming trend (see top chart).

A human-induced hothouse climate?

Here's a key quote from the Conclusions:
BQSTART
The likely cool greenhouse in which about half of Antarctica is still ice-covered means devastation from the tens of meters sea level is likely to rise (e.g., Ward, 2010), and poleward shifting of warm climate belts.
BQEND
So the appropriate term for what's likely to happen is a 'cool greenhouse', which sounds harmless, but is not.
It's a very interesting paper, and we need to remember that nothing like this has happened in the time of modern humans.
How quickly?

a cool greenhouse seems imminent within perhaps a century or two.

Big Oil is determined to drain every last dirty drop of oil it can from the earth and to hell with the dangers that come with doing so. The nuclear reactors are all aging and in need of costly replacement and were a bad idea to begin with as they made nuclear weapons possible along with disastrous meltdowns. What happened to the residents of Fukushima and their governments awful response to it, will be causing cancers that could've been avoided.

This week we learned that it fell victim to “river piracy” – and climate change was almost certainly to blame.
The river – which stretched up to 150 meters at its widest points and averaged depths around three meters – lost its water source to another nearby river during a period of intense melting affecting one of Canada’s largest glaciers. As a result, the Slims was reduced to a trickle in less than a week. 
We can now add river piracy to the growing list of unexpected, dramatic and tragic consequences of human-caused climate change. Although this is the first observed case of river piracy, it likely won’t be the last. 
The melting of Yukon’s massive Kaskawulsh glacier – known to the local Southern Tutchone First Nation as Tänshī – caused the drainage gradient to tip in favour of the second river, redirecting the meltwater to the Gulf of Alaska, thousands of miles from its original destination. 
The science says there’s a 99.5% chance that climate change caused this dramatic transformation of the landscape. The continuing warming trend that caused the glacier to thin so extremely means the change is likely irreversible.
Such a rapid transformation of the river alters more than just the physical geography and ecosystems of one of Canada’s most majestic and ecologically sensitive regions. It also affects local Indigenous communities. 
Residents near Kluane Lake, which the Slims river used to feed, reported water level changes immediately after the river’s disappearance. The lake is now about three meters lower than normal, and is in jeopardy of being cut off from its own outflows — making traditional food for the Kluane people, such as trout and whitefish, much harder to find.
Climate change’s extreme impacts are obvious to communities throughout the north, from documented hunting season changes and wildlife migrations to rising coastlines and drunken forests, where trees now lean into rivers as permafrost melts and land gives way. 
We’ve seen images of climate change shrinking the world’s glaciers before, which is worrying, if you consider that these glaciers are like bank accounts: they store snow and ice during cool, wet weather and release water when an area needs it most, during hot, dry summers or droughts. 
When nature’s thresholds are passed, everything changes. Landscapes are radically transformed in the blink of an eye. In this case, river piracy is a dramatic reminder that the consequences of climate change are often unpredictable. 
It’s also proof that climate change isn’t a problem of the future. It’s happening now. We’re seeing the increasing effects of climate change every day.
So, what to do about this dismal assessment?
We must transition our economies quickly and decisively away from fossil fuels to renewable energy, and governments must play leadership roles to make this happen. 
We must move forward with a common understanding that we are embedded in the natural world, and what we do to our surroundings, we do to ourselves.
I was part of the wave of hope that ushered in Justin Trudeau as Canada’s prime minister in 2015. I applauded Canada’s commitments to the Paris agreement, especially our country’s push to limit the average global temperature increase to 1.5C. 
But since Paris, Prime Minister Trudeau has approved two oil pipelines and one of Canada’s largest carbon dioxide-emitting liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, virtually ensuring that Canada will not meet its own climate targets. 
As the new US president works to dismantle hard-won climate initiatives south of our border, a clear and effective approach to climate change in Canada is more important than ever.
Making deep reductions in carbon emissions can’t wait until 2050. Humans are the dominant force on the planet, and we’re causing unprecedented impacts. Human-caused climate change is making events like hurricanes, floods and droughts stronger and more frequent. 
I believe there’s still hope. Nature has the ability to continue to shock us. If we pull back and give nature room to recover, it may surprise us.
So who are the pirates? In the case of the Slims, certainly not the second river, and certainly not nature. We are the pirates, and we’re robbing ourselves. If we don’t act on climate change now, we’re stealing the prospect of a clean and healthy planet from ourselves, our children and generations to come.

Currently we have solar cells being manufactured in China often using coal as their source of energy. It makes zero sense to put those cells first in places that aren't at the top of the heap in potential. The reason there is a build out right now in Seattle and London is entirely due to misallocation due to tax incentives.

You might even argue for micro-grids where a neighbourhood was able to share power between homes so that if one had high demand from cooking a roast and others got in take out everyone could have power. Of course if everyone has an Easter ham or a Christmas goose on the same day, trouble. 
But we've got a lot of troubles if we look at our goals and this gridless solar with storage idea. We want to switch many of our cars to run on electric power, so the in home power needs for recharging vehicles will increase. We also want to convert our home heating to heat pump technology, at least in places where that is feasible, because this reduces natural gas and heating oil use. Air conditioning is mostly needed when the sun is out and could run directly on the solar panels but home heating would likely peak before dawn or at least be in the dark during the cold months. That would need storage.

If your whole house is automated, I could imagine that the roast in the oven doesn't turn on at the same times as the refrigerator to reduce peaks. But this still assumes you aren't running a long term deficit, long term being however long the batteries last.

BQEND
Hardly, I think you have some gaps in your understanding of economics.
I think you are confusing the fact that we had solar PV and wind power technologies 40 years ago with the idea that it would have made economic sense to attempt to switch to them from fossil fuels.
40 years ago takes us to 1977, when solar PV cost $76/W. Going further back you begin to talk $1000s/W
Let's go with your suggestion that we could realistically have started building out large scale solar PV as one part of a substitution of fossil fuels. Ignoring issues of intermittency and storage, 100GW of solar PV capacity at 10% c.f. would have cost us of the order of $7.6trillion.
40 years later, module costs are at $0.30/W, and the same putative 10GW of continuous generation would now cost us $30billion, a rather more realistic number, no?
It has taken that 40 years to get us down the solar PV cost curve - it couldn't have happened much quicker, just as Intel could not have delivered processor chips much faster than Moore's 'law' anticipated.
There is a similar story with wind power and Li-ion batteries, and no amount of wishful thinking would have accelerated their development. Only now Tesla is building a 'giga-factory' to make billions of Panasonic Li-ion cells, 26 years after their commercial introduction, are costs anywhere near the $100/kWh level. Only with the development of 6 & 8GW specialised machines has offshore wind begun to approach a cost anywhere near new nuclear power.

BQEND
Yes, after the two oil-price hikes and the coal industry strikes it seemed a good idea at the time, but that moment disappeared.
North Sea oil began to flow; OPEC lost much of its power as other non-OPEC countries in addition to the UK came on-stream; oil hit $10/barrel; Thatcher beat the NUM and the Tories launched the 'dash for gas'. Any serious action on global warming lay far into the future at that point.
The fact remains that however regrettable the delay, from 2008 onwards the UK has invested very large amounts of money into building out a serious wind and solar capacity and has begun the process of removing coal from our electricity mix. as we learn how to incorporate a steadily rising proportion of renewables. 
You can protest that this is not good enough as much as you like, but this UK milestone is still significant and will carry weight far beyond anything that Costa Rica or others have done in the eyes of grid engineers facing a similar mix to the UK's and with an economy a similar size or bigger than the UK's.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1492955244000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'1317478', u'in_reply_to': u'97130600', u'id': u'97136589', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'desconocido', u'text': u'BQSTART

only reason renewables are comparatively expensive is because of lack of direct investment
BQEND
I agree with that, in principle, but my view is that simply throwing more $billions at the problem in a shorter period of years would not have gotten us engineering solutions any quicker. I.e. that the lack of investment is simply due to the time that we have had available to us.
It has taken time, and $billions spent world-wide, to bring solar PV modules from $1,000s/W down to < $1/W.
It has taken time, and $billions spent world-wide, to take wind turbines up from 250kW to 10MW.
It is taking time, and $billions spent world-wide, to develop offshore wind so that it costs less than nuclear power.
It is taking time, and $billions spent world-wide, to bring battery storage towards $100/kWh (at which point EVs become competitive with ICEVs)
Yes, the rate of current investment in actual capacity doesn't come close to what is needed yet, but all the trends are pointing to the fact that at some point before 2030 all of this investment will yield solutions that are more than competitive with fossil-fuelled alternatives (and very likely nuclear ones too). At that point the rate of investment can be dramatically increased.
Long before that point, it will be impossible to raise finance for fossil-fuelled alternatives, because bankers can read spread-sheets as well as any engineer can, so a tipping point will occur a little ahead of the cost curves, perhaps as early as 2020 (there is some evidence of this happening now, with increasing numbers of banks refusing to support coal generation projects)
So I am, as ever, optimistic about the direction of travel.

You seem to have gaps in your history of engineering and I am probably a few years older than you at a guess although much of the technology still pre-dates me.
*40 years ago - we technically had the technology to do away with fossil fuels. This is the time when most of the breakthroughs were made and it came specifically from having spent $bn to move the technology forward to solve the problems due to political turmoil threatening oil supplies
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis
*30 years ago - at this point many of the break throughs had been turned into working power plants and we would have seen a significant move towards but for a change in the politics.
The development from 40 years ago had also seen an expansion into searching for more fossil fuels. It also saw the advent of free market globalisation and the beginning of the end of the cold war. A choice was made to expand the use of fossil fuels. If there had been a further energy crisis though it is likely that the $tns pumped into FF expansion would have continued into green energy
*20 years ago - at this point we had basically established all of the key engineering steps that we would be discussing for Today's energy solutions when scaled up. We were all aware of climate change.
- At this point computer chip development had made the process of purifying Si for PV fully feasible and it was becoming the PV of choice and implemented on actual homes.
- We had Li -ion batteres being used for portable devices
- we had an operational commercial scale offshore wind for years
-csp + storage, hydro, tidal, nuclear also long established technologies
*10 years ago  - at this point we finally saw a country start to show the benefits of economy of scale as China started going into mass production for PV, wind was already close to what it is today
About the only technological advances recently have nothing to do with energy solutions that we are discussing.

Let us look at this from an actual engineering perspective which is problem solving.
Just in terms of the energy generation if we already had the infrastructure built to be zero intrinsic CO2e for operation then just to maintain this level at a conservative estimate would be:
Replacement rate:
10GW / yr wind 4 GW / yr PV
Assuming all longer term infrastructure would be built eventually in the time. Unless you can show that we exceed this level of production or clear plans to then you cannot view current construction sufficient to decarbonise the economy.
And we are currently reducing our rate of construction in the UK.
Even prior to the PV price drop the previous government if it had not been for the banking crash would probably have added 33GW of offshore wind:

It is taking time, and $billions spent world-wide, to bring battery storage towards $100/kWh (at which point EVs become competitive with ICEVs)
BQEND
EVs are already competitive with ICEVS but only if you reduce the energy costs to reflect the costs not the price of clean energy.
But you are never going to offer batteries at 100kWh and the range that you want because the global Lithium supply cannot match the number
https://qnovo.com/82-the-cost-components-of-a-battery/
Even if you lower the costs then like with Si the market will raise the price of the LI.
For vehicles though the $300 / kWh was actually the break even issue but without a charging network it is worthless. And if you meet the extra demand with gas its cO2e / kWh is higher.
In bulk the batteries are almost at the level that you suggest but it is still not going to mean all the cars change:

I think you underestimate the costs of in home solar storage.
BQEND
I believe you are equally guilty of overestimating them. As solar PV modules, Li-ion batteries and other technologies for local energy storage come down in cost (as they are), the logical end-point is for domestic and commercial-scale solar PV and storage to provide the 'base-load'.
Or are you going to disagree with the CEO of the UK's National Grid:
BQSTART
From a consumer’s point of view, the solar on the rooftop is going to be the baseload. Centralised power stations will be increasingly used to provide peak demand
BQEND

BQSTART
The most logical way to build out solar isn't to put it on people's houses in London and Seattle, it's to put the available cells in places like Arizona and Queensland.
BQEND
Wrong. Those are useful places to build out solar PV, but the sun doesn't just shine on large areas of relatively empty land. It shines on every roof-top, road verge and track-side. The UK, for example, has only installed a miniscule amount of solar PV relative to the available land area on such surfaces, and has focussed on south-facing domestic roofs.
The logical thing to do, as costs come down, is to install solar PV on every square metre of available surface, and provide local storage. Contrary to what most people think, the constraint on solar PV is not how much space we have, but the 'ramp-rate' the grid has to deal with as it comes in and out.
By building out local storage, the grid ramp-rate is reduced, because more energy can be consumed locally than would otherwise be the case.
BQSTART
This doesn't require any lithium, doesn't have any potential for starting on fire and is non-polluting
BQEND
As Mazter has mentioned, please check out the Redflow ZCell. Lithium is not the only game in town as far as local storage is concerned.
Large-scale solar PV, CSP and HVDC interconnectors will be needed, of course, but a very large chunk of electricity demand world-wide will be provided by local solar PV and storage, because the engineering reality is that solution will be cheaper than grid electricity in nearly every part of the world during the 2020s.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1492936521000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'more energy can be consumed locally than would otherwise be the case', u'effect': u'by building out local storage the grid ramp rate is reduced'}, {u'cause': u'the engineering reality is that solution will be cheaper than grid electricity in nearly every part of the world during the 2020s', u'effect': u'a very large chunk of electricity demand world wide will be provided by local solar pv and storage'}], u'author_id': u'1317478', u'in_reply_to': u'97084953', u'id': u'97119306', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'John_Davies', u'text': u'If battery powered trains are a possibility, perhaps, though I would have thought this would likely have to be restricted to multiple units travelling relatively short distances.

The control room tweeted the milestone on Friday. It is the first continuous 24-hour coal-free period for Britain since use of the fossil fuel began. West Burton 1 power station, the only coal-fired plant that had been up and running, went offline on Thursday.

The UK has had shorter coal-free periods in 2016, as gas and renewables such as wind and solar play an increasing role in the power mix. The longest continuous period until now had been 19 hours – first achieved on a weekend last May, and matched on Thursday.
A National Grid spokesman said the record low was a sign of things to come, with coal-free days becoming increasingly common as the polluting fuel is phased out. 
Coal has seen significant declines in recent years, accounting for just 9% of electricity generation in 2016, down from around 23% the year before, as coal plants closed or switched to burning biomass such as wood pellets.
Britain’s last coal power station will be forced to close in 2025, as part of a government plan to phase out the fossil fuel to meet its climate change commitments. 
Hannah Martin, head of energy at Greenpeace UK, said: “The first day without coal in Britain since the Industrial Revolution marks a watershed in the energy transition. A decade ago, a day without coal would have been unimaginable, and in 10 years’ time our energy system will have radically transformed again.
“The direction of travel is that both in the UK and globally we are already moving towards a low carbon economy. It is a clear message to any new government that they should prioritise making the UK a world leader in clean, green, technology.”
Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate and energy at WWF, called the first coal-free working day “a significant milestone in our march towards the green economic revolution”.
“Getting rid of coal from our energy mix is exciting and hugely important. But it’s not enough to achieve our international commitments to tackle climate change – we haven’t made anything like the same progress on decarbonising buildings and transport. Whoever forms the next government after the general election, they must prioritise a plan for reducing emissions from all sectors.” Redmond-King said.
Britain became the first country to use coal for electricity when Thomas Edison opened the Holborn Viaduct power station in London in 1882. It was reported in the Observer at the time that “a hundred weight of coal properly used will yield 50 horse power for an hour.” And that each horse power “will supply at least a light equivalent to 150 candles”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/21/britain-set-for-first-coal-free-day-since-the-industrial-revolution

Tens of thousands of scientists are this weekend rallying around the world in a rebuke of Donald Trump’s dismissal of climate science and attempts to cut large areas of scientific research.
More than 600 marches, largely concentrated in the US, Europe, South America and Australia, began amid warnings from organisers that science is “under attack” from the Trump administration.
Placards demanded “science not silence”, declared “there is no plan b”, and offered support from “florists for research-based legislation”, showing the crowd was not restricted to those in scientific community. 
Chants asked what people wanted? “Science”, the marches bellowed. When? “Following peer review.”
Wellington in New Zealand, was one of the first marches to start, with protesters gathering on the waterfront and waving signs calling for action. Similar crowds gathered in Auckland.

In Sydney, hundreds gathered at Martin Place in the centre of the city and walked to Hyde Park. Speakers included Dr Angela Maharaj, lecturer at the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre, and former Liberal party leader, Dr John Hewson, who told the crowd politicians’ ignorance of climate change was “an embarrassment beyond belief”. 
Anti-tobacco campaigner Professor Simon Chapman, science writer Dr Jonica Newby, and writer and feminist Eva Cox, were also scheduled to speak.

Australian scientists and supporters flocked to 12 national events, including Brisbane, Canberra, Hobart, Adelaide, and Melbourne.
“It is very important that the March for Science is a community-led march; it’s a statement that is coming from the community,” professor Stuart Khan, an organiser of the Sydney march, told the ABC.
“It’s not led by the academics, it’s not led by eminent scientists because it’s not about them, it’s about the community saying: ‘This is what is important to us’.”
In Melbourne, immunologist and nobel laureate Prof Peter Doherty called for a price on carbon.
A preview of his speech on Friday said there were “major threats to the global culture of science” in today’s world.
“Why? A clear understanding of what is happening with, for example, the atmosphere, oceans and climate creates irreconcilable problems for powerful vested interests, particularly in the fossil fuel and coastal real estate sectors.”
Small crowds also gathered in Tokyo and South Korea’s second biggest city of Busan.

The marches, which take place on Earth Day, come one week before the Peoples Climate March, a series of large-scale climate change events that will be more overtly political.
“The March for Science and the Peoples Climate March go hand-in-hand,” said Dr Geoffrey Supran, an expert in renewable energy at Harvard University.
“Because attacks on science don’t just hurt scientists, they hurt scientists’ ability to protect the people, and climate change epitomises that. When politicians cater to fossil fuel interests by denying the basic realities of climate science and pursuing anti-science climate policy, they endanger the jobs, justice, and livelihoods of ordinary people everywhere.”
The global March for Science movement was not specifically directed at Trump, but he has proved to be a catalysing force, honorary national co-chair of the group, Lydia Villa-Komaroff, a molecular cellular biologist said last week.
“There seems to have become this disconnect between what science is and its value to society,” she said.
“Fundamental, basic science really underlies all of modern life these days. We have taken it so for granted.”
In the US, the main march in Washington DC will see thousands of protesters converge on the national mall decrying attempts to slash funding for basic government research into cancer, climate change, forensics and other areas.
Scientists have also been perturbed by the Trump administration’s attempts to sideline or ignore research and by repeated gaffes by key Trump appointees, such as Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt, who denied that carbon dioxide is a key driver of global warming.
Ayana Johnson, a marine biologist and march organiser, said Trump’s policies have been “horrifying” but added that the hundreds of companion marches around the world showed there is a “global trend of anti-intellectualism” where politicians reject evidence-based policymaking in favour of playing to voters’ base emotions.
Some scientists have criticised their colleagues for throwing themselves into the political fray by openly touting the benefits of science in front of the White House.
But Bill Nye, a well-known science communicator in the US, said scientists are in a “dangerous place” and must speak out.
“Science has always been political but we don’t want science to be partisan,” he told the Guardian. “Objective truths have become set aside and diminished and lawmakers are acting like a strong belief in something is as valid as careful peer review.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/22/global-march-for-science-protests-call-for-action-on-climate-change

My apologies for supplying that link you are quite correct, my intention was and still is to point out that in the CAGW debate there is no middle ground.
BQEND
Incorrect.Firstly, CAGW is a made up acronym used only by deniers and blog rolls. It does not appear in the scientific literature.
Secondly, no there is no debate because the deniers have never provided the actual Evidence(TM) too support their incoherent claims. So, no there is no middle ground.
Skeptics, have provided Evidence(TM) that questions specific issues with data and so on, and there is discussion in the scientific literature about those subjects.
BQSTART
community classifies any dissenting scientist ""denier"" not skeptical when in reality skepticism is one of the most valuable tools in science.
BQEND
Incorrect.Firstly, where skeptics have looked at the Evidence(TM) and carried out their own research and got it published, they have concluded that the mainstream consensus is Coherent, enjoys Consilience, and that the data is correct.
 BEST is a prime example of that effort by a skeptic, who sourced independent funding including from the Kochs to carry out a total review of the temperature data records. The bEST data is now regularly included in mainstream reviews of temperature records as a way of confirming what HadCRUT et al report.
BQSTART
Continual questioning of ideas and results is a means of overturning long-held assumptions and uncovering new ideas.
BQEND
Correct.Unfortunately for the deniers, is that despite their never ending questioning they have failed to provide any robust Evidence(TM) that demonstrates AGW is not Coherent, and lacks Consilience.
AS an example of the numerous efforts, your link is an example. Your initial claim was that there was dispute/debate amongst geoscientists.
When peeling back the foreskin of your Evidence(TM), we find its not very good - a highly biased population with a vested interest, with the paper itself concluding that older men in positions of authority in an industry threatened by potential policy outcomes of accepting AGW, rejected the basic science. (Turkeys do not vote for Xmas)
This is the problem with the deniers, selective quoting, to distort what the actual scientific papers say, further erodes any claim to healthy scientific skepticism.

When you save 98% of scientists agree, you just lost. No where can I find 98% agreement on anything thats being reviewed and debated.
BQEND
First, I didn't say anything about a 97% or 98% consensus. But I'll talk about it if you like. 
Second, you will find a lot review and debate about gravity, about evolution, about thermodynamics, about just about anything in science where the fundamental principles are widely agreed and that applies equally to climate science. Debate over the nature of gravitons and the behaviour of black holes doesn't mean that 98% of physicists won't tell you that jumping out of a 10 storey window is a bad idea. That's the nature of the consensus on climate as well: there is no shortage of new work and lively debate around the cutting edge.
Third, the consensus isn't what justifies the evidence, the evidence is what justifies the consensus. You see those scientists who spend their working lives in labs measuring isotope ratios from ice cores or mud bores, who look at fossils in different sedimentary rocks, who measure fossil pollen grains on lake bottoms, who follow these dozens of lines of evidence, have come to similar conclusions, based on independent lines of research. The consensus emerges from many consilient lines of coherent research: the 3 Cs.

In Manhattan, and across America, “huge, light-hearted throngs ambled down autoless streets.” Earth Day had been born, an outburst of protest – and revelry – that involved everyone from save-the-whales activists to opponents of new freeways. Denis Hayes, now 72, was the man tasked with organising it. “What we did was pull together an event that told all of those people, ‘You know you’ve really got something in common and this should be one big movement where we’re supportive of one another’.”
It sparked, he tells me, the most profound change in American society since the New Deal. “We now have different kinds of buildings, different kinds of automobiles, different planes, different lighting, different land use. People are choosing to have diets for environmental reasons, choosing to have one child for environmental reasons.” And all that, he says, “didn’t come from political leadership at the top, it came from a bunch of demands down at the grassroots”.
In 1990, Earth Day went international, reaching 200 million people in 141 countries. Now, according to its website, more than a billion participate in celebrations, teach-ins and protests around the world. This year, the Earth Day Network has teamed up with scientists for a rally on the National Mall in Washington DC. Volunteers around the world are convening their own versions of this “March for Science”, to champion “evidence-based policies in the public interest”.
Vanessa Furey, one of the organisers of the London march, says she was motivated by the “rise in fake news and ‘alternative facts’” during the past year, “and that quote from Michael Gove [during the referendum campaign] that ‘people have had enough of experts’”. The experts are fighting back. “Scientists aren’t the natural group to go out marching – and I know there are some that still have reservations about doing it. But it felt like a proactive, positive move for [them] to come out and say, let’s get the public involved.”
But is there any point in these big days out when the world seems to be hurtling ever faster towards disaster? Last year was the warmest on record, yet progress on environmental issues seems to be going into reverse. Donald Trump is still mulling over whether to abandon the US’s commitment to the Paris agreement on limiting global warming. Scott Pruitt, the man he appointed to lead the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the creation of which was the original Earth Day’s greatest achievement, doesn’t believe the scientific consensus on climate change. The UK government, once a global leader in the campaign to reduce carbon emissions, will be absorbed by Brexit for years. This week it privatised the Green Investment Bank, with no guarantee its mission will be maintained over the long term.
“It’s pretty tough to look at what’s going on today with clear eyes and not get fairly depressed,” says Hayes. The challenges facing activists have certainly changed in the 47 years since he became involved, when “you couldn’t see 100 yards in front of your nose” in cities such as Pittsburgh, Los Angeles or Gary, Indiana. “The easy stuff environmentally is when something poses an immediate threat to you, to your children, to your neighbourhood. When that’s happening, it is not that hard to organise people and to get them sufficiently incensed to demand change.”
Hayes says that it’s tougher with the big global issues such as climate change, threats to the world’s oceans and migratory species – issues that cross national boundaries and can’t be solved by any one country acting alone. “Those sort of things are all in much worse shape in 2017 than they were back in 1970,” he says.
But despair, appropriate as it might seem, isn’t just bad for the soul. A growing movement of “Earth Optimists” believes that it could actually make things worse. In an editorial for Science magazine’s Earth Day issue, professors Andrew Balmford and Nancy Knowlton argue that “presenting people with huge problems without solutions leads to disengagement”. They continue: “Without examples of conservation succeeding, hopelessness could itself emerge as a driver of extinction.” And there are successes: in Brazil, for example, the rate of Amazon deforestation is down to one-third of its 2004 peak. Chinese investment in renewable energy is set to exceed $300bn by 2020.
It’s those kinds of triumphs, and myriad smaller ones, that have inspired the Earth Optimism summit, also taking place in Washington DC this weekend. In the UK, Earth Optimism Cambridge will carry the torch. Speakers including Jane Goodall, David Attenborough and Steven Pinker will relay “stories of hope”, and there’s a “solutions fair” with stalls telling people how to consume less and get involved in campaigns. Dr Rosie Trevelyan, director of the Tropical Biology Association, is one of the brains behind the event. She argues that if people dwell on the negative, they won’t learn what actually works, and what they can do to help.
Examples come from near and far. “We’ve got someone from the Wildlife Trust, which has restored fenland around here,” she says. “It’s an incredibly important habitat and it had practically disappeared. I went to a fenland on Sunday and saw a bittern. Bitterns had almost gone extinct in this country, and they’re now breeding out there.” One of Trevelyan’s students from Ghana will talk about how he and his colleagues managed to save the Togo slippery frog from extinction. When they were selecting positive stories, she says, “we had to cut loads of them, we had so many. It’s about making people aware of the fact that we don’t need to just stand by and watch these things disappear, we can actually do something.”
Earth Day has its detractors, particularly in the US, where environmentalism is seen through the distorting lens of the culture wars. “Earth Day is a yearly reminder that humanity must be controlled, manipulated and even destroyed for the good of the planet,” wrote rightwing pundit Glenn Beck last year. He claimed that the EPA’s ban on the insecticide DDT in 1972 led to millions of avoidable deaths from malaria as other countries followed suit – despite the fact that the US wasn’t the first to outlaw the chemical and continued to allow its use for public health reasons.
For Ron Bailey, Reason magazine’s science correspondent, the mixing of politics and ecology has turned off many who might otherwise find common cause with the protesters. “When it was started back in 1970,” he says, “there were obvious problems with pollution and so forth that needed to be dealt with. But it wasn’t an all-out assault on capitalism and market economies, which it has more or less turned into. It’s very alienating for those who are actually anxious to address specific problems that are occurring in the environment both locally and globally. If the only solution is destroying the economy, you’re not going to get a lot of people on board.”
No fan of Trump, Bailey nevertheless thinks the scientists marching in Washington today are making a mistake. “Certainly we should celebrate science and its objectivity, and what this has brought to modernity. But by tying it to Earth Day, they are undermining their message. It automatically tinges them with politics.” That, he reckons, could jeopardise funding for scientific research, which in the US has tended to be bipartisan.
If not a day, though, then what? “If you’re interested in these kind of things, then go to your local city council, go to your local legislature, write letters to your congressman, testify at hearings, that kind of thing, about the issues that particularly concern you,” says Bailey.
It is not a colourful solution. For Trevelyan, it’s not a question of either/or. And while she doesn’t strike me as particularly political, she believes the reaction to Trump and the new spirit of protest are something to be welcomed. “I think it’s mobilised more people to worry about things,” she says. “I think we should watch this space. The March for Science has been catalysed by seeing [him] as president. People are no longer being complacent.”
Hayes addresses what he sees as the self-harming democratic choices we have made more directly. “If you happen to be an American or a Briton or a French person or a Turk, it’s difficult not to be a little bit ashamed of your country. That’s just a reason not to get despondent, but to get energised and angry and committed.”
“In 1970,” he says, “we called it Earth Day, but it was really a focus on individual cities in the US and schools and neighbourhoods. As we move forward, I think it genuinely is becoming ‘Earth’ Day.” The stakes are higher than they’ve ever been. “You know, this is not one of those casual things that if you win or lose, you don’t mind; or you say, ‘Jeez, sorry, we lost that one.’ We’re talking now about impoverishing the human prospect for the next 100 generations. We can’t lose on this.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/22/earth-day-2017-hayes-interview

We can try and work it out. I don't have the answer :)
First thing is the sun's angle changes hence the shading will also change. On assumes that for some reason the net shading is higher for this shape than for, say, a sphere?Or maybe they're only comparing it to a plane (frozen reservoir). Is it possiblea sphere would be even better?
That's my first guess: A pinnacle like this is not the best imaginable shape, it's just much better than a default semi-planar glacier or completely planar reservoir like the ones that predecessor made in the shadow of mountains.
My second guess is evolving. The surface is approximately a parabola, with a flat, circular base: a cylindrical paraboloid. One could work out what surface is exponsed to the sun as a function of the sun's angle from equatorial to zenith (except it's at a non zero latitute hence sun will never be straight above - meaning some of the paraboloid is always shaded.So: - pi.(radius squared) is always shaded.- Surface: Say the total height of the ice thing, and z is, the sirface isintegral of [2.pi.[r-z/r*h]^2], z=0,hSo when z=0 (ground level, we have a circular ice extent which has circumference 2.pi.[r-z/r*h]^2And when z=h, we have a circumference 2.pi.[r-z/r*h]^2=0 i.e. no circumference at all at the tip.Problem that this is linear - we need something going as the square of the height (inversely). Well never mind for now, let's say it's a linear spike intstead of a hyperboloid for starters.
So the integral: integral[[2.pi.[r-z/r*h]^2]dz {0,h}= 2.pi.int[r^2-2r.z/r.h+z^2/r^2/h^2]= 2.pi.[z.r^2-2z^2/2*h+z^3/3/(r.h)^2]= 2.pi.[r^2.z-2h^2/2*h+z^3/(3.r.h)^2] only term is z=h, z=0 gives 0= 2.pi.h[r^2-h^2+1/(9.r^2)]
Now I'm stuck because I don't know how much of that is shaded as a function of the sun's angle, just that half of it is, at sunrise.So the total shaded area would be the base (pi.r^2) and half the above (i.e. pi.h[r^2-h^2+1/(9.r^2)])Total shaded area at sunrise is therefore pi.(r^2+h[r^2-h^2+1/(9.r^2)])Total shaded area for a circular reservoir is just pi.r^2 which is much smaller.

for anyone wanting to explore the region musically i can heartily recommend this recent release on the ever-brilliant sublime frequencies label, where the mountains meet the sky : folk music of ladakh

honest jons prob your best bet if you're in the uk cos i think they do distro for sublime frequencies, but plenty online options if you're elsewhere, or wanting digital rather than vinyl. anyways it's great, here's the blurb...
Music from Ladakh recorded during the making of the film The Song Collector by director Erik Koto with additional material recorded by Bill Kite in 1992.
“Situated high in the Western Himalaya, Ladakh is one of the great cultural crossroads of Asia. For centuries, it sat at the hub of ancient trade routes that connected the Silk Road to India, Tibet, and Kashmir. Each year, once the winter snows had melted from the high passes surrounding Ladakh, its markets would buzz with merchants from throughout central Asia. They brought spices, wool, salt, and silk. They also brought their instruments and their folks songs. Over time, these diverse musical influences laid the foundation of Ladakh’s unique folk traditions. Folk music became central to the daily life of the Ladakhis with song serving as an essential form of communication, documentation, and entertainment.
This collection of songs is intended to offer a sampling of the range of Ladakh’s folk music. These songs also celebrate one of the great folk artists of Ladakh, Morup Namgyal. Morup is an avid preservationist and during his 30-year career working at Ladakh’s only radio station (All India Radio, Leh) he recorded a vast archive of Ladakhi folk songs. This collection of over 1,000 recordings was unlike anything else in Ladakh and formed a crucial link to a dying folk tradition. Tragically, it burned to the ground in 2002 when a fire raged through the old wooden radio station building. The loss was devastating, but Morup immediately set about recreating the archive. Five of the songs on this album, recorded in 1992, are among the handful of tracks to have been spared by the fire.
Today, Ladakh’s marketplaces bear little resemblance to the buzzing markets of old. Gone are the camel trains and merchants, replaced instead by Indian trucks belching smoke. Seemingly vanished too are the folk musicians, pushed aside by the synthetic beats of the latest Bollywood hit. But the folk artists have not vanished entirely, and if you wander beyond the blare of the latest pop song, you’ll discover a folk tradition that, thanks to the efforts of Morup Namgyal and others like him, is alive, evolving, and poised to endure the challenges of modernization. I hope you enjoy this small glimpse into the sounds and lyrics of this Himalayan crossroads.”', u'recommendation_count': u'4', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1492858619000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'16180002', u'id': u'97062453', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'squeezycakes', u'text': u'THIS IS GREAT', u'recommendation_count': u'8', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1492858003000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'13787138', u'id': u'97061939', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'jan oskar Hansen', u'text': u'great work', u'recommendation_count': u'7', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1492856857000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'16834728', u'id': u'97060906', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ScantNollidge', u'text': u'What biological phenomenon do the stupas mimic?', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1492856573000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'3484046', u'id': u'97060658', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'belgrave', u'text': u'It seems to me that the ice stupas are surrounded by prayer flags.

The engineer from Ladakh, in the Jammu region of north India, was already a famous problem solver: a Bollywood film loosely based on his life had grossed a billion rupees in its first four days.
But addressing the water shortages that threatened life in his mountainous home had started to feel like an intractable problem until he saw the chunk of ice: still hanging, improbably, beneath the bridge, long after the shards around it had melted.
In that moment, he says, “I understood that it was not the warmth of the sun that was melting the ice on the ground. It was direct sunlight.”
What Wangchuck saw reflected in the ice that day was realised four years ago, when he unveiled his first “ice stupa”, an artificial glacier that towered surreally over the otherwise arid landscape, and for which in December he received a prestigious £80,000 innovation prize.
It is the latest solution to an old problem in the Himalayan foothills. Despite its breathtaking scenery, life in Ladakh has always been hard. It is a desert at 10,000 feet, receiving on average just 50mm of rainfall each year. “The only reason people can live there is the glaciers,” Wangchuk says. 
Each winter, titanic shelves of ice form at high altitudes and melt throughout the spring, flowing downwards into the streams that are the veins of civilisation on the mountain. Lately, that cycle has faltered.
Unnaturally high global temperatures threaten ice shelves everywhere – but researchers believe Himalayan glaciers are shrinking more quickly than any on earth. Less water is reaching Ladakh’s farms and villages, and when it does, the volume of water from the faster-melting glaciers can break the banks of streams, causing floods.
Wangchuk is not the first to try to wring a more sustainable water supply from the mountains. For centuries, inhabitants of the Hindu Kush and Karakoram ranges have practiced “glacier grafting”, chipping away at existing ice and pooling the pieces at higher altitudes, hoping to create new glaciers that can supply streams throughout the growing season. Apocryphally, villagers in the 13th century “grew” such glaciers across mountain passes to stop the advance of Genghis Khan.
More than a decade ago, another Indian engineer devised an update. Chewang Norphel earned the nickname the “iceman of Ladakh” by using a network of pipes to divert meltwater into artificial lakes on shaded sides of the mountain. The water would freeze at night, creating glaciers that grew each day as new water flowed into the basin. Norphel created 11 reservoirs that supplied water to 10,000 people.
“The problem was that it couldn’t be done in lower altitudes, where people actually live,” says Wangchuk. The lakes were also restricted to heavily shaded areas, and simply melted too quickly to make up for the shortfall in water wrought by increasing temperatures. Adapting the concept became Wangchuck’s obsession. The auspicious chunk of ice on the bridge showed him how that could be done.
“The ice needed to be shaded – but how?” he says. “We couldn’t have it under a bridge, or use reflectors, which aren’t practical at scale. So we thought of this conical shape: making ice shade itself.”
It was a kind of biomimicry: artificial innovation based on natural phenomena, such as velcro – modelled on the way plant burrs attach to dogs, or new skin grafts that stick to bodies by piercing the tissue and expanding, the same way parasitic worms fix to the intestines of their hosts.
The conical shape hit a sweet spot, maximising the volume of ice that can be “grown”, while minimising the surface area exposed to direct sunlight. That means it keeps melting well into the spring, releasing up to 5,000 litres of water each day by “storing it in the sky”, Wangchuk says.
It also has the benefit of resembling the Buddhist stupas – religious sites used for meditation and worship – that dot the landscape, a crucial point for 50-year-old. “Because it resembles something we have in our tradition, it is made more close to the population, to their hearts,” he says.
Synchronising his work with nature and tradition are key to the inventor’s practice. “Generally I like things to be simple and self-acting,” he says. “For me, simplicity is beauty, simplicity is the ultimate satisfaction.”
And the stupas are simple. They are formed by running pipes below the frost line, at which temperature the water hovers between a liquid and solid state. Then the pipes turn skywards, spraying the water into -20C air, using the bitter cold to freeze it as it falls to earth.
The first prototype, stretching 20 feet high, was built in October 2013, and expected to melt by the beginning of May. It lasted eighteen days longer. A second much larger stupa was grown near a forest of 5,000 trees, and kept them watered throughout the driest months until 6 July.
Those two stupas were funded by crowdsourcing donations. Last year, Wangchuk was awarded a Rolex innovation grant, money he will use to create the next generation of ice towers. 20 more, each 100 feet high, are in the works.
He will also use the money to fund an “alternative university” in Ladakh to train young people to see in their surroundings answers to the region’s problems. “Solutions for the mountains, by the mountain people,” he says.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/22/the-ice-stupas-of-ladakh-solving-water-crisis-in-the-high-desert-of-himalaya

After a very hot record breaking summer it's a lovely day to today in my patch of the Southern Hemisphere subtropics - 27 degrees C maximum, sunny with a few clouds. That's my subjective experience of today, so far. 
I also know based on the subjective experience of meteorologists that this lovely weather is the product of a high in the Tasman Sea bringing fine weather to Australia's east coast. We should also have fine weather for tomorrow's ANZAC day march, but by Wednesday, a high will have traveled north from the Southern Ocean into the Bight, pushing the cold front and trough that extend north from a Southern Ocean low, toward South East Queensland bringing some much appreciated rain.
Subjective experience is that associated with a single point of view. Objective experience is that from many points of view of the world and universe around us and within us. Objective experience is collective experience.
Based on my immediate subjective experience, I know today is a lovely day and it likely to remain so because except for the summer storm season, in my subjective experience weather doesn't change quickly in Brisbane. In that my subjective experience and the objective experience of meteorologists coincide. As for tomorrow and Wednesday, I rely on their objective experience.
As a biological scientist involved in mosquito management, I've made similar predictions a few days to a week out, and instigated interventions. Like the meteorologists my observations were subjective but formed part of a collective experience and knowledge. Objective experience is just a wider view.

There’s no time for gloom and doom. We already have solutions that will power sustainable abundance. Dirty fossil fuels will fade as we dial up clean, renewable energy sources. The revolution is here: solar costs have fallen more than 80 percent since 2008, onshore wind is down 40 percent, and grid-scale batteries cost 70 percent less. We can have everything we want and need, with less stress on Earth’s Operating System - less lasting damage to God’s Creation.

Yes, of course plants photosynthesise using CO₂, but they cannot take up the amount we are currently producing through burning. Many ecosystems including corals, mangroves and rainforests have developed in a limited range of temperatures which climate change will push them beyond (so called 'climate departure') and we're seeing the result in the Great Barrier Reef. And drought is expected to harm many plants, such that wheat and maize yields may halve over the next century - this in turn will create a demand for agricultural land that will seriously impact on habitats, while other areas will be lost to accelerating sea level rise. One estimate is that 40-70% of species would become extinct as a result of global warming by the end of the century.

“In relation to the created order
Humanity loses its harmony with the natural order and our God-given stewardship of the environment gives place to sinful plundering.
This is manifest as exploitation, the needless destruction of the world without thought for its created beauty or intrinsic worth.
It is also manifest as pollution, the selfish and rapacious use of raw materials, contaminating the oceans and the very atmosphere, all too often in the interests of economic profit, luxury and self-indulgence.”

Everyone's emissions are their own responsibility. So the guy driving his car is part of the problem. He may not have other good options, especially in the US, but he doesn't get to just sit there and say it's not his problem. He can either do something different (cycling is indeed an excellent low-carbonoption), or he can hassle his representatives to change the system so that he _does_ have low-carbon options. (EVs, PT, living closer to work, etc).
Companies have responsibilities too in much the same way. Everyone needs to run in the same direction of reducing emissions, fast. There are tens of ways that individuals can do that, as well as many things that only companies and governments can change.

Rather than act rationally, he held only to what he thought were the perceptions afforded him by his senses, such as he considered them to be. You likely consider Hitchens brave to have ignored the fear that came to him by the kindness and mercy of God. In truth, Hitchens preferred arrogance over reason.
I suspect that Hitchens, like many of us, assumed that his predicament was the natural state of everyone. When someone claims they feel a certain way, or think a certain thought, it seems to us that we can feel and think as they do. But even as we think this, we witness how many of us love, say, the color green, even as many others are hating it. And we are always left incapable of knowing who is right. We are cut off from all but ourselves when it comes to knowing things. Each of us, and in a very real sense, is dead to everything. I suspect that this is why no one can define what life is.
Because we are all dead (hermetically and inexorably sealed away from truely knowing anything), then even were God to actually exist, no human could possibly know Him based on ""rational thought."" Which brings me to the Book that you mentioned-- the one that was written by the collection of ancient desert tribes.

From the very moment of our first existence, we are locked inside of ourselves - completely selfish. It is a puzzle, a problem that that tribal book explained unlike any other. And, whereas all the other writings have been scarcely aware the problem even exists (and this includes almost all of the writings of science), I thank God that this singular tribal Book not only explains it, but that it even explains its solution.
We humans do not know whether our thoughts are rational. That is just how inherently lost we are in this cursed universe. And yet, like Eternally Burning Hitch, we often think ourselves noble when we in arrogance claim to rely upon ""Rational Thought.""

Creationism The Hovind Theory 
Hovind presented a version of Young Earth creationism he calls the ""Hovind Theory"" in lectures and in the book Unmasking the False Religion of Evolution.[42][43] The Hovind Theory is entirely rejected in the scientific community, and its plausibility has been criticized by other Young Earth creationists.[44][45]
In the theory, dinosaurs and humans coexisted and Tyrannosaurus rex was a vegetarian prior to the fall of man.[30][46] Hovind expands upon the early 20th-century vapor canopy concept of a protective shield that made Earth a relative paradise between the expulsion from Paradise and Noah's flood.[47] Noah's family and two of every kind of animal[48] (including dinosaurs, which fit because babies were taken aboard and conditions allowed larger humans, making the ark's size, based on cubits, larger[49]) boarded Noah's ark before an ice meteor impacted the Earth. Fragments from the meteor caused planetary rings and impact craters on the moon and other solar system bodies.[50] The remainder were drawn to the North and South Poles by the Earth's magnetic field as cataclysmic snowfall which buried the mammoths standing up.[43][50] The ice on the poles cracked the Earth's crust, releasing the ""fountains of the deep"". According to Hovind, these events caused an ice age, and made the Earth wobble around, collapsing the vapor canopy that protected it.[51]
In the next few months of the flood, the dead animals and plants were buried, and became oil, coal, and fossils.[52] The last months of the flood included geological instability, when the plates shifted, forming ocean basins and mountain ranges. The Grand Canyon was formed in a couple of weeks during this time.[46]

Sometimes, I stray into politics and other times, I venture further afield. Today, on Earth Day, I was reflecting on best ways to move real action forward and it is clear to me, and almost everyone in this industry, that building bridges between like-minded groups is key. 
Frankly, it isn’t just scientists that are concerned about climate change. Our concerns are shared by business leaders, the insurance industry, defense industries, people who enjoy the outdoors, farmers, and many more. Recently, there has been a movement amongst persons of faith as well. In fact, for some people of faith, taking care of the Earth is a mandate from a higher authority. In this light, and to celebrate a very different voice form my own, the following is a guest post by a well-known meteorologist in the USA, Paul Douglas. It turns out he is also a man of faith as well as a business leader. Thanks Paul.
-John Abraham
Christians just celebrated the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I’m a Christian, husband, father, businessman and scientist; a Penn State meteorologist by training. It’s true that all knowledge is relative; science is never “settled” and one never quite reaches solid bedrock. There’s always a new observation, a new discovery, a radical theory, more testing to do. We look at the universe through a pinhole as God gradually reveals himself to us.
Regardless of how you pray or how you vote, we can all agree that fewer toxic chemicals in our air and water is a good thing. But today, more Americans die prematurely from air pollution than traffic accidents. More than 5 million premature deaths result from dirty air every year, worldwide. Air pollution disproportionately impacts minority and low-income communities across the USA. And statistically, America’s poor are much more likely to live near toxic waste sites. 
These numbers betray the ugly truth that the poor pay the steepest price for America’s toxic reliance on fossil fuels. This is not the world Jesus teaches us to create. “He will reply, truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me,” Jesus told his disciples in Matthew 24:45. 
The Trump administration’s misguided efforts to roll back protections for public health and the environment puts every one of us at risk, especially those with the fewest resources. Increasingly, America the Beautiful is under siege, as the interests of polluting industries take priority over the safety and welfare of our children. 
Science is not a substitute for faith; the two are not mutually exclusive. Science has no answer for the miracle of consciousness, the power of love and the promise of eternal life to come. We are here to worship our Creator and enjoy the fruits of his Creation. We are caretakers of a precious gift. We don’t own anything—everything around us is on loan. “My home is in Heaven. I’m just traveling through this world,” Billy Graham preached.
Science doesn’t have all the answers, but we would be well advised to listen to the 97% of climate scientists who tell us Earth is warming, and the rapid burning of fossil fuels is responsible. Because the symptoms of a warming planet are becoming harder to deny and dismiss.
I just co-authored Caring for Creation: The Evangelical’s Guide to Climate Change and a Healthy Environment with Mitch Hescox, a former coal industry employee and a Methodist Minister. He is now leading the Evangelical Environmental Network, made up of conservatives focused on conserving the very thing that sustains us: a healthy, vibrant planet. 
I’m proud of the many Christians who will march on April 29th in the People’s Climate March. Around the world people of faith will speak with one voice about the dangers of climate change, and the opportunities for good, renewable, clean-energy energy jobs. Environmental justice and economic justice go hand in hand. Clean energy is rapidly outpacing fossil fuels in creating jobs—the solar industry already employs twice as many people as coal. 
We are called to be stewards, tending what’s left of Eden. “Man has been appointed as a steward for the management of God’s property, and ultimately, he will give account for his stewardship” says Luke 16:2. 
How are we doing? 
More than 150 million people around the world live within three feet of sea level, so warming, rising seas are quickly becoming more than an inconvenience. Climate change is already making storms, droughts and heat waves more intense, impacting where crops grow and who has access to water. Climate change is emerging as the global human rights struggle of the 21st century.
A rapidly-changing climate affects the health and welfare of our kids, and their kids. Respect for life must extend to future generations of unborn. Climate change is a global pro-life issue.
There’s no time for gloom and doom. We already have solutions that will power sustainable abundance. Dirty fossil fuels will fade as we dial up clean, renewable energy sources. The revolution is here: solar costs have fallen more than 80 percent since 2008, onshore wind is down 40 percent, and grid-scale batteries cost 70 percent less. We can have everything we want and need, with less stress on Earth’s Operating System - less lasting damage to God’s Creation. 
What would Jesus do? We can’t know the mind of God, but based on Christ’s own words, actions and ministry he might have two simple questions. “Did you protect my Father’s home? Did you defend his children?” 
What will we tell him?

""Since our original 2010 statement, new climate data from the geological record have arisen which strengthen the statement’s original conclusion that CO2 is a major modifier of the climate system, and that human activities are responsible for recent warming.  Palaeoclimate records are now being used widely to test the validity of computer climate models used to predict climate change. Palaeoclimate models can simulate the large-scale gradients of past change, but tend not to accurately reproduce fine-scale spatial patterns. They also have a tendency to underestimate the magnitude of past changes. Nevertheless they are proving to be increasingly useful tools to aid thinking about the nature and extent of past change, by providing a global picture where palaeoclimate data are geographically limited. Geologists have recently contributed to improved estimates of climate sensitivity (defined as the increase in global mean temperature resulting from a doubling in atmospheric CO2 levels). Studies of the Last Glacial Maximum (about 20,000 years ago) suggest that the climate sensitivity, based on rapidly acting factors like snow melt, ice melt and the behaviour of clouds and water vapour, lies in the range 1.5°C to 6.4°C. Recent research has given rise to the concept of ‘Earth System sensitivity’, which also takes account of slow acting factors like the decay of large ice sheets and the operation of the full carbon cycle, to estimate the full sensitivity of the Earth System to a doubling of CO2. It is estimated that this could be double the climate sensitivity.""

Indeed they do.

 You say that ""From '98 - '15,"" ( a period of 17 years) ""temperatures rose .05 degrees C per decade"" whereaswww.bom.gov.au/state-of-the climateshows it rose by 0.15 degrees C over that time from one extreme El Nino to the next.

You claim ""sea levels have been rising for the last 22,000 years"" but most of this rise was due to the end of the last glacial or ice age from 19,000 to 9,000 years ago.

George HW Bush was on board and was working to mitigate the problem. We had folks like Newt Gingrich partnering up with Kathrine Hayhoe and her evangelical pastor, husband form Texas Tech University. They were writing a chapter on Climate change for the Newt's upcoming book on dealing with climate change mitigation. That all went South when Gingrich had a sudden epiphany.

Here's the moment that Newt threw Katherine and her husband under the bus.

The march was an opportunity to oppose ignorance.
When my country had a realistic price on CO2 emissions ( which you erroneously call a carbon tax) increases in the price of electricity for other reasons (crude oil price and network costs) eclipsed the price of liquid fuels and electricity, respectively. Nevertheless emissions dropped because of the impact of the carbon price on the retail price of electricity before the network cost was factored in.
Renewable electricity generation or what you call green power ischeaper than new coal fired power station generated electricity. Cross subsidies on renewable energy sources reduce the onerous network cost. Old coal fired power stations were completely subsidised in their construction and subsequent privatisation.Windfarm electricity costs $74 per MWhr to produce while electricity from new coal fired power stations costs $119.
Your so called ""Climategate"" revealed nothing. There is no scandal about climate data adjustments - it makes sense that meteorological temperature data often needs to be adjusted if it's to be used to track regional climate. There was no pause in the rate of rise of the global climate temperature as a 15 year variation in the rate of temperature rise is of insufficient time to significantly affect climate which needs 30 years. Climate science is mainstream with little little to do with Malthus 
Global climate temperatures have risen 0.85 degrees C since 1880. Increased incidence of extreme rainfall events with associated flooding, increased destructiveness of tropical cyclones, increased severity of droughts and length and severity of fire seasons and increased frequency of heat waves all present objective dangers to life, livelihood and property.
As with the last major global greenhouse warming when atmospheric CO2 rose by 40% from 200 ppm to 280 ppm over a period of 10,000 years leading to a global temperature rise of 4 degrees C, the current global greenhouse warming due to atmospheric CO2 increasing by 40% from 280 ppm to 400 ppm over 137 years leading so far to a temperature rise of 0.85 degrees C which is yet to stop rising. CO2 is controlling the climate temperature nob. There is nothing else turning the climate temperature knob. 
Very hot periods will most likely lengthen and intensify while extreme weather is likely to increase over the coming century according to the IPCC.

Our first seven years as expats were marred when people heard our American accents and asked what was wrong with US, to have 'elected' such a dumbass liar. We told them our deal and most of them became our friends (some to this day).

It was great to have an educated president whom everyone loved, everyone we met over here in the UK as well as in the EU. 
As well, it's a terrific feeling knowing we had a scandal-free eight years as opposed to the bloodless coup which began the 'war on terror'. Remind me: how many were forced out or had to resign from the current cabinet in the last 100 days?

The main March for Science event was held in Washington DC, where organizers made plans for up to 150,000 people to flock to the national mall, although somewhat fewer than that figure braved the rain to attend. Marchers held a range of signs. Some attacked Donald Trump, depicting the president as an ostrich with his head in the sand or bearing the words: “What do Trump and atoms have in common? They make up everything.”
More than 600 marches took place around the world, on every continent bar Antarctica, in events that coincided with Earth Day.
The marches, the first of their kind, were officially non-political. They were, however, conceived by three US-based researchers – Caroline Weinberg, Valorie Aquino and Jonathan Berman – after Trump’s inauguration. Organizers have said science is “under attack” from the Trump administration and many protesters excoriated the president with signs that likened him to a dangerous orange toxin or disparaged his now defunct university.
Trump released a statement that insisted his administration was committed to preserving the “awe-inspiring beauty” of America, while protecting jobs.
“Rigorous science is critical to my administration’s efforts to achieve the twin goals of economic growth and environmental protection,” Trump said. “My administration is committed to advancing scientific research that leads to a better understanding of our environment and of environmental risks. 
“As we do so, we should remember that rigorous science depends not on ideology, but on a spirit of honest inquiry and robust debate.”
There’s very low morale among government scientists because science is under assault from this administration
The US marches were some of the last to take place, following hundreds across the world. A common theme among protesters was a worry that politicians have rejected science-based policies. 
“I’m encouraged by the marches I’ve seen already taking place around the world,” said Rush Holt, a former congressman and head of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. “For generations scientists have been reluctant to be in the public square. There is a lot of concern.”
Speakers in Washington included Christiana Figueres, the former United Nations climate chief, and climate scientist Michael Mann. Hundreds of scientific institutions, environmental groups and union groups partnered with the march.
 “There’s very low morale among government scientists because science is under assault from this administration,” Mann told the Guardian. “That being said, events like this will lift the spirits of scientists. They are finding a voice.”
Pharmaceutical companies, concerned about the impact on research talent of Trump’s attempts to ban or restrict travel from certain Muslim-majority countries, risked his wrath by supporting the march. In a video, Pfizer said it was “proud to stand behind our scientists”.
Trump has galvanized scientists with his comments about climate change, which he has called a “hoax”, as well as questions about whether vaccines are safe and threats to cut funding to universities that displease him. 
The White House’s recent budget proposal would remove around $7bn in science funding, with the National Institutes of Health, which funds medical research, bearing much of the pain. Earth sciences, ranging from weather satellites to marine research to coastal preservation, are also lined up for severe cuts.
Climate change was at the heart of the March for Science, spurred on by dismissals of the issue by Trump and his top advisers. The budget director, Mick Mulvaney, has said climate research is a “waste of your money”. Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has erroneously denied that carbon dioxide is a primary driver of global warming. 
Other areas of science have been all but abandoned. The president has yet to nominate administrators for Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, nor to appoint his own science adviser. 
John Holdren, science adviser during Barack Obama’s presidency, said Trump had “shown no indication of awareness of the role of science and the role of science in government”.
“Scientists are understanding that they have to become activists, that they have to speak up, that they have to be heard,” he said. “The message isn’t, ‘Please save our jobs.’ Scientists would be in another line of work if they were just interested in their salaries. If funding for science is slashed, all of society will lose out.”
The march has proved controversial within the science community, which is typically reluctant to be overtly political. Some scientists have raised concerns that the marches will invite attacks by Trump and his supporters, or will fail to convince the public that science has inherent value.
But several famous voices have joined the cause. “Science has always been political but we don’t want science to be partisan,” Bill Nye, a prominent engineer and TV personality, told the Guardian. 
“Objective truths have become set aside and diminished and lawmakers are acting like a strong belief in something is as valid as careful peer review.”
Nye said science was in a “dangerous place” but hoped the march would help nudge Trump to a more amenable position.
“The president changes his mind quite frequently,” he said. “We want to influence the people who influence him. That’s our goal for the march.”
 Leland Melvin, a former Nasa astronaut who participated in two missions, criticized the administration’s plans to eliminate Nasa’s education budget.
 “Doing that would keep people like me from getting a master’s or PhD,” he said. “If we want brown people and women getting these degrees and get them involved in science, we have to fund it. The administration needs to get its head out of the sand.”
Cristian Samper, president of the Wildlife Conservation Society, said the march aimed “to celebrate science, not to politicize it”.
“Science is behind the good news and bad news about wildlife conservation ,” he said. “it has nothing to do with the fake news. Science is the antithesis of fake news.”
The marches came one week before the People’s Climate March, a series of large-scale events focused on climate change that will be more overtly political. 
“Attacks on science don’t just hurt scientists, they hurt scientists’ ability to protect the people, and climate change epitomizes that,” said Dr Geoffrey Supran, an expert in renewable energy at Harvard University.
“When politicians cater to fossil fuel interests by denying the basic realities of climate science and pursuing anti-science climate policy, they endanger the jobs, justice, and livelihoods of ordinary people everywhere.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/22/march-for-science-earth-day-climate-change-trump

How long can politicians avoid reality? The people charged with responding to real risks, like the Corps of Engineers and the Pentagon know what's happening and what's likely to come.

And they are correct. There's strong evidence that regional climate changes in the past led to increased conflict and migration.
We've already seen conflicts and migration linked to drought with the warming to date in places like Syria and Africa, and the momentum of Earth's climate means significant further warming is in the pipeline
Farmers around the Bay of Bengal were driven by drought to fish the Bay and now fisheries there are collapsing and the migration from a population of hundreds of millions is beginning.
People in Madagascar have been reported to be reduced to eating ash and rocks as their crops have failed for several years now due to drought linked to global warming.
When climatic zones and rains cross borders now there will be people with guns on the other side who may not like those being forced to move. I believe India and perhaps one more country are now building walls to contain the population of Bangladesh which resides on the sinking Ganges River Delta.

First of all, there was the mourning period. Not for me, but for my fellow citizens. I was just mad. And I wasn’t even maddest at the Trump voters. I understood that the critical battle lines now are not left versus right, but the 1% neoliberal globalisers making off with all of the loot and disembowelling the middle class. So when I saw the campaign, I knew that in the US, just as in the UK, a candidate who said anything at all about people forgotten in the neoliberal race would have a solid chance.
No – I was mad at my own leftwing tribe. All of January, people on the left would confront me with dazed, grief-stricken expressions, as if they had just emerged from a multi-car pileup on a foggy highway. “How could this have happened? What will we do?” I couldn’t even bear to participate in those conversations. Finally I started explaining my rage to my closest friends.
I had been screaming about the possibility of this very moment for eight years, since I published a piece in the Guardian titled “Fascist America in 10 Easy Steps” and wrote a book based on it, called The End of America (2007). Under George Bush Jr, the left had been very receptive to the book’s message about how democracies are undermined by the classic tactics of would-be authoritarians.
But once Obama was elected – “one of ours” – I had to spend the next eight years yelling like a haunted Cassandra, to a room the left had abandoned. I had yelled myself hoarse for eight years under Obama about what it would mean for us to sit still while Obama sent drones in to take out US citizens in extrajudicial killings; what it would mean for us to sit still while he passed the 2012 National Defence Authorisation Act that let any president hold citizens for ever without charge or trial; what it would mean for us to sit still while he allowed NSA surveillance, allowed Guantánamo to stay open, and allowed hyped terrorism stories to hijack the constitution and turn the US into what finally even Robert F Kennedy Jr was calling a national security surveillance state.
For eight years, under Obama, my audiences were libertarian cowboys and red-state truckers; members of the military and police forces, who were appalled by what they were witnessing; and even conservatives, worried about our legacy of freedom. My usual audience, the shoppers at Whole Foods and drivers of hybrid cars, the educated left, my people, sat smugly at home while the very pillars of American democracy were being systematically chipped away. They were watching Downton Abbey and tending their heirloom tomato patches on weekends in the Hudson Valley, because everything was OK; yeah, he may OK drone strikes, but they can’t be that bad, since he was one of “ours” – a handsome, eloquent African American, a former community organiser – in the Oval Office. Seduced by the image of a charming black man on Air Force One who talked about “change” – a white woman in a pantsuit (though highly paid by Goldman Sachs) talking about “that highest, hardest glass ceiling” – the left slumbered while US democracy was undone brick by brick by brick.
So my feeling, the first inaugural month of 2017, as the left sat shiva, was: now you are worried? Now you want action? Now that the separation of powers is a joke and the constitution has collapsed around your ears, you point a finger at Trump and say, “Sudden Catastrophe?”
He didn’t do this. You did this.
Your own inaction and willingness to be seduced by two-bit identity politics labels, without actually doing the hard work of being patriots and defending the actual constitution – brought us exactly, exactly here.
I had sought for eight years to explain to my own people, to no avail, this: it is not that important who sits in the White House if the structures of democracy are strong. If the structures of democracy are strong – you can have a madman or madwoman for four years or even eight, and then he or she is gone, and the nation’s freedoms live.
But if you take an eight-year nap snoozing through a systematic dismantling of the structures of democracy – freedoms of speech; independence of the press; separation of powers; fourth amendment rights to privacy; and allow the suspension of due process under the guise of “fighting the war on terror” – hell yeah, some day you will wake up and there will be a crazy man or a strongman in the White House and then nothing you do or say will make a difference any more.
So yeah, Month One: I had nightly glasses of red wine to dull my rage at my own feeble delusional kind, and avoided the collective liberal “mourning conversation”.
There are still shocking days – missiles to Syria, gunboats to North Korea – but we stay focused
Month Two: February was the month of OMG! Or else, WTF! I was part of it too, as Pres Trump’s new-to-us-all methods of exploding Twitter bombs, engaging in scary political theatre, committing daily acts of apparent, um, economic treason, and doing it all at a bewilderingly fast pace, demanded a learning curve from us all. It was a sense of chaos, destabilisation. OMG! He issued a travel ban. OMG! People are held en masse at Newark – New York City taxi drivers are boycotting the airport because of the ban! OMG, Uber is profiting on picking up those rides! OMG, now we have to boycott Uber! WTF! He is rounding up immigrants! OMG – he is separating families at the border! WTF – did Kellyanne Conway just promote Ivanka Trump’s clothing line? Isn’t that illegal? WTF! Are Chinese influence-mongers really lining up at Mar-a-Lago to ingratiate themselves with the president’s son-in-law? WTF – stripping the EPA of any budget to keep the air and water clean? OMG – did he just say he doesn’t believe in global warming? There was a stream of statelier edits from Congress, as the nation’s “WTF?” reaction evolved into: can he really do that? Ben Cardin, the Democratic senator for Maryland, proposed a Senate resolution that Pres Trump obey the emoluments clause of the constitution, which forbids bribery (Trump had refused to put his holdings in a blind trust). States began to pass laws, such as those protection sanctuary cities, to fight back against measures that Trump was taking federally. My day-to-day life was spent at our tech company, DailyClout, training a group of young people to write about legislation, Congress and statehouses, and putting out news stories, blogs and opinion pieces following these developments. DailyClout is incubated in a cool space in Manhattan called Civic Hall, which is funded by Microsoft, Google and Omidyar Networks, where we are surrounded by others – mostly idealistic millennials – who are also building exciting new tools for new kinds of civic engagement.
Month Three: in March, we all began to see a massive grassroots “resistance”. I personally don’t like that term, because you use that term to fight a completed fascist takeover; it gives democracy’s opponents too much power; right now we have a battered democracy on life support that needs defending from those who wish to pull the plug.
March was the month that dozens of new entities devoted to mobilising citizen action emerged from the collective shock. There were so many forms of new organising and funding: online candidate training seminars to Knight Foundation grants for new tools to get public and municipal records to people. Existing “civic tech” sites such as PopVox and Countable were joined in March by a slew of new tools and sites put together by this powerful wave of activism. Our collective missions got boosted with jet fuel by the huge burst in ordinary citizens wanting and needing to take action. New platforms ranged from 5 Calls – which came out of the experience of volunteers in the Clinton campaign and which sends you political action steps to take in five phone calls – to DailyAction, a similar service, which emerged out of Creative Majority, a Pac that supports Democratic candidates, and USAFacts, set up by Steve Ballmer, formerly of Microsoft, which compiles and crunches federal, state and local data from government sources. My own life mission didn’t reorient, since I had cofounded DailyClout’s platform in 2010. But use of our civic engagement tools skyrocketed. Our first product, called BillCam, lets you search a database of live state and federal bills, then pop a live bill into your blog or news articles; it lets you interact with the bills in real time and share them socially. We also created RSS feeds to stream live state and federal legislation right into the websites of local, regional and national news sites, and the websites of elected officials. In March we boosted our blog stream and videos covering new state and federal legislation, and started to report on what people could do locally to push forward their issues. Our sites on social media grew by triple and quadruple digits.
I presented these tools in March to news outlets and candidates and campaigns around the country – from Maine to Ohio to Oregon. I felt as if I was rediscovering my own nation, as the people in it were rediscovering belatedly how precious and fragile democracy was, and how much it depends on an informed citizenship. We were invited to demo it in a senate office; we visited Congress too, for our first exclusive interview, with Representative French Hill of Arkansas; I had never before been inside the Senate office building, or the Congress’s Longworth House Office Building. It was uplifting and moving to me. I also saw that elected officials worried about democracy, and wanting to empower real citizens, existed on both sides of the aisle.
We got our widget embedding live bills into news outlets totalling 160 million readers. In Q1 of 2017, 113,000 people searched BillCam to look at bills that would affect them – that they could now affect in turn. There are still shocking days – missiles to Syria, gunboats to North Korea – but we stay focused.
An amazing thing happened in March. The distinguished technologist George Polisner –who quit his senior-level role at Oracle in a public letter, covered widely in the US press, in which he demurred from Oracle’s CEO’s intention of “working with President Trump” – had started “ Civ.Works, a social platform, privacy protected so citizens can organise without fear of a corporate-buyout Big Brother. Polisner and DailyClout joined forces in March. We’re working to combine Civ.Works’ power of organising with the power of DailyClout’s streaming digital updates via RSS feeds, blogs and video, about local and federal legislation. No wonder I feel excited about the future.
Am I happy about the present? I feel incredibly energised, hopeful and certain that if enough citizens, in our democracy and worldwide, wake up (as they are) and are able to get hold of real tools to use democracy – and those best-case tools are now digital and link to social and digital media – we can indeed be in the midst of what another president called “a new birth of freedom”. Where I live, every day, on the frontlines of this digital revolution, there is every reason to feel in spired. That doesn’t mean I am “happy” about where the nation is – I am extremely scared, just as I am scared about the future of Europe in a parallel assault on its democracies.
But the biggest threat in the US or the UK isn’t one political party or candidate. It is people’s ignorance about their own democracies and their till-now lack of real-life tools to protect them. DailyClout UK and DailyClout EU are next on our list of planned launches: the UK legislative database is totally unsearchable, and the UK Parliament’s own website ends in dead links when you try to find actual legislation. The EU website tells you with difficulty what bills have passed but doesn’t show you what is coming up, when you might possibly take action – it offers a feed of pointless press releases instead. This lack of legislative transparency and usability had a lot to do, I believe, with the Brexit vote.
Months Four, Five and Six will see more and more of these tools – from dozens of T-shirt-clad bespectacled tech revolutionaries, coming online. Geeks are the new patriots, and code is the new “shot heard round the world”.

As soon as we sang the first chorus of the hymn, the tears started. “Here I go again,” I thought, “crying in church.” This was three weeks ago. And the week before, and the week before that, all the way back to last November’s election.
Sudden emotional outbursts are how I’m able to understand what Donald Trump’s presidency means to me. I wasn’t disconnected to these emotions before, but it’s the unexpected and potent nature that has changed.
I’m in no immediate danger from the Trump presidency. I’m not fearing deportation, the loss of my healthcare, a racially motivated arrest. I haven’t been personally attacked online or in the real world. So when I get scared and start crying, I wonder what it would feel like to be in that more vulnerable position, and I’m more distressed by the damage being done.
My lens on Trump stems from work in the climate movement. My vantage point is as executive director of 350.org, a global effort to build a social movement that can confront the power of the fossil-fuel industry and accelerate our transition to 100% renewable energy.
Trump stands in direct opposition to those goals. As president, he has wholeheartedly taken the side of the oil, coal, and gas industry and is already seeing to it that their agenda is enacted. Previous US presidents and candidates also did business with this industry, but at the same time they decried the threat of climate destabilisation, worked actively to secure international diplomatic alliances leading to an agreement, and achieved some progress from the executive branch.
At the very time when we need to be taking great leaps forward, Trump and his allies are dragging us backwards
Before Trump’s election, the climate movement had made some serious progress. Thanks to the good work of movements around the world, the social licence of this industry is on the decline. Investors are pulling their dollars, banks are cancelling loans, and public support for fossil-fuel companies is low.
Ditto for the politicians who back them up. Take congressman Lamar Smith of Texas: 45% of his constituents, not unacquainted with his ties to the oil industry, were less inclined to vote for Smith when as chair of the house science committee he failed to investigate ExxonMobil’s alleged climate cover-up. (350.org is under subpoena from Smith’s office for our efforts to get the truth out about Exxon.) From the political arena to our energy markets, it felt like the tide was finally beginning to turn in our direction.
But then along came Donald Trump to declare climate change a hoax (the only head of state in the world to do so), promising to revive the coal industry (declining in the US, thanks to terrific organising), and appointing known climate-change deniers to head the very offices responsible for regulating the problem.
When Trump won, a new kind of despair settled over climate activists. We’re pretty accustomed to despair already – climate grief circles have started up in Australia, home to devastating heatwaves, fires, drought, and a basically decimated Great Barrier Reef – but this felt like something new.
One week after the election, I was at a gathering with movement leaders across the faith, labour, LGBTQ and reproductive justice movements. We were each asked to write down one hard truth about the election that we hadn’t yet said out loud. One person wrote: “The small window of time we had to dramatically reduce emissions may have just closed.”
At the very time when we need to be taking great leaps forward, Trump and his allies are dragging us backwards with an ideology that puts corporate power above all else – and you’d be hard pressed to find a set of corporations more desperate to hold on to power than the likes of Exxon, Chevron and numerous coal and gas companies with less brand recognition.
At least now there’s no mystery about what we’re up against: the full political might of the fossil-fuel industry. Two examples register highly on that score. The first is the appointment of former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. The second is the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline.
The Tillerson appointment stands out because even the most cynical and pessimistic among us didn’t predict that a person at the pinnacle of “big oil” would be in charge of diplomacy in the Trump regime. As my colleague Bill McKibben has said, you might as well ask Ronald McDonald to head up the Department of Agriculture. And Exxon isn’t just any oil company: it has hidden what it knew about climate change, as early as the late 1970s, in order to continue making money on a product it knew was wrecking the planet. It funded climate-denying thinktanks and retained the same firms that helped tobacco companies claim that nicotine isn’t addictive. It should be bad enough to have the entire cabinet made up of the 1%, but the state post provides Tillerson and Exxon with far too much temptation to officially use the US foreign policy apparatus to keep extracting more oil.
The night I saw that Trump suggested Tillerson for the post, I burst into tears and crawled into bed. It was a feeling close to panic, in recognition of what might happen and how powerless I felt. Thank goodness I’m part of a big team, some of whom love battle and were quick to start writing and producing statements denouncing his appointment. Reports came out last week that of all the cabinet members, Tillerson is doing the best job keeping a close relationship to the president. Because this man is used to operating in secrecy, we’ll have to stay vigilant to understand the moves he’ll be making.
Then there is the remarkable story about the Dakota Access pipeline and the historic resistance at Standing Rock. At no other time has there been this much widespread opposition to a pipeline, for the many reasons pipelines merit our opposition. This represented an alliance of tribes whose rights, livelihoods and lives have been systematically desecrated by the US government and corporations. The camp at Standing Rock itself was a symbol of everything Trumpism cannot be: spiritually grounded, connected to history and land, fundamentally respectful of the rights of nature and peoples, infused with art and music and heart. It moved people to act in solidarity all over the world. Many moved money out of the banks invested in the project.
And the resistance worked. The forces at Standing Rock peacefully made sure that the Obama administration put a stop to the construction and allowed further review of the pipeline’s viability.
So it was with cruelty – the same cruelty seen in the enactment of the Muslim travel ban and the gamble with the healthcare of 24 million people – that Trump signed an executive order to begin construction immediately. At the end of March, oil began to flow through the pipeline. This is why I’m still crying in church. The minute I start to feel numb, I believe I’ll lose some hope and resolve.
And there is another animating goal. Progressives share so much, but so often our human nature and lopsided structures get in the way. Can we use this moment to be honest with each other in a new and different way, and clear up longstanding disagreements and inequalities that enable us to be aligned behind a common vision? Because I believe we will take power back. And when that happens, we need to enact a very bold agenda that catapults political possibilities far, far away from where Trump has dragged them.
This work is already under way: it’s the work of conversations between unions and environmentalists; large, well-funded organisations and smaller grassroots ones; centrist and more radical activists; and those who believe change comes from disrupting unjust laws and those whose work is to pass just ones.
It’s the work of the People’s Climate March, which will take place on Saturday, 29 April in Washington DC and throughout the rest of the country. Its message aspires to the future we’re trying to build, and it’s being organised by a diverse cross-section of the entire movement.
That tearful day in church ended on a high note. Afterwards, some friends and I went to New York’s MoMA PS1 museum to see the Rev Osagyefo Uhuru Sekou perform. Rev Sekou is a Pentecostal minister, an author and a gospel and blues musician, who has been active in the Movement for Black Lives. Yes, I went to church twice that day, and no, that isn’t the norm for me! And when he sang “What a time to be alive, the revolution has come”, I didn’t feel like crying – I felt like getting back to work.
20 January 2017 marked a turning point for the entire world. Since the election results were announced on 8 November 2016 I’d been feeling mostly numb, unable to process what the impact would be for me, my family and the people I care about. I felt the need to be quiet, to be somewhere quiet. To have space to think.
Every step I took felt like walking on eggshells. The first few weeks after the election everyone around me seemed to be unsure, fearful and riddled with anxiety. I was too. Quick to lash out, slow to listen. I had nothing to start from except what I’d heard during the campaign.
And yet, at the same time, I did know what was coming. Perhaps somewhere my cells were reorganising to protect my heart from what was inevitable. More suffering, more uncertainty. More people dying for trying to live. During the campaign, the surrogates for our current president unabashedly attacked Black Lives Matter activists as “terrorists” and “cop killers”. In the aftermath of the election, there were many different responses. Some decided to continue their work as before and felt that not much had changed. Others decided to demonstrate their resistance by doing a direct action at the inauguration. Others shared information about the key players in the incoming administration, attempting to support others in the network to understand more clearly the new political agenda. All of us remain committed to the work of black liberation.
During the holidays, my family and I talked over dinner about personal security. I described to them a new set of protocols we would need to begin using in order to ensure our safety, insofar as that was even possible. My parents described their fear of what was to come. A lawsuit filed by a rabid conservative former district attorney hung over our heads as someone charged us and other activists with “starting a race war”. Indeed, the election of Donald Trump was like a nuclear plume slowly rising over the United States.
What I’ve learned in the first 100 days of this administration is that you can never stop dreaming about freedom. I’ve spent the past few months being relatively quiet. Listening. Brushing up on my reading about the right wing in the United States and the movement it has been diligently building for the past 30 years. I’ve taken to a practice of listening more and also listening less. Listening more to what’s not being said, watching as the various factions on the right joust for power and influence. I’ve taken stock of the damage, as the right wing now controls the presidency, the supreme court, Congress and the majority of state legislatures. Listening less to voices that refuse to deal with our political reality as it actually is, as opposed to how they want it to be.
The low points over the past few months have been many. Executive order after executive order that sought to punish the communities that make America great – Muslims, undocumented immigrants, black people, women, queer communities, transgender people. A “law and order” agenda that seeks to criminalise anyone who disagrees with the administration’s aims. An attorney general who refuses to protect each person equally. A secretary of education who seeks to privatise public education. A secretary of housing and urban development who seeks to slash an already paper-thin budget for housing set aside for those living in poverty. A chief strategist with white supremacist leanings who is responsible not just for advising the president, but who, to all intents and purposes, is the one pushing the many decisions that this so-called president espouses on television. And of course, the recent bombings of Syria and Afghanistan. Certainly, we are in for a long fight and not all of us will make it.
I comfort my parents who are concerned about the state of their healthcare. They’re both in their 60s and have recently retired. And so, while the Affordable Care Act isn’t perfect, it is what they have and it is what they depend on. And it is what they deserve, what every human being on this Earth deserves – to be cared for.
And yet I am hopeful. The disorganisation of our political landscape offers abundant opportunities for new strategies and a transformation in the way we care for one another. I welcome the opportunity to be closer to my neighbours, to fight for myself, my family and my loved ones with every fibre of my being. Inside of the quiet, the cynicism dissipates. We have no choice other than to fight back, to take back what was always flawed but still holds the promise of what could be.
I remember that the resistance is real and it lives. The day before the president is inaugurated, I join more than a million women in the streets of Washington, DC; for many, this was their first time on a demonstration. When the president followed orders from his chief strategist to institute a travel ban on Muslims, airports were shut down by those fighting for democracy and those caught in the crosshairs of such a ridiculous endeavour were given legal support and reunited with their families. I work with the National Domestic Workers Alliance, a prominent voice and political vehicle for the millions of domestic workers in the United States who are still excluded from most federal labour protections – and so when the president initially nominated a man for secretary of labour who was known for his opposition to workers’ rights, we participated in the resistance to stop him from being confirmed. Representatives returned to their home districts and were forced to face their constituents in ways that they haven’t had to in decades.
And so, while there are many challenges to overcome, it is good to know that we are not alone in attempting to find the solutions necessary to save our lives and the lives of millions who are vulnerable not just in the United States, but around the world. Wherever there is oppression, there is resistance. I’m happy to know which side I’m on.
I live in the heart of Trump country, in Meigs County, Ohio, a rural county struggling with poverty and addiction. My neighbours are precisely the people the right wing have been preying on and propagandising while the left abandoned them for decades. I wasn’t terribly surprised to see Clinton had lost. I’d just published a column in the Guardian about why so many people would be voting for Trump. But I wept on election night and then got well and truly drunk, because I didn’t want to think about what was coming next.
My household is bracing for disaster. I wrote a book, Hand to Mouth, about what a precarious life feels like, but this is the first time I’ve felt precarity coming in my bones and also had enough income to assuage my fears of: not enough food, not enough warmth, not enough anything on hand to deal with an emergency. I have a garden, as anyone in the country does, but we got serious about it after the election. This is the first year I’ve thought that food prices will spike enough to make it worth focusing on the garden as a food source, not just a hobby. Increased immigration raids will likely leave food rotting in the fields and shipping costs will probably go up as they do during periods of uncertainty; imported food will be more expensive.
And the more the country talked about Russia, the more sense it made to expand the plans we had for a few tomatoes and beans to include asparagus and maybe some root vegetables because they’ll keep just fine. The logic: oil and power costs tend to spike when Russia’s doing a thing and we’re bombing the Middle East. Then we thought: maybe berry bushes. A few fruit trees. And a herb patch. And maybe we should borrow a tiller at this point or buy one? Just now, I’m mapping out two weeks of my schedule around harvest time so I can be home to do the food preservation. We’re not about freeze-dried food storage yet; right now people are still only joking about nukes.
Besides, this part of the country’s turning into a rainforest. A decade ago this part of Ohio didn’t reach such high temperatures. Now summers are lush and humid, while winters are becoming harsher. So it’s not such a bad idea, if you happen to have the land and the time to get the work done, to be working on sustainability. Partially that’s environmentalism, but it’s an economic consideration too. It’s a thing we talk about over dinner at home or with friends. We also talk about power. Electricity is expensive, so is heating oil, and gas ain’t free either. Power will only get more expensive as regulations are rolled back and the market is left to its own devices. Water is already a scarce commodity. Might as well put in some solar panels if you can afford it.
I spent the weeks between the election and the inauguration mostly glued to Twitter. I tried to help people reason through what had just happened. I impatiently explained the philosophical and historical definition of fascism versus the hyperbolic version. I demanded we all grow up and focus on the important stuff: not what had happened, but what was coming. My audience grew and split into groups – people who liked my satirical round-ups of the incoming administration’s peccadilloes, people who liked that I discussed the reasons we were vulnerable to a demagogue, people who just wanted someone to explain what the hell had happened.
I started taking more note of political conversation I heard around me, too, here in rural Ohio, where they went for Trump hard. Consensus seemed to be building that voting Trump hadn’t worked but as it was a last-ditch attempt anyway, it was worth waiting to see. Nobody quite agreed on what he was supposed to have done or, rather, there were a lot of things. Mostly, he was supposed to have disrupted everything – but not exactly like this. He needed to get off that stupid Twitter, anyway, everyone agreed on that. I keep wondering what these people didn’t learn from the Tea Party.
Once the inauguration was over, I largely quit trying to explain anything to anyone online; emotion was riding too high and we were back to breaking news instead of analysis and I was planning a garden, so I started joking that no matter what happened, at least I had fertile land and a defensible perimeter. When the kids weren’t listening, we talked about what guns to buy.
Between the realisation that we were moving into a time of instability and trying to keep up with the daily domestic outrages, I couldn’t muster the energy to care about who had what ties with Russia. As far as I could tell, nobody knew anything concrete and it was all an expenditure of nervous tension, something tangible to turn like a Rubik’s Cube. I watched friends I respect come to personal attacks over whether Bernie or Hillary would have been better, instead of concentrating on the task at hand, which was: we damn well did have Trump.
If we could find someone to blame, we could avoid blaming ourselves: I watched it all spin around me and decided it wasn’t for me. I was going to concentrate on writing a book instead, paying closer attention to the world around me. I hoped that maybe by writing it I could answer my own questions: how did we get to this point where we seem incapable of governing? Where is this division and can we heal it? Most important, how is everyone experiencing all this unrest? I have always had a difficult time drawing a line between journalism and activism. I just go places and watch things and I write about them. I am a curious sort and my readers tend to be interested in the same things I am. Which I suppose is why, when faced with a country I hardly recognise, my instinct is to set off around the nation asking people impertinent questions and share what they tell me with everyone else.
Three months in, my neighbours who discuss politics in public and voted for Trump seem to be split between unreasonable partisan shills and people who voted for disruption because it was that or more of the same. It seems many people really were hoping that someone with no experience might – just maybe – do it differently. Only he’s turning out to be worse than anyone we’ve ever had so far and now discussion is turning to whether we even have a functioning government any more.
It’s a fight between what I know my country should be and what I see it turning into, which is the plaintive cry of all American millennials. I am 34 years old and I have watched my country poisoned by fear and hate, watched generations before me sell out my future and that of my children, watched us destroy the whole world’s economy and within months get back to business as usual and record highs in the markets. I do not have youthful hope for America, not now, and certainly not in Trump’s twisted version of freedom and progress where we hate and fear anyone who isn’t exactly like us and we have no charity for a fellow citizen. I was no fan of Hillary Clinton either, but at least she was only likely to enrich herself and her friends within reasonable limits. I can understand wanting power for power’s sake even if I wish leadership looked less like plutocracy. But I cannot, will not fathom the intentional hollowing of everything I have been taught to cherish.
I got a tattoo recently, for the first time since mid-2015. I get tattooed when I am wrestling with something very difficult, because I prefer to keep reminders than to learn lessons twice.

Harvesting is the single biggest cost factor for this option, due to need to de-water recovered biomass prior to converting to ""something""; anything, in fact, that legitimately closes the carbon loop. 
Environmental / energy / carbon burdens are also issues. Pick your algal-growth data set of choice, and just one example would then be that a 500 MW coal-fired power station requires 30 square km (3,000 ha) of ponds. At least the water in the ponds need not be fresh, and surprisingly would represent less volume than that consumed by a forest of equivalent sequestration-power. 
By contrast, Rio Tinto in Australia has 1,500,000 ha of mining lease land in Western Australia that it currently uses to run cattle. It is irrigating 850 ha of this land, based on de-watering a mining pit and booking the additional carbon sequestered in the soil. This is separate from the potential increased economic yield from improved grazing from irrigated rangeland. (I think; you will need to inform yourselves on that.) 
So, potentially, yes, there are vast tracts of land available, in some countries; no, the crop does not need to be trees; there is always something however, such as, what happens when the mine stops de-watering in the above instance; or when the granulated slag could be re-purposed to replace Portland cement?

Why? 
From a pedant's perspective, the simple answer to LG's question on scale is ... the same scale as our existing global coal and oil industries. 
36 B tonnes of carbon dioxide annually is equivalent to 9.8 B tonnes of carbon; we currently mine 8 B tonnes of coal pa @ 65% carbon (give or take 20%); plus, we extract 4 B tonnes of oil pa @ 85% carbon; so, crudely, the mass balance closes out. 
If this carbon, released as gas, was captured in such a way as to be re-used rather than stored, the perspective changes. The only feasible market that could handle the sequestered volume is energy, and obviously such an energy industry already exists. So, 200 years to re-tool this industry to become one capable of closing its own loop might be a tad pessimistic? 
However, and perhaps more realistically, LG's broader issue of where would you get the area to either process and/or store this CO2 initially is still valid.

The term is no such thing. We are talking engineered ponds, not open ecosystems. Ironically, one of the problems with ponds is their tendency to become open ecosystems, where weed species out-compete. This need not be a problem, from a sequestration point of view, as you may produce more biomass. It is a problem however if you can't then turn this biomass, toxic or otherwise, into something useful. 
Algae systems are used commercially for specialty chemical production in places like Hawaii, including using flue gas directly to fertilise with CO2 and nutrients as NOx and SOx. The economics don't stack up at large scale however, as the only feasible product (ie available mass market) is energy. And the only way to make this energy cost-effective is if it can displace fossil energy, first, and at a competitive price, second. It can't.
Co-benefits from algae systems do however muddy the waters and are a good example of needing to take a systems approach to analyse options, including those of using slag or mine tailings for geosequestration. On the San Francisco Bay, algae ponds are used to strip harmful nutrients from wastewater before the biomass is recovered and converted to biogas; this gas fuels the whole treatment facility.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1492958912000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'4659181', u'in_reply_to': u'97136535', u'id': u'97139604', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ComfortablyPlumb', u'text': u'it isn't an either/or proposition.We need to be doing all of it.

yes, but you need to be very careful with chemistry. You need to know every single chemical being used history before you can judge how much better accelerating the weathering cycle:
https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/CarbonCycle/page2.php
Most of the available sites simply have already added the CO2 in the first place and while there is some potential one or two schemes are likely worse CO2 than direct use.
In this case, I don't think that there is really much harm that can be done but the question is are there better uses of the Calcium Silicate and Iron slag:
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cement-from-carbon-dioxide/
And the real problem is when talking about adding it to new plants, the modern process should be MOE anyway.

With the steel at best you are looking to recapture a small % of the CO2 that was added from the steel in the first place.
The chemistry that he is discussing is trivial with the limestone being 
CaCO3 + heat -> CaO + CO2
Which is a reversible reaction. The CaCO3 isn't needed for steel production and we should infact be using molten ore electrolysis 
http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2013/05/greener-cleaner-steel-metal-oxide-electrolysis
The thing is that in schemes like this that to use air with 0.04% CO2 is not particularly effective and the longer CO2 cycle of weathering is likely to very slowly remove the CO2. 
But even if it does work and it doesn't hurt to try as long as you don't use chemical processes which create more CO2 than you remove, it can never be on a scale to make a meaningful difference.
The best location is also chemical reactions that produce pure CO2. 
More interesting would be if the slag could be used as one of the greener alternatives to concrete. 
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cement-from-carbon-dioxide/

Its dawning saw the start of the widespread burning of coal for factories and steam engines and, as a result, the beginning of significant outputs of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Our climate is now warming noticeably as these emissions have accumulated across the planet.
The British landscape has also been changed dramatically. In particular, the countryside is now peppered with piles of slag left over from old steel mills. Landscaping these piles of industrial waste has required major efforts by local authorities in recent decades.
But now a British scientist is planning to use slag heaps to deal with the climate change. Based at Cardiff University’s school of earth and ocean sciences, Phil Renforth is preparing to test the feasibility of using iron and steel slag deposits to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. His three-year project, which has just been awarded a £300,000 grant by the Natural Environment Research Council (Nerc), is set to begin in Consett, County Durham, and Port Talbot, south Wales.
Renforth’s first step will actually be to make more of the industrial waste piles. “The aim is not to use old slag heaps to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but to carry out trials that will show how we can extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by pumping air through newly created slag heaps,” he told the Observer last week.
During the process of steel-making, iron ore is mixed with limestone or dolomite and heated to extremely high temperatures. The end results are steel and slag, a waste mixture of calcium and magnesium silicates and oxides. Piles of this ore-processing leftover have been dumped around the countryside over several centuries.
“Often these heaps have been landscaped very nicely,” said Renforth, who has worked on the project with Will Mayes of Hull University. “There is one in Consett that has been turned into lovely parkland where people can walk their dogs. They are all round the country. Wherever we have made iron, we have left a pile of slag.”
Earlier research by Renforth has shown that carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is absorbed by material inside slag heaps. “We now want to see if we can improve the rate of this absorption so that can we make significant reductions in atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide in the future,” added Renforth.
To do this, Renforth’s project will proceed in two stages. “First, we will drill into one of these old, historic slag heaps and see what has been happening there over the years and understand what chemical processes have been going on as rainwater has brought carbon dioxide into the heap.
“And then we will start the second stage. We will create our own mini-heap – about the size of a skip – and play with its chemistry to try to optimise its ability to sequester carbon from the atmosphere.” These slag-based carbon sequestrators could then be used as models of larger devices that could reduce carbon levels in the atmosphere, Renforth added.
The UK produces 3-4m tonnes of slag a year while the total global production is estimated as being about 500m tonnes a year at present. However, this rate could increase as developing nations catch up, added Renforth. “Our calculations suggest that we might produce between 100bn and 200bn tonnes of slag cumulatively by the end of this century,” added Renforth. “That has the potential to remove 50-100bn tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere, we believe.”
Finding effective ways to achieve carbon dioxide extraction – or sequestration, as it is also known – is considered to be of vital importance in stabilising global warming to below 2C. While the burning of coal and oil for electricity generation can be substantially replaced with the use of renewable or nuclear energy sources, scientists say there will still be a need to burn some forms of fossil fuel – for the aerospace industry, for example – and this use will continue to add carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. So finding ways to suck it out – to balance this continued output of carbon – could still have a very important role to play in limiting climate change.
“We are going to have think about ways of not just limiting carbon emissions but of actually removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and it may well be that technology based on slag leftovers from the steel industry could play a key role,” added Renforth.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/23/can-slag-heaps-help-save-the-planet-carbon-dioxide-capture-climate-change

If we don’t change our ways we’re expecting something like 3 feet of sea level rise in the next century, and it could be 2 and it could be 4 and it could be 20. 
The chance that we will cross thresholds that commit us to loss of big chunks of West Antarctica and huge sea level rise is real.
So when you start doing “Well you’re not sure,” but there’s a chance of really bad things and the uncertainties are mostly on the bad side, could be a little better or a little worse or a lot worse, but we’ll be breaking things.

The Sun is currently showing no increase in activity.
Solar scientists don't agree with you.
Some so-called climate sceptics helped to fund a project which they imagined would support their position - the independently-funded Berkeley Earth project.
Set up in 2010, Berkeley Earth completely rechecked all the temperature data (at least as far back as 1880 - they are working back further now).
BE was set up to deal with all the points made by so-called climate sceptics.
Many so-called climate sceptics said this was exactly what they wanted, and they would accept what BE reported.
When BE reported that their research agreed with other researchers that:
- the Earth is warming;
- has been since the 19th century;
- and that greenhouse gases produced by human activity are the cause....

Climate change deniers argue that the Sun is the main cause of climate change. But the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum in the record, when the Sun's energy reaching Earth was least. Yet, there was more energy coming in than going out. This shows that the effect of the Sun's variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses, mainly from burning fossil fuels.

The billionaire said in an interview there was no political motive tied to the release of his new book, Climate of Hope: How Cities, Businesses, and Citizens Can Save the Planet, which is co-authored with the Sierra Club executive director, Carl Pope.
“I’m not running for office,” the 75-year-old said, who considered a 2016 presidential bid after serving three terms as mayor of New York.
His new book, he said, offers a specific policy objective: to help save the Paris climate agreement, which was signed a year ago.
Under the deal, the US pledged that by 2025 it would reduce its annual greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels, which would be a reduction of about 1.6bn tons.
The Trump White House is debating whether to abandon the pact, as the president promised during his campaign. This week, days before thousands of protesters around the US marched in support of scientific research, a meeting on the issue was abruptly cancelled.
On Sunday, a White House official told Reuters Trump would sign several executive orders on energy this week. In March, Trump signed an executive order to roll back Obama-era climate change regulations such as the clean power plan.
“This builds on previous executive actions that have cleared the way for job-creating pipelines, innovations in energy production and reduced unnecessary burden on energy producers,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Bloomberg said he believed the US would hit its Paris goals regardless of what Trump chooses to do, because of leadership at the state level and market forces at play in the private sector.
“Washington won’t determine the fate of our ability to meet our Paris commitment,” he said. “And what a tragedy it would be if the failure to understand that led to an unraveling of the agreement. We hope this book will help to correct that wrong impression – and help save the Paris deal.”
Bloomberg has played a prominent role in some of the fiercest US policy debates, having invested millions in an advocacy group that pushes for stronger gun control and another that promotes liberal immigration policies. In his new book, which follows what a spokeswoman described as $80m in donations to the Sierra Club, he solidifies his status as a prominent advocate of action to combat climate change.
His policy repertoire aligns him with core values of the Democratic party, although he has no formal political affiliation.
In the interview, Bloomberg shrugged off conservatives who condemn him as an east coast elitist. He noted that policies he helped initiate in New York City – including a smoking ban and high taxes on sugary drinks – have caught on elsewhere.
“My goal has been to save and improve lives,” he said. “Some ways of doing that can be controversial at first, but end up being highly popular and successful.”
In his focus on climate change, Bloomberg directs particularly aggressive language at the coal industry.
“I don’t have much sympathy for industries whose products leave behind a trail of diseased and dead bodies,” he writes in his book, adding: “But for everyone’s sake, we should aim to put them out of business.”
Similar language haunted Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid last year and fueled criticism from Trump and other top Republicans that Democrats were engaged in a “war on coal”.
Asked about the consequences for politicians who embrace such a stance, Bloomberg offered a pragmatic approach.
“The fact is coal in Appalachia is running out,” he said, criticizing a Trump campaign pledge: “Washington can’t put generations of people back to work in a dying industry.”
Saying coalminers “have paid a terrible price” for their work and the decline of the industry, Bloomberg disclosed for the first time plans to donate $3m to organizations that help unemployed miners and their communities find new economic opportunities. Bloomberg Philanthropies highlights the plight of coalminers in a new film to be shown at the Tribeca film festival on Wednesday.
He avoided condemning the Trump administration directly, however, largely casting the new president’s steps on climate change as irrelevant. Asked about Bloomberg’s statements, the White House declined to comment.
“As it turns out, Trump’s election makes the book’s message – that the most important solutions lie outside of Washington – even more important and urgent,” Bloomberg said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/23/michael-bloomberg-ignore-trump-climate-change

As fish stocks deplete in coastal waters because of overfishing and climate change, fishermen have no option but to venture ever further out to sea on small boats, flimsy canoes and catamarans. These modest craft are prone to accidents, especially during the monsoon season from June to August. The absence of navigational aids, radio communication or safety devices heightens the risks.
Radio Monsoon, a collaborative project that grew out of a competition at the University of Sussex, is designed to help, using a low-tech forecast service to ensure safer working conditions among the 30,000-plus fishing families in the area.
During its pilot, Radio Monsoon provided daily forecasts in the local language of Malayalam, specifically tailored for 10 fishing villages along the 80km Thiruvananthapuram coast. These areas are particularly vulnerable to bad weather and natural disasters. 
Based on data from India’s national meteorological department and the centre for ocean information services , as well as local knowledge, Radio Monsoon’s forecasts are disseminated through social media, loudspeakers placed in harbours, and by word of mouth.
Fishermen can also access forecasts over a phone line supported by an internet server. Their feedback is collected regularly and relayed to the forecasters so that the information can be adapted to their needs.
Maxmillan Martin, who is from Kerala and is now a research associate at the University of Sussex, first had the idea for Radio Monsoon in collaboration with friends after the devastating tsunami of 2004. 
In June and from then on, it's do-or-die trips for us. The sea faces terrible storms
The group – a retired teacher, a journalist, a user interface designer and a social media expert, all from Kerala – came up with a narrowcast system whereby forecasts recorded on to CDs would be played in the harbour. “It was a very low-tech intervention but the fishermen loved it and the local forecasters did too,” says Martin. “It worked but we went on with our lives.”
Martin, who has a background in geography, resurrected the idea while doing his PhD at the University of Sussex, entering it into a competition for innovation funding. A full-blown pilot followed in 2014, and ran on a “shoestring budget” until 2016, when funds ran out.
Team now plans to relaunch and expand the project, monitoring its impact on fatalities and the search and rescue operations that currently save about 3,000 lives a year.
Before Radio Monsoon, there was no widely used local and regular marine weather information service for local fishing communities. With families reliant on the money made from fishing hauls, a culture of risk-taking emerged.
“Once, my boat capsized and I hit my head. I had to swim and reach the shore,” recalls Sebastian Kristudasan, 40, a fisherman in Kerala. “In such situations, if someone is nearby, they will save the fisherman; we save ourselves or we are gone.”
Fishermen usually venture 70-80km from shore, says Kristudasan, adding that it can be difficult to navigate back if they go out too far. “Long ago, people could navigate looking at [the] stars. Now we don’t do that. GPS can help us coordinate. If there is no GPS, we go to a distance where we can see the shore and the mountains.
“Beyond that, we estimate the distance by using our hands [the distance between the tips of outstretched hands being one fathom or six feet].”
Wilson Franklin, another local fisherman, says: “In June and from then on, it is do-or-die trips for us. The sea faces terrible storms. You can die, or lose your gear, you can escape on some other land, or suffer an accident while returning. Or you can come back safe. You have to careful during these three months. By September the sea becomes calmer.”
Martin said fishermen do not always heed advice, especially since their livelihood depends on them going out to fish whatever the weather. “They told us they just take their gear on to the boats and nothing for safety, because they believe they just need to be able to swim. If they are good swimmers, then they can do it; if not, the attitude was ‘Well, that’s too bad.’ They are not really afraid because it’s just part of their lives. The way they perceive risk is totally different than how we do.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/apr/24/radio-monsoon-safety-fishermen-south-india-kerala

A coalition of pressure groups including Action on Smoking and Health, Greenpeace, Public Citizen and the Sierra Club have written to the CEOs of the three companies asking them to stop funding the powerful business group.
In a letter to Disney’s boss, Bob Iger, the coalition points to the media company’s commitment to reduce its net greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2020, its support of the Paris climate agreement and its ban on depictions of smoking in theme parks and all G, PG and PG-13 movies.
“Unfortunately, the US Chamber of Commerce is doing everything it can to block efforts to combat both climate change and anti-smoking laws and regulations. It opposes the Paris Agreement that you publicly support, is suing to block the implementation of the Clean Power Plan, consistently lobbies against legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and spends millions of dollars in money on elections ads urging voters to back candidates who support the fossil fuel industry and oppose efforts to combat climate change,” they write.
The US Chamber of Commerce is the world’s largest business organization and represents more than 3m businesses, large and small. Under its president and CEO, Thomas Donohue, who took over the chamber in 1997, it has become a political powerhouse with global influence, although it is secretive about its membership. 
Last year alone it spent $104m on lobbying, the most of any lobby group. It has used its influence to fight anti-tobacco legislation across the world. The chamber campaigned against US sanctions on Russia after its incursions into Ukraine and Donohue met Egypt’s authoritarian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, after his recent White House visit. 
The activists’ campaign comes as some of the world’s largest companies have quietly severed ties with the chamber. According to an analysis by Public Citizen, at least 13 of the world’s biggest companies (Costco, eBay, Hewlett-Packard, General Mills, Kellogg, Kraft Heinz, Mars, Mattel, Mondelēz, Nestlé, Starbucks, Unilever and Walgreens Boots Alliance*) have quit the US Chamber of Commerce in recent years amid political disagreements and worries about its stance on the environment. 
A number of those companies confirmed to the Guardian that they were no longer members but would not speak on the record about their reasons for leaving. Other companies did not return emails and calls for comment. A spokesman for the chamber disputed the companies that had left and their reasons for leaving but she declined to confirm which companies had stayed.
“The chamber has never disclosed and does not disclose its membership and therefore I will not be able to confirm or deny who is or isn’t a member. However, I can tell you that your list is simply wrong, and it would be inaccurate for you to report that those companies have left the chamber for the reasons you mentioned in your inquiry,” Blair Latoff Holmes, vice-president of media and external communications, said.
The chamber claims to be a bipartisan organisation but has become increasingly partisan. For the first time last year, 100% of its election spending backed Republican candidates. Holmes said: “Our endorsements are made by a lawmaker’s scorecard, and their views on the issues that are important to our membership and the American business community, based on economic growth and job creation. In recent years, Republicans have scored higher than Democrats on issues of importance to the business community but we have maintained a bipartisan approach to the candidates we support and have bestowed awards such as the ‘Spirit of Enterprise’ award to Republicans and Democrats alike.”
The pressure group’s lobbying has already led to a number of high-profile, and public, departures. In 2015, the pharmacy giant CVS quit, citing the lobby group’s pro-tobacco work. CVS, the first major drugstore to remove tobacco products from its shelves, said it had been “surprised” by a New York Times report that the chamber lobbied foreign governments to ease restrictions on tobacco sales.
In 2009, the chamber called for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to hold “the Scopes monkey trial of the 21st century” – a trial that put creationist theory up against evolutionary science – in order to discuss humanity’s role in climate change. That same year, Apple and the utility companies Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) and Excelon left the chamber, citing its anti-environmental advocacy. 
“We find it dismaying that the chamber neglects the indisputable fact that a decisive majority of experts have said the data on global warming are compelling and point to a threat that cannot be ignored,” the PG&amp;E chairman and chief executive, Peter Darbee, told the chamber.
Nike too has voiced criticism of the lobby group’s climate stance, saying it “fundamentally disagrees with the US Chamber of Commerce’s position on climate change”.
Dan Dudis, director of chamber watch at Public Citizen, said activists would target other chamber members in the coming months. “We are looking at companies that have explicit public policy positions that run counter to the chamber’s stance.” 
He said the chamber was “pushing the interests of a minority” by claiming to represent a broad swath of businesses. “Those businesses might give $500,000 or $1m for trade lobbying but money is fungible,” he said. “That cash frees up money for the chamber to lobby against climate change legislation, for tobacco and against the interests of many of its members.

“Pessimists selling to optimists.” That’s how one former Florida coastal property owner describes the current state of the market in a must-read Bloomberg story. Right now, science and politics don’t favor the optimists. The disintegration of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is speeding up, providing increasing evidence we are headed for the worst-case scenario of sea level rise — three to six feet (or more) by 2100. The impacts are already visible in South Florida. “Tidal flooding now predictably drenches inland streets, even when the sun is out, thanks to the region’s porous limestone bedrock,” explains Bloomberg. “Saltwater is creeping into the drinking water supply.”

The global March for Science started as a small community based in Washington DC after online discussion sparked shortly after Donald Trump’s inaugration in January, but grew to encompass hundreds of satellite groups in cities from New Zealand to South Korea to Switzerland.
Readers in those countries and many more got in touch to tell us why they were taking part – below are some of their stories.
I took part because at a time when we so badly need to maintain hard-won momentum on tackling climate change, politics around the world is taking us in the other direction – ignoring clear scientific imperative. In the Arctic regions where I’ve worked, climate change is already having huge impacts. I’m afraid and frustrated that the window of time we have to reduce emissions and minimise the suffering climate change will cause to people is now closing
I hope the march has made scientists more visible, and shown that as a community we do have a real passion for reason and truth. It can be hard to know what to believe or who to listen to at the moment. We need to show that science is credible, its based on reason and evidence and that we’re not prepared to let scientific facts be misrepresented to the public. 
I wanted to show support for the March for Science in Washington DC. It is very important to me that science be robustly funded, and that children all over the world get quality STEM education. I’m also concerned about transparency in science – peer-reviewed science should not be censored so am uniting behind the #sciencenotsilence hashtag.
I probably feel most strongly about representing veganism at the march. If you care about deforestation, water preservation, energy use, greenhouse gasses – you have to be vegan. If you care about animal cruelty, animal welfare, animal exploitation – you have to be vegan. If you care about antibiotic-resistant infection – you have to be vegan. If you care about obesity, heart disease, diabetes and various cancers – you have to be vegan. And for me it’s the science that tells us this.
Science cannot be silenced, there needs to be a free flow of information in all fields of science, and funding for education, research, conferences, etc, with no strings attached. The current atmosphere is one of “gag orders” and meddling in how science is taught, disseminated, and used to support verifiable facts that do not always support the agenda of certain factions in a number of countries. In the US this has become especially problematic, with large cuts in national and state funding that will impact health, research, and natural resources. 
Its time to make ourselves heard, and I do not believe that “science should not be politicised”, as some say. Science has been politicised since before Galileo. I hope the march sends a message of global cooperation and shared values within the scientific community, and to the public in general that science is not locked up in ivory towers or museums or laboratories. We are part of everyday activities, we are the people on the street.
This man's Trump takedown is complicated. Ask a physicist for the derivative of acceleration.

I wanted to To underline the importance of the scientific method. It is the best tool that we, human beings, currently have to interrogate the world that surrounds us. It poses a question, finds the conditions to test it appropriately, repeats this test rigorously to asses whether the results can be reproduced, and leads to an answer supported by evidence. It is evidence-based, not opinion-besed, and open to feedback. Evidence, fact-checking – and responsible Googling – do matter. Let’s build our society and educational system on these principles. 
Geneva is home to many international organisations and has more than its fair share of scientists. The speakers at the rally before the Geneva March for Science included: James Beacham, a particle physicist at CERN; Hilal Lashuel, a Molecular Biologist studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s; and Mike Sparrow, Senior Scientific Officer of the World Climate Research Programme.
I took part in the march today partly for political reasons: politicians need to recognise the benefits of science to society and ensure that policy is guided by evidence, not by lobbyists for vested interests. But also for personal reasons: I have close family members who will dismiss facts in order to maintain their beliefs. I want to affirm that as new information comes to light, we should integrate it into our beliefs: facts are immutable, but beliefs can change.

I find that the recent political developments and shift in society’s view on research, its practitioners and its findings, threatens the good relationship between society as a whole a the small portion of it that lives primarily for and from research (not only science). 
I hope that by showing others who researchers are, and explaining what we do on the occasion of March for Science, we may be able to initiate a new dialogue that will foster mutual learning and trust. March for Science is an opportunity for all researchers to come together and show others in society that although we all have a different voice and question, we do all believe that the scientific method we apply and the questions we consider are of prime importance to us all.

Shouldn't leaders do the right thing above all else? Climate change is by far the most dangerous threat to the welfare of humanity now and for the centuries ahead, well and widely document over decades by thousands of scientists, does that not mean anything to our leaders? Shouldn't our political system favour morality? 
Unfortunately, our world does not yet work that way and the modern democratic political system does not favour or function on morality. It has no onus to honour promises or accept responsibility or to be accountable. Scientists being ignored and now walking up and down the streets in desperation, is simply another symptom of the underlying issue, and that is the issue of political corruption blocking action on climate change.
Yes, there are other issues too as noted, corruption of the media, misinformation amongst the public and so on. But since a solution can only come through law, and no amount of demonstration or marching will make any difference in the face of the vast lobbying power of the fossil fuel industry, the need now is to recognise that the solution to beginning action must be political, and most likely political system change not just a change of party.

Climatologists are using computer modelling to try and work out the future global climate. Are you denying that?
Computer modelling depends on many factors and is very often wrong depending on the datasets employed and how the data are manipulated. Are you denying that?
Climate change will occur in the future with or without human intervention due to events such as volcanism, impacts by extraterrestrial objects, variations in the intensity and timing of heat from the sun etc. Are you denying that?
I selected passages from one source and I provided the link to the source so that it could be checked. If the source is incorrect, then it is the fault of the authors.

JulesBywaterLees - Representing 27 countries the problem with a chief advisor
BQEND
We now seem to be getting to the heart of your misunderstanding.The Scientific Adviser doesn't represent 27 countries, she represents the body of scientific evidence. The problem arises when the scientific evidence runs counter to a lobbyists's interests.
As we saw in this case, when a scientific adviser presents evidence that runs against a lobbyist's interests, they lobby to get her sacked (or in this case to get the entire position of Chief Scientific Adviser abolished). It's the ""Serengeti Strategy"", where individual scientists are singled out, isolated and picked off by lobbyists whose interests run against the scientific evidence.
Anti-science climate sceptics have used this approach against scientists such as Michael Mann and James Hansen, Greenpeace used it against the European Commission's Chief Scientific Adviser, and so on.

I suppose the most preposterous aspect of Greenpeace's behaviour has been their response to the abolition of the Science Adviser position.You'd think they'd be welcoming the decision they lobbied for. Instead it's all ""Nothing to do with us guv"".
Looking at the responses to their actions from leading climate scientists and environment journalists, Greenpeace must see that it has alienated mainstream scientific opinion, and alienated the mainstream scientific community with its strategy of isolating and picking off individual scientists.
Preposterously, they've been trying to distance themselves from the anti-science agenda they themselves lobbied for.

You'll find all that's happening in the US as well.
A group called ""US Right to Know"", funded by anti-GM and anti-vaccine organisations, has been chasing US university scientists working in genomics and plant pathology with FoI requests for their emails.Any other scientist who complains about USRTK's activites gets hit with a retaliatory FoI request for their own emails. It's a sustained, well-funded campaign of harassment, like the one against climate scientists.
A very well connected anti-vaccine crackpot, Robert Kennedy Jr., has been lined up to lead Donald Trump's vaccine ""safety"" commission.
In the UK, Prof. David Nutt was sacked as a government adviser for stating the scientific evidence on drugs policy.
In the European Commission, the whole post of Chief Scientific Adviser was abolished when the Chief Scientific Adviser stated the scientific evidence on GM crops.

When you reach a scenario when people are driving all over the place just to use public services, then it's much better for the environment that you have a serviceable approximation of that service in your home instead, and I think that's more or less why things end up as they do, but it's a way less than optimal scenario, especially for densely populated area.
So everything which isn't in the home probably needs to be accessible on foot, or at worst local public transport, which means you have to have a lot of those things, whatever they might be, all over the place, and they have to be either more economical or of higher quality, or otherwise offer a preferable experience in some way, to your home conveniences. Else many would rather just stay at home and use those.
Government can't and won't fund a future like that, imo, because it can't afford to, even if it had any idea what it might look like, let alone the capacity to develop and maintain it. It seems increasingly to prefer to leave what might otherwise be public services to private corporations, putting the burden of finances and expertise on them. 
It does it in bits and pieces, like bike sharing schemes, and the old classics like playgrounds. I mean theoretically everyone could have a playground in their back garden, but not everyone has a back garden and even those who do generally recognise that the social experience of a playground is preferable to development to a walled experience of a back garden.
Sometimes there are attempts are more innovative expressions even, like adult gyms in public places, and these seem to be very well received, but they're still coming in dribs and drabs, and limited by the kind of Government funding which can be allocated. 
So as a half way house what I would suggest is somewhere between public and private ownership of services of that kind, in semi-permanent locations, or entirely mobile in function like the bike share schemes, that enhance the potential for shared experience for adults and children, outdoors or in public places like halls, and community centres, which would outshine the potential and functionality of private owned conveniences.
Reducing the amount the individual consumes in transportation and other major forms of consumption in and out of the home, but increasing the amount of enjoyment and experience, the amount of services they're able to make use of overall, so the quality of life experience can still raise in line with expectations and along with the rate of development of new and interesting technology, which I think will always serve as a powerful motivator force to those who have their baselines of survival and health met.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1493307303000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u""it ca n't afford to"", u'effect': u""wo n't fund a future like that imo""}], u'author_id': u'16593754', u'in_reply_to': u'97404380', u'id': u'97408445', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'JulesBywaterLees', u'text': u'Wow I'm impressed with Greenpeace's lobbying power if the 'dictatorial' EU bent under pressure- but perhaps they didn't, I don't know and they appear to be a scapegoat/excuse for the decision.

I agree that road vehicle usage is one of the big issues (which is increasing dramatically, and imo even electric vehicles don't represent a sufficient fix for that), but individual property ownership is another big one, and that seems like an unavoidable trend of development in a global marketplace.
The more rich and powerful a country becomes, the more it feels it can justify increased spending on luxuries, but if those luxuries are high energy and material intensive luxuries then this causes a big problem.
The difficulty that we're having is that an over-abundance of materials and energy in the short term is driving our habits towards production and consumption of unsustainable goods and lifestyles in which the bulk of the value is in the materials and energy, rather than as a function of the creative process, and this also maximises the potential of workers to produce, but only in the short term and only at a great environmental cost, and it doesn't necessarily produce enjoyment proportionate to that cost either.
An example of the opposite approach would be an artist who spends hundreds of hours on a piece of art, or even a software programmer spending thousands of hours on developing a piece of software or videogame. That's low environmental cost for a high intrinsic value product.
But then we need devices to run the software and play the videogames. In the 1980's everyone played their games at an arcade or went to a university to use computers, because they knew they would get a better quality service for less money than they could at home. That's the sensible economical and ecological way to do it, but it's not the most convenient way, and it's certainly not the most profitable way.
But it is the most social way. But most social approaches to problem solving are also exclusive. If you want to use the arcade you need money for the machines, and if you want to use the university computer you need to study there. If you want to get your laundry done at the shop you need to walk and wait in line with screaming kids etc. 
So I think to tackle climate issues, that social aspect of living needs to be rejuvenated, but it's very hard to convince people that it should be or that they would even enjoy it if it was. Just like the extreme eco argument suggests we need to return to the land and live like our ancestors, the main opposition is that it represents a step backwards, a impossible attempt to close Pandora's Box.
But to step forwards is much harder. For progress to be seen as a step forward is easy perhaps for the young, impressionable and idealistic, but there are powers at work whose agenda is to dispel what they see as the follies of youth with what they see as cold pragmatic realism.
The argument on climate progress is a settled matter for some, at least in theory, but when the practice doesn't seem to stack up with the theory, whether that's through lack of credible progress in industry and lifestyles, through apparent hypocrisy, or even (for the most pigheaded opponents) lack of experiential evidence of the damage of climate change or disproving of their chosen religious beliefs, then the case to oppose it becomes progressively strengthened. 
In the worst case, failure to progress sufficiently can even drive people in the direction of denialism or religious craziness. It can be seen as more comfortable to submit to the inevitability of an apocalyptic future than to recognise our failure, either as individuals or all together, to avert that future.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1493305189000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'it', u'effect': u'a big problem'}, {u'cause': u'they knew they would get a better quality service for less money than they could at home', u'effect': u""in the 1980 's everyone played their games at an arcade or went to a university to use computers""}], u'author_id': u'16593754', u'in_reply_to': u'97404380', u'id': u'97406610', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ATHERIS', u'text': u'BQSTART

BQENDI don't doubt there are many who advocate emissions reductions who live by their principles, and are even a net carbon benefit to the world. It's without doubt that this is true.
I also don't doubt there are many places on Earth where people still live responsibly by the land, using only (or at least mainly) what their environment can provide, but what I see as less likely is that enough people will manage to return to such a simple existence when the infrastructure of their country has shifted so far away from it.
Once you build all the roads and electrical grids and sanitation, once you build all the supermarkets stocked with every available food and drink from all four corners, there will always be a tight and inflexible minority (in some cases even a majority) who see all of those things as inalienable rights that no eco-warriors can take away from them at the ballot box, and so long as these options remain preferable to the alternatives which they're aware of, they'll continue to put their money in these directions.
People still buy palm oil and palm oil products, despite it's impact. People still buy powdered rhino horn.

Britain's per capita CO2 emissions are half those of Australia largely due to greater wind turbine generation
BQENDI wonder if that incorporates
all emissions ie ones locked up in the products we consume that were produced and shipped from overseas? These are some of the hardest things to measure, and I think they get left out of a lot of these figures.
I think in the future it should be possible to get an accurate carbon footprint reading on every product, in the same way we receive nutrition information labels on our food.

BQENDRight, and this is a fairly predictable trend wouldn't you say? Not one that can really respond easily to environmental campaigning, and not one that the people who the campaigners are appealing to can easily control, which is basically that point I was making.
These are appealing luxuries, but the good news is that there are even more appealing luxuries to which the world could divert it's interests and individual investments. Simplicity of existence seems to be something which is spoilt by exposure to complex existence. It expands our worldview in a way which is compelling and difficult to reverse.
People do still very much appreciate the idea of simplicity - we use devices and services which are simple to us, even though they're wildly complicated under the surface, and we mostly don't want to understand the complexity beneath the surface so long as they serve our interests.
So to change things comes down to increasing simplicity of operation, and expanding complexity of features and scope (novelty). True simplicity and innocence of existence of the kind you mention, living by traditional methods on the land, seems to be very vulnerable to development, especially with increased Internet access.

Over the last decade my campaigning has been political to get my daughter elected and at the last election remove the most environmentally damaging LNP (conservative) premier from his seat. Responsible government is an important way of achieving change and creating jobs. The Chinese economy has continued to grow over the last decade and the export of services, commodities and food to the Chinese market is are large factor in the Australian economy. As for steel making in China Australian exports of iron ore and coking coal are a significant part of our extractive industries. These industries are not winding up. However thermal coal demand and price has dropped considerably in recent years as other means of generation become competitive and China confronts particulate pollution problems. Thermal coal has continued to drop in price with so subsequent rise in demand.
Australia as a rich neighbor has shared and assisted in the industrialization and improved prosperity of many East Asian, South East Asian and South Asian countries, notably China, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and India. Small gains make such a big difference in these societies.
China's per capita emissions are on par with those of Europe. China's public health achievements have been impressive if somewhat counteracted by their air pollution problem.
Healthcare is largely about provision of services by people and by itself is not energy intensive. Roads present emission problems and economic problems in encouraging car use for commuting when provision of public transport infrastructure to do the same job could be cheaper. Sanitation or sewerage came to Brisbane in the 1960s and is now part of a major water and nutrient recycling mechanism. The major economic cost in provision of electricity is the cost of building and maintaining a network of sufficient capacity to meet the peaks in demand that occur on very hot days during heatwaves. These peaks are produced mainly by domestic air conditioner use.
Air conditioner use is largely a product of individual house design and the impact of neighboring buildings.

Another word for your metaphorical backbones is a narrative. In the 1980s and 1990s Australian Labor Treasurer and later Prime Minister Paul Keating often spoke of the need for a narrative when driving political. economic and cultural change. In the early 80s he floated the Australian dollar and instigated a series of economic reforms which ensured Australian economic prosperity into the 90s and set the country up to be the only culturally western economy to survive the global financial crisis without going into recession. A Labor Treasurer dragged the conservative Liberal National Party coalition kicking and screaming into what are now seen as neo-liberal reforms. Local Liberal National Party politicians that I now know tell me that while they didn't like his ideas at the time they now appreciate what he did. Through his famous Redfern speech he also started the process of reconciliation of white and black Australians to the High Court decisions on Native Title and the injustices of past oppression and frontier wars which extended into the last century. He recently announced neo-liberalism had reached the end of its usefulness, particularly in regard to energy policy.

Increasing seasonality associated with global warming may have played a role in these bushfires and in the severe droughts that brought some of the last of the Spinifex People in from the deserts. Recent years have seen large scale destruction of vast swaths of coral reef, mangrove, alpine ash forest, pencil pine woodland, and kelp forest due to global warming.
Sustainability is contingent to managing global warming in the long term and dealing with its consequences in the short term over the next century. Agricultural sustainability is about managing over grazing, erosion, and water resources in a climate with increasing seasonality.
In my 66 years of life I've seen my city grow from 500,000 to 3.2 million people. The initial response was to build freeways, bridges and more recently road tunnels to enable people to get to work. Recently the state and local governments have started to put money into public transport increased bus services, busways, duplication of existing and development of new suburban railway lines and a proposal to start underground routes in the inner city. Freeways have reached their limits but there is reticence in the conservative side of politics to commit to public transport infrastructure.
My obsession is science. This requires contact with the real world and discussion with real people often face to face. There is a social as well as intellectual component in these activities, particularly in restoring local rainforest by finding fruit and seed, growing it in nurseries and planting the tube stock result in an appropriate place. As an organisation we receive government grants to cover the cost of the environmental service we provide. With global warming coral diversity is increasing in Moreton Bay at the same time as mass bleaching events occur on the Great Barrier Reef further north. This makes it even more important to maintain waterway health by reintroducing the gallery rain forest.

Electricity grids like roads quickly become congested once built and even when you build a grid with sufficient capacity you also need the generation capacity to match demand. The confluence of readily available reverse cycle air conditioning units and increased summer heatwaves has caused problems of generating capacity for New South Wales this summer just gone. Shutting down the alumina smelter to keep people cool is not good for business.
Neither Australia's nor Britains per capita CO2 emissions figure include the emission footprint embedded in imported goods. Critics of China's gross emissions would do well to realise that.
My Chinese colleagues in the early 1980 were going home to do the stratigraphic work needed to find the coal that would come to underpin that country's industrial revolution. Televisions and refrigerators aren't major consumers of electricity.
These blokes had been sent out to work in the fields during the cultural revolution and had used the opportunity to collect fossils and send home by rail. Now Deng had other ideas for China and those fossils and the story they told were part of it.
They came from an already complex confucian culture with a marxist overlay and they arrived in an post colonial English speaking culture with a large overseas Chinese population. They went back to negotiate the complexities of a changing society including what happened at Tiananmen Square.
Aboriginal Australians also come from a complex non-agrarian society with traditions and knowledge of land management partly through the judicious use of fire.

How did Queenslanders deal with that situation? I can think of four Labor politicians who played a large role in seeing that period through, three of whom lived to see its ultimate demise and one of whom is still alive today and organising the Commonwealth Games.
One kept alive the decency and common touch of the best of the Queensland ALP, two reorganised the party structure to become more inclusive of members and one maintained his ties with the legal system which eventually brought down the undemocratic system.
The last became the first Premier of the new democratic era. The surviving member of the two became the Premier up til 2008.

Making long-term peace with the land, so to speak.
I think high technology and distributed R&D have a big part to play in that, because there are just so many different variants of ecologies that need to be far better understood, and so many theoretical ways to use land besides the common agricultural methods, even if expanding that potential necessitates development of entirely new types of machinery for maintenance and harvest, and even alternative methods of distribution, storage and conversion into end product.
The US food and drink economy for example tuned itself entirely around the corn monoculture, and that extended to a great deal of popularised fast food and soft drinks, high fructose corn syrup, ketchup and so on. Their diet is really, really corny.
So if there were some novel multi-crop arrangements that made more efficient or at least more sustainable use of land, that would be best complimented by a corresponding set of culinary developments which depended on a steady supply of those less typical crops and were of such high quality or market appeal, as to offer an extra financial incentive for people to make the switch.
You only have to look at how much life is supported in a rainforest, or even just at the way a tree arranges it's leaves to maximise exposure to sunlight, to know there are few ways less efficient - or healthy for land in the long term - than row upon row of the same flat ground level crop.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1493347175000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'there are just so many different variants of ecologies that need to be far better understood and so many theoretical ways to use land besides the common agricultural methods even if expanding that potential necessitates development of entirely new types of machinery for maintenance and harvest', u'effect': u'distributed r&d have a big part to play in that'}], u'author_id': u'16593754', u'in_reply_to': u'97431460', u'id': u'97433619', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'JonathanLamb86', u'text': u'breaking down the*', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1493295070000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'16593754', u'in_reply_to': u'97372637', u'id': u'97394935', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Walsunda', u'text': u'When I told my friend who's a professional numbers man from the ALP left that I spent time on Guardian discussion boards arguing with climate science deniers, he suggested I would be better to spend my time on the discussion boards attached to the many Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers in this country.

I am concerned about the segregation of views, though as a commenter on scientific matters I regard myself as an interpreter of evidence rather than a presenter of views. I also base my politics on evidence.
Scientific training involves looking at and considering all realistic possibilities which is why my campaigning these days is largely within a mainstream political party. The scientific inquisition is not comparable to the old Spanish one. It's more open minded. The Green Party voters I come across in my work in restoring rain forest to our local creeks find themselves being reminded that politics is the art of the possible and some possibilities are worse than others.
What pieces of the puzzle do you think are being ignored by mainstream climate policies and science behind it?
The old industries have gone anyway with or without emissions reductions as a causative factor. An example of this is the multinational owned Australian car manufacturing industry. Similarly with the old brown coal based now privatised electricity generating industry of Victoria. Plants constructed in the 1960s by the state government and subsequently sold in the 1980's at bargain basement prices by international corporations are closing down because the cost of maintenance. Even in black coal fired New South Wales the private owners of generation capacity are building no new coal fired plant. This led to shortfalls in generation capacity during the heatwaves that occurred in this hot summer just gone.
With government backing in the form of loans private consortiums are building wind and large scale solar capacity. The now old coal fired plants were entirely built by government. In Queensland alone roof top solar panels generate the equivalent output of a large coal fired plant plus save 50% of the cost that's due to transporting the electricity.
For the people who don't want to change, as with the car industry, the decision was made by overseas corporations. Change is forced upon them and it's up to Government to pick up the pieces. 
Currently more countries than ever before are committing to emissions reductions schemes which in countries like Australia make more economic sense than any possible alternative. The US is the the current major exception in both emissions reduction and economic sense.
Anti-environmentalists and anti-progressives are rallying to oppose these environmentally and economically rational measures.

Metaphorical backbones to draw influence for direction of development from. Ways of bringing information and individual efforts together in a way that helps us to make sense of it all.
Computing and the Internet already play a big part in that, but we should be making progress beyond those steps, using these as a foundation for the next steps to grow from.
Big business is always resistant to change, but individuals can rarely resist something when it's new and exciting enough, provided they can access and afford it. The more the development takes place in the virtual space, the more people will be able to do that.
If you take away the requirement of having physical access to heavy machinery, scientific testing equipment and so on, and needing to live in close proximity to a workshop or lab, by modelling their functions accurately in the virtual space, then the amount of people able to work productively in a branch of research and development could skyrocket. 
I do this myself with designing and simulating loudspeakers in software, and many thousands of others do the same, so it's a particularly well developed field with huge amounts of freely available documentation and recorded experiences online. Many who contribute to this distributed collective development process go on to make serious contributions to the field. I find the sheer depth of experience you can achieve in the virtual realm really helps out with this.
Some tasks (like constructing huge wooden speaker cabinets) are extremely resource, labour and time intensive when performed physically, so, even if the virtual approximation is only a fraction as good as the real thing, the benefits yielded from the capacity to repeat the process over and over, thousands of times in a low-consequence environment mean you can eventually train your mind to fill in the blanks and compensate for the eccentricities of the software's limitations.
There are so many theoretical systems through which virtual and physical resources and energy can be recorded and passed between people and service providers that we haven't even scratched the surface of, and partly as I said, because we're not daring to think big enough.
One of the greatest conundrums faced when thinking big is that it can often seem that a big idea can never work unless many other big ideas are in place to support it. Socialists encounter this problem all the time, and like to imagine a notional revolution would make everything fall into place, but that goes against the evolutionary principles you mentioned, and the lessons of the fables.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1493345224000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u""we 're not daring to think big enough"", u'effect': u'partly as i said'}], u'author_id': u'16593754', u'in_reply_to': u'97431460', u'id': u'97432982', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'JonathanLamb86', u'text': u'What a lot of people are doing is removing themselves from inquisitors, through self-imposed segregation for their views. Inquisitors tend to ask inconvenient questions, and it's not comfortable to be without an answer to a question that challenges your worldview. It's perfectly reasonable that people would do this, because a nascent and radical worldview necessarily needs to be nurtured in a supportive environment, but only up to a point, and there always comes a point where it needs to be strong enough to stand up to close scrutiny. At least some people need to be capable of voicing that perspective in a way that stands up to close scrutiny, and at the moment I don't see many people doing that, because the mainstream climate arguments are ignoring so many vital and obvious pieces of the puzzle:
Where do all the old industries go? What will the workers do? What about the people who don't want to change? What about the countries whose Governments won't commit?

I'm totally with you on the evolutionary point. Small increments over time is absolutely the correct way to think about things. 
I like to think of Aesop's Fables for an easy to digest reference. Everyone knows ""The Tortoise and the Hare"" - slow and steady wins the race, but although it's the most famous one I don't think it always applies. In some instances running fast really will win the race, so it's only really useful as a whole life philosophy, not for every challenge. 
Another good one is the boy who tries to take hazelnuts from a jar. He sticks his hand in and greedily tries to take a whole handful, but by grabbing tight to the handful he can't remove his hand, so by trying to take everything he wants in one go, he ends up with nothing at all. So he has to let go of some of the things he wanted and just take what he can manage. Like 'not biting off more than you can chew'.
The Chinese finger trap is a good metaphor as well. Pull too hard or fast and you'll be stuck and make no progress at all. 
Another kind of thinking I find appealing in addition to the basic evolutionary process, is fractal thinking. Self-similar mathematical patterns.
That's the real driving force for change, imo, but it's a very difficult one to harness effectively.
A lot of the time people just mirror each other. Actually I think most of the time people just mirror other people and things other people do. Not directly of course, and we're all unique, but we build our potential from everything we're exposed to. Everything we read and watch on TV, every conversation we have and everybody we meet.
But there are some thoughts which are so powerful that they can serve as a root for millions of people to do amazing things. Thoughts that create things like language, verbal language or software programming languages, or the language of cinematography or storytelling, or the language computers use to talk to one another (like the Internet), or for computers to talk to machines to create physical products.
When an idea like that comes along then it can make incredible progress incredibly quickly. Even biological evolution has recorded instances where something like this happens, like the birthing of complex life during the Cambrian Explosion. Once the first few complex vertebrates had formed, it offered a 'backbone' (metaphorical and literal) for all kinds of amazing unexplored possibilities before natural selection began to whittle them down.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1493344908000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'16593754', u'in_reply_to': u'97431460', u'id': u'97432899', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'JonathanLamb86', u'text': u'Er.. When I said ""elites"" in my initial post though, what I meant was the 1% of the 1% - the CEOs, the media barons, the powerful politicians, as they're by far the easiest group for campaigners to scapegoat, but that process runs all the way down to the point where anyone living in a first world Western nation is an elite. To people in Africa and North Korea and wartorn parts of the Middle East, the whole Western world might be the elite. The people who we see as having control over things, in other words.
As you and your daughter demonstrate, we all have the potential, in theory, to take matters into our own hands, and make a direct and valuable impact as individuals, but the bigger the task we're looking at tackling, the higher we need to raise our game to have an impact, and there are always going to be forces pulling in the other direction, so long as there's a livelihood to be had in doing so.
When it comes to the biggest and most inflexible of industries on which the livelihoods of millions depend, directly and indirectly, then nothing short of identifying what it is exactly that those industries serve, for their customers and for their employees, and then to serve that same thing through another approach altogether, is enough to change them or phase them out of existence. 
A lot of the more utopian positions on climate frame themselves in the broadest possible sense, too broad to be practically applied. The classic example being the John Lennon style, 'all you need is love' approach. A lot of people who've experienced some of the best that a low impact life has to offer in places like India (as Lennon did), come to arrive at this sort of understanding. 
But it's all very well telling people they can live like that and everything will be good, it's entirely another thing to extend the dream into reality. The UK isn't India and never will be - even without the influence of local culture, habits, and traditions, geology and population density makes it impossible.
That's not to say that extremely broad solutions aren't an option. The Internet is an extremely broad solution to communications. It's essentially a good idea, and so everyone uses it, but the broader the solution the more care and time and resources and talent it takes to roll it out to the world.
Any small and specific organisation of people with limited talent, funding and resources, is necessarily limited in that they can either take a narrow and focused approach that yields measurable and compelling results over a small area of interest.
Broader solutions like Lennon's Indo-philosophy and the Internet, may be, and generally are employed either to assist and support the more focused areas, to raise awareness of them or to tie them together into something that takes shape as something bigger.
But tying together the sheer amount of small and positive initiatives in a way that looks credible and inspires optimism from sceptics is very, very difficult. The left has an image problem of being perpetually fractured, and that's because it is perpetually fractured. Even when it comes together it's still fractured because there are so many different approaches, some compatible, some slightly contradictory and some irreconcilably different.
So in short (or in long, perhaps I should say, but in short because it could be longer), I think we need to think bigger, and act like the potential exists to act bigger. Thinking bigger is easier said than done, and a lot of people claim to be 'thinking big' when really what they mean is, they're 'thinking about big things', which is something entirely different.
To say ""we should end CO2 emissions by 2050"" is thinking about big things.

The economies of countries change as industries are phased out of existence due to market forces. Economies of scale resulting from the economic development of East and South East Asia plus closeness to markets have seen Australian industries such as steel making and auto manufacture phased out as their international owners have shifted operations to our northern neighbors. This has brought prosperity to that region, some unemployment in parts of Australia but also increasing employment in other parts as new industries develop.
India like China is also industrializing. Modi is not following Ghandi's agrarian simplicity model. Mainland Australia covers much the same latitudinal spread as India with less rain and poorer geologically determined soils. Their food makes sense here but Australia is no longer an agrarian society or economy. We do however have the one of the world's oldest surviving cultures. In many ways that non-agrarian culture makes more sense in the world of today.

Actually that's what almost everyone except an isolated handful of people do. We don't go out measuring our environmental impact beyond the obvious rules of thumb like not driving too much, flying too much or eating excessive amounts of meat, recycling, not consuming more than we determine to be 'needs', etc.
But everything is relative. What we consider to be needs are to others unimaginable luxury. In parts of India, it's so rare to have mod-cons like fridges and washing machines, that anyone lucky enough to get one may be the talk of the village. 
So we all construct our narrative justifications, not just of ourselves but of others, that's partly what I mean by what you called 'pack behaviour'. Not only do we not want to see ourselves as bad, we don't want to see other people who we care about and respect as bad either, and actually 'bad' is probably far too strong a word to use in most cases.
My contention is that we construct these justifications, as individuals yes but also more widely as a society, around the industries which support us, and that we work for. 
You are indeed lucky as I suspected, not in the ways I suspected but incredibly lucky nonetheless, in that you and your family have the education, experience and opportunity to contribute to a part of the system that is clearly beneficial to the environment.
However, the system as stands can only support so many roles that fit that prestigious bill, and the proportion of vocations that heal the environment versus vocations which damage the environment is massively out of whack.
That's where campaigning alone falls flat. In the UK we have a campaign that's been running for a while now, called ""One Million Climate Jobs"". It's a noble endeavour and the intent is clear: Create one million jobs, like those held by you and your daughter, and reap the benefits for the economy and the environment.
The campaign itself doesn't have the power to create jobs of course, it can only highlight the theoretical potential that jobs may be created and hope that it's call be answered. In the UK, Labour under Jeremy Corbyn, has a policy for something called the National Investment Bank, a 500 billion pound fund which in theory might be employed to create such millions of jobs, but this fund faces fierce criticism and opposition for being idealistic. Simply earmarking a fund still doesn't offer any concrete assurance of delivery.
Which is why I raised the point: What are the least flexible industries on Earth right now, how inflexible are they, and why are they inflexible? (and secondarily, how does that influence consumer behaviour?)
The classic extreme example of an inflexible industry with colossal impacts on consumer behaviour is the Military Industrial Complex. The MIC ensures that the world remain in a constant state of war, and this state is largely irrespective of the moral justifications.
There are so many conflicts and human rights atrocities in the world which can be deemed worthy of military intervention at any given time, and the MIC operates like any other business - it has to sustain itself, it's machinery, it's distribution networks, it's staff, it's investors, it's boards of directors and so on. Like most industries on Earth, it has to sustain itself relatively predictably or face disaster for it's interests.
Once you slow a machine like that down to a crawl, it can be very difficult to start it up again. We saw an example of this happening recently in the UK, when the steel industry was being hammered by Chinese dumping of steel on the global market below cost. This led to such a collapse of business that several steelworks had to be closed - permanently.
They were operating on such tight margins with such heavy industrial processes, that once the steelworks was wound down temporarily, it would be uneconomical to ever fire it up again. 
The harsh reality of climate change is that the permanent winding up of many of the world's industries may be inevitable. Many argue that it should already have happened or we should at least be accelerating towards that state.
Individual lifestyle choices do impact on the industries of the world, but the moment the value of one raw material drops, or the price of oil or gas falls, the world ramps up it's demand for those things accordingly.
The fall in value of commodities and energy opens up the potential for poorer countries to develop themselves, and few people would dream of denying them the ability to do so. We're not talking luxuries in most cases, but things which we would consider to be bear essentials.
The healthcare, roads, water, sanitation and access to electricity we all take for granted and see as low impact provided we act responsibly, are actually incredibly high impact almost regardless of how responsibly we act.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1493291846000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'this', u'effect': u'such a collapse of business that several steelworks had to be closed permanently'}], u'author_id': u'16593754', u'in_reply_to': u'97372637', u'id': u'97390473', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ID2310987', u'text': u'So you've got nothing?

Clearly I've generalised massively and perhaps unreasonably about the behaviours and actions that lead to overwhelming CO2 emissions. Fairly putting a finger on what's leading to them is not something it's easy to do concisely, because of the sheer complexity of the system under discussion.
When we're asking the question ""what sort of lifestyles and vocations cause the most damage to the environment, and how practical is it for those lifestyles to change"", we all at once have to consider:
- What are the least flexible industries on Earth right now, how inflexible are they, and why are they inflexible?- How do those inflexible industries influence consumer behaviour, in the present and in their long term outlooks?- How independent are our personal choices, and our lifestyle choices that we feel determine our moral position in relation to the world and our energy and material consumption?
You raise a very interesting specific example in your own story. You drive around a 4x4 a lot of the time, but it's justified because you're helping to conserve the environment in doing so. I think it would be fair to suggest you and your family have an unusually high concern for the environment relative to the norm. Others' thresholds of justification will be lower than yours.
In answering your question about how we define elites, I'd like you to consider the much more solidly established example of how we see wealth. It's all relative to our own experience. If we're extremely poor, then we set the definition of 'rich' as much lower.
Having your own house and a car and being able to go on holiday several times a year might be seen as rich. The Labour party in the UK recently suggested that if you earn more than $120,000 (AUD) per year, then you're rich, and this provoked howls of derision from all the people earning more than that who didn't consider themselves rich.
The other problem when it comes to defining elites is that globally speaking, most people living in first world nations are incredibly rich, and with great wealth comes great environmental impact, whether we directly experience or appreciate that environmental impact or otherwise.
When you earn $120,000 a year (or whatever), and spend it on stuff, then that's all going to cause an impact. There are vanishingly few people these days (although those who do tend to be very tight knit and exclusive in their existence even though they often won't recognise that they are), who live a truly sustainable and integrated existence with the land around them, consuming only domestic and sustainable products from others who do the same.
Even people who do this are often subject to a degree of 'greenwash' that they're unaware of. Looking at individual anecdotal stories of responsible living can teach us very little, in the same way that looking at anecdotal stories of terrorism teaches us little about Islam.

Next weekend, the People’s Climate March will follow.
Redglass Pictures and StarTalk Radio created a short film in which the brilliant scientist and communicator Neil deGrasse Tyson – though not specifically talking about the science marches – perfectly articulated the motivations behind them.
For example, last weekend’s March for Science was largely a pushback against the creeping science denial among today’s political leaders, about which Dr. Tyson said:
But in this, the 21st Century, when it comes time to make decisions about science, it seems to me people have lost the ability to judge what is true and what is not; what is reliable and what is not reliable; what should you believe, what should you not believe. And, when you have people who don’t know much about science standing in denial of it, and rising to power, that is a recipe for the complete dismantling of our informed democracy.
The climate march is in response to so many of our political leaders using science denial to obstruct the important debate about policy solutions:
So once you understand that humans are warming the planet, you can then have a political conversation about that … [policy solutions] have political answers. And every minute one is in denial, you are delaying the political solution that should have been established years ago.
Mythbuster Adam Savage was interviewed on MSNBC about why he decided to speak at and participate in the March for Science in San Francisco:
we live in a time where people are passing legislation like in North Carolina to not pay attention to science when making legislation about coastal water levels rising. That is absolutely ludicrous and anti-human. We need to make, as you just said, policies based on the best evidence we have available to us, and that’s why I’m marching.
The marches have drawn some attention. PBS NewsHour – the only American network news program to consistently report on climate change – did a story featuring our own Geoffrey Supran:
The underlying problem is that it’s been decades since we’ve known enough about the threats posed by human-caused climate change to mitigate those risks. It should be a no-brainer: we have one planet with one climate that we depend upon entirely for our survival. We are in the process of fundamentally changing its atmosphere by dumping 35 billion tons of carbon dioxide into it every year. Our only reasonable option is to curb that carbon pollution as quickly as possible before we destabilize the Earth’s climate.
We seemed to finally be moving in the right direction with the Paris agreement, and now the American government is reneging on its pledges and doing everything in its power to increase carbon pollution. Members of the House Science Committee, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the President of the United States deny basic scientific findings made decades ago. The President proposed a budget that would slash funding for scientific research, he’s failed to appoint people to key scientific posts in his administration, and Republicans in the House of Representatives passed two bills to stifle science at the EPA. 
It’s madness. We are risking the future of our society on the slim chance that a 3% fringe minority of climate scientists is right and 97% are wrong. It’s like playing Russian roulette, but with far worse odds. At least with Russian roulette there’s a 5-in-6 chance (83%) you’ll be fine. That’s a far sight better than the 3-in-100 (3%) gamble our leaders are taking on climate change. Worse yet, even the 3% don’t deny that humans are altering Earth’s climate, which is an inherently risky proposition.

We’ve reached the point where scientists are taking to the streets to make it known that we’re failing to heed their warnings. That’s a step far outside the comfort zone for most scientists, but it’s the right move. Our leaders will only act on climate change if their voters demand it. Right now while voter support for climate policies is high, because of an effective misinformation campaign and continued media false balance, many view it as a low priority. 
Hopefully, seeing scientists marching in the streets will raise public awareness about the urgency of the problem we’re causing so that they demand change before it’s too late.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/apr/25/march-against-madness-denial-has-pushed-scientists-out-to-the-streets

But despite the advances, the Asset Owner Disclosure Project chairman, John Hewson, has warned there is still an “enormous resistance” to managing climate risk.
The AODP releases its fifth global index on Wednesday, ranking the world’s largest 500 asset owners and, for the first time, the 50 largest asset managers on their performance managing financial risks associated with climate change.
Asset owners and managers were scored on governance and strategy, portfolio carbon risk management and metrics and targets, and graded as leaders (A-AAA) rating), challengers (B-BBB), learners (C-CCC), bystanders (D-DDD) and laggards (X).
The index found that 40% of asset owners and just 6% of asset managers were classed as laggards, meaning they had a scored zero on the measures for managing and disclosing climate risks.
The report concluded that “the scales have tipped”, as 60% of asset owners are now taking some action.
Of the 500 asset owners, there are now 34 leaders, 34 challengers, 44 learners and 187 bystanders, an increase in all categories since the last year compared with laggards, which fell from 246 to 201 in number.
Australia and New Zealand were among the 10 best-performing countries, which were all in Oceania and Europe.
Asset owners in Australia and New Zealand average B compared with an average D across Asia. Australia’s Local Government Super ranked first among asset owners in the world and First State Super ranked third, both with a triple A rating.
But Hewson said there was still “enormous resistance” among Australia’s asset owners because they tend to “take a very short-term focus, and rely on short-term remuneration, so they won’t take a medium to long-term challenge on easily”.
Hewson said asset owners tended to have a “herd instinct” and many people saving for retirement haven’t focused on the risk of a climate-induced financial crisis and exercised their concern through choice of fund.
“The government downplaying the need to transition to renewables doesn’t help ... It’s not conducive to a serious assessment of risk, that’s for sure.”
The former Australian opposition leader warned a climate change-induced financial crisis would be a “global phenomenon and is a global risk”, agreeing with the former US secretary of the treasury Hank Paulson that the risks dwarfs even the US subprime mortgage crisis that precipitated the global financial crisis.
According to the AODP report, nearly one in five asset owners have staff focused on integrating climate risk into their investments, two in five (42%) incorporate climate change into their policy frameworks, and 13% of asset owners now calculate portfolio carbon emissions, up from 10%.
However assessing the risk of stranded assets is still quite an advanced tool used by only 6% of the index.
All three asset managers in Australia and New Zealand rated D. Macquarie, the sole Australian investment manager included in this index, rated a D.
The report said this was “a cause for concern giving its impending acquisition of the UK’s Green Investment Bank” and called on it to “dramatically improve its climate credentials”.
Hewson called for regulators to mandate disclosure of climate change risks, suggesting the Bloomberg taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures and other G20 processes will “inevitably” lead to such disclosure.
“The solution should be disclosure first, because once [asset owners and managers] admit this is the risk they’re running, naturally they’ll want to manage it.”
Hewson also praised the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority for warning in March that individual directors may be financially accountable for failing to factor in losses from climate change, commenting “that’s shaken them up a lot”.

The business of producing food for an ever-larger population, on less and less land, with less and less water, requires the resources of large corporations and banks as well as the management skills of those rare individuals who can profitably farm thousands or tens of thousands of acres. While small-stakeholder farms do provide a small fraction of our food, we need to be realistic and accept that our public policy must first and foremost insure that our primary means of food production remains profitable and efficient. Just as the owner of a mom-and -pop retail store must make substantial capital investment and exercise considerable business and marketing skill to stay in business in a retail environment dominated by big box stores, so too must the small-stakeholder farmer invest in current technology, exercise good business judgement, and possess considerable marking skill to run a viable farm. It is not good public policy to artificially support small stakeholder operations that cannot compete in the open market. We absolutely must produce food with the minimum possible environmental and real estate footprint - the world already has more than 1 person per acre of habitable land, and that density will continue to increase for the foreseeable future.

Don't bank on it",article,http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/25/sonny-perdue-trump-agriculture-secretary,0,"Donald Trump owes his election in no small part to the support of farm country. But since entering office, almost all his actions and pronouncements have betrayed an abysmal understanding of farm and rural concerns. No surprise, then, that food and farm advocates have looked eagerly to Sonny Perdue, who was sworn in as agriculture secretary on Tuesday, to educate and temper the president on their issues.
The new secretary has his work cut out for him. The president unveiled a budget blueprint last month that slashed funding for the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) by 21%.
Will Perdue become the champion that the advocates hope for? He gave mixed messages about his vision during his confirmation hearing. Perdue wants to preserve the “broad tent” approach of his predecessor, such as supporting organic and locally grown and consumed food. Unfortunately, he also stated that “the jury is still out on whether humans are causing climate change”. He also indicated that he would be open to allowing school districts to formulate their own meal plans, a move that could undermine the 2010 Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act, which requires schools to provide nutritious meals with more fruits and vegetables. Frozen- and junk-food companies have lobbied for loosening the regulation.
Most worrisome is that it appears that, under Trump and Perdue, the USDA will double down on an industrialized, corporate food and agriculture model that is already failing most farmers and rural residents.
Perdue’s Senate hearing centered on USDA programs that cater to large-scale companies producing commodity crops. The former governor said farmers and taxpayers are getting “good value” from these programs. Tell this to farmers, most of whom run small family-owned operations, who in 2017 will face a fourth consecutive year of diminished income in spite of record productivity.
It shows an inconceivable lack of imagination if the nation’s top agricultural leadership is suggesting we tackle low prices by pushing production, new product development, new markets and exports. Plus, Perdue wants to establish a new undersecretary for trade. While a minority of large-scale farmers will benefit from this spent approach, we are not going to produce our way out of the current agricultural doldrums.
The USDA would do better to invest in programs serving a wider swath of farmers and struggling rural communities, including those that encourage more farmers to enter rather than leave the business, help farmers produce a diverse mix of healthful foods for regional consumption, and create local jobs (the very same approach worked well for Perdue in his home state). Farmers also need programs that would curb the soil erosion and runoff that pollutes drinking water from Des Moines to Toledo and many rural communities in between.
Does Perdue believe in the market economy? If so, farmers need markets to reward them for clean water and carbon sequestration. Farmers – who will be hit harder and more frequently by the catastrophic floods, droughts and pests that accompany a changing climate – need programs to help their farms become more resilient, a point reinforced by a recent bipartisan task force, that found these interrelated issues to be “among the most significant threats to food and nutrition security”. Yet the Trump administration has worked to systematically dismantle the government’s ability to tackle climate change, even suggesting it will back out of the Paris Agreement, a move opposed by the National Farmers Union.
Other critical issues are also question marks. For example, when asked about his commitment to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), more commonly known as the food stamp program and the largest single expenditure in the federal farm bill that will be renewed next year, Perdue said he hoped to do it “more efficiently and more effectively than we have”. That sounds like shrinking this safety net vital for low-income families, especially those in rural communities – research shows that a larger percentage of households in rural areas receive Snap benefits than in urban areas, contrary to the stereotype.
During his first 100 days in office, Trump has shown little intention of investing in rural communities. Only today, three months into his administration and the first with a secretary of agriculture, has he met with a group of farmers in a rushed photo opportunity, and signed an executive order that essentially calls for a 180-day regulatory review.
His new secretary of agriculture has given every indication of catering to the farmers and agribusinesses that least need public support while neglecting the majority of farmers and rural communities.
Trump may not be personally affected by his broken campaign promises – so far he has failed to replace the Affordable Care Act with something better, or to deploy his secret plan to defeat Isis in 30 days – but the rural electorate that put its faith in him will suffer the consequences. They will continue to see more polluted drinking water, depressed farm incomes, failed businesses, farmland vulnerable to floods and droughts and loss of hope.
Status quo is what the farm and rural constituencies voted against, and precisely what Trump and new secretary of agriculture will all but ensure.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/25/sonny-perdue-trump-agriculture-secretary

The figures I gave, as I said, were based on a Nissan Leaf since that's what modeller was giving as a reference. I understand that the proposed design for the taxis is a hybrid. In that case it is still generating pollution and carbon emissions, even if they are somewhat reduced, when there is an opportunity to have zero emissions. This is a greenwash.
BQEND
I'm sorry but you seem to be stretching reality just to find negatives. BEV's with range extenders are still far, far more fuel efficient, take the
'UPS style' Workhorse truck that has reduced fuel consumption by 80%.
This is a massive step in the right direction, and I assume we'll see rules and regs steadily pushing up the electric only range, especially as battery costs are still falling fast. I'd also expect the taxis to start the day fully charged, and opportunities for charging (lunch/tea breaks) during the day that don't impact on 'work'.
Your hydrogen alternative is a dead duck for cars, it's never going to work. All it does is add a H2 fuel tank and fuel cell to an EV, though it does admittedly reduce the size of the battery.
I'm yet to see any reports that still think H2 is a viable solution for mass transport anymore.
A better use for the technology is in energy storage, or perhaps reserved for long distance HGV's, an area that will be much harder for BEV's to crack.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1493362389000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'11150889', u'in_reply_to': u'97374301', u'id': u'97441366', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'derekcolman', u'text': u'London air is still cleaner than it was 50 or 60 years ago.

City stop-start driving, particularly for taxis picking up and dropping off passengers and moving a lot of people around, is energy intensive, even with regenerative braking and energy efficient technologies in heating, air conditioning, lighting etc. It's easy to think 'if a Nissan Leaf can do x miles, why can't a new London Taxi do that too' but it really is comparing two very different machines, even if they do have the same ultimate aims. And the Nissan Leaf isn't a 7 seater (6 passengers plus driver) vehicle. 
The closest comparable electric vehicle would be the Nissan e-NV200 van/minibus, which is, at the very most, around 106 miles (using the NEDC data) but that will obviously drop with more passengers, luggage and stop-start driving. London Taxi Company with the new TX5 are aiming for a real life range of around 70 miles on electric power, which is probably where the Nissan e-NV200 would sit if used as a minicab around London. 
I think the new TX5 is pretty damn good, all things considering. But, and it's a large but, it's a stop-gap, it's the replacement for the 2.8 litre diesel engined TX4, it's going to be the missing link between dirty, polluting taxis and genuinely clean, zero emission vehicles, it's what we have to have before we can get to 500+ mile ranges with the next couple of generations of pure electric vehicles, or zero emission hydrogen fuel cell vehicles for applications like taxis.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1493289193000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'12597510', u'in_reply_to': u'97374301', u'id': u'97386955', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'geofarce', u'text': u'I think they are plug-in (petrol) extended range electric vehicles.Very different from something like a standard Prius.And certainly no diesel there.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1493329022000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'3003624', u'in_reply_to': u'97369685', u'id': u'97425017', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'woohouse', u'text': u'Currently, PHVs can undertake bookings anywhere in England and Wales, provided:

From 1 January 2018, all new black cabs will have to be battery-powered electric models by law as part of TfL’s effort to reduce toxic pollution from diesel engines.
The cash will pay for network reinforcements to enable British Gas owner Centrica and other energy companies to install 300 rapid electric-car charging stations by 2020.
The charging point can top up a car’s battery within minutes, rather than the hours it takes for the city’s thousands of conventional electric vehicles.
An initial 75 fast chargers are due to be operational by the end of the year. While some of the sites will be exclusively for black cabs, the network will also be open to the increasing number of owners of Teslas, Nissan Leafs and electric BMWs in London.
Ben Plowden, TfL’s director of surface strategy and planning, said: “An extensive, rapid charging network is fundamental in helping drivers make the shift from fossil fuels to electric.”
The cost of installing the chargers will fall on the companies that won a TfL tender: Centrica, Bluepoint London, Chargemaster, Ireland’s Electricity Supply Board and Fastned from the Netherlands.
Pricing has not been announced but the main existing network in the capital, Source London, would cost a Leaf driver £10.80 to fully top up with a rapid charger, plus a £4 monthly fee. TfL said the cost to drivers would be capped for the first two years.
The Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association expects the first electric black cabs on London’s roads in September. 
Cabbies with an existing taxi older than 10 years will be able to claim a payment from TfL of up to £5,000 later this year towards the cost of the new zero-emission taxis, which are being built at a factory in Coventry.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/26/electric-black-cabs-transport-for-london-tfl-charging-stations

 “We keep hearing 2014 has been the warmest year on record,” Inhofe said, pulling a snowball from the bag. “You know what this is? It’s a snowball, just from outside here. It’s very, very cold out, very unseasonal.” Inhofe, apparently content that 150 years of global warming research had been swatted away as nonsense, playfully tossed the snowball at the Senate president.
Two years later – both of which set new global records for heat – at least half a dozen former aides to Inhofe – the fiercest critic of mainstream climate science in Congress – have been hired to top positions at the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency. Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the EPA who has an erstwhile Inhofe aid as his chief of staff, recently erred by denying that carbon dioxide was a primary driver of global warming.
Donald Trump, meanwhile, has vacillated on the issue but has previously called climate science “bullshit” and a “hoax”. His actions since becoming president perhaps speak loudest: he has set about dismantling the Clean Power Plan, thrown open federal lands to coal mining, ordered the revision of clean air regulations and halted new vehicle emissions standards.
But amid climate activists’ despair, there are fresh shoots of hope that, as a party, Republicans’ climate intransigence is shifting. A growing group of Republicans in Congress are newly emboldened and are speaking out in favor of finally addressing a crisis that is starting to bite their constituents.
The Climate Solutions Caucus, set up just last year, now has 38 members, half of them Republicans. The congressional group, which is crafting bipartisan action on climate change, is bolstered by a new chorus of big business, faith groups and young college-based Republicans that are demanding the GOP drops the climate skepticism that has become a key part of its identity over the past decade.
If you want to join as a Democrat, you have to bring a Republican. It’s a Noah’s Ark approach, which is appropriate
 “The vast majority of Republicans in private buy the science – the likes of Inhofe are in the minority,” said Danny Richter, legislative director of the Citizens’ Climate Lobby, a non-profit group that painstakingly helped put together the caucus. 
 “What Republicans needed was safe passage to talk about climate action in public, to not be the the first one to walk down that rickety bridge. There’s now a group who can see their constituents are genuinely concerned about climate change. 
 “They are done with the denial. That should really shift something fundamental in American politics.” 
 The standard bearer in Congress is Carlos Curbelo, whose district includes the Florida Keys, an area in serious peril from the advancing seas. Curbelo, the son of Cuban migrants, said his generally moderate views and age – he’s 37 – make him “both an old-school Republican and also a new young Republican.”
Curbelo was the first Republican to join the Climate Solutions Caucus and co-chairs it alongside Ted Deutch, a Florida Democrat. In a bid to get beyond partisanship, members of the group are evenly split. “If you want to join as a Democrat, you have to bring along a Republican,” said Deutch. “It’s a Noah’s Ark sort of approach, which is appropriate given the subject matter. We don’t argue about the science. It’s all very respectful.”
The wretched polarization of climate politics in the US showed signs of shifting last year when a group of 17 Republicans put their name to a resolution that called for “meaningful and responsible action” to the heatwaves, storms, floods and rising sea levels wrought by climate change. After surviving last year’s election despite committing what was thought to be a party heresy, this group is now attempting to break their colleagues’ collective fever over climate.
“There are a lot of Republicans who understand this is a real challenge, and the caucus is giving them a place where they can explore ideas,” Curbelo told Guardian US. “It was assumed that Republicans would take a position of denial, but that’s not the case. One of our main goals is to depoliticize environmental policy in the US.”
Curbelo admitted it is “labour intensive” to get some of his fellow Republicans on board, but the success of the small but expanding caucus is “spreading like wildfire. A lot of colleagues are now contacting us and wanting to learn more.”
Many Republicans were put off the climate issue by former vice-president turned activist Al Gore, according to Curbelo. The warming temperature of the planet has rarely ever been seen as an urgent issue by the party and the forceful campaigning by Gore and green groups was met with Republican hostility, almost as a reflex.
“Al Gore did all that without a Republican partner, so we got to a state of affairs where Republicans automatically oppose anything to do with the environment,” Curbelo said. “I don’t really blame Al Gore for that but there’s a lesson there. We need a proper, sober discussion on this issue.”
Trump’s aggressive rollback of Barack Obama’s climate agenda casts a long shadow, but nagging forces are buffeting Republicans’ position on climate change. Polling shows hearty public support for the science and the need to cut greenhouse gases, while the position of fossil fuel companies – often viewed as the dastardly puppet masters of denial – has evolved to the point where Shell and BP can write to the president to demand that he stay within the Paris climate agreement.
“There are Republicans who can now say ‘I am conservative and care about conservation’ and that is an important signal to the base, that they can go back to the tradition of Teddy Roosevelt and the party that passed the Clean Air Act,” said Richter.
“The problem we are now facing is that the Republican party hasn’t exercized its muscles on this issue in a long time. The more they do that, the easier it will be.”
Agreeing on the need for action is easier than settling upon what that action should be. Curbelo said that the caucus is an “ideas factory” but there are no consensus solutions to go with the group’s name. Republicans remain largely opposed to federal regulation in the shape of the Clean Power Plan, and while imposing a tax on carbon and letting the market sort it out has some heavyweight Republican support, it too is a very hard sell.
All of this will require both sides breaking free of a destructive cycle that has made climate change a partisan cudgel
“I’m not for any sort of carbon fee. I like incentives more than being punished,” Scott Taylor, a Republican whose coastal Virginia district is slowly sinking into a rising Atlantic, told Guardian US. “I think it’s pompous to think man can stop an ice age. That’s ridiculous.
“That said, there are issues with sea level rise and how to defend against that. That is something Republicans are willing to debate now.”
Curbelo has called Pruitt “reckless” for his dismissal of climate science and the Climate Solutions Caucus has written to Trump to urge him to stick with the Paris deal. But with the administration dismantling measures to lower emissions, a replacement plan is needed soon if the US isn’t to abandon the challenge in a practical sense whether it stays in the agreement or not.
“The more real it gets the harder it gets,” said Richter. “But if we are able to get to the point where Republicans in Congress can pass something, it would be very difficult for Trump to veto that.
“There’s a strong economic and jobs narrative there. Republicans won’t want the Silicon Valley for solar, wind and battery storage to be outside the US.”
Richter said environmental groups also need to move beyond their entrenched position of attacking Republicans and instead applaud and encourage those willing to speak out on climate change. All of this will require both sides breaking free of a destructive cycle that has resulted in climate change becoming a partisan cudgel rather than an urgent cause for co-operation.
“The American people by and large want to see their leaders address the challenges of the 21st century and ignoring climate change is dangerous,” Curbelo said. “Are we going to be short sighted or are we going to be honest and build a sustainable country for future generations?”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/27/climate-solutions-caucus-republicans-trump

Whether there was a hiatus or slowdown at some point is still debated, with some arguing strongly for it and others saying it lacks scientific basis. The conclusions unsurprisingly depend on the time period considered, the dataset and the hypothesis tested, so the diverging conclusions do not need to be inconsistent.

I'm not an expert in exactly how the ARGO buoys work, but then I'm sure you aren't either. However, my understanding is that they go through a cycle of measurements starting at depth and rising gradually to the surface, where the data is then transmitted. This means that the final surface reading, although it may also have a pressure reading attached to it, is self-evidently from the surface layer. The aim of the pressure sensor is to ensure that the subsurface measurements are triggered at the correct time. Unless you have any evidence to the contrary, I strongly suspect that your criticism is spurious. Here is the brief description from the ARGO website:

I asked for a source a whole 24 hours ago and you have provided nothing at all.
BQEND
1) Not only I am not at your beck and call, I do not necessarily ""log in"" to the Internet every day.
2) You initially asked for an ""authoritative"" source. In your opinion ""searching for this particular quote is quite interesting as it reveals deniers ..."", and only ""deniers"".
You are clearly going to reject any source I might propose as ""not authoritative"".
3) You have now expanded your criteria to include ""some random blog"". That opens up the field a bit ...
I have seen Christopher Monckton (on WUWT ?) describe the calculation for ""The Pause"" from the TLT satellite data in almost exactly the same way I did above.
Note that I consider CM in a very similar way to ""Dellers"" (James Delingpole). They are both entertaining, and occasionally thought-provoking, but not to be in any way considered ""authoritative"".
When talking about a ""halt"" in the satellite data for 18 (and a half) years, the term (almost) exclusively used is ""The Pause"".
Unfortunately I have seen several people start off using the word ""hiatus"" when discussing the slowdown in surface trends, only to subsequently intersperse it with use of the word ""pause"", which is a major source of confusion.
4) Since my initial post there is a new paper in Nature, titled ""Reconciling controversies about the ‘global warming hiatus’"" (link, full access unfortunately paywalled) which includes a description of the problem with defining exactly what the word ""hiatus"" actually refers to (in the context of climate change).
As they put it in the abstract, ""we show that apparently contradictory conclusions stem from different definitions of ‘hiatus’ and from different datasets"".
They appear to limit their analysis to the surface temperature datasets (?), which is at least consistent with my distinction of ""Hiatus = A slowdown in surface trends; Pause = A zero trend in (TLT) satellite data"".

It is, of course, possible to collect multiple readings to a high resolution that agree closely with each other; that is high precision, but its accuracy (ie close to the real value) can still be poor if the readings are all subject to a bias. Conversely, it is possible to have multiple measurements that show poor agreement with each other due to random errors; in that case taking an average achieves greater accuracy. 
BQEND
This is not particularly well worded, as one must be very careful with the terms accuracy and precision, but it does sort of get there in the end. It is a rather roundabout way of stating...

I'm a PhD scientist. I learned about the basic science underpinning climate change as part of my degree around 1980.

My background means that I have grasped something else that you clearly haven't: if there are areas of the science that contradict my own understanding, I know it is far more likely that I'm missing something than that those studying the subject professionally have got it wrong (especially as there are hundreds of them pawing over every new scientific paper published)!!

No, I haven't. Autocorrelation has the effect of causing both variance and standard deviation to be underestimated (ie the calculated values are significantly lower than they should be).

But, as I have said before, precision is irrelevant to this discussion as it is just a theoretical property of some numbers. What is important is the accuracy of the underlying measurement itself, and how any error propragates through the subsequent computation, which Mr. Tamino did not address.

If there had been a ""slowdown in surface temperature trends during the period 1997/8 to 2013/4"" compared to the previous rate then the trend from 1969 (when change point analysis detects the last change in trend) to 1998 would be significantly steeper than the trend from 1969 to 2014, would it not?

I fail to see why you would want to make this an issue when Tamino is showing that he has thought about it and worked out how to deal with it! Yes, this utilises an averaging technique, but it does not imply any issue with the individual temperature readings or the mean figures derived from them. The latter was what you were trying to imply, so please stop trying to pretend otherwise!
""No, not moving any goalposts, but you do seem to be jumping around a bit and I'm afraid it does take some effort to keep up.""
That's priceless!!!! It's you who keep jumping around, in an attempt to keep forcing your point, as others point out the flaws in your arguments.

No, you are incorrect; I didn't miss that at all. The problem with the methodology lies as much with sampling as anything else; sampling can introduce errors at least as large as equipment, especially when it requires getting a sample from a long way beneath the surface prior to measurement. What makes you think that the Argo sensors are not regularly recalibrated? Also, you still have not addressed the other point; namely that you, in your ""rush to criticise"", failed to read the paper sufficiently to realise that it had nothing to do with the surface temperature data used in the global temperature datasets.
""Your alternative hypothesis, that Argo readings could be spot on, and any error therefore might lies within the ship-borne equipment is an interesting concept, to say the least.""
You need to read more carefully! I never made such a suggestion. However, one of the previous methods used for measuring sea surface temperature was with a bucket and a thermometer; this was shown to bias temperatures downwards. Meanwhile, the other previous method, which measured the temperature of the engine intake of ships biased temperatures upwards.

Neither of these statements are true.
Firstly, the article specifically does mention global temperature (last sentence, third paragraph), although the argument could more generally be extended to any data series exhibiting LTP (long term persistence).
Secondly, the article compares the effect of averaging on three data samples:- White Noise (Gaussian), AR(1) and ARMA(1,1). The data values are not provided, but the scales of the graphs are sufficient to infer that the variance within each sample is small scale too. Interestingly, although all three graphs are scaled differently, it is enough to note that the bandwidth of the AR(1) and ARMA(1,1) results are wider than the White Noise values by at least an order of magnitude, and this is for ideal data under laboratory conditions.

BQEND
You have fallen into the common trap of conflating ""the pause"" with ""the hiatus"".
""The hiatus"" refers to the slowdown in surface temperature trends during the period 1997/8 to 2013/4.
NB : The word ""hiatus"" was used incorrectly by the IPCC in their AR5 (2013) report. ""Hiatus"" in normal English implies a complete halt in whatever you are talking about, but the IPCC text clearly defined a ""slowdown"" in surface global warming trends.
""The pause"" refers to trends in the lower troposphere satellite datasets, and is calculated from the ""current"" (monthly) datapoint to the earliest date that results in a zero (or just negative) trendline.
NB : As per Santer et al (2011), only trends longer than 17 years in length are considered to be ""statistically significant"".
""The pause"" ended in November / December 2015 for both the RSS (V3.3) and UAH (V6.0) datasets. It has definitely NOT ""returned"", and is unlikely to do so for several years.

BQSTART
... and there are many papers confirming that.
BQEND
For ""the pause"", there are exactly ... let me double check, oh yes ... ZERO scientific papers ""confirming"" its return.
Until you provide references or links to the papers you are thinking about, the above ""analysis"" would indicate that they cannot exist because the raw data explicitly rejects ""the pause's"" reappearance, and peer review would have resulted in any such putative ""papers"" being rejected for publication.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1493745909000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'peer review', u'effect': u'any such putative papers being rejected'}, {u'cause': u'the raw data explicitly rejects the pause reappearance and peer review would have resulted in any such putative papers', u'effect': u'that they can not exist'}], u'author_id': u'3985037', u'in_reply_to': u'97699648', u'id': u'97729137', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'MaxStavros', u'text': u'BQSTART

Actually, it has been common knowledge for many years that global temperature series exhibit strong autocorrelation, which must be taken into account when estimating statistical properties such as precision and uncertainty.

How significance tests are misused in climate science 
Posted on 12 November 2010 by Maarten AmbaumGuest post by Dr Maarten H. P. Ambaum from the Department of Meteorology, University of Reading, U.K.Climate science relies heavily on statistics to test hypotheses. For example, we may want to ask whether the global mean temperature has really risen over the past ten years. A standard answer is to calculate a temperature trend from data and then ask whether this temperature trend is “significantly” upward; many scientists would then use a so-called significance test to answer this question. But it turns out that this is precisely the wrong thing to do.
This poor practice appears to be widespread. A new paper in the Journal of Climate reports that three quarters of papers in a randomly selected issue of the same journal used significance tests in this misleading way. It is fair to say, though, that most of the times, significance tests are only one part of the evidence provided.
The post by Alden Griffith on the 11th of August 2010 lucidly points to some of the problems with significance tests. Here we summarize the findings from the Journal of Climate paper, which explores how it is possible that significance tests are so widely misused and misrepresented in the mainstream climate science literature.
Not unsurprisingly, preprints of the paper have enthusiastically been picked up by those on the sceptic side of the climate change debate. We better find out what is really happening here.
Consider a scientist who is interested in measuring some effect and who does an experiment in the lab. Now consider the following thought process that the scientist goes through:
My measurement stands out from the noise.So my measurement is not likely to be caused by noise.It is therefore unlikely that what I am seeing is noise.The measurement is therefore positive evidence that there is really something happening.This provides evidence for my theory.This apparently innocuous train of thought contains a serious logical fallacy, and it appears at a spot where not many people notice it.To the surprise of most, the logical fallacy occurs between step 2 and step 3. Step 2 says that there is a low probability of finding our specific measurement if our system would just produce noise. Step 3 says that there is a low probability that the system just produces noise. These sound the same but they are entirely different.
This can be compactly described using Bayesian statistics: Bayesian statistics relies heavily on conditional probabilities. We use notations such as p(M|N) to mean the probability that M is true if N is known to be true, that is, the probability of M, given N. Now say that M is the statement “I observe this effect” and N is the statement “My system just produces noise”. Step 2 in our thought experiment says that p(M|N) is low. Step 3 says that p(N|M) is low. As you can see, the conditionals are swapped; these probabilities are not the same. We call this the error of the transposed conditional.
BQEND

BQSTART
In the meantime, we need to live with the fact that “statistically significant” results are not necessarily in any relevant sense significant. This doesn't mean that those results are false or irrelevant. It just means that the significance test does not provide a way of quantifying the validity of some hypothesis.
BQENDBit more deep than ""first years"". Subtleties to the applicability of Baysian statistics to that data type.

Your assertion founders on the arbitrary assumption that the time series may be represented as non-stationary (trend), bias and random gaussian normal noise components; that the bias is perfectly known and the CLT may be invoked to average away any noise, and thus global averages are virtually free of measurement error.
In practice, none of these assumptions are true.

Nonsense! It is a mean figure derived from actual data. 
Each data set uses a slightly different approach in terms of the stations used. However, you're completely missing the point. What matters is that the choice of stations is consistent for each data set and this allows the temperature anomaly (as opposed to absolute temperature) to be calculated.
It is no coincidence that all of the different data sets, regardless of the method used (and including ""BEST"", set up by a former skeptic), come up with the same result.

In fact, it has been warming for decades and we now routinely hit temperatures that are 1°C (about 2°F) above the temperatures from 100 years ago.
But despite what we may expect, temperatures across the globe don’t rise little by little each year in a straight line. Rather, temperature changes are a bit bumpy. They go up and they go down somewhat randomly as they increase. Think of a wiggly line superimposed on a straight rising line. 
A great depiction of the behavior is seen from the NASA data, shown below. Each black mark is the Earth’s temperature for a given year. The red line is calculated from 5-year averages of the black data marks and is much smoother than the black line. As you move from left to right, you pass from the year 1880 to the most recent year (2016), which is shown in the very upper right corner.
Careful observation of the graph shows that the last three years (2014, 2015, and 2016) were all record-breakers. It makes you wonder, what the chances are that global warming has sped up? 
Well this is a question that can be tested with statistics, and a new paper out in Environmental Research Letters did just that. In the study, the authors ask a few important questions. First, can the latest three years, all of which were record-setting, tell us whether the rate of warming has changed? Also, can the years that preceded those (which were cooler than the trend) tell us whether the rate of warming had slowed?
With respect to whether surface warming has sped up or slowed down, the authors of this study made a testable hypothesis. They started out assuming that the Earth was warming at a constant rate but superimposed on this warming was a random short-term variability. Then they looked at the temperature measurements (like those shown in the figure above) and ran statistical tests to see whether those temperatures would be unlikely to occur given their hypothesis. A simple way to state this is, do you get temperature results like that above with the simple assumption of constant warming with natural year-to-year fluctuations?
Using what is called a Monte Carlo method where you let your statistics tool give you a large population of possible temperatures by running many random trials, the authors found that using the NASA temperatures, the likelihood of seeing a trend as low as, or even lower than what was observed during the 2001–2014 period was 74%. The likelihood of seeing the actual 2000–2012 temperatures was 96%. In other words, it’s very likely that a time period with a trend as low as observed would occur just by chance, given a constant warming rate. 
They repeated the analysis for another climate dataset (HadCRUT4) and found again, it’s not unusual to expect the temperatures we actually saw over these periods. The figure below shows five different sets of temperature data; they are all telling this same story of uninterrupted rise over the past four decades or so.
What was incredibly powerful is that the authors show that it would have been statistically significant to have not found an interval with as a slow warming as actually measured. 
What this analysis shows us is that the Earth continues to warm apace. Furthermore, we shouldn’t get excited about any given year that is cold or warm, or think it’s showing that global warming is slowing down or speeding up. Rather, this paper reminds us that long-term trends are what matters. And the long-term trends are speaking loudly. This latest study is just another nail in the coffin of the lie that global warming ended.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/apr/27/new-study-global-warming-keeps-on-keeping-on

The 195 countries that have signed up to the so-called Paris Agreement to reduce CO2 dumping in the atmosphere & oceans have made a modest commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28% over a decade.

Actually, you claimed, ""the issue of energy storage is completely unrelated to the energy source"", a claim which isn't true.
BQEND
Maybe it was badly phrased, what I meant is ""storing energy doesn't depend on the source this energy was produced from"". In other words, there's no energy storage solution that works for surplus nuclear energy but can't store surplus energy produced from renewables.

BQSTART
Energy storage isn't needed for sources that are available on demand and can be rapidly ramped up and down.
BQEND
I'll get back to that.

BQSTART
The idea that you can dump your intermittent power on a country that isn't ""going green"" and buy power back from them at will is not going to work in a world where all countries have gone green.
BQEND
a. I'm pretty sure the Sanders plan (or similar plans referring to the US) will not lead to ""all countries going green"". You're still a powerful country, but not THAT powerful.
b. Why isn't it going to work? The only reason it wouldn't work was if all countries have achieved a perfect balance, where, through a diversified energy mix, they produce exactly as much energy as they need. If that happens, there is no surplus energy to export and no need to import any energy either. Otherwise, there's no reason why a country where specific weather conditions result in a temporary surplus of RES-produced energy shouldn't be able to export this energy to a country where equally specific weather conditions result in a temporary drop in energy production.

Absolute nonsense. Coal and nuclear power plants, just like gas, oil, hydro, solar and wind plants, can (and do, at least in our side of the Atlantic) operate on load following mode, which means that they produce varying levels of power, depending on the demand (including, in France, nuclear reactors shutting down for the weekend).

BQSTART
It's nice that you want to include these other possibilities but they are not the ones that are being ranted about by those demanding that we ""leave it in the ground"" (referring to oil, natural gas and coal) and use 100% solar and wind by next week.

The idea that you can dump your intermittent power on a country that isn't ""going green"" and buy power back from them at will is not going to work in a world where all countries have gone green. So your importing and exporting idea is not going to work other than as a means to expand the energy market and perhaps get power from some place where it's day and send it to some place where it is night.

But regarding each one, biomass is unlikely to provide substantial electrical power production. It might be capable of conversion into fuels for vehicles, e.g. butanol. Geothermal power generation is most likely to work if you live in Iceland. Geothermal heating and cooling, however, could be in general use. Hydro in the 1st world is largely already built out. Using reservoirs behind these dams for water cooled floating solar cells and building small ponds below the dams such that water could be pumped back behind the dam during high solar output times and run through the turbines during low, this creates a giant battery without the cost of a giant battery.

It turns out that, every year, year after year, he introduced the same legislation to make a point, and no one else ever seems to have signed on to it. To me, this looked like showmanship rather than governance — an exercise designed to highlight his own support for a very progressive agenda. The hard work is to draft a bill that your co-legislators can get behind, in the political climate that exists and in the place where you work. I concluded that Sanders was less interested in actually accomplishing anything than he was in staging protests where he could claim some kind of moral high ground, not interested in getting in the weeds and doing anything to actually achieve his goals within the Congress he worked in. This research put Sanders’ supposedly pristine progressive agenda in perspective: it is very easy to maintain that agenda if you never make the hard choices necessary to get things done.

With electricity they are highly related. The production and consumption occur nearly at the same time. If they are not matched, you have a brown out, a black out, instability, potentially disaster.
BQEND
True. But, like I said before, the issue of energy storage is completely unrelated to the energy source. Whether electricity is produced by an oil plant, a coal plant, a nuclear plant, a solar plant, a hydro plant or a converted exercise bike, all the surplus energy produced is lost (unless, like I said before, it's consumed by another, importing country).
BQSTART
No, they are base power, you can't ramp nuclear quickly and you don't want to, coal is also best run at a stable level.
BQEND
Then again, nuclear reactors or coal plant turbines are regularly shut down in times of low demand, which is what I was refering to.

BQSTART
You don't, they are neither base nor peaking power, they are intermittent power. So this is a whole new thing that you and so many others seem to ignore.

individually solar power, wind power and, to a lesser extent, tidal power are indeed intermittent, unstable and unpredictable, the
energy mix that comprises of these RES, as well as other, more stable RES like biomass, geothermal and hydro is neither intermittent nor unstable.

Sanders promoted Clinton, much to his discredit in my view. 
Barack Obama dragged his feet on climate change for most of his two terms in office. He presided over a massive increase in fracking--a process that emits methane, a greenhouse gas--and of oil drilling on federal lands. He ran cover for BP in the aftermath of its oil spill in the Gulf. He opened the Atlantic Seaboard to oil drilling between 2010 and 2016 and to the Arctic as well, only retracting that as part of his legacy-protection efforts in his final days in office. He refused to oppose the Keystone XL Pipeline for years, only coming out against it after TransCanada pulled its permit application. Obama permitted Shell to drill in the depths of the Chukchi Sea seventy-five miles off the Alaskan coast. In 2012 he visited the oil patch there to boast about the vast increases in fossil fuel production his policies had stimulated. And Obama adopted a studiously neutral posture as the police and company vigilantes inflicted violence and terror on those opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock. 
Mindless tools like ""TheWhatWhatofWhat"" incoherently flail at people on the left WHO OPPOSED the environmentally devastating policies that his corporate liberal hero Obama--and Hillary Clinton, the Queen of Global Fracking--supported, proving, once again, how utterly irrelevant modern liberalism has become in the face of the mounting crisis humanity faces.

I provide you with a link to information from the World Health Organisation & you resort to Wikipedia. Kind of sums up the whole debate on that one. Would you accept reporting from the New York Times? (with accompanying commentary from various nutjobs) You realise that people choosing the facts that they want to believe in, while ignoring actual expertise is probably the main reason why Trump is President right? And in actuality people are moving back to Fukushima, as well as surrounding prefectures, because it is safe. There is also no spike in radiation... that bit of 'fake news' you are peddling is the result of people constructing ever more robust robots that can get closer to the melted core of the broken reactor (inside a containment structure that did not break). So big surprise, those robots then managed to detect higher radiation levels, which is how science works. And this is a reactor that is a mess & will be very difficult to clean up. But you know what? The advances they will make in robotics will be put to use as we continue to explore our solar system to visit the planets & moons that have similarly high levels of radiation to deal with. Meanwhile though the people who work there on the clean up no longer need to wear protective clothing (alt link) ...but read the assorted commentary of various nutjobs at that link too. Some people are very invested in being afraid.
As for advances in energy storage, that is actually a big gamble to make with the fate of humanity itself at stake. Laypeople in general don't really grasp the challenges involved & the large amount of time it takes to make the required developments. What we are seeing at present is the result of many decades of work on Lithium-ion technologies (all those laptops & mobile phones). Even a slight modification of the chemistry (eg. Li-O₂ technology alt link) means having to start from the very beginning... and there is always the parable of Envia & A123. Fundamentally we are trying to replicate the advantages in energy storage that Nature itself decided are best done in the chemical bonds of a hydrocarbon... which is how we got into the present predicament in the first place. Needless to say we won't improve on that technology, and progress on alternatives will be slow with more failures than successes. As for large scale long term storage, pumped hydro has been around for many decades (usually for storing overnight coal-fired electricity) and won't be finding a way to magically produce order of magnitude improvements. The only people who assume the required improvements will come are those that don't bother to investigate the technology beyond the occasional media blurb. We are likely to go several decades into the future & the improvements will be modest at best in this area. But we should try anyway. Recognising the many potential pitfalls however, a wise approach would include other options for decarbonisation so that the whole plan doesn't collapse when the required improvements in energy storage don't materialise.
If you are up for getting a better understanding on the issue of 100% renewables & energy storage & just deep decarbonisation in general, then this is an excellent starting point.

here in the States at Washington State University, their agriculture based engineers have been working on irrigation ditch (water) driven turbines to electrify battery powered machinery.
BQEND
One of the
earliest uses of wind power was to power pumps for irrigation.

BQSTART
For more than two millennia wind-powered machines have ground grain and pumped water.
BQEND
The water in irrigation ditches typically flows very slowly, with little or no excess energy to extract so typically it could not generate power for machinery, no.
If you have a fast moving stream then again that's a long established way of generating power.
However, it is not as if farms are stuck for proven ways to generate power. For example, there are the well-established, tried and tested renewable energy technologies - wind turbines and / or solar panels, backed up with biomass (straw for example) burning generators. 
If there's a grid connection, the farm power can use the grid for power regulation (matching supply with demand) or if there's no grid or the intention is to design a system that works off the grid then the system designed can regulate power using an energy store - and I normally recommend pumped-storage hydro or power-to-gas though there are other energy storage methods.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1493415855000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'14857627', u'in_reply_to': u'97476176', u'id': u'97492588', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'J.K.

...of COURSE healthcare costs have risen sharply since 1960 you buffoon, that is the nature of healthcare technology.
BQEND
Right.
Just like the ""nature"" of computer technology made computers so much more expensive now than in 1960. And how the real cost of automobiles fell 50% in the last century. And telephone calls 99%. Examples are too numerous to count.
Unlike the medical sector, these were able to develop without being choked by the government albatross.
Left to its own devices, any technology of other product for which there is a demand will over time become less costly, as market competition will result in higher productivity over time.
It is this process that is responsible for our current generation enjoying the highest standard of living in history, which would be far higher were it not impeded by government meddling.
Very few leftists, of course, can grasp this rather obvious truth, because they are profoundly ignorant of economics and history, and deprived of their reasoning faculties by leftist ideology, which many reality-based people now consider to be a cognitive disorder.

“Mr President, start listening to the people and the scientists, not the greed of the fossil fuel industry,” Sanders said at a rally on Capitol Hill, where he was flanked by environmental advocates and two of his Democratic colleagues, Senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who authored the bill, and Ed Markey of Massachusetts.
“As you all know,” the Vermont senator and former presidential candidate told the crowd, “Donald Trump is wrong about a lot of things. But there is no area where he is more wrong than on the issue of climate change.”
Sanders added: “No, Mr President, climate change is not a hoax. Climate change is real.”
At the event, held just outside the US Capitol, Sanders, Merkley and Markey unveiled legislation which seeks to completely phase out the use of fossil fuels through a transition to 100% clean and renewable energy by the middle of this century. But the bill, called the 100 by ’50 Act, is unlikely to be considered by a Republican-controlled Congress, where many GOP lawmakers are still unwilling to acknowledge the science behind global warming and contribution of human activity.
The partisan nature of the debate was not lost on the audience, as one attendee interrupted the proceedings to ask: “Where are the Republicans?”
“We’re going to have to recruit those colleagues across the aisle,” said Merkley, who ranks among the Senate’s most progressive voices. “This is not a red or a blue issue,” he said. “There is no excuse for failure. This is the biggest test facing human civilization and we have to respond and win this battle.”
Demonstrators are set to gather in Washington for the People’s Climate March on Saturday, which will also mark the 100th day of the Trump administration. Similar marches are expected in major cities across the US, as part of a broader effort to oppose Trump’s efforts to roll back the climate initiatives put in place by Barack Obama.
The president has signaled his intentions to tear up the landmark Paris climate agreement, forged by more than 195 nations in late 2015, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28% over a decade.
Trump’s top aides, who are split on whether or not the US should remain part of the Paris accord, were scheduled to meet on Thursday afternoon to discuss the deal’s future. Trump’s chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, is a vocal proponent of pulling out immediately.
Trump has vowed to withdraw from the Paris agreement, and has already taken steps through executive action to begin the process of overturning Obama-era environmental regulations.
Among them was a directive to the EPA to dismantle the Clean Power Plan, one of Obama’s signature climate policies to reduce carbon pollution from power plants. Trump also signed an executive order that aims to unravel the Obama rule designed to protect American waterways from pollution, and proposed in his budget draconian cuts to the EPA.
At the rally, Markey said Trump’s actions were precisely why hundreds of thousands of people felt compelled to take to the streets.
“Donald Trump [is] still saying that he’s going to issue a new executive order allowing for more oil drilling on the public lands of the United States of America,” he said, drawing jeers for the president from the crowd. “That is just completely and totally unacceptable.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/27/bernie-sanders-fossil-fuel-plan-2050

In no way, shape or form is that a commitment to give you a $550 rebate on your electricity bill. It's patently obvious that Abbott is talking about general benefit to the economy flowing from cheaper electricity prices. Governments talk in these terms all the time when describing the claimed benefits of their policies.

Energy Networks Australia (ENA) says clear policy settings could ultimately save Australian energy customers $100bn, and allow a smooth transition, where large-scale variable renewable energy can be integrated securely, creating the prospect of Australia’s electricity sector achieving zero net carbon emissions by 2050.
A new roadmap from the ENA to be released on Friday says the energy market is in the middle of a profound transformation that will only intensify over the next two decades.
Modelling produced for the report suggests that by 2050, up to 45% of Australia’s electricity supply could be provided by millions of distributed, privately owned generators, in homes and businesses.
The report notes the trend towards decentralisation of power generation creates “profound adaptation challenges for the system’s architecture, stability and efficiency given it was originally designed for almost 100% of generation at the transmission end of the system”.
The report’s estimated $100bn in cost savings is a function of governments rolling out nationally consistent policies that would encourage the two parts of the system to work harmoniously together – the current poles and wires of the national market, and the virtual grids in homes and businesses.
Allowing efficient co-optimisation would prevent overinvestment in poles and wires.
The ENA’s chief executive, John Bradley, said with stable policy settings, networks could buy grid support from customers instead of building their own infrastructure.
The rise of distributed energy between now and 2050 will coincide with decarbonisation in the national grid.
The report suggests by 2030, around 40% of generation could come from renewable technologies in Victoria and Western Australia, with an increasing share in New South Wales and Queensland as coal generators are retired.
The report points out that Queensland alone will boast solar generation capacity almost as large as its current coal-fired generation capacity by 2030.
The chief energy economist at the CSIRO, Paul Graham, who collaborated on the report, said the east coast grid would probably require the equivalent of 25 new large-scale solar or windfarms being built in just five years.
But the report points out that the massive technological transformation is rolling out in a policy vacuum.
“There is currently no enduring, clear long-term climate policy. There is also a lack of integration between electricity sector planning processes and climate policy,” the ENA report says.
It notes barriers to efficient decarbonisation “will be exacerbated if distributed energy resources are not utilised to support system balancing, facilitated by network optimisation systems”.
The release of the roadmap follows the publication of a draft version last December just before the Coalition decided to rule out an emissions-intensity scheme for the electricity sector after a brief internal revolt.
The ENA’s new report continues to argue that an emission-intensity baseline and credit scheme for the electricity sector, and “technology-neutral” carbon policy, would allow the transition to low-emissions power sources at least cost to households.
It says an intensity scheme or an “alternative policy of similar merit” should be rolled out by 2020, and the government should pursue “review opportunities to introduce an economy-wide carbon pricing mechanism” by 2026.
Bradley says the intense transformation required in the electricity sector will only be possible if the industry agrees on a clear roadmap, and with “stable and enduring carbon policy to support investment”.
A range of influential organisations have told the current Finkel review of the national electricity market the Turnbull government needs to put a price on carbon or adopt a market mechanism to drive emissions reduction.
A string of peak bodies have used the review to call for the adoption of a market mechanism, including the National Farmers’ Federation, the Investor Group on Climate Change and the Business Council of Australia, which explicitly called for an emissions intensity scheme.
The current industry consensus around carbon pricing is a major turnaround in a very short period of time.
Three years ago some of the same groups urged the parliament to get out of the way so that Tony Abbott could repeal the Gillard government’s “carbon tax”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/apr/28/australians-could-save-100bn-on-electricity-if-government-had-clear-policy

The relationship between the Greens and the giant roughhouse union the CFMEU is curious. The union has tipped money into the minority party in rather generous dollops. There seemed to be some quid pro quo with Senator Richard Di Natale and his parliamentary colleagues opposing the restoration of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and legislation to reduce the number of union people on the boards of super funds. Other employee outfits such as the Electrical Trades Union and the National Tertiary Education Union have also funded the Greenies. But when it comes to coalmining there are some unfortunate tensions. Contrary to official Greens policy, the mining part of the CFMEU is dead keen on getting the Adani mine up and running, in the forlorn belief that it will employ thousands of workers. Yet the union’s construction segment doesn’t seem too bothered about splashing members’ funds on the minority party.

Westpac, the country’s second-largest bank, released a new climate policy on Friday, saying it would limit lending for new thermal coal projects to “only existing coal producing basins”.
The coal mined must also have energy content “in at least the top 15% globally”, meaning at least 6,300 kilocalories per kg, according to the Westpac policy.
Adani’s Carmichael mine would be the first in the Galilee basin and the coal would have only 4,950 kilocalories per kg, the miner told the Queensland land court in 2014.
Canavan, thealso the minister for northern Australia, invited Queenslanders seeking home loans or term deposits to boycott Westpac as a result of its decision.
“I can only conclude from this decision by Westpac that they are seeking to revert to their original name as the Bank of New South Wales, as they are turning their back on Queensland as a result of this decision,” he said.
“May I suggest those Queenslanders seeking a home loan or a bank deposit or some such in the next few months might want to back a bank that is backing the interests of Queenslanders.”
Canavan also accused Westpac of turning its back on “the Indigenous people of Queensland” because of majority support for the project among Wangan and Jagalingou traditional owners, although this is contested by an anti-Adani faction.
The Queensland senator castigated the bank for “almost zero consultation with the people of north Queensland”, saying it was “more interested in listening to the noisy activists in Sydney than the job hungry people” in his constituency.
Westpac has come under pressure from environmental groups and various activist campaigns, including one that targeted its cash machines and a rally that interrupted the bank’s 200th anniversary celebrations in Sydney this month.
Adani’s final investment decision on Carmichael had been slated for this month but the company subsequently said it would be made by June before mine construction from August.
An Adani Australia spokesman said the company had not approached Westpac for funding for the mine, rail or port expansion.
But Blair Palese, the chief executive of climate advocacy group 350.org, said Westpac’s decision represented “an enormous blow to this project and the future of coal in Australia”.
Palese said the federal and Queensland governments, which both support the proposed mine, were “becoming increasingly isolated as businesses and international investors refuse to touch coal and the Adani project”.
“After months of community pressure, Westpac’s announcement is a strong indication that people everywhere are ready to stop this climate disaster in its tracks and that Adani and our government ignore them at their peril,” he said.
Adani is seeking a $1bn concessional loan from the commonwealth for its rail project linking the mine to its Abbot Point coal terminal.
On Thursday Andrew Harding, the CEO of Adani’s rival Aurizon, told the Melbourne Mining Club his company could build the line for “at least $1bn less” than Adani’s proposal, with fewer land acquisitions and less impact on the environment. 
Adani wrote off that suggestion as “fanciful and monopolistic”.
“The so-called plan is a smokescreen aimed at defending Aurizon’s expensive monopoly of coal rail lines in Queensland,” Adani said. “The Aurizon plan is designed to instil fear and stifle hope in the people of regional Queensland.”
The CEO of Westpac, Brian Hartzer, also said the bank would increase its lending target for “climate change solutions” from $6.3bn to $10bn by 2020 and $25bn by 2030.
“Westpac recognises that climate change is an economic issue as well as an environmental issue, and banks have an important role to play in assisting the Australian economy to transition to a net zero emissions economy,” Hartzer said. “Limiting global warming will require a collaborative effort as we transition to lower-emissions sectors, while also taking steps to help the economy and our communities become more resilient.”
Adani previously received a $543m loan facility in two deals with Westpac, alongside others from Commonwealth Bank and National Australia Bank, to acquire a 99-year lease on the Abbot Point terminal, according to the climate advocacy group Market Forces.
NAB ruled out funding the Carmichael project in September 2015, a month after Commonwealth Bank parted ways with Adani as project finance adviser.
The CEO of ANZ, Shayne Elliott, in effect ruled out financing the mine last December when he predicted a downward shift in the bank’s exposure to coalmining would continue for the foreseeable future.
Critics of the Adani proposal, which would be Australia’s largest and one of the world’s largest coal mines, argue the impact of carbon emissions from its coal is incompatible with global attempts to limit warming to less than 2C.
Canavan said Adani’s target markets in India and north Asia would simply source lower quality coal with higher emissions elsewhere, a conclusion he said was shared by the Queensland supreme court in its recent rejection of a “green activist claims” against the mine.
The Adani spokesman said the company was “fervently committed” to the project “despite Westpac and other Australian financial houses choosing to ignore the opportunity to invest”.
“The financial houses have, instead, chosen to bow to environmental activists,” he said. “In so doing, they have chosen to continue to invest in overseas coal projects that will generate jobs in those countries at the expense of Australians, many of whom are their investors and depositors.”
The Carmichael coal “easily meets the emissions standards announced by Westpac”, the spokesman said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/28/big-four-banks-all-refuse-to-fund-adani-coalmine-after-westpac-rules-out-loan

The way I see it, listening is a form of activism.
This Saturday I will be in Washington DC for the People’s Climate March, and I will have my audio recorder with me as part of my mission to collect 1,001 audio interviews about how climate change and water have impacted their lives.
My journeys as a poet-activist-touring cyclist began three years ago at the People’s Climate March in New York. I wore a cardboard sign around my neck that said “tell me a story about water” on one side and “tell me a story about climate change” on the other, joining a rising tide of 400,000 activists.
That day people told stories about all sorts of things: of the health impacts of paper mill pollution on a community in northern China; climate change’s threats to Vermont’s maple syrup industry; and the experience of being stuck in an office building for 62 hours during Hurricane Sandy.
Since the 2014 People’s Climate March I have been traveling through 11 countries, mostly by bicycle (and sometimes by boat). To date I have recorded interviews with more than 600 storytellers in the US, Fiji, Tuvalu, New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Qatar, Morocco and the UK. 
You can follow my progress on my 1,001 stories website.
Here is a sample of some of the stories I have recorded on my journeys so far.
I met Rebecca and her daughter Athena at the September 2014 People’s Climate March in NYC. At the time, Athena was five months old; she slept on her mother’s chest as we walked. 
Rebecca told me that she and her husband moved to Ojai, California because they wanted to “start a family and get out of the big city of Los Angeles.” 
“We moved to a five acre avocado ranch in Ojai and we have 300-plus avocado trees,” Rebecca said. “Our whole goal is to build and create this farm so that we could raise our daughter Athena that she could live on for her whole life and have her children.” 
Their goal was to have a farm that could be passed down through generations. A prolonged drought made that goal more complex than Rebecca anticipated. “We’re now at the end of a five year drought and our water is running out, and so our trees are extremely thirsty,” she said at the time. “The cost of water is soaring. We’re not sure if we’re going to be able to keep our trees or not because of how water consumptive it is.” 
All of the water in Ojai comes from Lake Casitas. After five years of drought, the reservoir was then on its last reserves. “The climate, just since we’ve moved to Ojai, has completely changed,” Rebecca said, “and so our big dream and our vision of moving to this beautiful place where we could grow our own food and we could live sustainably on the earth is starting to die, quite literally. It’s drying up.” 
The highest point on this low-lying coral atoll nation in the Pacific is only four meters (12.5ft) above sea level. With a population just shy of 11,000, Tuvalu is one of the smallest and most remote countries on the planet.
I lived in Tuvalu for a month, from December 2014 to January 2015, and during that time I made friends with Losite, a Tuvaluan my age, who invited me to the outer island of Nukufetau to spend Christmas with her family.
Losite’s mother, Nisikata, works as a primary school teacher in Nukufetau. We sat overlooking the sea. She told me the story of a drought that lasted from April to December 2013: “Our local taro crops [and] the fish died because of the drought,” she said. “We usually get water from rain. And when we [went to] fetch water from our tank … it’s all empty.
“The underground well water [was] also salty,” Nisikata said. “There used to be a freshwater lens under Tuvalu. In the last 15 years, due to sea level change, that freshwater lens has become salty and impossible to drink.”
“With the drought, so many things that affected our life, like our livestocks. We depend on pigs, [and were] also facing problem by finding food. Coconuts are not bearing fruit … green nuts are all falling down. [It was] very hard to find anything to drink,” she said.
“Donors from overseas gave bottles of water and those waters [were] distributed to each island and also into schools by the government of Tuvalu. And from there we can survive.” 
Rations of food were also provided to each island. “Bit by bit we used those and when we run out of the ration, the government still providing us with more until we were back again to our normal weather: sunny, warm and then sometimes rain.”
I met Dr Mike Joy, a senior lecturer at Massey University, during my bike trip down the length of Aotearoa. Joy told me this story from his home in the Horowhenua, on the lower north island, in February 2015. 
“Water and climate change are totally interrelated here, as I guess they are everywhere,” Joy said. “As a country we are going along a very clear path towards maximizing agricultural production. Our government has decided that it wants to double agricultural production in the next decade or two.
“We already have extreme effects of intensification of farming,” he said. “62% of the length of all our rivers in the country are unswimmable through pathogens, mostly from farming but also from urban impacts.
“Pretty much anywhere in lowland New Zealand you’ll find polluted waterways, and in the conservation estate, which is mostly the alpine areas, we have amazingly clean lakes and rivers,” Joy said. 
With the intensification of dairy agriculture, “we now have 6.5m dairy cows in this country,” Joy said. “If you want to think about the impact of 6.5m dairy cows, a very conservative comparison is that one dairy cow produces as much waste as 14 humans. So you multiply that out … a country the size of the United Kingdom and has 90 million human equivalents.” 
The current human population of New Zealand is 4.8 million: “The waste from these animals doesn’t get some form of treatment like human waste would in a developed country. It mostly just goes into waterways.
“The other big downside to that is more than 50% of our greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, and so we effectively, while our CO2 emissions are relatively OK because we’re quite a low human population, our greenhouse gas emissions in total are massively increasing,” Joy said.
“We trade on this clean green image, but in reality we’ve trashed an amazingly unique and diverse country, and we’ve trashed it in the name of producing a very low-value commodity – that’s milk powder. Of the milk that’s traded in the world, more than 35% of it comes from New Zealand. We’re a major player in global markets, but only at the cheapest possible end of the scale.”
And at what cost? “The other reality that’s well hidden here is that New Zealand has the highest proportion globally of threatened species overall. We have the highest incidence of waterborne diseases of any developed country as well.”
Partway through my six months of cycling up Australia’s east coast, I pedalled through Wooyung, in New South Wales. Enticed by hand-painted signs for peaches, nectarines, lychees and mangoes, I pulled into Wooyung Rd Fruit and Vegetable Stall. I propped my bicycle next to an array of coconuts. 
I bought a banana and a nectarine and listened as Terry, a lifelong farmer in Wooyung, told me the story of how floods are more unpredictable than ever before. He said: “Here we used to get floods in January, February. March was your wet monsoon. Now they can come any time from winter. The biggest flood we had, 2005, was the end of June – 34 inches in about three days.”
This unpredictability impacts which crops Terry is able to plant. “There’s risk planting any crops on the flats now,” Terry said. “You used to be able to plant watermelons, rockmelons, and things on the flats and you seldom got flooded out before maybe January, February. Now, anytime, there’s such a risk,” he said. “Too much money involved to put many crops down on the flats,” Terry said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/28/devi-lockwood-climate-march-1001-climate-change-stories

El Niño events are prompted by natural fluctuation in ocean temperatures in the Pacific but have a global impact, leading to flooding, droughts and heatwaves. They also exacerbate the increased extreme weather events occurring due to the continued heating of the world as a result of human-caused climate change.
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Friday that a new El Niño was 50-60% likely before the end of 2017. “Memories are still fresh of the powerful 2015-2016 El Niño which was associated with droughts, flooding and coral bleaching in different parts of the world and which, combined with long-term climate change, led to the increase of global temperatures to new record highs in both 2015 and 2016,” said Maxx Dilley, director of WMO’s climate prediction and adaptation division.
It is unusual for El Niño conditions to return so swiftly, said Tim Stockdale, principal scientist at the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), one of the leading prediction centres around the world and which contributed to the WMO forecast. “Normally we would expect a longer interval before another warming. But, having said that, El Niño variability is really rather irregular.”
Friday’s forecast is a early one, based on observations, climate models and historical trends. At present the likelihood is that any El Niño event will be a moderate one. “It will become clearer in the next couple of months,” said Stockdale.
However, regional warming associated with El Niño has already caused very heavy rains and floods in Peru and Ecuador, after the sea surface temperatures in the far eastern tropical Pacific ocean rose to 2C or more above average during February and March. This phenomenon has in the past sometimes been followed by a global El Niño.
Another concern is that the variation in El Niño over decades may be switching to a new, hotter phase. “For the last decade, the tropical Pacific has tended to be on the cold side, and that has helped keep global temperatures down. With this warming coming back so soon, it makes you wonder if the decadal trend is a bit more on to the positive side,” said Stockdale. “Obviously if that were sustained over the next five to 10 years, it would make the global warming signal stand out more strongly than it has done over the past decade.”
The impacts of El Niño events vary but often lead to hot, dry conditions in south and eastern Australia, as well as in Indonesia, the Philippines and south-eastern Africa. The Indian monsoon rainfall, upon which millions depend, also tends to be lower than normal. Wetter than usual conditions are typically seen along the Gulf coast of the US, and the west coast of tropical South America.
It remains unclear whether climate change is affecting the frequency or severity of El Niño events, partly because with complex phenomena many years of data are needed to distinguish the human-caused and natural influences. 
The ability to forecast El Niño events has improved in recent years, enabling authorities to make preparations. “Accurate predictions of the most recent El Niño saved untold lives. These [are] essential for the agricultural and food security sectors, for management of water resources and public health, as well as for disaster risk reduction,” said Dilley.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/28/temperature-boosting-el-nino-set-for-early-return-this-year

Nevertheless Paris COP21 was a big step forward.
For the first time almost the entire world has accepted that global warming is an urgent threat to the stability of the climate system, habitable zones, and global food chains. 
They have accepted the need for commitment to, and have set country by country emission reducing targets, and have recognised that what has been agreed is far too little for a safe outcome.
They have agreed that the targets must be reviewed within five years to match more closely the requirements Earth science suggests are needed to prevent catastrophic consequences within the lifetime of today's teenagers.
Trump is a clear and present danger to the biosphere, humanity and modern civilisation. America should start impeachment on the grounds that he is too dangerously irrational, to hold the office of President.
This graphic shows how difficult the +2C target is to achieve, because the world has already wasted too much time. The fossil fuelled Trump administration is a deadly mistake.

But we also owe it – very faint – hope | Bill McKibben,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/28/climate-march-washington-dc-trump-administration-environment,0,"There is no upside to the Trump presidency. To be in DC – I’ve come for Saturday’s giant climate march – is to be reminded up close what all Americans have known for months: we’ve put the country in the hands of a man completely unequal to the task. A man so cluelessly over his head that he keeps telling reporters he’s in over his head.
 But if you want a few grayish linings to the dark-orange cloud, you can find them. In fact, the last few days have given those of us in the climate fight a few glimmers of light.
 At midweek, and quite unexpectedly, the man who invests Harvard’s billions announced at a seminar that the world’s richest and most famous educational institution had more or less divested from fossil fuels. Of course he didn’t say that explicitly since it would require backtracking on the university’s strident declaration that it would never do such a thing. But close enough – Harvard had “paused” investing in fossil fuels, and was unlikely “ever” to resume. 
 Credit a remarkable campaign. Harvard students – like those at so many other places, including Penn and Cal where campaigners are currently sitting in –waged a relentless fight, even as officials told them no over and over again. Great credit is due them, and the alumni and faculty they enlisted. Leaders like Chloe Maxmin, who I met while she was still in high school, spent their entire college years on the fight, showing what persistence looks like.
 But they were aided, I think, by Trump’s unlikely victory. In the past, plenty of players could look for someone else to pass the buck to: surely dealing with climate change was the government’s responsibility, not Harvard’s? That was always a moral lapse, but in the Trump era it’s completely absurd. We’re ruled by a man who thinks global warming is a hoax manufactured by the Chinese – clearly the rest of us are going to have to step up.
 And that rest of us includes Democratic politicians, too many of whom have tried to straddle the climate issue in the past. Barack Obama, remember, spent his years in office championing an “all of the above” energy policy that saw America vault past Russia and Saudi Arabia as the biggest hydrocarbon producer on the planet. But Trump throws such temporizing into sharper relief. 
That’s why Oregon senator Jeff Merkley and Bernie Sanders felt empowered Thursday to introduce legislation that, for the very first time, draws the line where it should be. Their bill demands that America move to 100% renewable energy. Not some solar panels but also some frack wells, not some windmills but also some new pipelines. 100%.
 That bill’s not going to pass anytime soon, obviously, but it is going to become the new bottom line for any serious progressive politician. Whoever leads the fight to replace Trump is going to have to do it on a platform of 100% renewable energy –and in contrast to Trump’s craziness on the issue, it will look statesmanlike instead of aspirational.
 If the capitulation of some parts of the establishment, and the invigoration of some progressive leaders, count as two small positives, there’s also a third: the unleashing of the full energy of lots and lots of people who have had to speak more softly in the past. One of the strongest voices at the ceremony launching the Merkley/Sanders bill, for instance, came from Mustafa Ali, who for many years ran the environmental justice program at EPA.
 The environmental justice program probably won’t exist much longer – the Trump EPA budget zeroes it out, which tells you all you need to know. Ali resigned – and immediately joined the staff of the HipHop Caucus, one of the most vibrant and dynamic climate justice campaigns on this particular planet. 
In his first few weeks, Ali spoke powerfully – but with a bit of the habitual reserve of the bureaucrat. By yesterday he was sounding a lot like the Rev Lennox Yearwood, the charismatic founder of the caucus: he had US senators, fists in the air, chanting “Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop.”
 Which is pretty much what all of us who will march tomorrow are saying. We’re under no illusions: Trump is the worst thing that could have happened to the planet. It’s possible the damage he’ll do will be eternal – we’re clearly on the edge of breaking the planet’s climate system. But we will fight on, looking for the holes in the Death Star. And finding some.

Trump’s initiatives include, but are not limited to, a 31% cut in the Environmental Protection Agency and potentially leaving the Paris climate agreement.
Among those suffering in the heat will be former vice-president Al Gore and, apparently, Leonardo DiCaprio. It is likely to take a titanic effort to change the other Wolf of Wall Street’s mind, however, as Trump has repeatedly said that the inception of climate change had nothing to do with mankind. Only 1,361 more days of this to go!
A group of senators, including Resistance regular Bernie Sanders, this week unveiled legislation that aims to transition to 100% clean and renewable energy by 2050.
Hundreds of thousands of immigrants and their allies will be striking and marching around the country on 1 May. The May Day protests are traditionally led by unions and labor groups, but this year – galvanized by the Trump administration – immigration, racial justice, gender equality and LGBT groups will be playing a big part.
Demonstrations will take place in a number of states. Activist groups are launching a “Corporate Backers of Hate Campaign” on the same day, which will see demonstrations at the offices of companies seen to be supporting or benefiting from the Trump presidency. Targets include JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs.
Trump will be met by thousands of Luke Skywalkers, Hans Solos, and, depending on individuals’ tastes, Jar Jar Binkses when he returns to New York City next week. 
It’s the president’s first trip to his home city since inauguration day but he will be met by protests. Given Trump’s visit comes on 4 May (May the fourth be with you, etc), organizers have called for activists to come clad in Star Wars gear.
The president, a noted fan of heavy machinery, will be visiting the USS Intrepid aircraft carrier-cum-museum with the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. The NYPD says it costs $308,000 a day to protect Trump during his New York jaunts.
There has been a 1,035% spike in Islamophobic incidents at US borders during Trump’s first 100 days, according to the Council on American-Islamic relations (Cair).
In a press conference on Thursday Cair’s executive director, Nihad Awad, said the group, which he founded in 1994, had “never seen a spike” under any previous administration. A coalition of Muslim organizations is holding a two-day meeting in Washington on 1-2 May when they will lobby elected representatives to take action.
• “Trump is the worst thing that could have happened to the planet,” writes climate activist Bill McKibben, but his catastrophic attitude towards the environment has at least forced politicians, and some private enterprises, to step up.
• In related news, the Trump administration is considering allowing oil and gas companies to drill off the Atlantic seaboard. The president has ordered his interior department to “review offshore areas potentially rich in fossil fuels that were put out of reach of drilling by Barack Obama’s administration”, according to Oliver Milman.
On Wednesday the government launched a new hotline for people to report crimes committed by “illegal aliens”. 
It appears to be another anti-immigrant step by the Trump administration – but the plan was reportedly thwarted when people called the hotline to report UFO sightings. Or sightings of Superman. Or Big Foot. You get the idea.
If any of you need to report space aliens to our government, please call their hotline: 1-855-48-VOICE.

It is NOT true that 99% of peer reviewed papers conclude that. Indeed the IPCC AR5 report states that the climate response to a doubling of CO2 is 'likely' in the range 1C to 2.5C and extremely unlikely to be above 3C. A temperature rise of 2C is not devastating. 
We need to decrease and then hold emissions at a fixed (smaller) level for CO2 levels to eventually stabilise. We only have to reduce them to zero if we want to return to pre-industrial levels.

as to the topic of universal health care and abortion rights. Those are issues I am still mulling over as I can see the rational argument both for and against. I can hear it "" 'against universal health care!!' what is wrong with you"". I think my resistance to it ties back to three things 
1. the implied lack of agency on the part of an individual (the government controls your access to health and has access to your private self), 
2. the law of unintended consequences. From Health Management Organizations (HMO's) in the early 1990's to the Affordable Care Act, health costs in the U.S. have increased disproportionate to inflation, while assess to doctors has decreased. 
3. only a very few projects are most effective at the federal level - the space program being a shining example. Most efforts that require community action work best at a local community level.

Here is the issue many of us have with your argumentYou wish to change the government of the U.S. from a Republic to a Majority Rule Democracy for POTUS.You chose to argue for this change by associating the republican form of government with a disavowed and repugnant episode in our countries history (as do many others). You go on to say a republican form of government is not suitable for today - essential just repeating your thesis.
Now, here is why this is a very bad argument. There is nothing intrinsic about a republic that is in any way associated with slavery, yet you link the two. You could have easily said that historically, the electoral college was established so states with smaller populations would agree to join the union. That is a true and unbiased statement. You could have argued that that now all citizens / states see the benefit of belonging to the union and therefore we no longer need the electoral college. The merits of that or other arguments would be up for discussion.However that is not what you do. Instead you bring up slavery as your argument - why? To stop discussion, to imply that through association anyone who supports the Electoral College is as backward and bigoted as the slaveholders of the 19th century. 
Brightwings, I think you know what you are doing, even though you cry innocence in your reply to Chief Wiley about associating slavery with the electoral college. And frankly what you are doing is disgusting. You are smart enough to know that slavery is to the U.S. what nazism is to Germany and so you use this emotional issue and try to use collective guilt to win folks to your argument. But you seem to thing others are not so smart and will not see through your propaganda. However, all you do is anger people through your false argument and end the possibility for a real discussion.
If you have a real and convincing argument for instituting a straight democracy you need to give it. If you have an answer to the concern of ‘mob rule’ that can arise with a straight democracy you need to articulate it. But you don’t and so this suggests you are only after power over others and you will pursue that power over, through any means necessary and that too is disgusting.
Why should I try and talk with you or reach any common ground with you when you associate my concerns as a small population state resident by associating me with slave holders.

That debate is far, far behind us. The issue is how to address climate change – as quickly and effectively as possible.
Virtually the entire scientific community – more than 99% of peer-reviewed studies – has concluded that climate change is real. It is caused by human activity. And the impacts are devastating.
According to a study published Monday by the National Academy of Science, climate change is already causing severe weather events including prolonged droughts, record-high temperatures, and rising sea levels because of melting Arctic sea ice. And while everyone will be affected by climate change, the people who had least to do with causing the problem will be affected the most, including low-income families and communities of color across America.
That is why we must aggressively transition our energy system away from fossil fuels and toward clean, renewable energy solutions such as energy efficiency, solar, wind and geothermal energy, and electric vehicles. 
Here’s the good news: the global community is moving in the right direction. Solar panels cost 80% less today than they did in 2008. The solar industry has grown every year for the past decade. In fact, nearly one-fifth of the world’s electricity today comes from clean, renewable resources like the sun and wind.
No matter what agenda President Trump and his administration of climate deniers push, it is clear that jobs in clean energy like wind and solar are growing much more rapidly than jobs in the coal, oil and gas sectors. The number of workers maintaining wind turbines in the US is set to more than double between 2014 and 2024, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Around the world, more than 9.4 million people already work in the renewable energy sector. These are the jobs of the future. 
Not only does renewable energy help fight climate change and create jobs, but it’s also good for public health. Cutting carbon pollution emissions by just 32% by 2030 would prevent up to 3,600 premature deaths, 90,000 asthma attacks in children, and 1,700 heart attacks each year.
We’re beginning to transition to a clean energy economy – but scientists say we need to do it faster to avoid the worst consequences of climate change.
University researchers and the not-for-profit Solutions Project have mapped out how we can achieve a 100% clean, renewable energy future for all 50 states and 139 countries by 2050. With their research, governments in the US and around the world can learn exactly how to break dependence on fossil fuel, why we don’t need fracking and how we can move aggressively in terms of sustainable energy and energy efficiency.
Now is the time for taking swift, aggressive action.
This week, Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon and I, Bernie Sanders, together with Senators Ed Markey and Cory Booker, introduced a bill that is a major step forward in addressing the climate crisis. The bill, which is strongly supported by the Solutions Project and other major environmental organizations, would transition the US toward a completely clean energy system for electricity, heating, and transportation.
Not only is this possible and affordable, but it would also create millions of decent-paying, long-term and full-time jobs that our economy desperately needs. It would clean up our air and water. And it would decrease our dependence on foreign oil and improve national security.
Most Americans know that Congress is way out of touch with where the American people are. The Koch brothers and the fossil fuels industry are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on campaign contributions to keep it that way. Too many members of Congress now worry more about the interests of the oil, gas, and coal companies than the interests of their constituents and the wellbeing of the planet.
The only way we will defeat organized money is to organize through people power. We must stand up and demand that Congress put people over the profits of the fossil fuel industry. That’s why the People’s Climate March in Washington DC and all over the world on Saturday is so enormously important. 
When millions of people in every country in the world demand that their government work to transition our energy systems away from fossil fuels and toward sustainable energy, we will win. That’s what today is about, and that’s what tomorrow must be about. We must keep up the fight for our children and future generations to come.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/29/bernie-sanders-climate-change-big-oil

British democracy missed out on the reforms that took place in the early 20th century in Australia. 
As the commentators on this weekends second round of the French Presidential have said the direct democratic nature of the vote will stop the minority candidate winning the Presidency. In a the non-compulsory voting system of France the only worry for those who aren't of an extreme right wing persuasion is how many voters will opt not to vote. The opinion I heard is that a drop off in voter numbers will not skew the vote in this weekend's election.
Australia has compulsory voting. Voting is regarded as not just a right but also a responsibility. This results in around 90% or more of voters casting a valid vote. We also have preferential voting so that minor party voters second or third preference also counts as a vote in the final two horse race usually between candidates from the two major parties. 
This overcomes the first past the post problem that occurs in the election of British members of Parliament when in a 40%, 35%, 25% split between three candidates, the minority 40% candidate can win and become the unrepresentative representative.
This is not about perfection but instead its about the best possible system. While the US electoral college system may stop the majority of Americans deciding who will represent them as head of state and more importantly as head of executive government, in the guise of protecting the rights of the minority of voters in the smaller states, such people are not the only minority in the country. Minority rights have to be protected by other means.
Of course the electoral college gerrymander is not the only gerrymander tainting US democracy. The Senate is inherently gerrymandered. The House of Representatives has electoral districts which are not representative and many of the state houses have similar problems. 
 As a union rather than a federation the US lacks a national electoral commission at arms length from executive government comparable to the Australian Electoral Commission to ensure voting is fair, democratic, representative, proportional, and open to all voters.
My Prime Minister briefly met your president today with words from both leaders about the Battle of the Coral Sea off the coast of Queensland when both our countries fought the navy of an extreme right wing undemocratic power. We then understood the importance of democracy. It's a shame the Us has lost its way in that regard.

The answer was, abolish internal combustion cars by 2030, and reduce the total number of cars from 26 million to 13 million.
This is interesting because one can now start to think concretely about what this would involve. As of now there seem to be roughly 95,000 plug in cars registered in the UK, and we seem to be buying them at the rate of 75,000 in the year 2016-7. There are about 12,000 charging points.
So the question is, how you get there from here? The 13 million are going to have to all be bought new - there is no significant second hand market because not enough have been sold. 
A guess - you would announce in about 2020 that as of Jan 1 2030, no non-electric cars can be legally driven. No fuel can be sold for them. All fuel pumps will close. There will be charging points instead.
Now we have to get the things manufactured and sold. Right now a new electric with decent performance is going to cost. The Outlander, the most popular, costs a bit over £30,000. The next one, the Leaf, is from £20 - £25,000.
Well. This is going to be fun. People now, lots of them, buy their cars second hand at prices well under £10,000. They will just have to do without. This is a good reason for doubting that the 13 million number is achievable. Its probably going to be nearer 5 million, if that. We currently seem to be selling around 3 million new cars a year. If we double the average price, sales will fall by far more than one half. You can see this from the results of the recent excise tax rises.
It must be very doubtful that at the prices quoted above, its going to be possible to sell as many as 1 million a year. More like one half or one quarter of that, which would lead to an installed base of something like the 5 million estimated above.
Where are we going to get the batteries? That is not trivial at all...
You are also going to have to take consequential actions. The motorways and dual carriageways will be comparatively deserted - one doubts that battery technology is going to allow long distance driving in the next 12 years. Maybe you take some of the lanes and make them into mass transit and bike ways? But large numbers of people even so are going to find daily travel, shopping, getting to work and school very much harder and more time consuming. We are going to have to see large movements of people into places nearer to work and shopping. It will be the end of the suburbs, and rural areas will house mostly the retired. The retired who are fit enough to cycle, into the bargain!
And then you have the employment issue. You will be reducing employment in the auto industry very substantially. You will also have a positively huge amount of steel scrap to dispose of. All 26 million cars currently registered!
This is absolutely huge. Kudos to Jules for having put some numbers on it that allows one to start to think it through. But do you really, Jules, think any government is going to be able to get this through? Stay in office long enough to make it happen?

You mentioned models- this link is an excercise produced to explain weather/climate forecasting by Reading University, they are connected to studies of climate.
The advanced weather climate forecasting agency runs a basic formula that was developed decades ago- it is newtonian physics coupled with some materials physics that determines what happens to a particle in the atmosphere. 
The problem is that there a billions of calculations- so rather than doing each particle it does a block 100 KM in size, and with computing they are getting better and more refined.
The agency produced models of what would happen to Hurricane Sandy a week before it hit NY- running dozens of models each with slightly different inputs offered a dozen or more paths- but most of the them hit landfall towards NY rather than the few that meant it went out to sea or hit landfall earlier.
This enabled a probability of risk to be issued to emergency agencies to allow for a couple of days preparation.
So real results using real science.The same programs can be run longer for the whole world with different levels of CO2 as part of the equation- the physical properties of CO2 are well known and can then generate longer term climatic responses.
And these can be compared to actual observations over periods of decades.

Democracy is based on the principle that every voter's vote is, as close as possible, of equal value. Any system, such as the electoral college, which deviates significantly from this equal value rule is a gerrymander.
BQENDI am not at all sure of this one.
Most committed democrats have, at the same time, been very wary of lurches of popular sentiment. So they typically do not go for systems which will allow simple majorities to decided everything, with no safeguards. The safeguards vary, but in the UK you have the FPTP system, which effectively disenfanchised UKIP and which means that the number of votes required per MP varies wildly by party.
In the US you have the phased voting system, the checks and balanceces between executive and judiciary and legislature, and you also have the requirement that a party shall not just get a majority of votes, but shall get a majority of territories.
The effect, as you point out, is that the vote of a Los Angeleno has less weight than that of a Nebraskan. But its not right to call this 'undemocratic' as a system for this reason. Its a compromise, like any democratic system is. Like the UK system is. Even the dual round election system of France is a compromise though of a different sort. Pure PR ends up sacrificing something else - it would in the UK have admitted UKIP in large numbers to Parliament, probably to government in a coalition, but those admitted would have had no connection to the specific local voters who put them in.
Democracy is not an all or nothing system where if you fail in perfection you are not democratic. Its one in which any particular implementation will be open to criticism as less than perfect in some respect. But the real difference is between the systems as a whole which give the citizenry a voice and power over who governs them, and those where they have no power to throw out the government.

We don't actually have a plan for peak oil and the attitude of governments is we have decades and some how it is all going to be alright.
Syria is an interesting trailer of the worst kind of disaster movie- peak oil hits the poorest, food prices increase, subsidies decrease, revenue gets a double whammy of both loss of exports and increased imports, a narrow economy based on resources and a lack of sustainability due to the reliance of oil, topped by long term drought, and contained with state force.
So how do we cope with the expense of 2C rise, whilst the wealth creation is cheap energy that is rapidly becoming more expensive?How well would we cope with 3 C? how resilient are the grain belts whose surplus feeds billions?And what about low sensitivity but abrupt change in the climate of that grain producing belt?
hopefully we are not going to billions starving, but some nations will see famine, who will place pressure on their neighbours. Globally we we spend more on food in the event of drought/flood in key areas, and this may lead to wilderness and forest suffering, leading to more AGW.
There is some speculation that plagues were worse in Europe because of bad summers, that led to a lowering of immunity, and in times of climatic stress that leads to migration, which leads to spreading of disease.
Our civilisation has lots of pressure points, even the price of oil given our civilisation is built on $30 b oil, and globally $100 oil saw very slow growth. War of course seems to be a human condition, but just because Rome fell a part it doesn't mean other wars /empires collapsed for the same reasons.
If anything full international war is on the wain, it is very energy intensive, even the crusades were sucking up huge resources at home- so we are likely to see more of the non linear wars currently raging. The WW1 was a fossil fuel war, it used mass production , a fossil fueled industrial complex and steam to deliver the soldiers to the front line- and WW2 was oil powered.
My over riding point is actually even though there is a degree of continuity our civilisation is only a couple of hundred years old- the old civilisation didn't collapse it was simply superceded.

BQENDSo I can blame the rise of the Roman and British Empires on climate change, both founded on wars.

BQENDI used to read The Oil Drum a couple of times a week. I know the whole peak oil thing. I still keep in touch with places like
Peak Oil Barrel . I could probably write a book on civilisation and peak oil, though it would just cover the sort of ground gone over by Kunstler, Richard Heinberg, Rob Newman and that lot. But I do not or at least no longer believe that is really where we are as a civilisation now.
The civilsations that collapse in the Bronze age had probably less than 1% of their populations able to read. Even kings and royalty were likely illiterate. One of the current ""big ideas"" in history is that Western Rome underwent ""radical material simplification"". For the vast majority of the populace they moved from farming for owners who paid taxes to Rome to farming for Lords who collected taxes for maybe one or two rungs up the chain. Deurbanisation was real but really not for most people. 
Today 98%+ can read. Giant disruptions have swept through western civilisation and we continue to grow. The late bronze age civilisations had very constrained tool kits that were easily disrupted. The rise of iron meant great diveristy of supply away from tin, better materials and less collapses more societies that were replaced by incoming new societies. We have massively increased the diversity of our supplies of materials and constantly are substituting with technical innovations.

Chinese emissions are expected to rise to 15 billion tonnes then start to decline rapidly for the cut off date of 2050- well at least that is the agreement that the global community agreed on in Paris- other countries will have to act faster, and others will be given a bigger budget so as to economically catch up

If you think that climate sensitivity is highly likely under 2C, which is where I think the evidence is now pointing
BQEND
no one thinks it's highly likely it will be below 2c, there were two recent papers Curry/Lewis, that placed sensitivity at the low end using observations to back up the physics- when compared to much longer geological and ice core observations this is corrected and brings it to the mid range of between 2.5 - 3 C for doubling.
And then there are studies that suggest even more warming- if you are going to have an opinion why choose the lowest, why not the highest or the ones in the middle that get most frequent results from different studies? If you were a policy maker the best information is that 2.5 - 3 C is most likely, it could be less, it could be more- either way the only solution is reduce CO2 emissions.
Imagine you are building sea defences for your town- studies suggest a range of high tidal surges- at one end is 1 M, at the other extreme a couple of studies suggest it could be 10 M, but in the middle are a lot of studies that reckon on between 3-4 m. How big do you build your wall?Do you save money up front and build just a 1.1M high one, or do you blow the city cash on a 10 m high one?

Well, here are some for instances.
-- We have good evidence that temperatures will rise by 4C for every ppm doubling of CO2.
-- We are certain that the rise in temperatures since 1860 is 85% due to CO2 rises.
-- There was no Medieval Warm Period of global extent and today's warming is unprecedented in the last 5,000 years.

Part of the issue here is that, from the perspective of those who want to find disagreement, those of us defending science come off as incredibly dogmatic and stubborn. And it's true. We are being dogmatic and stubborn... at this level of the discussion where we're talking about whether our levels of emissions are likely to be harmful on current pathways. There is more than sufficient certainty and inherent risk as to dismiss the possibility of there being little or no problem.
But, quite honestly (and I'm sure you'll agree), that's just being stubborn about facts. The earth is NOT flat. It's not even somewhat round. The earth is a sphere and that's not debatable.

At last years US presidential election the majority of voters voted for the candidate with sane CO2 emissions reduction policies. Despite this overwhelming support the gerrymandered electoral college appointed the minority candidate as president.
BQENDNo, its not gerrymandered. It was set up to do what it does: to ensure that you have to have wide geographical backing and not just huge numbers of people in a few big cities. The whole point of the Constitution is to balance things. Cities versus rural. Coasts versus interior. One sort of economic interest versus another.
It actually works very well. It does not always result in a President with a popular majority getting elected, though mostly it does But it was never supposed to.

Bret Stephens does not deny the reality of climate change, but he uses a familiar strategy from the skeptical playbook: misdirection. Rather than acknowledging the role of climate change denial, he blames scientists and their allies for alleged certitude. In fact, the scientific community has taken great pains to analyze and communicate the uncertainties related to climate change.

What on Earth is ""climatism? What on Earth are ""climateers""? 
An activist is a person who campaigns for political and social change.
I'm a member of a mainstream political party and my daughter is senior in a Government formed by that political party. So I have some experience as a political activist in successful campaigning for and implementing political and social change. A brouhaha is a noisy and overexcited reaction and response to something. My experience as a political activist in bringing about political and social change has not been one of overexcited reactions but instead one of hard work and the promulgation of sane and sensible policies. Winning elections and seeing the implementation of policies are not without excitement but the elation involved is not overexcitement. You have to keep a clear head in politics as in science.
So in my experience of political activism, brouhaha is not part of the physical reality of mainstream politics. Activists in the form of ordinary people who volunteer are a vital part of the physical reality of political campaigns in democratic societies, which is a good thing.
In my state the impact on society of the activists who have volunteered their time to my political has also been for the good of that society, resulting in the restoration of democracy in 1990, the return of responsible, competent governance and economic prosperity, improved education, improved health and reductions in CO2 emissions.
My state stretches from 27 degrees to 9 degrees South, so is some distance from the poles. The temperatures experienced in the summer just gone were far from benign resulting in the usual increased death rate.
While you claim, without substantiation, that I was not talking about any relevant science here, I was talking about the science that establishes and explains the current global warming.

I don't mean that in 'hey they are just crazy' way but it is rather surreal.
If we take Bret's argument and put it into context it is rather like a patient arguing with their surgeon - the surgeon is offering outcomes, at one extreme is it will work with no complications and the other is death, and in the middle are degrees of success that range from complications to paralysis.
The medical opinion is that somewhere in the middle is the most likely outcome- and Bret is arguing that it must be the optimistic end, and to back it up his family believes it will be successful. Bret points out that the last patient was fine [although Bret doesn't ask about patients before then].
It would be a rather bizarre encounter between patient and surgeon- however Bret and his family would possibly get some comfort from minimising the risks in their minds. 
We all want absolutes, but handling and planning for risk is something we have to do on a regular basis- at the dawn of humanity the risk was to make the effort to go to some hunting ground far away which may or may not have good hunting and then there is the risk of the hunt.

Like all Journal opinion columnists who write about climate change, Stephens has said a lot of things on the subject that could charitably be described as ignorant and wrong. Thus many Times subscribers voiced bewilderment and concern about his hiring, to which the paper’s public editor issued a rather offensive response. 
Justifying the critics, here’s how the paper announced Stephens’ first opinion column in an email alert (usually reserved for important breaking news):
TOP STORIES
In his debut as a Times Op-Ed columnist, Bret Stephens says reasonable people can be skeptical about the dangers of climate change
In his column, Stephens pooh-poohed climate change as a “modest (0.85 degrees Celsius) warming of the Northern Hemisphere since 1880,” citing the 2014 IPCC report. However, Stephens packed three big mistakes into that single sentence. Here’s what the IPCC said (emphasis added):
The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] °C over the period 1880 to 2012
The northern hemisphere warms faster than the global average because it has more land and less ocean than the southern hemisphere (water warms slowly), so this is an important mistake that underestimates the global temperature rise. On top of that, since 2012 we’ve seen the three hottest years on record (2014, 2015, and 2016), so even the 0.85°C warming figure is outdated (it’s now right around 1°C). 
Most importantly, the global warming we’ve experience is in no way “modest.” We’re already causing a rate of warming faster than when the Earth transitions out of an ice age, and within a few decades we could be causing the fastest climate change Earth has seen in 50 million years. The last ice age transition saw about 4°C global warming over 10,000 years; humans are on pace to cause that much warming between 1900 and 2100 – a period of just 200 years, with most of that warming happening since 1975.
Of course, how much global warming we see in the coming decades depends on how much carbon pollution we dump into the atmosphere. If we take serious immediate action to cut those emissions, as the international community pledged to do under the Paris agreement, we can limit global warming to perhaps 2°C, and the climate consequences that come along with it.
But this is where Stephens’ opinions are particularly unhelpful:
Demanding abrupt and expensive changes in public policy raises fair questions about ideological intentions. Censoriously asserting one’s moral superiority and treating skeptics as imbeciles and deplorables wins few converts … Perhaps if there were less certitude about our climate future, more Americans would be interested in having a reasoned conversation about it.
In other words, the people obstructing climate policies are justified because climate “advocates” are too mean to them, and claim too much certainty about the future.
This is of course nonsense. There is uncertainty about how much global warming and climate change we’ll see in the coming decades (climate scientists are crystal clear about this), but the biggest factor contributing to that uncertainty is human behavior – how much carbon pollution we end up dumping into the atmosphere. This is apparent from looking at the IPCC global temperature projections:
In the red ‘burn lots of fossil fuels’ (RCP8.5) scenario, we’ll see a further 3.0–5.5°C warming between now and 2100. In the blue ‘take immediate serious climate action’ (RCP2.6) scenario, we’ll see a further 0.5–1.5°C global warming by 2100. Those ranges represent uncertainties in the climate modeling, but the difference between them – which is based on how much carbon pollution we release – is bigger than the uncertainty in each scenario.
Smoking provides an apt analogy. Each time we smoke, we increase the odds of developing cancer a little bit more. The future outcome is uncertain – we don’t know exactly if or when the disaster of cancer will hit – but we know we’re making it more likely every time we smoke, and the smart move is to mitigate that risk by cutting down on the cigarettes as quickly as possible. With climate change, each time we add more carbon pollution to the atmosphere, we increase the odds of a climate catastrophe a little bit more. The smart move is to mitigate that risk by cutting down on our burning of fossil fuels as quickly as possible. 
Stephens’ piece is akin to criticizing doctors and anti-smoking groups for being too mean to the tobacco industry, and for not focusing on the uncertainty about exactly when the chain-smoking patient will develop cancer.
So far, climate change may be humanity’s greatest-ever risk management failure. The Paris climate agreement was a major step to remedy that failure, but now the Trump administration is debating whether to withdraw from it, or simply refuse to honor America’s pledges. 
There have been bipartisan bills in Congress to implement market-based solutions to the problem, but each has been blocked by the Republican Party at the behest of its fossil fuel donors. Democrats have even proposed small government, revenue-neutral solutions that would benefit the economy, but while some Republican elder statesmen support the policy, Republicans in Congress have refused to even vote on it.
In short, on climate science and policy it’s clear where the problem lies, and it’s not with the advocates. Not only does Stephens get basic facts wrong and gloss over the tremendous risks posed by climate change, but he blames partisan policy obstruction on the people who are desperately trying every possible avenue to solve the problem. The New York Times is publishing and promoting textbook hippie punching, and its readers are rightly appalled. 
The Truth Is More Important Now Than Ever, Except If You're Reading Our Op-Ed Page pic.twitter.com/1bWM9IPM1k
A number of climate realists and scientists have canceled their subscriptions to the paper in response. It’s a difficult choice because New York Times journalists do a lot of good reporting, including on climate change. Justin Gillis is practically a national treasure. In fact many of those Times journalists themselves seem unhappy about the hire and Stephens’ first opinion piece. 
""The New York Times newsroom and the New York Times opinion section are totally separate things!"" he shouted into the void
At the same time, it’s difficult to stomach paying for a paper that uses that money to hire and promote views as uninformed and harmful as Bret Stephens’, on a subject as critically important as climate change. 
Personally, I had hoped that Stephens would simply avoid the subject, but his first piece dashed those hopes much in the way that our hopes for sensible American climate policy have been dashed time and time again by those who he defends.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/apr/29/ny-times-hired-a-hippe-puncher-to-give-climate-obstructionists-cover

Global warming is a crime against humanity | Lawrence Torcello",article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/29/climate-alarmist-global-warming-crime-humanity,0,"Most of us have wondered about the human context of past crimes against humanity: why didn’t more people intervene? How could so many pretend not to know? To be sure, crimes against humanity are not always easy to identify while they unfold.
We need some time to reflect and to analyze, even when our reasoning suggests that large-scale human suffering and death are imminent. The principled condemnation of large-scale atrocity is, too often, a luxury of hindsight.
I’m a climate alarmist because there is no morally responsible way to downplay the dangers that negligent policies – expected to accelerate human-caused climate change – pose to humankind.
There can be no greater crime against humanity than the foreseeable, and methodical, destruction of conditions that make human life possible. Hindsight isn’t necessary.
Scientists confirm, in overwhelming consensus, the fundamental facts that make anthropogenic global warming a clear and present threat to humanity and other species.
There is no amount of ideological deception capable of altering basic physics, chemistry and biology. It is ethically untenable for intelligent people to look the other way while elected officials deny reality, and our opportunity to avoid catastrophe slips away.
We know that the continued acceleration of climate change will bring more droughts, rising seas, more extreme weather, longer forest fire seasons and destructive storm surges. This in turn would lead to more water stress, crop failures, poverty, starvation, warfare and ever worsening refugee crises.
We know that the warming already achieved is expected to displace millions of people in low lying regions. Indeed, at our current rate of warming segments of the Middle East, Africa, and south Asia, will likely become uninhabitable for future generations.
This is not a problem for the distant future. People reading this right now risk dying of impacts related to climate change. Anyone who claims global warming is not catastrophic is ill informed – or playing a disingenuous game of privilege. Such a person is probably white, male, living in an affluent nation, politically conservative, and of a relatively wealthy demographic.
It is a fact that those least responsible for global warming, the global poor living in the global south, are most immediately vulnerable to climate change. This reality carries profound moral implications. Whole island nations in the southern hemisphere, such as the South Pacific’s Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Indian Ocean’s Maldives, are under threat from rising seas.
Citizens of these and other low-lying regions will be, or are already being, forced to assimilate to other lands. When indigenous populations are displaced and subjected to forced assimilation by outsiders exploiting resources for their own profit it constitutes a form of cultural genocide – and history teaches that the large-scale displacement of cultural groups can raise the risk of physical genocide.
Consequently, if any nation were to enact policies calculated to systematically destroy cultural lands and displace native people, as climate change will, it would rightly raise international debates over genocide. It makes no difference to populations forced off their homelands whether the resource exploitation responsible is occurring in West Virginia or Papua New Guinea.
The moral, and existential, implications of human-caused climate change should by now have triggered full-scale, second world war style effort to end fossil fuel dependence and associated greenhouse gas emissions.
The global community ought to have engaged in a renewable energy “arms race” years ago. Instead, we burn away time while fossil fuel interests fund negligent campaigns of disinformation and politicians stage fake debates over the science of climate change.
Despite efforts to poison public discourse the world agreed to a plan, in 2015, which might give humanity a fighting chance to avoid catastrophic climate change.
To undo this progress now, while time is running out and physics is managing the clock, is to risk sentencing countless people to death via extreme weather, depleted resources, and associated political instability. We know the human consequences of our policies and the casual acceptance of those consequences incriminate us morally.
Pulling out of the Paris accord is not the only way that Trump’s administration can undermine our attempts to address climate change: the United States can simply make it clear that it won’t honor its political and ethical obligations under the Paris agreement. 
It is hard to imagine a clearer way to signal that message than proposing to cut research funding for climate science, gutting the climate change programs of the EPA, NASA, and NOAA, halting payments to the United Nations related to climate change, backing construction of the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, and issuing an executive order undoing the United States’ clean power plan, which restricts greenhouse gas emissions at coal fired-plants.
The climate policies of the Trump administration, backed by many Republican leaders, are rooted in culpable ignorance and transparent corruption. And they place us all at risk on a scale that previous crimes against humanity never have.
Civility and fair mindedness do not require hospitality to policies that hasten the destruction of a livable planet. We don’t depend on hindsight to recognize the moral gravity of our current situation.
We will search in vain for a better reason to depose elected officials. Every legal resource to remove such leaders is justified. We can’t pretend we don’t know the nature of what is unfolding. We are witnessing a crime against humanity – and the potential prelude to future genocide.
We are the bystanders who must choose to intervene or be defined by our failure.

Organizers said about 300 sister marches or rallies were being held around the country, including in Seattle, Boston and San Francisco. In Chicago, marchers headed from the city’s federal plaza to Trump Tower. In Denver, marchers were met with a dose of spring snow.
Some of the marches drew celebrity attendees, including former vice-president Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio in the capital and senator and former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Bernie Sanders at an event in Montpelier, Vermont.
“Honored to join Indigenous leaders and native peoples as they fight for climate justice,” DiCaprio tweeted. 
Any marchers who used their phones to look at the EPA climate change website would have been greeted with a message from the new administration: “This page is being updated.”
“As EPA renews its commitment to human health and clean air, land and water, our website needs to reflect the views of the leadership of the agency,” said JP Freire, an associate administrator for public affairs. 
Previously, the website housed data on greenhouse gas emissions from large polluters and reports on the effects of climate change and its impact on human health. 
“We want to eliminate confusion,” Freire said, “by removing outdated language first and making room to discuss how we’re protecting the environment and human health by partnering with states and working within the law.”
Information from previous administrations is archived as a link from the EPA’s website. 
The EPA is currently led by Scott Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general who has denied that carbon dioxide causes global warming.
The Trump administration has called for budget cuts of nearly one-third at the EPA and has sought to weaken protections for human health. For instance, the White House has proposed cutting funding and regulations regarding lead poisoning prevention and is considering rewriting regulations concerning smog.
It has already rolled back a law that prevented coalmining companies from dumping waste in streams.
In an op-ed piece for the Guardian published on Saturday, Sanders made an economic case for a focus on industries meant to ameliorate the effects of climate change, rather than those which contribute to it.
The senator from Vermont wrote: “No matter what agenda President Trump and his administration of climate deniers push, it is clear that jobs in clean energy like wind and solar are growing much more rapidly than jobs in the coal, oil and gas sectors.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/29/epa-trump-website-climate-change-peoples-climate-march

Colin may be almost technically correct but I'll bet you he's deliberately spreading the hoary old half-truth.

Any observation that holds to the view that something is crap, when droves of serious academics have committed time and energy to it seems to imply that one has no capability for asking serious questions or holding investigations that run contrary to one's own predispositions as worthy of examination. I am not a post-modernist, but there are serious issues raised by such people that don't occur in the taken for granted assumptions of other investigators.
I do find it rather comforting that some elements of post modern thought, especially Foucault, have more in common with advanced quantum physics that any other theorising. If you really believe that language/meaning has no bearing on scientific bias, then I suggest an investigation into Bohr's work. When awarded the Nobel Prize for physics, Bohr opted for a coat of arms in which the Chinese Ying/Yang symbol featured prominently. Why? Because for twenty years physicists had struggled to make sense and meaning of their experiments; the breakthrough came when it was realised that a Western noun based language would not provide an adequate tool to do the job!
Similarly, when DNA was supposedly discovered, it was little reported that Crick argued that it could not have been produced by evolution! Whatever knowledge is produced (and Crick is a good example of it not following the traditional scientific process) there is always an element of cherry picking in terms of what is selected for public consumption and what is disregarded.
Are we really saying that Tesla was frozen out of the scientific fraternity because his work was fundamentally flawed? Of course not - he advocated 'free energy,' which ran contrary to the whole structure of the society in which he was working at the time. (Yes, I know he had technical problems, but that's hardly the point).
I reiterate, science (not methods of collecting evidence) is a form of knowledge that cannot meet its own claims to be 'value free.' As with any other form of human endeavour, it occupies a space that it has carved out for itself, in competition with other forms of knowledge.

This is delusional thinking and indeed technically incorrect. There is no evidence that technology will save human civilisation, just blind hope in more of the same solving our very significant problems. I very much enjoy a more personal observation of ecology and gender and agree that there are parrells between the treatment of the planet and woman. Even Thomas Hardy, a Victorian, understood this and used the notion symbolically in ' Tess'. A failure to intergrate wisdom into our affairs will exacerbate ecological collapse and social dystopia

Suddenly, green shoots and the hint of daffodil yellow start breaking through the muddy earth. Birds sing. The air is sweet. It’s a time of renewal – one that is so desperately needed for our planet and our politics.
The Earth, our mother, is the body that feeds us, nurtures us, inspires us. In more than three months, Trump and his government have begun a process to remove as many protections for the Earth and for women as they can. They are willing to destroy the Earth and, ultimately, threaten the people she feeds and gives life to, in order to take care of their immediate desires. The long-term consequences are irrelevant in their minds. 
Many of the terms for climate destruction and violence against women are interchangeable: extraction, rape, plunder, plowing, battery and excavation. But the similarities don’t end there. Many of those who don’t believe in climate change are very often the same as those who do not trust the stories and reports of women who have been harassed, battered and raped. 
Even when more than 97% of climate scientists warn us of the same thing we don’t believe them. More than 10 women have come forward to accuse Donald Trump of sexual assault – allegations he has denied – and we don’t believe them. It took 58 women coming forward for the stories about Bill Cosby to be believed. And there are still some who deny it. There are parallels between the high stakes scientists face in telling the truth and the potential ruin women face in coming forward to report their stories to families and courts. 
Or perhaps it is not and never was about believing scientists and women. No, it is clear that land exploiters and rapists actually do know what they are doing. Often they are strategic about it. One only has to read the early Exxon reports on what extraction would do to climate change or listen to the Access Hollywood tape with Donald Trump to hear their swagger and pride in being able to do what they do because they have the power.  
Whether it is pulling back EPA regulations and railing against the Clean Air Act or the mad dash for money through extraction and pipelines such as the Dakota Access pipeline. Whether it’s defunding Planned Parenthood or cutting funding to violence against women programs or reinstating and expanding the global gag rule so that healthcare for women across the world is devastated. All in the name of preventing abortion and being pro-life when their actions and policies are murderous and destructive in every direction. 
For years I have been fighting rape, battery, incest, female genital mutilation and sex trafficking. The staggering numbers of one out of three women raped and beaten on the planet have occupied my life from morning till night. But the story is even bigger, the mindset more pervasive. We can’t separate out the pieces of the story.  
Humanity is struggling to determine whether we will accept living and dying in a world where 0.1% of the people reign over our Earth, our bodies, our rights in service of their own interests and profit or whether we collectively rise and fight to transform this predatory paradigm. 
But this morning as I awoke to the softness and generosity of spring, it was so clear and simple. Every struggle we have – women’s liberation, racial justice, economic inequality, immigration rights, gender rights, disability rights – happens on the Earth, because of the Earth.  
So that’s why I am rising on 29 April with the climate march. Let our passion and fight for our mother be the energy and trajectory that fuels us and binds us to a larger struggle to end and transform this deadly and exploitative mindset. 
Let our fight for the mother bring forth a global spring. Now more than ever we need a renewal in our dedication to a world where women, and indeed, all of life, triumph over destruction and the forces of anti-life.

Switching from one type of technology to another does not have the same consequences as allowing a hyperthermal event to develop.

A human-induced hothouse climate?
David L. Kidder, Thomas R. WorsleyDept. of Geological Sciences, Ohio University 2011
Here's a key quote from the Conclusions:
BQSTART
The likely cool greenhouse in which about half of Antarctica is still ice-covered means devastation from the tens of meters sea level is likely to rise (e.g., Ward, 2010), and poleward shifting of warm climate belts.
BQEND
So the appropriate term for what's likely to happen is a 'cool greenhouse', which sounds harmless, but is not.It's a very interesting paper, and we need to remember that nothing like this has happened in the time of modern humans.
How quickly?
BQSTART
a cool greenhouse seems imminent within perhaps a century or two.

Global temperatures are dropping again, and solar activity is decreasing as we come to the end of cycle 24, and as they did in 2008. Not enough to off-set underlying warming, and the solar cycle may not be the cause (PMO is also a big factor).

Less History-channel (duh) - more facts. But even a deeper wish for more ""why"". 
A problem of science journalism is that the headline usually is ""new research finds""...
The point with science is that it is old. So the headline should be ""theory of absorption, applied with radiation theory, combined with decades of data, 100 years of development of fluid dynamics, invention of computers with increasing ability to solve turbulent equations and new measurements show that (insert conclusion). And then some details found in the appendix should be shared. 
The way media present science as ""new "" is that is becomes atomised from the article ""new"" the day before. All these ""new"" atoms of insight are in fact both evolving from a common set of ideas. 
One can of course not write the history of science before introducing every new paper that comes out. But it is possible to frame it like this: 
BQSTART
For years, science has pondered the relationship between X and Y. This relationship has impact on how Z is transferred. This problem were first identified in ( for example) 1952, and has up until now been constrained by the use of ( for example) indirect approximations. This new study overcome the old approximations by using a new method ( or mathematics or physics or whatever) to reduce the uncertainty given by the previous approach. 
The results from this study increase the understanding of X, Y and how Z, being the basis of how larger/smaller (some dynamical) expressions integrate across (some result) 
BQEND
As scientists we know this fact so well that we forget to mention it. Even science journalists with science background forget this context - and the young journalists who cover the topic - they are bitten off fast - because science is so used to those using the tactics of ""just asking questions"" just to delay a conclusion. 
What is needed is journalists who know the subject so well that they know what questions must be asked to clarify what is learnt. 
Help science to be spread as context. Most scientific papers give that context in extremely condensed form, when we use a few words and references in the introduction. Even when ""new"" science has the oldest reference going back to 2007 - it is just a way to point back to history - pointing back to science in 1983, those papers referring to papers going back to the 1950's....etc. 
When writing for Nature/Science one has at best 3000 words to share the full-time work of maybe 10 human-years full-time. It is extremely condensed. And to understand these papers requires an understanding of the history of the subject. 
The best science journalism were written last year. Drawing the line from Einstein's general relativity to gravitational waves being discovered over a century. Good science journalism were made when the Higgs were discovered, showing the babysteps taken between ""idea"" and ""documentation"". 
Journalism should not underestimate that the narrative of history actually work with science and the headline ""new paper finds..."" . New findings in genetics can be placed in context of even Darwin and the documentation of the double helix and....all the interesting baby-steps every student of a subject discovers. 
Remember ""new study finds something new about climate"" - the history of that science also has a history of a couple of centuries. The science it is based surprisingly often in the 19th century - so it can clearly not be ""political"". 
Every ""new study"" that does not have a title beginning with ""Falsification of..."" are in fact worthy of a rather boring news-story:

We homo sapiens are extremely special creatures. We're truly amazing. So are the other species who have become extinct over the millenia. All were extremely special, and finely tuned by evolution to survive. They all had their amazing adaptive strengths which made them evolve to fit their environment in the first place. And all are now no more.
If you think comparing human survival to that of the humble trilobite in the sea is stretching is, then think of our homo cousins - neanderthals, homo erectus, and maybe homo habilis though not everyone agrees that really consists of a species.
These are all gone. They had tools, speech apparently (voiceboxes), and lived through epic climate change episodes, but with the neanderthals surviving into the current age. They are all gone now.
Homo sapiens has no essential skill, once society and industry is gone, that makes it inherently better suited to avoid extinction.
If, of course, the current human industrial complex can be kept going ad infinitum, then there is a good argument humanity could survive at least until the next mass extinction event.
That's a big ""if"": we're living on the edge of the possible extinction of the ever so fragile human industrial era. And once that protection is gone, going back to stone tools and primitive farming methods does not rule out our extinction, any more than our hominin cousins managed to avoid extinction.

The crucial element in this process of climatic change can be seen in the surface sea ice as well as the increase in ice bergs broken off of outlet glaciers. One of the key elements in this process is the mixing of warmer waters which are reaching ever further north into the Arctic seas. 
Scientific American brought out a review of a paper discussing this process recently. Here is an excerpt from the article:
“Rapid changes in the eastern Arctic Ocean, which allow more heat from the ocean interior to reach the bottom of sea ice, are making it more sensitive to climate changes,” Polyakov said. “This is a big step toward the Arctic with seasonal sea-ice cover.”
Seasonal ice is unstable and the Arctic system is showing signs of this transition from pack ice, which remains for decades until it drifts far enough south, and an Arctic covered with rotten ice and ice floes. Much of the ice in the Arctic today is drift ice that thaws and refreezes according to season. This is what makes sea-ice extent a deceptive scale for judging the mass of ice on the Arctic waters. 
There is no need to wait for an ""ice-free"" Arctic. An Arctic subject to seasonal thaws and freezes is already here.', u'recommendation_count': u'6', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1492683359000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'3684556', u'id': u'96929514', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'rockyrex', u'text': u'Global warming it's a 'line'.

The iceberg, which has dwarfed the nearby small town of Ferryland, is estimated to measure some 46 metres (150ft) at its highest point. “It’s the biggest one I ever seen around here,” mayor Adrian Kavanagh told the Canadian Press. “It’s a huge iceberg and it’s in so close that people can get a good photograph of it.” 
The light blue behemoth has become a tourist attraction in recent days, as locals from across Newfoundland sit in bumper-to-bumper traffic for a chance to snap photos of the glacial giant. Their shots have flooded social media, showing the massive structure looming over local homes and sitting large compared to a helicopter hovering over it. 
Icebergs are no strangers to these parts – a large number drift through from the Arctic each year, earning the area the moniker “iceberg alley” and giving rise to a local industry focused on iceberg tourism. 
“You can see off in the distance on a clear day, you can see five or six big ’bergs,” said Kavanagh. Most of them simply float past the town, but this latest visitor appears to be grounded and could remain in place, he added. 
So far this year the number of icebergs moving into the North Atlantic shipping lanes has spiked, forcing vessels to either slow down or make long detours. Some 616 icebergs have moved into the shipping lanes so far this year, as compared to 687 in all of 2016. 
Experts say uncommonly strong counterclockwise winds may be drawing the icebergs south. Global warming has also been linked to the increase, as it has accelerated the process by which chunks of the Greenland ice sheet break off and float away.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/19/ferryland-iceberg-newfoundland-canada

But it isn't all good news. The Environmental Protection Agency has charted glacial loss since the 1940s, and that shows a steady decline. Key glaciers that have existed for millennia are collapsing, according to the National Resources Defense Council, and if the current pace of retreat continues, Glacier National Park in Montana will be glacier-free by 2070.

While a frost fair on the Thames is probably now a most unlikely occurrence, the scientists point out that the fairs stopped in the first place not because the weather got warmer but because London Bridge was replaced in 1825.

But in exoplanet research, if I see an unusual planetary system I am more likely to adjust the prevailing theories of planet formation to accommodate the anomalous results.
Climate science is mid-way between those extremes. The big picture is as solid as the laws of thermodynamics, while the detailed nuances are barely understood at all. To the extent that evidence for the LIA seems to contradict the big picture, the discrepancy is almost certainly due to faulty evidence. Likewise, the so-called ""pause"" last decade was pretty clearly related to a problem of then-unaccounted for energy dispersal (later resolved with more and better evidence).
There is a small possibility that the evidence for the LIA could be indicative of some deep confusion about the big picture, which provides the motivation for clarifying historical global surface temperature record.

It's true that all reconstructions show generally cold conditions between ad 1580 and 1880 in western Europe - punctuated in some regions by warm decades during the eighteenth century. The transition to these colder conditions occurred earlier in the Arctic and western Europe than in North America or the Southern Hemisphere regions. The Earth's average global temperature continued it's very slow cooling from the Holocene Climatic Optimum some 7000 years ago. This was known at least 4 years ago as this study shows.

Agreed. We have some data about floods and even avalanches back then, because f.x. rivers crossing it's banks leave tell-tail thin horizons of sand and silt where it should not be. Snow avalanches can bring small pebbles onto lake and lake-ice. So by coring such lakes one can look at the evidence left behind long ago. So weather events can be resonstructed. 
Climate is easier. Or rather - there are more data that shed light on it. 
Tree-rings, moraines from glaciers, altitude of former tree-lines, composition of pollen or even insects , climate dependent chemical fractionation in everything from inorganic to organic carbonates, the growth rate of fossil shells - the list is long and amazing. Using magnetic properties in desert-dunes one even look at changes in mean wind-speed and direction. In old ice one can use some pretty amazing counting of atoms, looking at ratios of different isotopes. There are whole groups who does not only count tiny diatoms and foraminifera under microscopes, they also sample them and analyse the heck out of the tiny samples accelerating their atoms up to high speeds. 
All these things record climate better than memory of humans in modern times (unless they are equipped with good thermometers and note-books). 
Over the last decades there is a pretty comprehensive and detailed picture of natural climate variations being developed. Groups have measured ground-water tablets raising and falling in Africa, studied changes in where the precipitation entering the middle east, Tibet and Greenland came from. Tracked how the Gulf-stream speed has changed. There is a lot of information out there. 
The quality of this information is now good enough to accurately produce climate maps covering the Northern Hemisphere well at sub-century time-scales - global patterns a bit coarser. 
The last couple of decades, even seasonal variations are possible to tease out. It is possible to do even if the original sampling does not resolve monthly changes. 
Not to pretend it is easy - as one needs to understand the dynamics of the proxy and backtrack the dynamics of the climate system. It is a bit like being a forensic detective - one start with evidence and then deduce cause. There are a couple of hundreds of years of know-how involved involving all known sciences. 
Take the above article, for example. It was being evident that LIA and MWP was not global 30 years ago. Based on both dynamical and empirical lines of evidence. That the little ice-age was out of sync dependent on location in a little place like Europe was known 50 years ago. 
It is fair to say that IPCC is to be partly blamed for some of this confusion by presenting a curve of the last 1000 years of temperature in 1990 with way too little explanation to where it came from (being an illustration of relative temperature changes in the UK based on work of Lamb). When paleoclimate started to be a part of IPCC - then also came the first hemispheric reconstructions (what became known as the Hockey-stick) and the regional North Atlantic Medieval bump ""washed out"". 
What can not be blamed on IPCC is that professional deniers since have milked this wide-spread misunderstanding for the last 20 years. It is a lakmustest - if anyone who has insight has ever used that argument, one know they are up to no good. If they were up to anything good they would obviously and helpfully explain that the first version was an illustration based on data from the British Isles. 
Here is a brief pop-sci walk-through by Bo Vinther

These uncertainties have given American sceptics opportunities to claim that global warming is nothing more than a natural variation in the climate.
However, new research by the Royal Astronomical Society shows that the period between the 16th and 19th centuries may have had cold winters but it also suffered scorching summers, so it was not an ice age at all.
At most the average temperature during this period was half a degree centigrade lower across the Northern Hemisphere, whereas during actual ice ages it was down 8C. Close examination of the data also reveals that not all the winters were cold, so the natural variability of the climate continued throughout the period.
The causes of the slight cooling were a combination of lower solar activity, volcanic eruptions and manmade changes to the landscape. Solar activity is again on the wane now, but this will not save us from rises in temperature. Greenhouse gases that have been pumped into the atmosphere in the last 160 years have already pushed the temperature up by 1C and it will continue to rise.
While a frost fair on the Thames is probably now a most unlikely occurrence, the scientists point out that the fairs stopped in the first place not because the weather got warmer but because London Bridge was replaced in 1825. Until then the low arches and large supports trapped ice as it flowed down the river – allowing the river to freeze over upstream.

BQEND
Last week I presented a perfectly correct calculation and simplified but relevant modelling of how reflectors and the proposed geoengineering scheme would work.

BQSTART
today you are banging on and on about economic models (the from RCPs are economic models),
BQEND
The RCPs are scenarios that lead to a given radiative forcing. 
Again all you have done is prove my original point that you don't like the idea of their being a range of values. 
I am not forecasting what the ppm CO2 will be, nor are the RCPs. There are people actively trying to keep the ppm CO2 as low a possible.
But to estimate the possible outcomes of if we don't act includes a range of possible outcomes. Hence why there is more than one RCP presented.
Clearly economics is a factor to future emissions, how do you think that it would be realistic to estimate what the ppm CO2 *could* be in 2100 without including factors which are currently known to influence emissions?
If a politician or even a scientist were just to simply promise that the CO2 in 2100 would be 500ppm CO2 unless they have a model to back it up would be meaningless.
BQSTART
I will bet you will be howling against economic models in a week or two. 
BQEND
You have not shown any evidence of you having done advanced optics, thermodynamics or computer modelling.
You are simply attacking anything that disagrees with you rigid belief that only a very narrow set of values is possible.
You dismiss the upper end of the ECS estimates. You have complained about referring to expert estimates of the Earth System Sensitivity. You are now complaining about the RCPs and people using central estimates of CO2 forecasts. 
You object to calculations and are hence seeming to think that to support or object to a specific model or research paper is to reject it all. Again I return to the concept of a range of opinions.
You are in fact taking an extreme position by only accepting such a narrow band of the projections included in the literature and supported by calculations.

""Is all this alarmist? Sure."" 
To be alarmist means to exaggerate a danger and by so doing cause needless worry or panic. In this case the danger is real and not exaggerated, so the worry is far from needless. It's alarming not alarmist.
BQEND
The whole use of ""alarmism"" with regard to climate change is seriously problematical. If anyone isn't alarmed by climate change then self-evidently they are completely ignorant of climate change and it's almost certain impacts.
As you say, the connotation with alarmism is the exaggeration of danger. However, we need to challenge the very use of the term alarmism with regard to supposed exaggeration. Why invent the term ""alarmism"" when there is already a very clear and well understood term to describe this accusation, and that is ""exaggeration"". After all what is being alleged with the use of term ""exaggeration"" is very clear. It is then possible to address this claim.
Whereas the use of the term ""alarmism"" as a pejorative is very sly and sneaky. In my experience most vocal climate change deniers are dishonest, disingenuous, slippery and engage in blatant sophistry. Therefore if you tackle them for their use of alarmism, and pin them down, they will disingenuously claim that ""alarmism"" just means raising the alarm about something and it is not a pejorative term. 
The thinking of climate change deniers can easily be seen with their vehement objection to the term ""denier"". They claim it is defamatory, because of it's association with holocaust denial. Of course most people accusing them of denial and not trying to smear them by associating them with holocaust denial, they are simply saying they are in denial of the evidence. The reason climate change deniers are so aware of smearing, is because it is what they do. They deliberately use and invent terms like alarmism to smear those raising concerns about climate change.
Most of those concerned about climate change and who see the need to address it are moral people who are not interested in smearing climate change deniers. Smearing is a one way thing when it comes to arguments over climate change. Those concerned about climate change simply want the problem to be acknowledged and addressed. They are not interested in smearing climate change deniers. They know climate change denial is false argument, a false belief, and that they evidence supports seeing climate change as a very serious threat, that we must address as urgently as possible.
Okay, I can't speak for everyone concerned about climate change, but I just see climate change deniers as an obstacle, a nuisance. I don't take their arguments at all seriously because self-evidently they have no idea what they are talking about, and are mistaken at the very least. Smearing those using plainly false arguments is not necessary when they discredit themselves every time they try to deny climate change, or the threat climate change poses. They are essentially saying I'm an ignorant fool, every time they say something.

As I've tried to explain before, trying to differentiate between El Nino events and climate change impacts is word play. As climate change and global warming is warming the oceans, and these ocean oscillations and circulations involve warm and cold water, the idea that somehow El Nino is entirely separate from ocean warming due to global warming is nonsense. A generally warming ocean will self-evidently influence El Nino events themselves. The question is in what way.

http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n2/full/nclimate2100.html
What I'm saying in simple terms is that ocean warming due to an increased greenhouse effect/radiative forcing i.e. anthropogenic warming and climate change caused by anthropogenic carbon emissions, and El Nino events are obviously coupled. To what extent this relationship can be teased out, described and modelled I'm not sure, as it will be very complex.
Environmentalists are often criticised for attributing extreme weather events to climate change because extreme weather events have always occurred. It will be claimed that it is impossible to prove the contribution of climate change. However, conversely, claiming that extreme weather events are not influenced by climate change is plainly nonsensical considering the the Earth's weather is essentially driven by the warming of the atmosphere, the warming of the Earth's surface and the warming of the oceans due so solar radiation, and the amount of heat trapped in the system due to radiative forcing.
To conclude, claiming that these events are not connected to climate change warming is an exercise in dishonest word play. To understand these phenomena it is necessary to divide them all up into different categories, to give them separate and individual names. But this is purely necessary because of the category based nature of language logic it's necessary so we can speak about these processes and describe them, with language. It gives the false impression that these are separate entities, when actually the terms, the labels are for one whole highly interconnected system. It is impossible for one part of the system to change or be effected, and it not influence other parts of the system. It is a classic mistaking the map for the territory logical fallacy, to attribute weather to El Nino events and not climate change, to attribute coral bleaching to El Nino and not climate change. The map is not the territory i.e. the idea or the words are not the phenomena being described. These apparent differences, and the apparent existence of different entities, are created by language and language logic. The phenomena this language refers to, and the ideas behind them are not all separate as the language and categories imply.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation
Trying to claim that is an effect of El Nino, not climate change/warming, that is a natural weather event not due to climate change, the climate has always changed, are meaningless word games, based on the category nature of language logic.

In general, speciation doesn't work like that. Each generation is capable of breeding with its parents' generation. It is only the accumulated differences that make breeding impossible (its actually an open question (i think) whether humans could potentially breed with chimps for instance.. no one's tested it)... For instance, if all your ancestors back to your common ancestor with your cat were alive, and standing in a line, and so were all the ancestors of your cat back to the same common ancestor. There would be no point where one generation along either line could not breed with the one next to it (or the one 50 generations back)... As you went along the line towards the common ancestor you'd eventually meet one with whom you could breed, but the babies would be infertile. Further back still, and you'd come to one with whom you couldn't breed at all. For evidence of yourself having a common ancestor with your cat, the best data are fossils, morphology, embryology and genetics. 
The 'biological species concept' (reproductive isolation) works for only a limited group of species (as i noted earlier, not only, or all, animals) for instance (looking from the other direction) some species of animals are asexual (e.g., many insects, some amphibians, and others)... Under the reproductive isolation definition each individual of (requisite) asexual species has to be considered as a separate species, which gets a bit messy. Species, like most things in biology are not clearly delineated from each other, but rather there is a continuum. 
If you're interested in evolutionary theory (which you seem to be) I'd recommend the website below. There are also some very good books... Your Inner Fish is a good short one as are most of Richard Dawkins' books (try The Ancestors Tale).

Smearing those using plainly false arguments is not necessary when they discredit themselves every time they try to deny climate change, or the threat climate change poses. They are essentially saying I'm an ignorant fool, every time they say something.
BQEND
The problem comes though in that while it might be obvious false arguments to anyone informed that they can gain sway either over people who are ignorant or who want to be deceived.
There are situations that if we are to get the action taken that you do need to often robustly discredit your opponent to avoid false balance or them smearing you so much that your message is lost.
While I would not call this smearing but more asserting expertise, for people trying to stop the debate happening they then try the victimhood card.
The term ""alarmism"" is an example of a carefully constructed term to try to strengthen ties of deniers as a group and to equate this group to another group. It is yet another example of the soft peddle debate trying to control the subject of the argument. 
The problem is that it is easier to keep people ill-informed than to make them well-informed.

For all the sound and fury of climate change denialists, self-deluding politicians and a very bewildered global public, the science behind climate change is rock solid while the impacts – observed on every ecosystem on the planet – are occurring faster in many parts of the world than even the most gloomy scientists predicted. 
Given all this, it’s logical to assume life on Earth – the millions of species that cohabitate our little ball of rock in space – would be impacted. But it still feels unnerving to discover that this is no longer about just polar bears; it’s not only coral reefs and sea turtles or pikas and penguins; it about practically everything – including us. 
Three recent studies have illustrated just how widespread climate change’s effect on life on our planet has already become. 
There has been a massive under-reporting of these impacts.
“It is reasonable to suggest that most species on Earth have been impacted by climate change in some way or another,” said Bret Scheffers with the University of Florida. “Some species are negatively impacted and some species positively impacted.” 
Scheffers is the lead author of a landmark Science study from last year that found that current warming (just one degree Celisus) has already left a discernible mark on 77 of 94 different ecological processes, including species’ genetics, seasonal responses, overall distribution, and even morphology – i.e. physical traits including body size and shape. 
Woodland salamanders are shrinking in the Appalachian Mountains; the long-billed, Arctic-breeding red knot is producing smaller young with less impressive bills leading to survival difficulties. Marmots and martens in the Americas are getting bigger off of longer growing seasons produce more foodstuffs, while the alpine chipmunks of Yellowstone National Park have actually seen the shape of their skulls change due to climate pressure. 
Life is proving just as strange under our new climate regime when it comes to genetics. Pink salmon genetics are evolving for earlier migrations – with fewer salmon encoding their genes for earlier migrations. In making its way north, the southern flying squirrel has begun hybridising with the northern flying squirrel. The water flea has seen its genetics change over just a few decades to respond to higher water temperatures. 
But the fact that so many species are undergoing genetic changes doesn’t mean they are successfully adapting to our warmer world. 
“In many instances genetic diversity is being lost due to climate change, not just in nature but also in resources that human’s depend on such as crops and timber,” Scheffers said. “It is important to not confuse species responses and adaptation as an indicator that everything will be okay.”
Scheffers and his colleagues’ findings are furthered by a study in Nature Climate Change this February that found that 47 percent of land mammals and 23 percent of birds have already suffered negative impacts form climate change. In all, nearly 700 species in just these two groups are flagging under climate change, according to this research. 
We now have evidence that entire ecosystems, some the size of entire states within the USA, are changing.
“There has been a massive under-reporting of these impacts,” co-author James Watson with the University of Queensland said in a press release, pointing out that the IUCN Red List only considers seven percent of mammals and four percent of birds as threatened by climate change and severe weather. The IUCN often drags behind the latest science – many species wait decades for an update while most species on Earth have never been evaluated. 
In worst-case scenarios, species are simply vanishing. 
A third study – this one in PLOS Biology – found that more than 450 plants and animals have undergone local extinctions due to climate change. Local extinction, as its name implies, doesn’t mean the species are gone for good, but that they vanish from a portion of their range. For example, the barren ground shrew has seen its range constrict aggressively as its tundra home warms. 
“If global warming continues, species that cannot change or move quickly enough may go globally extinct,” the study’s author, John Wiens with the University of Arizona, said. 
Such global extinctions have already happened. Last year, scientists discovered that the Bramble Cay melomys – an Australian rat-like rodent – went extinct recently (it was last seen in 2007) due to rising seas inundating its tiny coral island. 
It’s the first mammal confirmed to be pushed to extinction entirely due to climate change – or one could say our fossil fuel addiction.
Wiens’ study also found that local extinctions were happening more in the tropics than in temperate areas. This is worrying since the tropics hold the vast bulk of the world’s biodiversity, with many tropic species still unstudied and even undiscovered by scientists. 
But changes are rippling even beyond single extinctions.
“We now have evidence that entire ecosystems, some the size of entire states within the USA, are changing in response to climate change,” said Scheffers. He pointed to kelp forests that he said “are dying” and being replaced by rocky, less-productive ecosystems. 
Made up of giant brown algae, kelp as tall as trees provide essential nurseries for fish, protect coastlines against worsening storm surges, store vast amounts of carbon, and provide homes for species like sea otters. But warming waters combined with ocean acidification is taking its toll. 
And Scheffers expects more “ecosystem shifts,” as scientists describe them, in the future. Cloud forests are at risk of becoming high altitude grasslands, coral reefs of becoming algal-dominated ecosystems, and Arctic sea ice – open ocean. 
“Given what we are seeing now, just imagine what will happen to all these species when temperatures increase by four of five times that amount,” said Wiens. 
If global society doesn’t kick its fossil fuel addiction – and quick – scientists estimate that temperatures could rise 4-5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Such a rise would be not so much catastrophic, but apocalyptic. 
“One thing that is certain is that this global response to climate change points to an increasingly unpredictable future for humans,” Scheffers said. 
More than half of the world’s humans today live in cities – but that won’t make any of us immune to the changes going on in nature. According to Scheffer’s research, humans will see a drop in productivity of various crops or timber species, a drastic loss in marine fisheries, a potential rise in new diseases as well as disease spreading to places they’d never been before. Meanwhile, declines in coral reefs, kelp forests and mangroves could lead to more lives lost in climate-fueled storms. Loss of global biodiversity will also have knock-on effects in societies around the world, from less productive ecosystems to impacts we simply can’t predict today. 
“I was not surprised,” Scheffers said of his research. “But I was alarmed. The extent of impacts is vast and has impacted every ecosystem on the Earth.”
Is all this alarmist? Sure. But it’s high time we set off the alarms – they should have started ringing in the 1980s and been deafening by the early 1990s. 
Does all this imply nothing can be done? Of course not. 
“Governments and large organisation can invest and commit to reducing carbon emissions and protecting natural ecosystems that increase resilience to climate change not only for nature but for people as well,” Scheffers said. “These include large areas of connected forests which cool local and regional climate, pristine coral and oyster reefs that not only provide food but reduce storm surges, and well managed watersheds that will maintain adequate fresh water.”
Wiens agreed, but added that “there also needs to be more, bolder, large-scale efforts to reduce the carbon that is already in the atmosphere.”
A number of companies have already produced technologies that do just that: they pull carbon out of the atmosphere. But to date, lack of money and support have delayed rolling out such devices en masse. 
Meanwhile, the researchers agree that the Paris Agreement – the only global agreement to tackle climate change – must be protected. 
“Wisdom comes from combining truth with beliefs. There is a global scientific consensus around climate change and its impacts on nature and humans. It is truth that climate change will have devastating impacts on human health and quality of life,” Scheffers said, noting that the Trump Administration’s current flirtation with pulling out of the Paris Agreement “is not only an unwise decision but a dangerous decision.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2017/apr/05/climate-change-life-wildlife-animals-biodiversity-ecosystems-genetics

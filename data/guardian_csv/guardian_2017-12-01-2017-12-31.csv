When family planning funding was further reduced in April and May, concern intensified about the potential impact on maternal mortality and young people’s access to sexual and reproductive health information. Other donor countries responded with the She Decides initiative, led by Dutch minister Lilianne Ploumen, which set out to raise $600m (£450m) to compensate for the shortfall created by the Trump administration.
Setting the tone for a year when elections brought big changes in governance, Adama Barrow ended Yahya Jammeh’s 22-year rule in the Gambia. Jammeh, whose exit terms meant he avoided prosecution and was able to keep many assets, departed only after mediation by west African neighbours and the threat of armed intervention.
Data compiled by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development showed that six European countries – the UK, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Sweden – hit the 0.7% UN aid spending target.
Save the Children urged the British government to increase pressure on Saudi Arabia to protect children in Yemen from ongoing violations. With no improvement in humanitarian access, author Alex de Waal warned later in the year that Britain was in danger of becoming complicit in the use of starvation as a weapon of war in the country.
In a report published to coincide with the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Oxfam said it was “beyond grotesque” that a handful of rich men are worth $426bn, equivalent to the wealth of 3.6 billion people.
Three UN agencies warned that Somalia was facing a “very real” risk of famine, with more than 6 million people – half the population – facing acute food insecurity. Humanitarian groups said there was a “small window” to stop a repeat of the 2011 famine, when an estimated 260,000 people starved to death in the country after a slow response from donors.
EU commissioner Neven Mimica pledged a €225m (£200m) support package for the Gambia, which he said was “virtually bankrupt”. Following in his footsteps, Boris Johnson became the first British foreign secretary to visit the country. 
While Chad’s foreign minister, Moussa Faki Mahamat, was elected as the new head of the African Union, outgoing chief Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma condemned the proposed US travel ban on refugees from Somalia, Libya and Sudan. Morocco rejoined the AU after a row over the status of Western Sahara more than 30 years ago. 
Tributes poured in for Hans Rosling, the data guru and development champion, who died aged 68.

Famine was formally declared in parts of South Sudan, and stretched aid agencies warned it was immininent in Somalia, Nigeria and Yemen. David Miliband and Toby Lanzer argued that the global humanitarian system was under “unprecedented strain”.
Agencies warned that “countless lives” were at stake as they launched a major appeal for east Africa to help those facing hunger. Drought and conflict had left more than 16 million people in the region in need of food, water and medical treatment. Our podcast asked what could be done.
Ben Quinn, reporting from Burao and Hargeisa, said help was slow to arrive in the towns and villages he visited.
In South Sudan, Simona Foltyn found aid delivery under threat from armed fighters, while agencies rebuked the country over an extraordinarily timed move to raise fees for aid workers. Six aid workers and a driver were killed in the worst single attack on humanitarian staff since civil war broke out in December 2013.
International Women’s Day on 8 March included a call for a global strike. In New York, the Commission on the Status of Women ended with commitments by states to advance women’s economic empowerment by implementing equal pay policies, gender audits and job evaluations. 
El Salvador made history as the first nation to impose a blanket ban on metal mining. Campaigners celebrated a victory for “water over gold”.
A powerful video report showed how anti-slavery activists are often the only chance of escape for the thousands of vulnerable Russians lured from cities to the remote republic of Dagestan, where they are enslaved in rural brick factories and farms. 
Médecins Sans Frontières hailed trials in Niger of a vaccine against rotavirus as a “game changer” in the battle against the virus, which claims the lives of an estimated 1,300 children daily, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa.
Bidi Bidi, in Uganda, welcomed 800,000 people escaping conflict and famine in South Sudan, in the process becoming the world’s largest refugee camp. Tensions quickly rose as more new arrivals took the number closer to a million.
Four months after the peace deal that finally ended Colombia’s long-running civil war, our podcast investigated how you solve half a century of bloodshed and go about building lasting peace.

You think there isn't any?

Based on what published scientific paper(s)?
Climate change (AGW) is a scientific paradigm, so well-established that it sits alongside other paradigms as plate tectonics, evolution, and relativity.
The key concepts were established in the 19th century.
Tens of thousands of pieces of research in geochemistry, palaeontology, oceanography, atmospheric physics, and many more fields of study, have resulted in this overall concept.
Any other idea would need to explain at least as much evidence in a different way.
Which would include the huge mass of evidence from the geological record.
A scientific paradigm will only change if a new paradigm is found that explains not just the existing evidence but even more new evidence.
There is no sign at all of that process happening over AGW, because there is no evidence accumulating that would initiate a paradigm shift.', u'recommendation_count': u'11', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1513276644000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'tens of thousands of pieces of research in geochemistry', u'effect': u'this overall concept'}, {u'cause': u'there is no evidence accumulating that would initiate a paradigm shift', u'effect': u'there is no sign at all of that process happening over agw'}], u'author_id': u'2923581', u'in_reply_to': u'109718360', u'id': u'109718935', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'funkymentalist', u'text': u'BQSTART

A recent Gallup poll also found American concern about climate change at an all-time high. But lack of public support isn’t the problem. For example, 62% of Trump voters support carbon pollution taxes and/or regulations. And of course while there is tremendous public support for many gun control policies, Republicans in Congress refuse to vote for those policies. Sadly, the party is now morally and intellectually bankrupt, completely controlled by special interests and indifferent to the opinions of their constituents.

Only 2% voted Green. That should tell you all you need to know. People do not care much about things that do not affect them directly. People do not care much about climate change. All but a handful dont want to hear about it. We simply do not care enough. And in that we are proving what we are, and what we are is wrong.
Climate change consequences lag the cause (our emissions) by up to one thousand years. Ocean acidification and the air are immediate consequences. Warming though lags by decades and sea rise by centuries. On our current course, we would be extinct before the all of the consequences can be experienced. None of us are going to pay for the damage we have done, and none of us are taking any responsibility for it with those in power, our politicians, being paid off to turn a blind eye. Our only redress, is our vote. Amonst other things, we voted to not act on climate change. 
On the widest scope possible, at the level of existence, you could argue that climate change is not a test for the individual, such as running or mathematics, but it is a test for a the whole species, our species, humanity. It requires the species to care. If humanity cannot show compassion and care, enough to protect the existence of future generations from our actions now, then perhaps someone designing such a thing as life conclude that that species is not worthy of existence at all. If humanity does not deal with climate change in a very timely fashion well before the consequences are all too obvious, it will become extinct and arguably, for good reason.
The only certain thing so far is that we will not act if our only incentive is scientific proof and minor enivornmental observations because we have had those for over 75 years and that has not caused humanity to act. Expecting this to change is unrealistic. So expecting action on climate change with a change of words, is also unrealistic.
What we need is a new political approach whereby people, who will never care enough to vote Green whilst climate change affects only others, will be in power enough to be able to vote for action on any issue, including climate change, separately to other issues as well as having their vote override the choices of government who too frequently are acting on behalf of lobbyists and party donors such as the fossi fuel and finance industries whose only intentions are greed and self-interest today without giving any thought to the damage caused in the future. 
The people do have the capacity to vote to solve climate change, to choose to have climate change solved through law, but that depends on them to having that choice represented in law, and that depends on there being a new political system which allows people to have the power to make law directly.

However climate science as a political movement has conducted itself in a way that casts doubt on its integrity.
Carbon sources are not limited to fossil fuel. Almost everything we do puts more carbon in the air. The real driver is population; humans were putting out each around a ton of carbon per year before fossil fuels were widely used. Putting the brakes on fossil fuel use will not bring down the CO2 level by itself.
Limiting the population is likewise not a viable solution. Ice cores tell us that the CO2 level has been rising for eight thousand years. It is the population boom of the 19th century that made this obvious. We ran out of biomass to consume, and then we began using ""fossil"" fuels. We do not have the resources to support even ten percent of the present population with conventional carbon-based ""renewable"" fuels.
Those familiar with evolution know that there has never been a stable CO2 concentration. There is no mechanism to stabilize it. Evolution has caused dramatic changes, and each new crisis provokes the evolution of new species that tend to balance things. In the early stages the atmosphere was a toxic mix of carbon dioxide, water vapor, ammonia, and methane. Only with the evolution of plant life and photosynthesis was animal life even possible. Our present atmosphere with an 80%/20% mix of nitrogen and oxygen and trace amounts of CO2 is the result of a billion year tug-of-war between plants and animals.
Humans with our prolific production of CO2 from fire and draft animals are just the most recent products of this evolution. However we are conscious. We know we are affecting the climate, and we have ways of controlling the CO2 concentration. We do it in space missions and submarines. Experimentally we have done this on earth with the Biosphere 2 project:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere_2.
No amount of climate hysteria, no amount of finger pointing and shutting down industry will bring CO2 levels down. Much of the climate science community is of Luddite or deconstructionist persuasion. They are have a visceral hatred of carbon-free technologies like hydro power (""save the fish"") and nuclear power. While railing against civilian nuclear power,they frequently cite Fukushima. But Fukushima was an obsolete first generation reactor that was built in exactly the wrong place. If modern reactors are still a danger, then the dozens of reactors afloat in Navy vessels around the world are a much bigger threat.
Neither population control nor fossil fuel taxes will be enough to stop the rise in CO2. Neither will scaring schoolchildren or giving our money away to the poor. We need carbon free energy, and carbon sequestration as well. Fortunately the climate changes we see in the press are exaggerated. We still have a few generations to develop the technology, but that is what we must do.

For example, conservatives who are more scientifically literate are less worried about global warming. In essence, education arms them with the tools to more easily reject evidence and information that conflicts with their ideological beliefs. This has been called the “smart idiot” effect and it isn’t limited to climate change; it’s also something we’re seeing with the Republican tax plan.
However, other research has shown that conservatives with higher climate-specific knowledge are more likely to accept climate change – a result that holds in many different countries. For example, when people understand how the greenhouse effect works, across the political spectrum they’re more likely to accept human-caused global warming.
Social scientists have also debated whether communicating the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming moves the needle in a positive or negative direction. Previous research led by Stephan Lewandowsky has shown that informing people about the expert consensus increases acceptance of human-caused global warming. However, Yale social scientist Dan Kahan has remained unconvinced and continues to argue that 97% consensus messaging is polarizing and therefore counter-productive.
To test which side is correct, social scientists Sander van der Linden, Anthony Leiserowitz, and Edward Maibach conducted a survey of over 6,000 nationally-representative Americans, of which 934 were conservatives with at least a college degree. This is the group for which facts should hypothetically be most polarizing, because they have the tools to most easily find ways to reject those facts and an ideological bias against accepting climate science.
On Monday the authors published their first paper using this data in Nature Human Behavior. In that study, they specifically examined whether informing these high-education conservatives (and liberals) that “97% of climate scientists have concluded that human-caused global warming is happening” would increase their perception of the consensus, or if it would backfire, causing polarization and further rejection of the consensus among conservatives. 
In the control group, college-educated conservatives thought the expert consensus was about 64%, and college-educated liberals put the number at 78% (a 14% partisan gap). After being informed about the actual 97% consensus, the conservative answer increased to 83% while the liberal response rose to around 90% (a 7% partisan gap). 
Notably, not only did highly-educated conservatives respond positively by generally accepting the facts and adjusting their views accordingly, but the ideological gap on this question shrunk in half. It’s a clear example that facts aren’t necessarily polarizing.
In response to this study, Kahan pointed out that it only addressed perceived consensus and not acceptance of human-caused global warming or support for climate policy.
in this paper, author doesn't report impact of %-scienist msg on perceptions of climate change 5/5
However, the authors have just published a second paper in the Journal of Science Communication that responds to Kahan’s critiques by including the data addressing those questions. It shows that consensus messaging increased acceptance of human-caused global warming by about 5%, both for the participants as a whole and specifically for college-educated conservatives. Similarly, support for climate policy rose by about 2% across the political spectrum.
These numbers might sound small, but on their 7-point scale (4 being neutral), support for climate policy rose from 5.48 to 5.59 on average, and from 4.89 to 4.99 among college-educated conservatives. In other words, though it may not be considered a high priority, support for climate policy is already there, and informing people about the 97% expert consensus moved the needle a bit further in the positive direction. And as Kahan said in 2003,
Individual opinions influence political outcomes through aggregation. Even a modest amount of variation in opinion across individuals will profoundly influence collective deliberations
Indeed public awareness of the expert consensus and reality of human-caused global warming has been on the rise, as research by Larry Hamilton has shown.
Public awareness of scientific consensus has risen alongside and plausibly influenced public acceptance of anthropogenic climate change itself. https://t.co/J7fNaZjS0m pic.twitter.com/BdU1gtaOeZ
A recent Gallup poll also found American concern about climate change at an all-time high. But lack of public support isn’t the problem. For example, 62% of Trump voters support carbon pollution taxes and/or regulations. And of course while there is tremendous public support for many gun control policies, Republicans in Congress refuse to vote for those policies. Sadly, the party is now morally and intellectually bankrupt, completely controlled by special interests and indifferent to the opinions of their constituents.
To summarize, most Americans are aware that humans are causing global warming, and across the political spectrum they support climate policies. Communicating facts isn’t necessarily polarizing; in fact certain information like the existence of the 97% expert climate consensus actually decreases polarization and increases acceptance of climate science and policies. That’s all important and good news, but until the fossil fuel industry no longer controls the political party in power, America won’t be able to implement national climate policies.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/dec/14/research-shows-that-certain-facts-can-still-change-conservatives-minds

A sustainable future is vital and possible,article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/11/no-more-green-rhetoric-sustainable-future-vital-possible-labour,0,"The climate crisis is the most significant issue facing humanity. Natural disasters are already displacing entire communities. More intense droughts are leading to unprecedented levels of food insecurity and hunger across the globe. This summer saw hurricanes, floods and fires affect hundreds of millions of people from India to Niger, Haiti to Houston. The UK is also vulnerable to climate impacts, with more destructive storms, prolonged floods, and heatwaves becoming the norm.
Our climate reality is increasingly unpredictable and daunting. However, it is also opening the space to collectively reimagine a different future for the UK. Fossil fuels helped ignite the first industrial revolution, but we now know that their continued use will threaten our very existence. Within the UK we have the skills, ingenuity and people to drive the next energy revolution, powered by renewables. For us to make this change a success, our politics must have environmental sustainability and social justice at its core.
This is why climate change is at the heart of Labour’s industrial strategy. At the last election, Labour pledged that 60% of the UK’s energy will come from low carbon or renewable sources by 2030 to help us meet the challenge of tackling climate change. Labour plans to achieve this mission by transforming our energy system by taking parts back into public control and exploring how we can ensure greater local control of energy generation and supply. We want to cultivate strengths in growing markets for green tech, invest in renewable energy infrastructure, reduce demand for heat, and maintain Britain’s climate commitments. 
Two years ago, representatives from 196 countries met in Paris and committed to limiting global temperature rises to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels, with the aspirational target below 1.5C. The UK ratified the landmark Paris agreement the following year, promising to “continue our leadership on climate action”.
Despite its green rhetoric, the government’s record is not good. Its Clean Growth Strategy even admitted that the measures it recommended would not fulfil either the fourth or fifth carbon budgets. These budgets are restrictions on the total amount of greenhouse gases than can be emitted in a five-year period by the UK and are legally binding; for example the fourth carbon budget covers the period 2023-27, and the fifth covers 2028-2032. 
We should be over-performing on our carbon budgets, not underperforming. The most recent autumn budget even threatened the future of new renewable generation by not admitting any more new low carbon electricity levies until 2025, on current forecasts, while at the same time giving tax breaks to oil and gas firms. The implications of the new levy regime could be catastrophic. Without alternative funding, it may spell the end of much low carbon development in the UK. With the success offshore, this is the moment to be seizing the opportunity to develop other forms of renewable energy. The Tories continue to push fracking despite its unpopularity across the country. The result of Tory policy not only undermines our climate change obligations but means many suffer from the effects of air pollution and fuel poverty.
I’m joining 100 other MPs, across parties, to call on our pension fund to remove its investments in fossil fuels
That’s why I’m joining 100 other MPs, across parties, to call on our pension fund to remove its investments in fossil fuels. Our words in Paris must be matched by our actions in parliament – our constituents expect nothing less. This starts, but by no means finishes, with where we invest millions of pounds through our pensions. But we need to open up this conversation beyond parliament to ensure a just transition to a green economy.
This campaign is the fastest growing divestment movement of all time, which has seen more than $5tn of assets divested across more than 800 institutions. Campaigning for our universities, workplaces, unions, and pension funds to divest is one important way we can help to build a more sustainable society.

The reason why I presented those numbers was to point out that discussing population growth is not a helpful thing when it comes to pollution in Asia.
BQEND
Pollution has a direct relationship to population, and therefore to population growth. Of course it's helpful, or relevant, in a discussion of pollution.

So if they're declining why should we be talking about population growth?
BQEND
Because you're talking about the decline in the rate of growth, not a decline in population. You'd be better to use figures for the birth rate per 1000 population and death rate, and look at the difference. If the former is larger than the latter then even excluding immigration the population will rise.

The end point of your logic is that humans should cease to exist, as that would be the absolute ""best"" for, or least impact on, the planet. From that logic your own presence on the planet is a bad thing and needs addressing in a similar vein to the non-existence of future children. That or you think it's OK for you to exist and consume and affect it, but not others. Otherwise you appear to have an issue with overpopulation, but not population.

In the Philippines, President Duterte has taken a hard line against the excesses and poor regulatory oversight of the mining industry, despite resistance from powerful lobby groups.
I find this article rather naive and reverse Orientalist in its take on matters pertaining to Asia vs the supposedly sclerotic and ineffectual ""West"". If you remove the USA, Australia and Canada from the equation, you should see that the countries of Europe are doing far more on the ground and at community level to tackle climate change than almost any country or community in Asia you care to name. This is grassroots action that is scaling up across communities and countries, like the Transition Towns movement, driven by citizens, not authoritarian or totalitarian govts like the ones mentioned by Nair, where the state does all the bidding and controlling.
Take the examples given in the paragraph quoted above. China's ""Great Green Wall"" is a nightmare for the native population, like so much of the state-directed projects, and it doesn't matter how many trees are planted or solar panels are installed, if the state is trampling all over the rights of local people (and the environment) in a misdirected effort to be ""green"". The Vietnam example is a total joke, and does absolutely zero for climate change, while the state continues to roll out large scale irrigation schemes, destroy rivers and wetlands, produce more methane from their love of intensive rice and trample the rights of ethnic minorities. You could also have mentioned the plans by the VNM govt to build dozens of coal-fired power stations as evidence of its commitment to fighting climate change, including 12 in the vulnerable environment of the Mekong Delta. As for defending Duterte's ""hard line"" in the Philippines, I am sickened that you could even consider raising him as an example of anything apart from a murderous thug who is proud of his record of personally killing people.
All the countries you mention are all far more committed to pursuing a model of rampant consumerism than much of the West, and are far less well equipped to sort it out in an equitable manner. Did you know, for instance, in poor Cambodia, the average person uses 2,000 plastic bags a year, most of which get discarded straight into the environment and not landfill, against the western European average of 200 plastic bags.

To restrict consumption means to restrict consumers and no one wants to be restricted.
BQEND
Indeed. However all sorts of restrictions are a fact of modern life, and in the capitalist world often that's effected through the pricing mechanism. Therefore, an economic approach is possible. Most crucially the 'tragedy of the commons' needs to be addressed, with monetary value and pricing incorporated into the externalities of production. For example, ""polluter pays to clean up"" and mandatory ""producer takes back old goods for recycling"" policies must be enforced.
BQSTART
To restrict growth is to restrict wealth and everyone wants the chance to be wealthier and wealthier.
BQEND
Only up to a point, as theorists have long known, and most famously summarised in Maslow's hierarchy of needs. In modern countries where basic needs have been met, happiness and self-esteem are more a important driver. A crucial element of this is a sense of fairness and civic belonging, which is why those countries which score highest on 'best cities to live in' and 'content with life'-type surveys are usually the more egalitarian/socialist Nordic nations.

Asia will have to do it | Chandran Nair,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/05/west-climate-crisis-asia-developing-nations,0,"The climate change talks in Bonn have now wrapped up with little firm action. Next year they move to Poland. But whatever is discussed or agreed in European cities over the coming years, the answers to climate change will not come from the west (beyond a few technological tweaks), but Asia.
Climate change is the most striking example of the unintended consequences of an unsustainable economic model. It is predicted that some regions, such as Asia’s Indus valley, will be too hot to live in by 2100. Coastal megacities are threatened by rising sea levels. Common resources – land, food, water and forests, among others – are already strained. Climate change will upend agriculture, making food security a major issue for hundreds of millions at a time when arable land is in decline.
But climate change is far from the only example of what is wrong with our model of development. Air pollution levels in Delhi were so high over the weekend that an international cricket match was halted, with players reported to be “continuously vomiting”.
The west isn’t going to sort this out. Its democracies face huge difficulties when confronted by the need for unpopular decisions that dramatically shift lifestyles and mean people must give up privileges such as car and air travel that they have taken for granted. Perhaps inevitably, western politicians prefer to seek solutions through market mechanisms and technological “innovations”. When it comes to the future of the planet, decisions in Beijing, New Delhi, Jakarta and Lagos will be more important than those taken in Washington or Brussels.
With the dual challenges of growth and sustainability, Asian governments face a unique challenge. They have large and increasing populations that are still poor, with a majority still lacking secure access to the basic rights of life: a minimum standard of living that includes a safe and secure food supply, clean water, permanent housing, adequate sanitation and access to energy.
Yet they can’t improve their standards of living in the resource-intensive way western countries did. To do so would be to invite catastrophe. Their common resources are strained and the biosphere is stressed – a situation that, as science makes clear, will only get worse.
It is true that Asia is very diverse. A solution in South Korea or Singapore will look very different to what is pursued in poorer Cambodia or Myanmar, or middle-income Malaysia.
But all Asian governments must, in the coming decades, find ways to sustainably manage resources to ensure their populations – current and future – have access to them. They need to develop solutions that move away from what the west believes to be the standard. They need to put more focus on collective welfare over individual rights. They need to manage expectations so as to avoid overconsumption and waste.
So how is Asia doing so far? October’s Chinese Communist party congress provided reason for cautious optimism. One thing in President Xi Jinping’s three-hour keynote speech stood out: his redefinition of China’s “principal contradiction”. For Deng Xiaoping, widely regarded as the father of modern China, this contradiction was between the nation’s needs and its overall lack of development. Xi now describes it as the tension between “unbalanced and inadequate development and the people’s ever growing needs for a better life”. In this, Xi signalled a move away from a policy of development at all costs towards something more balanced.
This is an approach the other large nations of Asia, such as India and Indonesia, should take note of. Until now, the continent’s imbalanced model of development has been based on prioritising growth in the cities over development in the countryside. Many large Asian cities are becoming intolerable places to live because of congestion, density and heat. Inequality has also increased. And as Asia seeks to embrace modernity – which, in practice, means adopting many aspects of western lifestyles – it risks losing its own culture and traditions, which underpin age-old values and have helped maintain social cohesion over centuries.
From massive solar schemes to decades-long reforestation projects designed to hold back the desert across the western part of China and inner Mongolia (the Great Green Wall of trees is aided by a solar power station), the Chinese government is leading the fight. Vietnam too has taken steps towards sustainability, investing in rural irrigation to increase rice yields. In the Philippines, President Duterte has taken a hard line against the excesses and poor regulatory oversight of the mining industry, despite resistance from powerful lobby groups.
Singapore is a much smaller and wealthier example, yet despite its “free market” reputation it routinely takes wide-ranging action to ensure that housing, healthcare and other social services are provided universally. Nor is Singapore scared to make aggressive interventions that would be decried as socialist in parts of the west: the government announced in October that it would put a hard limit on the number of cars in the city.
These countries need to go much further in developing new economic models if the world’s resources are to be sustained. But Asian governments must not act alone. The region has several international organisations and blocs that can encourage the sharing of ideas.
Developing nations must be given room to find alternatives by the mainly western-led international rule-making organisations, and must not be lectured by western leaders who have no experience in dealing with these challenges.
But most importantly, Asian policymakers and business leaders must start to take the lead, and stop being subservient to western ideas about progress.

From a Scientific American article by Ben Santer:
Reality is not fungible. It is not partisan. It cannot be altered by denying its existence. Yet another RT/BT process—a process that was already tried three years ago, but failed to undermine the basic findings of climate science—will not change the reality that humans are affecting global climate. Human actions have contributed significantly to warming oceans and land, rising sea level, retreat of snow and ice, and changes in extreme events. Nature will not save us from the consequences of these actions. Only human wisdom and intelligence can do that.
The RT/BT requests seek to muddy the waters, to confuse, to delegitimize and devalue decades of well-established science. These efforts to sow doubt are dangerous, and should be called out by all citizens—not just by climate scientists. We all lose if we cannot discriminate between objective reality and declared reality.

Sea-level rise had been rising at a rate of about 0.33 ± 0.04 cm yr−1 over the past few decades [36] but has increased to about 0.44 ± 0.05 cm yr−1 in recent years [37]. If current greenhouse gas emission trends continue, these rates will likely increase in the coming decades and centuries [38]. Over the next 1000 years, sea-level is projected to rise at an average rate of 3.44 cm yr−1, if all available fossil fuel resources are combusted and the CO2 released to the atmosphere.

Fear the true will of the people. Usually ""the people"" are a bunch of semi-primitives who have no clue what the fuck they are doing or whether whatever they seem to want is even achievable. Yes, everyone would love lots of money, free booze and no work to do, but besides that I don't think ""the people"" (as a whole, mind you, not those of them who have neurons in other places than their own gonads) are any good at deciding anything. 
Governments never enacted the will of the people; they did what they thought was best for the country and their own pockets, with priorities varying from ""most for my pockets"" to ""most for the country"", with the former being more prevalent throughout history.
All voting processes are flawed in one way or another, so you can't even argue successfully that the ruling people were ""chosen by the people"". Most times they aren't. They're usually chosen by a group of people with power, and then the candidate is shown as ""this is the one you should all vote [for] !"" and that's it. That's a lack of choice rather than a choice, much like ""mouldy bread or spoiled meat"" could be considered ""choice"".

AGW fits this.
Consensus is one of the ""3 Cs"" that need to apply for a concept to be a scientific paradigm.
The concept that global warming is being caused by human activity has - like other scientific paradigms - :
....... coherence - consilience - and - consensus ......
Coherence - a theory that coherently explains the multiple observed lines of empirical evidence across multiple aspects of the climate system.
Consilience - the predicted and projected changes being confirmed across multiple scientific disciplines observing the multiple aspects of the climate system.
Consensus - agreement amongst scientific researchers from many different academic disciplines that the first two C's are correct, and that no alternate theory can adequately explain this.
Climate change (AGW) is a scientific paradigm, so well-established that it sits alongside other paradigms as plate tectonics, evolution, and relativity.
The key concepts were established in the 19th century.
Tens of thousands of pieces of research in geochemistry, palaeontology, oceanography, atmospheric physics, and many more fields of study, have resulted in this overall concept.
Any other idea would need to explain at least as much evidence in a different way.
Which would include the huge mass of evidence from the geological record.
A scientific paradigm will only change if a new paradigm is found that explains not just the existing evidence but even more new evidence.

They set up a project called Berkeley Earth in 2010.
They found independent funding, including from sceptics in the business community.
Many so-called climate sceptics said this was exactly what they wanted, and they would accept what BE reported.
The first phase of the project took about 2 years.
When BE then reported that their research agreed with other researchers that:
- the Earth is warming;
- has been since the 19th century;
- and that greenhouse gases produced by human activity are the cause....
- suddenly the so-called climate sceptic websites rejected BE, and never mention it.
When I mention BE to so-called climate sceptics in discussions like this, they generally don't reply.
The sceptical scientists, of course, now accepted that their check on other scientists' work had confirmed that the science published on this matter is good science - because those sceptical scientists were real sceptics.
Going back even further, when Exxon got its own scientists to investigate climate change in the 1970s, those scientists found that CO2 from burning fossil fuels was causing global temperatures to rise.
Exxon didn't tell anyone of course.
Not their shareholders, for example.
There is no research supporting the opinions of so-called climate sceptics.
In fact the key scientific concepts were discovered in the 19th century.
In 1856, Eunice Foote published a scientific paper in the Journal of American Science, entitled “Circumstances Affecting the Heat of the Sun’s Rays.”
The paper was a report of an experiment in which she put various atmospheric gases into glass vessels with thermometers inserted.
She wanted “to determine the different circumstances that affect the thermal action of the rays of light that proceed from the sun.”
Oxygen and hydrogen, when pumped into the glass containers and exposed to the sun, displayed no significant difference in temperature in comparison to the control vessel containing air.
Pumping carbon dioxide into another receiver, also exposed to sunlight, Mrs. Foote wrote that the mercury in the thermometer leaped, with the one containing the carbon dioxide becoming much hotter, “more so than the others.”
Then there is this paper:

Probably not a good idea to use ""economists"" as your example of what ""experts"" should be like.
In addition to saying ""The only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable"", J.K. Galbraith (an economist !) also said ""There are two classes of economic forecasters: those who don’t know, and those who don’t know they don’t know"".
Regarding ""economic consensus"" there is also the famous ""joke"" that ""For every economist there exists an equal and opposite economist"".
On the other hand, in this Guardian article from a few months ago there was :

Prakash Loungani at the IMF analysed the accuracy of economic forecasters and found something remarkable and worrying. “The record of failure to predict recessions is virtually unblemished,” he said. 
His analysis revealed that economists had failed to predict 148 of the past 150 recessions. Part of the problem, he said, was that there wasn’t much of a reputational gain to be had by predicting a recession others had missed. If you disagreed with the consensus, you would be met with scepticism. The downside of getting it wrong was more personally damaging than the upside of getting it right.

Astronomical cycles that caused an increase in insolation, boosted by extra CO2 coming out of the warming oceans.
Attribution studies show that those astronomical cycles are now in what would be a very very slow cooling phase if no other process was operating.
CO2 level now is higher than any in the last several million years.
CO2 levels change in response to a number of factors.
For example, when mountain chains like the Himalayas began to rise, the rocks started to react with atmospheric CO2 (this is one of the processes called weathering).

Both are morally appalling and reject the available evidence and expert opinion.
The Initiative on Global Markets’ panel of economic experts was recently asked about the Republican tax plan. Among the experts who took a position either way, there was a 96% consensus that the plan would not substantially grow the economy more than the status quo, and a 100% consensus that it would substantially increase the national debt.
Economists aren't exactly big fans of current GOP tax plans https://t.co/B0jodtnv2v pic.twitter.com/4qqqzwsePd
Those numbers are quite similar to the 97% consensus among climate scientists that humans are driving global warming and the 95% consensus among economists that the US should cut its carbon pollution. 
The House and Senate Republicans have passed similar versions of their tax bill, and neither chamber is allowing any climate policy to move forward.
So what’s making Republican Party leaders reject the expert consensus on these incredibly important issues?
Sometimes tax cuts make sense; for example, when trying to stimulate a depressed economy, or when operating with a budget surplus. Neither is currently the case. This message from the president:
Unemployment is down to 4.1%, lowest in 17 years. 1.5 million new jobs created since I took office. Highest stock Market ever, up $5.4 trill
Is incompatible with Senator Lindsey Graham saying “the economy needs a tax cut.” The tax cut plan, which by design will increase the US national debt by $1.5tn, is also incompatible with Republican opposition to increased deficits. Just last year the Republican National Committee was warning of “an unsustainable path toward crippling debt.” 
Economists also agree that we should be paying down the debt when the economy is going strong. When the next recession inevitably strikes, governments need monetary flexibility to respond. That’s when it makes sense to run a deficit (for example, see the 2009 stimulus package, which helped pull the US out of the Great Recession and cost less than the Republican tax plan).
These Republican economic contradictions make no sense, but they’re familiar to those of us who follow climate change news. The only consistency in climate denial is in its contradictions – deniers claim global warming isn’t happening, but it’s a natural ocean cycle, and caused by the sun, and galactic cosmic rays, and Jupiter’s orbital cycles, and it’s really just a Chinese hoax, and in any case it’s not bad.
On taxes, the Republican argument is that cuts pay for themselves by stimulating economic growth and creating jobs.
“This is not going to be a deficit-producing effort,” McConnell says, believing economic growth will pay for bill.
But the economic literature is far from clear about whether tax cuts necessarily spur economic growth at all, let alone enough to pay for themselves. Moreover, corporate CEOs have repeatedly said that the Republican tax plan won’t spur investment or job creation – instead they’ll mostly pass the gains to their wealthy shareholders. There was an embarrassing video clip when Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn was confronted with this inconvenient truth:
VIDEO: CEOs asked if they plan to increase their company's capital investments if the GOP's tax bill passes. A few hands go up. ""Why aren't the other hands up?"" Gary Cohn asks.#WSJCEOCouncil pic.twitter.com/TD2oAlN27S
When presented with the nonpartisan congressional Joint Committee on Taxation analysis concluding the bill would increase the national debt by over $1tn even when accounting for associated economic growth, Republicans immediately rejected the results. 
In NPR interview, Paul Ryan said he “thinks” the tax cuts will pay for themselves despite analysis to the contrary. “I’m telling you that’s what I believe will happen. I’m not going to tell you I’m sure.” https://t.co/CdXtuJmf0P
As Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said, “Either it’s a religious belief, a belief where no amount of evidence would change that, or they are using the argument cynically and they just want more money for themselves.” He was talking about trickle-down economics, but just as easily could have been describing climate denial.
I’m old enough to remember when the GOP considered itself the party of intellectuals, back in the days when Republicans invented the concept of pollution cap and trade systems, for example. It wasn’t long ago that party leaders like Newt Gingrich and 2008 GOP presidential candidate John McCain were calling for the party to support climate policies.
Starting with the brief rise of the Tea Party in 2010, that all changed, and the intellectual rot of the GOP has accelerated under President Trump. In a July 2017 Pew poll, just 36% of Republicans said colleges and universities have a positive impact on America, and a stunning 58% said they have a negative effect.
Similarly, in an August 2017 Gallup poll, just 33% of Republicans expressed confidence in higher education. Worst of all, the Republican tax bill even penalizes American graduate students.
A 2012 survey found that Americans who only watch Fox News are less informed than Americans who watch no news at all. At the time, 55% of Americans including 75% of Republicans reported watching Fox News. The network is powerful – a recent study found that Fox News might have enough influence to tip American elections – and on the whole it prioritizes ideological messaging over factual accuracy.
Trump’s attacks on the so-called “fake news” media have further eroded Republicans’ trust of news sources that lack a conservative bias. As David Roberts wrote for Vox:
The US is experiencing a deep epistemic breach, a split not just in what we value or want, but in who we trust, how we come to know things, and what we believe we know — what we believe exists, is true, has happened and is happening … the right has created its own parallel set of institutions, most notably its own media ecosystem … “conservative media is more partisan and more insular than the left.”
Because so many conservatives rely on right-wing media sources for their news, it’s easy to misinform them through a constant stream of lies. 
For example, Trump’s Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin promised that his department would produce an analysis showing that the tax cuts will pay for themselves. One economist in the department leaked to the New York Times that such an analysis doesn’t exist and Treasury staffers weren’t even asked to study the issue. It was a lie. Mnuchin also claimed the plan would only raise taxes on Americans who earn more than $1 million a year – the exact opposite of reality and another blatant lie. In fact, the entire Republican case for their tax plan was based on lies. 
Similarly, climate denial is based on endless myths and misinformation – Skeptical Science has catalogued and debunked about 200 of them. And recent research showed that these myths are quite effective at misinforming their audience.
Republicans including Trump cited a list of 137 economists supporting tax reform, but further investigation showed the list is full of ghosts, office assistants, Koch employees, and many others who failed to mention they’re retired. The climate change equivalent is the Oregon Petition, whose signatories included Spice Girls and fictional characters among its fake experts.
The Republican tax plan and the party’s obstruction of climate policies are nevertheless both unpopular positions. Just 25% of Americans support the tax plan, though that includes 60% of Republican voters. 
Analysis: Deeply unpopular Congress aims to pass deeply unpopular bill for deeply unpopular president to sign https://t.co/3Bkhw6Pn5A
Similarly, 80% of Americans - including 62% of Trump voters - agree that the US should regulate and/or tax carbon pollution. But public support often doesn’t translate into policy, and Republican policymakers have been surprisingly honest and forthright about why they support the tax plan despite opposition by a majority of voters and economic experts:
.@RepChrisCollins (R-NY) on tax reform: ""My donors are basically saying, 'Get it done or don’t ever call me again.'""
Lindsey Graham says “the financial contributions will stop” if tax reform fails.
The plan also raises taxes soonest and most on poorer Americans, slashes their health care coverage, and Republicans are already planning to pay for the plan by cutting social programs that low-income Americans rely on. While massive income inequality is one of the biggest problems in America, squashing the ‘American dream,’ Republicans voted to make the problem much worse. Similarly, poorer countries are the most vulnerable to the consequences of climate change. The Republican Party motto may as well be ‘benefits for the rich at the expense of the poor.’
Quite simply, Republican politicians need campaign donations from oil companies and other big corporations to win elections. To maintain their power they must keep the cash flowing. That means keeping rich donors happy by cutting corporate taxes and obstructing climate policies. To achieve that, Republican politicians reject scientific evidence and expert opinion, lie to their voters, and rely on right-wing media echo chamber propaganda and tribalism to keep their supporters voting against their own best interests.
It’s all morally reprehensible, and so far, it’s working. At this point, the only way to fix the problem is to defeat the Republicans who have rotted their party to its core and are now spreading that rot throughout America and the rest of the world.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/dec/04/the-moral-and-intellectual-bankruptcy-of-the-republican-party

China is to stop or delay work on 151 planned and under-construction coal plants as Beijing struggles to respond to a flat-lining of demand for coal power.... Building new coal-fired power plants doesn’t directly increase CO2 emissions, because coal-fired generation in China is limited by lack of demand. But it does create a conflict between dirty and clean energy in the grid, because the grid operators tend to favor coal power plant operators when dispatching electricity.... The change came thanks to China’s renewable energy boom and a slow-down in power-demand as the country moved away from heavy industry. 
Yet the country kept building coal plants leaving China with power-stations often operating at less than half their capacity.
China hit the brakes on approvals of new coal-fired power plant projects on the second half of 2016, but previously approved plants have continued coming online at a rate of almost one large plant per week.
Last year, China set a target of stopping or delaying at least 150,000 megawatts of coal-fired power plant projects to alleviate the looming overcapacity problem with the new list marking the start of this process.
Renewables boom
The task of addressing coal power overcapacity is made more urgent by newly increased targets for wind and solar power capacity, which will bring more clean energy to the market in the next few years.
The government’s recent efforts to clamp down on the red-hot real estate sector and local government debt spending – key drivers of China’s heavy industry volumes and power demand – will also leave less space for coal-fired power generation.

AGW is based on the physical properties of greenhouse gasses established in the mid nineteenth century.
The theory of AGW itself was first laid out in 1896 (Arrhenius.
Since then, we have tracked and observed with empirical Evidence(TM) the expected outcomes of adding CO2e to the atmosphere.
Deniers, during the last century or more, have failed to over turn this basic physics, chemistry and resulting outcomes. Either they are lazy or they are wrong.

BQSTART
After all when you’ve forecast floods, pestilence, plague, ice free poles, snow free winters et al and nothing has come to be, you have a serious credibility issue to deal with.
BQEND
Incorrect.It is the deniers who lack credibility.
They make all these claims and never back them up with solid Evidence(TM) that scientists are making this claims in the scientific literature.
What they do come up with is outliers in interviews, op-eds, cherry picked comments, out of context comments and so on.
BQSTART
Theories founded on errors, lies and obfuscation and perpetuated by manipulation.
BQEND
incorrect.The data and methodologies are all in the public realm as part of the scientific peer reviewed process. No body of Evidence(TM) has been shown as to why AGW theory is wrong, very very few papers have been withdrawn or debunked as per the normal scientific process in the peer reviewed science journals.
Once again, we come back to the fact that deniers have failed over the last century to develop Coherent theories to explain the Consilience of Evidence(TM) that is being observed.
Once again, we therefore have to conclude they are lazy or wrong.
BQSTART
even if we give up using fossil fuels, retire to a cave and live on berries

Strawman arguments.
BQSTART
It’s a natural cycle and has been occurring since the beginning of time.
BQEND
Incorrect.
The Consilience of Evidence(TM) shows via the attribution studies that man is responsible for all of the currently observed warming.
Once again, deniers have failed to carry out their own analysis and provided Consilience of Evidence(TM) that we are not, and failed to provide a Coherent theory as to which natural cycle(s) could be causing the observed changes.
For example, deniers incoherently argue that warming is not happening, if it is it is the sun, or cosmic rays, or volcanoes etc.

...........we list the linear trend in the signals due to ENSO, volcanic forcing and solar variation in table 3. The magnitudes of these trend contributions are quite small compared to the overall trends. In fact the net trend due to these three factors is negative for all data sets except UAH, for which it is zero. Hence these factors have not contributed to an upward trend in temperature data, rather they have contributed a very slight downward trend.

All the current warming is related to human activity, because the sum of all natural forcings would be cooling the Earth very very slowly now.

As stated, in replying to another poster's comment about the US military's carbon footprint I expressly stated: Far from perfect . All normal people know that the renewables are still in relative infancy but my point was even the military are on the same road to utilising them to reduce carbon footprint and at the same time achieving improved military operational effectiveness.
Further to your other whataboutery that the other kids didn't do their homework so why should the US, a quick check on google identifies the Chinese PLA is already using wind and solar to power their military bases. Including those newly established in the South China Sea. Much like the US military, they are doing so so that the bases are more resilient and do not rely on re-supply/logistics routes that can be cut.
The Chinese are also closing down their older polluting coal plants replacing them with cleaner more efficient plants, and leading the biggest investment in renewables globally.
So I'm afraid, even the bad kids in the class are now doing their homework.

You're looking at the entire northwestern Gulf of Mexico; you're looking at one toxic dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish, made by that beautiful little creature on the lower right. 
And in the upper right you see this black sort of cloud moving ashore. That's the same species. And as it comes to shore and the wind blows, and little droplets of the water get into the air, the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up with people with acute respiratory distress. 
And that's retirement homes on the west coast of Florida. A friend and I did this thing in Hollywood we called Hollywood ocean night, and I was trying to figure out how to explain to actors what's going on. 
And I said, ""So, imagine you're in a movie called 'Escape from Malibu' because all the beautiful people have moved to North Dakota, where it's clean and safe. And the only people who are left there are the people who can't afford to move away from the coast, because the coast, instead of being paradise, is harmful to your health.""

Yet the big businesses he claims to champion are increasingly choosing to ignore the US president’s sceptical stance on climate change and press ahead towards their own environmental goals without him.
Several of the country’s corporate giants, including Walmart, General Motors, Ford and Mars, appeared this week at the second annual Companies v Climate Change conference in Miami to showcase their progress and reinforce their belief that sustainability and other green targets can be achieved irrespective of the policies and purpose of the White House. 
“We were disappointed [the] US pulled out of Paris, but what’s so great is what companies can do to make a difference,” said Zach Freeze, senior director for strategic initiatives in sustainability at Walmart, the first retailer to announce science-based targets for emissions reductions and a key signatory to the We Are Still In declaration that followed Trump’s Paris withdrawal.
“We all have a lot we can do and should do, it’s becoming more and more of an imperative. We’ve been working on this for a long time, prior to this administration [and] we’re thinking about 10 years from now where we’re going to be. Regardless of what’s happening, this is something we believe in. If we do it the right way we will see progress.”
Walmart, which claims 260 million customers per week worldwide, and employs 1.4 million workers in the US alone, earlier this year announced its Project Gigaton initiative that aims to reduce CO2 emissions globally by one billion metric tons before 2050.
Other companies at the conference in Miami – a poignant venue following flooding from Hurricane Irma in September and the threat of obliteration from sea-level rise within the next century – touted their own achievements in defiance of Trump’s climate stance. For example, General Motors’ purchase of 200 megawatts of wind energy for its Ohio and Illinois plants achieves 20% of its target to use only renewable energy sources by 2050. Confectionery giant Mars, meanwhile, has launched a $1bn sustainability plan, targeting a 70% reduction in greenhouse gases.
For Jason Youner, chief executive and founder of Companies v Climate Change, it is further proof that green-thinking American businesses are filling the environmental void created by the Trump administration’s cynicism.
“The corporate sector is not paying heed to the president’s agenda. They’re making all kinds of commitments and they’re putting all kinds of policies in place and changing the way they operate and do business and making a lot of improvements,” he said.
“The message is one of optimism and hope. The president can only do so much, he’s full of bluster and likes to talk a lot and kind of exaggerates his influence. The companies are seeing they can take the lead and influence what happens on the ground, so there’s hope and optimism. Companies around the world are moving forward and not letting this one rogue administration hold them back.”
Alana Libow, director of sustainable development for Danone, a signatory to We Are Still In and whose Evian bottled water brand business in North America has been certified carbon neutral by the Carbon Trust, believes companies can turn the political debate to their advantage as their customers and shareholders demand more environmentally friendly practices.
“It’s an incredible opportunity in an ironic sense, because business always plays a tremendous role in the actions we all take in our social responsibility,” she said. “It only highlights the opportunity and importance for business. Danone was founded on a dual commitment to our shareholders and society, way before we got into the worlds of sustainable development, corporate responsibility, being green. It’s a moment of highlight, nothing has changed in our business and we continue moving along and being a leader in the space.”
Still more can be done by the corporate world, some conference attendees believe. Nicole Labutong, technical manager at CDP, a disclosure and advisory group for businesses, pointed out that only 325 companies from tens of thousands with stated environmental goals had set science-based targets.
“Science is true whether you believe it or not. It’s up to non-state actors to do their part, say you’re ‘still in’ and make up for governments that might not believe in science,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/01/trump-climate-change-paris-withdrawal-ford-walmart

It requires extraordinary times, conditions and people to sustain a movement much beyond another generation; and the truly momentous ones extend another one or two beyond that, such as the New Deal.Modern conservatism began as a backlash to the Civil Rights Movement, specifically the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

The other half is that as the GOP implodes on its own, so too is the Democratic Party (the Clinton/Wall-Street wing of neo-liberal economic, and neo-conservative foreign, policies). And what's replacing it can be attributed, perhaps with more 'truth' than 'accuracy', to the insurgent (""Sanders"", socialist-lite) wing of the Party's base.At the state and local levels, virtually all of the DP's electoral gains were at the expense of the GOP, not 'fellow' Democrats, and in those states/districts the DNC has been triangulating into their presidential primary campaigns, and triangulating out of their general election campaigns. Which is to say, they're winning where the DNC allowed, by design, the state/local DP's to atrophy to the point of being politically irrelevant by deliberately not running candidates, or not supporting those that do.Both Parties are being overwhelmed by demographic changes they can't control, and by economic changes they're responsible for forcing on the rest of U.S. And neither has the intelligence nor incentive to embrace the inevitable.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1512277595000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'it', u'effect': u'which'}], u'author_id': u'10155237', u'in_reply_to': u'109099815', u'id': u'109119806', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'unusedusername', u'text': u'BQSTART

N.R.A. Member Offered Trump Aide ‘Kremlin Connection.’ A conservative operative told a campaign aide he could arrange a back-channel meeting between Donald J. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia through his pro-gun connections.

The White House was well aware of it:

BQSTART
On Dec. 29, a transition adviser to Mr. Trump, K. T. McFarland, wrote in an email to a colleague that sanctions announced hours before by the Obama administration in retaliation for Russian election meddling were aimed at discrediting Mr. Trump’s victory. The sanctions could also make it much harder for Mr. Trump to ease tensions with Russia, “which has just thrown the U.S.A. election to him,” she wrote in the emails obtained by The (New York) Times.
BQEND
Wouldn't it be a crime to knowingly suspect that election fraud by another country had taken place in the USA? Or is that okay if it's your own party?
Against this the propagandists fling their propaganda - saying you can't trust anyone in America. Trust Putin - don't trust American news.
How does this not look like fascism? And why do the Republicans, when confronted with this, say ""But everyone's doing it. Hillary blah, blah blah?"" If I get mugged, is it a defense for the assailant that I was mugged before? Because as a citizen, I'm taking a beating.
We do need a White Rose Society. The whole story is Fascism against Liberal Democracy and freedom. The fascists say ""Oh, you kooky liberals can't be trusted with government..."" Whose government, by the way? Who are these freaks who are saying that WE the citizen owe DONNY some support? He works for us! That we should borrow money to give to his pals - just because?

This is a terrible, terrible era, one in which tremendous harm is being done to many people, to the planet and to the federal government.
It is also a time in which, through the heroic work of people all over the country and the world, the regime has been exposed, thwarted and rebuked. That’s worth remembering as we face a horrific tax bill and the end of net neutrality.
This year of conflicts demonstrates that sometimes when we fight we win, and we have enormous fights ahead of us. The Trump administration is unstable for many reasons, from the erratic behaviour of the president to the Mueller investigation. Civil society has tremendous influence over what becomes of it, and of us.
It’s time to take stock of some of the encouraging phenomena that emerged from this grim year. So I made a list.
Many people found new roles in resistance, and powerful ones, including Amy Siskind with her weekly list of signs of creeping authoritarianism, Sarah Kendzior with her expertise on authoritarianism, and organizers of more than 6,000 chapters of Indivisible and other grassroots groups focused on engaging voters and winning elections.
Many others amplified their work on climate or racial justice or voting rights and connected it to the broad resistance. These times are useful in helping us see the common ground of all our ideals by seeing that the Trump administration, like its Republican predecessors and colleagues, opposes all of them. The same people who deny climate change promulgate racism, attack women’s rights, immigrant rights, etc.
Active, engaged, informed, creative, dedicated, energetic resistance works – and we need lots more of it
The Muslim ban was struck down by the courts, repeatedly. Trump’s own tweets helped make the case that they were motivated by unlawful discrimination, not public safety, and the passionate, spontaneous airport actions a week into the regime demonstrated that there would be resistance, and it would matter.
Healthcare “reform” died on the vine, but terrified and infuriated a lot of people along the way, who got active on the issue and terrified their Republican representatives back.
Significant attention was finally brought to the important issue of racist voter suppression, gerrymandering, and other violations of voter rights that have given the Republican minority an electoral advantage. Many lawsuits going after state laws and regulations are under way. This is a battle that matters immensely: it’s about the basic rights of people of color to participate in shaping the nation. It’s about race and racism.
Too many liberal and left journalists spent the past year telling a story about the swing states focused on Clinton’s weaknesses. Too few told the story of how many people – particularly black people – in those states were prevented from voting. Until everyone knows it, it’s worth repeating that had everyone had equal voting rights, we would have had a dramatically different election. 
We’ve seen numerous dramatic resignations/firings in the chaotic White House. Business Insider reports: “Since late July, senior level officials such as former communications director Anthony Scaramucci, chief strategist Steve Bannon, chief of staff Reince Priebus, and press secretary Sean Spicer departed the White House. Others have included Trump’s longtime body guard Keith Schiller, the director of Oval Office operations, and Sebastian Gorka, an adviser known for his cable news hits defending the administration.” 
Tom Price, the health and human services secretary, stepped down after a scandal about his squandering a million dollars of government money on private jets. And, of course, Michael Flynn was fired earlier this year, too (more on him below).
The administration is under investigation for some very serious crimes that may discredit the whole regime and incriminate, even incarcerate, some of them, including Trump family members and perhaps Trump himself.
Mueller is doing a thorough but swift job. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI on Friday; Paul Manafort and his right-hand man are wearing ankle bracelets; the collusion of Trump’s campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was revealed as he incriminated many others in the campaign, including several still in the administration; Carter Page sang like a (drunk) canary. There’s lots more to come. 
Many analysts say that such investigations start with the small fry, working their way from the periphery toward the center. They’re coming for the Trump family. Stay tuned. And be prepared for an uprising if the Republicans try to stop it.
The Russia business that so many insisted on denying through last winter is undeniable – don’t buy the idea that it’s just intelligence agencies promulgating it. The depth of this story has been exposed by superb journalistic work by many news outlets, including the Guardian; by leaked documents, including the extraordinary stuff exposed by the NSA whistleblower Reality Winner last spring; by politicians across the spectrum, from Maxine Waters to Lindsey Graham; by congressional investigations, and now by Mueller’s work – the indictments he handed down told us a lot. 
Virtually everything the Putin regime is said to have done in the 2016 election was made possible by the internet
Russian interference in European votes, including the Brexit referendum, is now surfacing as well, thanks to journalists in many countries. 
Julia Ioffe in the Atlantic recently broke a story about Julian Assange’s Twitter correspondence with Donald Trump Jr. Assange was doing his damnedest – as anyone who’s been paying attention the last 18 months already knew – to help Trump succeed, but now we get to read about it directly.
With every revelation, the case for the president’s own complicity grows stronger. Ioffe reports that Assange told Trump Jr last fall: “Strongly suggest your dad tweets this link if he mentions us.” Then, 15 minutes later, Trump senior did: “Very little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks. So dishonest! Rigged system!”
And let’s be clear: earlier this month, Trump didn’t say he supports Putin’s denials about infiltrating the election because he’s naive or gullible. He did so because if he acknowledges Putin is guilty, then he acknowledges he gained the presidency illegitimately.
The enormous role of Silicon Valley in cooperating and creating the vulnerabilities and capacities to hack the election are now being exposed: the capacity for harm of Facebook, Twitter, Cambridge Analytica, etc is finally being reckoned with. The industry’s own spin about how lovely and high minded and inclusive it is: we’re done with that propaganda, and that’s a good thing.
Remember that virtually everything the Putin regime is said to have done in the 2016 election was made possible by the internet: hacking voter rolls, pushing fake news, using armies of bots and trolls to shape opinion, hacking Democrats and offering the results to Trump team members. It’s not good to have powerful enemies; it’s good to know who and what they are.
The global climate movement remains strong, technological innovations making renewables more effective and affordable continue, the low price of oil hamstrings some oil projects and expansions, campaigns targeting sites from German coal mines to Canadian pipelines continue to be strong, and most countries continue to respect the Paris climate agreement.
Despite all those reports that Trump withdrew us, the United States cannot withdraw from Paris until the day after the next presidential election, in 2020, as Rebecca Leber reported in Mother Jones last week. The administration has not been able to redirect the world away from addressing climate (though it’s also true that we need far stronger measures and we need them soon).
Though stories about the Democrats being in disarray are forever being recycled, it’s worth noting that the Republicans are in a slow boil. There are loud condemnations of Trump from Jeff Flake and John McCain, among other prominent party members, and a whole wing of old-school conservatives, including the pundits at places like Commentary and the National Review, routinely condemn the administration.
There are lot of reports that privately, many elected Republicans are squirming about their miserable choice between going along with Trump versus the dangers of dissenting. They are constantly facing crises over whether to support or distance themselves from people like Roy Moore and policies that may make them unelectable next time around.
The healthcare battle this spring was a great example of that. Angry constituencies greeted – and in many cases chased away or frightened from showing up – their Republican congressmen this spring. And healthcare “reform” (we have to stop letting them call this stuff reform) tanked.
The elections last month in Virginia and across the country showed that there are real possibilities of a backlash against this rightwing extremism. Eight trans people, along with many women, people of color, members of the Democratic Socialists of America and other progressives who want a US for all of us won office. 
Philadelphia elected as its new district attorney a Black Lives Matter supporter and death penalty opponent who has sued the city’s police department 75 times. A lot of people who were poised to explain why the Democrats were total losers had to eat their editorials, and though the Democrats aren’t the revolution, they are the currently available alternative to the Republicans. 
The border wall is probably never ever going to happen (except that hundreds of miles of wall were built up already in recent decades). The idea Trump pushed during his campaign that Mexico was going to pay for it was something only suckers would believe, and it’s quietly taken a hike since the election. 
No president has ever polled anywhere near as low as Trump at this point in his presidency. He has a diehard base that he caters to, and the more he does, the more he alienates the rest of the public. It’s as though he’s building up an army of support, but in doing so he also fortifies the army of resistance. To paraphrase George W Bush long ago, he’s a divider, not a uniter.
After a long series of legislative defeats and stalemates, Trump is going after a radical transformation of the nation’s tax structure. It will take a lot to resist it, and the resistance should begin by noting that once again, this is the agenda of a party serving corporations and the super-rich and screwing the rest of us over in the process.
This list of our successes and their defeats does not mean you can sit back in the sunshine and trust that it will all turn out in the end. It means that resistance – active, engaged, informed, creative, dedicated, energetic resistance – works, and we need lots more of it. 
It’s too soon for despair, though not for grief. Grief and hope can coexist: grief for who and what has already been harmed, hope for preventing more harm. Remembering what we have accomplished and how ferociously engaged people are in this moment is knowing that the outcomes of many pending conflicts are entirely up in the air, and that we are powerful enough to determine some of them. That power of civil society has hardly yet been exercised.
Engagement means understanding that you can work with some parts and campaigns of the Democratic party as it exists without sharing the limited vision of its leadership. From the newly elected Danica Roem to the longtime congresswoman Maxine Waters, the party contains people whose commitments are more radical than those leaders. For those of us in places where our representatives are not out to destroy everything we love and believe in, it means engagement beyond opposition.
Work both inside and outside electoral politics matters, as do campaigns to transform the party into something more progressive and more accountable now being undertaken by many magnificent young organizers. Insiders and outsiders both have roles that matter.
Independent activists on issues like abortion or immigrant rights can define the debate and raise the issues before decisions are made inside the political system. We are in the midst of a host of battles over the fate of the nation and the earth, and the outcome is in no small part up to us. The results over the past year show that sometimes we win, if we try.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/02/biggest-victories-trump-resistance

A smart land owner looks at the tools of production available starting with the characteristics of the land and markets. In terms of potential revenue per acre available-cattle are toward the bottom end of the production value spectrum and tree fruits/nuts/berries at the top end. So you gotta ask yourself-are all those cattle farmers really that stupid as to be raising cattle when they could double, triple, quadruple their revenue per acre by switching to another crop? No. Unless you're a liberal-in which case you think anyone who doesn't share your opinion about an issue is stupid.
Maybe there isn't any infrastructure for harvesting, storing, shipping, packing, wholesaling pomegranates. So why would someone switch to tree fruits if the result is that the crop will annually rot in the fields? Maybe that's why the Amazon farmers are raising cattle instead of soybeans.

The researchers have calculated the total feed intake of domesticated livestock (measured in dry matter) and as can be seen from the pie chart 46% of all feed are grass and leaves. The second most important feed are crop-residues (straw, stover etc.) with 19%, while grains (maize, wheat, barley etc.) account for 13% of the global livestock dry matter intake.  Other by-products from the food chain (in particular from the milling, drink and food industry) supply 5% of the feed, while oil seed cakes contribute another 5%. Notably, oil seed cake is partly a by-product as well. Global consumption of vegetable oil has skyrocketed after WW II and almost all vegetable oils have a waste production in the form of oil seed cake. Large scale cultivation of soybeans was first driven by soy oil demand, and still today soy oil is the second most important oil in the world and contributes one third of the income from soy growing.fromAre Pigs Eating our Food?

The three major sources of ag sector emissions are all associated ruminant livestock production and are: a) land clearing and the reclearing of woody regrowth b) enteric fermentation (methane from cows and sheep) c) savannah burning to promote green grass regrowth for cattle fodder.

While it is correct that the global livestock sector uses 70 percent of the world’s agricultural land, not mentioned in the article is that half of it is unsuitable for crop production. In fact, as a recent paper in Global Food Security (Mottet, A., et al, 2017) points out, only 14 % of the livestock feed could also be used for human food, de rest is waste, and an important part of the circular economy. A further interesting finding in this paper is that cattle uses only 0.6 kg protein from human food to produce 1 kg of protein in milk and meat. Thus, a net gain! On the greenhouse gas emission it remains unsaid that the 14.5 % of anthropogenic emission is based on a so-called lifecycle analysis (from farm to fork) whereas the transport emission figures are tailpipe only (thus comparing apples with oranges), and the literature provides also higher figures for the latter. Finally, it should be mentioned that livestock is a critical part of the livelihood of about 800 million rural poor (mostly women), and that without livestock achieving the Millennium Development Goals of poverty reduction and gender equality would be practically impossible.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1512559927000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'17984798', u'id': u'109306381', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Adele Alsop', u'text': u'I live in a place, with other people and animals both domestic and wild, where the benefits to be lost with the sacrifice of pristine, un-chemically altered and un-poisoned farm land would be a disaster. This loss of rich farmland and water is a current global disaster too, as is commercial development on land that was farmland. Environmental degradation in every conceivable way, of human health, watersheds, oceans, soils, forests and wild life, and of the warming climate is-a-disaster. 
No where in this article are the perils of herbicides and genetically modified mono-crops mentioned. These methods of industrialized farming require massive tillage of soils and the ever increasing use- and marketing, of poisons: pesticides and herbicides to kill ever more resistant weeds. So if you have a conscience about respecting living things you need to listen up and do some real research, because the control of and elimination of the real future of our food is drastically at risk in what the authors of this article are advocating. 
The manipulation of people who are vegans and vegetarians, to promote toxic corporate mono-crop farming is what is going on in this article; including deforestation of the Amazon by exponential expansion of soybean crop farming. 
 If you have a vegan or vegetarian diet, support organic farming and learn about it too, please. This article is a disaster. 
And In my opinion, is probably sponsored by corporate genetically modified crop farming interests. What good is your vegetarianism or veganism if the food you eat is poisoned by herbicides? When you focus on and argue about animal husbandry you advocate against organic farming, and you need to learn why age old sustainable farming practice sustains the living biology of soils! National Geographic recently published an excellent article about organic farming in Iowa. The article beautifully explains why organic farms are the future, because everything is in the dirt you farm with, and that includes using manure and, yes, animal husbandry. Yes cattle ranching and the beef industry is part of the deforestation of the Amazon Basin, especially now that huge populations in the world are having beef marketing on steroids (literally) foisted on them: beef marketed as the status symbol of upwardly mobility.
It is the saddest thing because these people used to have healthy diets, heritage seed banking, and farming practices the rest of the world could benefit and learn from. Fact: Much of their poverty and loss of their farms is caused by global warming.
Biologically rich, alive and healthy soils are one of the hugest carbon sinks available to us, as are living oceans, fresh water, and Forests and biodiversity. These all are of paramount importance as carbon sinks. Industrial GMO farming creates toxic run-off, kills ocean and river biology; kills all of the living biology of soils- some of the richest soils in the world are here in the US- and insect life including bees. Fish, wildlife and clean water is all close to collapsing. Genetically Modified mono-crops require the elimination of sustainable farming , biodiversity of wild and heritage seeds, and the huge carbon sink which organic farming using manure instead of inorganic fertilizers which have to be mined, created and used in ways that destroy soils biology, pollute water, and release tons of CO2 into the atmosphere by massive mono-crop tillage of dead and dying soils. Soils are self regenerating when livestock is part of organic farming and wisely managed. Well planned organic farming with animal husbandry offsets the CO2 released into the atmosphere in scientifically relevant ways. Massive tillage of soils for genetically modified mono-crops using inorganic fertilizers and herbicides and pesticides contributes to exponential CO2 in the atmosphere with no offset, instead of beneficial farming that is a vital carbon sink.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1512520612000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'the control of and elimination of the real future of our food is drastically at risk in what the authors of this article are advocating', u'effect': u'do some real research'}, {u'cause': u'everything is in the dirt you farm with and that includes using manure and', u'effect': u'why organic farms are the future'}, {u'cause': u'these people used to have healthy diets the rest of the world could benefit and learn from', u'effect': u'it is the saddest thing'}, {u'cause': u'global warming', u'effect': u'much of their poverty and loss of their farms'}], u'author_id': u'17287933', u'id': u'109284162', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'mudsticks', u'text': u'And empower women in their farming, encouraging smaller scale agroecolocical methods that feed their local communities. 70 % of the worlds food is produced on smaller farms .

Bears and lions aren't going to become vegan anytime soon. Nor would I suggest it to one - lest I become THEIR prey.
BQEND
You will not become their prey because I suspect you aren’t going to regularly run into a lion when you’re walking down the street. Let’s say you did, I would not object to you defending yourself. I do value human life above an animals, I just value an animal’s life more than my want to eat their decaying flesh.
As I said above, we have the ability to reason through logic, and we can make the conscious choice to not cause harm or suffering on the industrial scale that currently happens. We should also use our logic to understand that just because an animal kills for food, doesn’t excuse us for doing the same. Animals do a lot of stuff that we simply do not agree with, they rape, they can eat their young, they kill each other. We generally consider this wrong, so why should we use them as our moral benchmark when it comes to killing? It's a convenient excuse to mask suffering for personal desire. The argument for modelling human behaviour on non-human behaviour is unclear to begin with, but if we're going to make it, why shouldn't we choose to follow the example of the hippopotamus, ox or giraffe rather than the shark, cheetah or bear? Why not compare ourselves to crows and eat raw carrion by the side of the road? Why not compare ourselves to dung beetles and eat little balls of dried faeces? Because it turns out humans really are a special case in the animal kingdom, that's why. So are vultures, goats, elephants and crickets. Each is an individual species with individual needs and capacities for choice. Of course, humans are capable of higher reasoning, but this should only make us more sensitive to the morality of our behaviour toward non-human animals. And while we are capable of killing and eating them, it isn't necessary for our survival.

So plants ARE ""mine to use""?
BQEND
Vegans draw the line at hurting sentient individuals. Plants lack nerves, let alone a central nervous system, and cannot feel pain or respond to circumstances in any deliberate way (not to be confused with the non-conscious reactions they do have). Unlike animals, plants lack the ability or potential to experience pain or have sentient thoughts, so there isn't an ethical issue with eating them.
The words 'live', 'living' and 'alive' have completely different meanings when used to describe plants and animals. A live plant is not conscious and cannot feel pain. A live animal is conscious and can feel pain. Therefore, it's problematic to assert that plants have evolved an as-yet undetectable ability to think and feel but not the ability to do anything with that evolutionary strategy (e.g. running away, etc.). Regardless, each pound of animal flesh requires between four and thirteen pounds of plant matter to produce, depending upon species and conditions. Given that amount of plant death, a belief in the sentience of plants makes a strong pro-vegan argument.
BQSTART
What about people who live in in places that can't support plant-based agriculture?
BQEND
Veganism isn't about being perfect. If I was in a situation wherein I had to eat an animal to survive, I would kill and eat an animal. Fortunately, I'm in a position (like many, maybe even the majority) that I am able to eat a plant based diet. Arguably, even third world countries are heavily plant based due to how cheap plants are compared to meat. I'm hopeful that with newer crop growing techniques, such as vertical farming and hydroponics that this will eliminate people not being to access plant based products. I suspect this is more of an issue with capitalism than anything else but I’m no expert.
BQSTART
What will happen to all the animals if their population isn't reduced?
BQEND
The large majority of individual animals would cease to exist, which is certainly preferable to living a short, brief life of suffering, would you not agree? If something does not exist, it cannot suffer. Let’s not kid ourselves and think we are doing an animal any favours by giving it life, when that life consists of nothing more than captivity, abuse and slaughter.
Regarding the animals alive now, veganism isn’t going to happen overnight. Slowly as demand for animal products decreases, we will breed less and less animals. The majority of animals are bred purely for consumption by humans and have their lives cut significantly shorter than their natural lifespan. Animals from animal agriculture are already being rehomed in animal sanctuaries and this is a good way of caring for and allowing them to live their lives. Unfortunately, a lot of animals cannot survive by themselves due to the way that they have been bred, meaning they can’t walk, pass bodily fluids and some have been mutilated which causes them to have issues eating, drinking or exercising. An example of this is the debeaking of chickens, who have their beaks burnt off so that they don’t peck at each other which they do when they are frustrated in cramped, disease ridden conditions.

BQSTART
What will we do with the animals that have actually died of natural causes?
BQEND
Contrary to some vegans, although I wouldn’t say the majority (I can only speak for myself), I’d have no issues with someone eating an animal that died of natural causes. For me personally, I’d just bury or cremate my cat or dog rather than eat it, so I’d treat any animal the same. 
BQSTART
How will you confront this issue with other animals of prey?
BQEND
Vegans are not against animals dying completely, this is unavoidable. Nature is nature. We stand against the systematic abuse and exploitation of animals for humans, when we clearly do not have to do so. A cat will kill a bird because it is in his nature. He is an obligate carnivore and he requires meat to live. Humans do not. We are omnivores with reasoning and logic and have the individual ability to decide to reduce harm and suffering around us.

Culturally, dog is ate in Asia and there is up roar from westerners. Would you not agree that you are culturally conditioned to accept that one is a loving companion animal and the other deserves to be locked in cages, lying in their own excrement without barely seeing daylight until they are brutally slaughtered?
Animals are intelligent enough for our consideration. If intelligence was a factor in who lives and dies to you, I'd suspect you wouldn't eat someone with a mental disability or a small child, who pigs have been shown to be smarter than. Even if an intellectual or emotional benchmark were justification for killing a sentient being, there is no scientific support for the claim that a capacity for intelligence or emotion equals a capacity for suffering. In fact, there is a great deal of scientific support for just the opposite; that because non-human animals do not possess the ability to contextualise their suffering as humans do, that suffering is much greater.

In fact it’s just the opposite. Reconsidering how we eat offers us hope, and empowers us with choice over what our future planet will look like. And we can ask our local leaders – from city mayors to school district boards to hospital management – to help, by widening our food options. 
We simply need less meat and dairy and more plant-based options in our food system if we’re to reach our climate goals
On Monday and Tuesday, the city of Chicago is hosting a summit for the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy to discuss climate solutions cities can undertake. Strategies to address and lower food’s impact should be front and center. 
 Animal agriculture is choking the Earth, and the longer we turn a blind eye, the more we limit our ability to nourish ourselves, protect waterways and habitats, and pursue other uses of our precious natural resources. Raising livestock for meat, eggs and milk generates 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the second highest source of emissions and greater than all transportation combined. It also uses about 70% of agricultural land, and is one of the leading causes of deforestation, biodiversity loss, and water pollution. 
 On top of this, eating too much meat and dairy is making us sick, greatly increasing our risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, several major cancers (including breast, liver and prostate) and obesity. Diets optimal for human health vary, according to David Katz, of the Yale University Prevention Research Center, “but all of them are made up mostly of whole, wholesome plant foods”.
So what gives? Why can’t we see the forest for the bacon? The truth can be hard to swallow: that we simply need less meat and dairy and more plant-based options in our food system if we’re to reach our climate goals.
This can start with individual action. Five years ago, our family felt hopeless about climate change, and helpless to make meaningful change. But when we connected the dots on animal agriculture’s impact on the environment, coupled with the truth about nutrition, we took heart because it gave us something we could actually do.
To create change at the scale needed, this will take more than individual choice – we need to get climate leaders on board about the impact of food. Cities and counties have used their buying power to transition fleets from diesel to electric, and we need to do the same with how we purchase food. We have done this in our own community, moving the lunch program of Muse School, in Calabasas, California, and the Avatar movie set to plant-based menus. Scaling up initiatives like these can make a big difference: if the US reduced meat consumption by 50%, it’s the equivalent of taking 26 million cars off the road. We think that’s damn hopeful.
 Decision-makers on all levels can make it easier for us to eat better, by expanding access to food options that are good for our health, affordable, and climate-friendly. Nationwide, cities and school districts have adopted food purchasing policies that include environment, health and fair labor standards. The city of Chicago is a recent adopter of this Good Food Purchasing Program, and so the solutions-focus of the summit is the perfect place to discuss how food can move us toward climate goals. In the same breath that we discuss fossil fuels, we should be talking animal ag, or we’re missing a big part of the problem – and a big part of the solution.
 Yes, food is inherently personal. It’s the cornerstone of holidays, it fuels high school athletes and long workdays, and it nourishes nursing mothers and growing children. And yes, Americans love meat and cheese. But more than that, we love our majestic national parks, family beach vacations and clean air and water for our children and grandchildren. 
As individuals, we can make choices on how to better nourish our families, and as citizens, we can encourage local leaders to make choices that will allow us to enjoy our land and natural resources now and in the future.

The seas are a vital part of the global ecosystem, leaving the future of all life on Earth dependent on humanity’s actions, he says.
Attenborough will issue the warning in the final episode of the Blue Planet 2 series, which details the damage being wreaked in seas around the globe by climate change, plastic pollution, overfishing and even noise. 
Previous BBC nature series presented by Attenborough have sometimes been criticised for treading too lightly around humanity’s damage to the planet. But the final episode of the latest series is entirely dedicated to the issue.
“For years we thought the oceans were so vast and the inhabitants so infinitely numerous that nothing we could do could have an effect upon them. But now we know that was wrong,” says Attenborough. “It is now clear our actions are having a significant impact on the world’s oceans. [They] are under threat now as never before in human history. Many people believe the oceans have reached a crisis point.”
Attenborough says: “Surely we have a responsibility to care for our blue planet. The future of humanity, and indeed all life on Earth, now depends on us.”
BBC executives were reportedly concerned about the series appearing to become politicised and ordered a fact-check, which it passed. The series producer, Mark Brownlow, said it was impossible to overlook the harm being caused in the oceans: “We just couldn’t ignore it – it wouldn’t be a truthful portrayal of the world’s oceans. We are not out there to campaign. We are just showing it as it is and it is quite shocking.”
Brownlow said much of the footage shot of albatross chicks being killed by the plastic they mistake for food were too upsetting to broadcast. The programme also filmed on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016, witnessing the worst bleaching event in its history. 
Climate change is causing ocean temperatures to rise, bleaching the corals vital as nurseries for ocean life, and waters are warming rapidly in Antarctica too. Jon Copley, from the University of Southampton and one of many scientists appearing in the final episode, says. “What shocks me about what all the data shows is how fast things are changing here [in Antarctica]. We’re headed into uncharted territory”
Carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning also dissolves in seawater, making it more acidic. Prof Chris Langdon, at the University of Miami, says it is “beyond question” that the problem is manmade. “The shells and the reefs really, truly are dissolving. The reefs could be gone by the end of the century.”
The noise from shipping, tourism, and fossil fuel exploration is also revealed as harming sea life. Steve Simpson, at the University of Exeter, who works on coral reefs in southeast Asia, says: “There is a whole language underwater that we are only just getting a handle on. They use sound to attract a mate, to scare away a predator. You hear pops and grunts and gurgles and snaps.” He shows the noise of motorboats distracting saddleback clownfishes from warning against a predator attack.
The Blue Planet 2 team found plastic everywhere they filmed, even in the most remote locations such as South Georgia island, an important breeding site for wandering albatrosses. There, Lucy Quinn from the British Antarctic Survey says many chicks are killed by plastic fed to them by their parents, including one young bird whose stomach was punctured by a plastic toothpick. 
Overfishing, which remains prevalent around the world, is also addressed. “Every night thousands of miles of fishing lines laden with hooks are set – there is enough, it is said, to wrap twice around the world,” says Attenborough. But the programme also highlights some success stories, such as the revival of sperm whales off Sri Lanka and herring stocks off Norway after bans or restrictions were put in place. 
Attenborough also visits Trinidad, where the conservationist Len Peters has transformed the prospects of the giant leatherback turtles who come to the island to lay their eggs and whose numbers have fallen catastrophically in recent decades. “I grew up in a house where turtle meat was normal,” says Peters. But his work to end turtle hunting and encourage tourism has seen numbers rise from 30-40 to more than 500.
Quinn says the oceans are of vital importance for the whole world: “The oceans provide us with oxygen, they regulate temperature, they provide us with food and energy supplies. It is unthinkable to have a world without a healthy ocean.” 
Daniel Pauly, who leads the Sea Around Us programme at the University of British Columbia in Canada, and was not involved in Blue Planet 2, endorsed its stark conclusion. He said vast, subsidised fishing fleets were scraping the bottom of the barrel and that ocean acidification could be terminal for many species.
Pauly also warned of the dangers of plastic attracting toxic chemicals and then being eaten: “They become poison pills.” Pauly said the question facing humanity now was simple: “Are we going to fight for the oceans or not?”
The final episode of Blue Planet 2 is at 8pm on BBC1 on 10 December in the UK. The full series will then be available online via the iPlayer, including in ultra HD and high dynamic range, the first time the BBC has provided such content.

Timings are being reset too, with egg laying getting earlier in the year, while autumn departures for warmer climes are delayed by up to a month.
The State of the UK’s Birds report for 2017, published on Tuesday, reveals the profound impact of global warming on Britain’s bird life, which is set to become even greater in the future.
Average temperatures in the UK have increased by almost 1C in recent decades and familiar birds like swallows, which migrate to Africa every autumn, have responded by leaving up to four weeks later. Others, such as garden warblers and whitethroats, are also enjoying warmer British weather for longer.
The migratory birds are also arriving and breeding earlier in the spring than in the 1960s. The great tit is a fulltime resident but it is also laying its eggs 11 days earlier than 40 years ago.
The UK’s increasingly warmer and wetter winters have induced some short-distance migratory birds to give up their journeys entirely and remain in the UK. The breeding numbers of blackcaps and chiffchaffs have both more than doubled since 1970.
However, the warmer conditions are posing a serious risk of extinction in the UK for many of the nation’s rarer birds, particularly those found in the north. Among these the dotterel, whimbrel and common scoter have already seen significant population declines.
But while cold-adapted birds suffer, those preferring warmth are taking advantage. Those currently limited to southernmost regions, such as the quail, little egret and hobby, have increased their numbers. Ornithologists expect other species, including the little bittern and zitting cisticola, may colonise the south in coming years as they escape the rising heat in continental Europe.
The State of the UK’s Birds report is produced by the RSPB, British Trust for Ornithology and the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust, together with the UK’s statutory nature conservation bodies including Natural England. Michael Morecroft, at Natural England, said: “Climate change is undoubtedly going to be one of the greatest influences, both positive and negative, on the future status of birds and other biodiversity in England and the UK.”
Morecroft said it was therefore vital that wildlife habitats are both expanded and better protected to help species better survive extreme weather and help them spread to newly suitable areas.
The RSPB’s Daniel Hayhow, the lead author of the report, said: “For some species climate change will provide opportunities to increase and expand provided the right habitat is there, while others will be vulnerable, increasing their risk of extinction as breeding species in the UK.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/05/climate-change-is-radically-reshuffling-uk-bird-species-report-finds

Congratulations, a sterling effort.
First, you would do well to note that I suggested at dramatic reductions in our degree of dependence on fossil fuels rather than saying that its use will be discontinued overnight. 
Second, electric powered heavy machinery already exists. Long distance freight could be more efficiently delivered by electrified rail. Construction equipment capable of fully electric operation already exists, is already more efficient and less expensive to maintain than comparable diesel equipment, and it will progressively be applied to more heavy duty applications. Battery technology is poised to improve by leaps and bounds for uses where drawing power directly from the grid is impractical and alternative liquid fuels are being explored such as producing liquid fuels using artificial photosynthesis ( https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/06/bionic-leaf-turns-sunlight-into-liquid-fuel/ ), not to mention improving fuel cell technology.
The claim that the relatively high energy density of gasoline, diesel, or LNG makes other fuels inherently infeasible is also bizarre. Even considering the present day disadvantages of, say, battery electric technology EVs can still operate much more efficiently than comparable ICE or diesel powered vehicles so the fact they currently require ~800lbs worth of batteries as opposed to ~100lbs of gasoline hardly cosigns them to useless novelty status! The motor is still easily capable of operating about 3 times more efficiently than the best possible ICE so you don't exactly need exact parity between the energy density of gasoline and that of electricity storage tech to make it useful. That's just intellectually lazy bullshit hiding behind claims of ""it's just physics"".

Fraccing uses a relatively small amount of water which is injected into a well for a matter of days over the fifty year life of the well.
Whereas a permeable reservoir producing under water drive, i.e. effectively a river flowing beneath the reservoir, will have that water produced with the oil, or gas, for 24 hours per day, seven days per week, 52 weeks per year, for those same fifty years. A volume of water so much greater as to seemingly be incomprehensible to antipathetics.
Any time coincidence is due to the rise in oil price making more economically attractive the production from higher water-cut wells than happens at times of lower prices.

This PBS news piece based on USGS, Science and other reliable findings makes it even clearer:
BQSTART
The rise in quakes coincides with an increase in drilling activity. Wallace’s house, for instance, sits above the Barnett Shale Formation, a layer of hard black rock that holds the U.S.’s second-largest deposit of natural gas. Between 1998 and 2002 companies started drilling this deposit using hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which involves pumping millions of gallons of water, plus sand and chemicals, into the ground at high pressure to crack the rock and release the gas. As the gas comes up the well so does the fracking fluid, along with volumes of brine so salty it is hazardous. The fluids are pumped back down a different hole drilled far below the shale into porous rock for permanent disposal. As more and more fluid is injected into these wastewater wells, pressure can start to build up on deep geologic faults. Eventually one can slip, causing an earthquake. 
Researchers at the USGS and other institutions have tied earthquake surges in eight states, including Texas, Oklahoma, Ohio, Kansas and Arkansas, to oil and gas operations. Some state regulators have been slow to accept scientists’ findings. Residents have become increasingly angry, and environmental groups have sued. “This is a public safety issue, and there’s been a lot of denial and ignoring of the problem,” says Wallace, who has joined neighbors to push for the shutdown of nearby wastewater wells.

The 19.6m-acre swath of mountains and tundra is publicly owned and ecologically unique. Now, thanks to the Republican tax bill making its way through Congress, a part of the refuge we’ve long fought to protect risks being transferred to the hands of the fossil fuel industry.
History will judge the decision as an egregious error.
This is all for the short-sighted purpose of funding irresponsible tax breaks and subsidizing the oil and gas industry
The Arctic Refuge is long revered by writers and photographers, and iconic among the ecologically unique wildernesses that conservationists have sought to protect since the early 20th century. The Arctic Refuge can never be restored to its original majesty once roads and pipelines are built, wells and drilling pads are dug, and oil is pumped and spilled.
Public research polling shows that a majority of Americans are strongly opposed to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Analysis also shows that the entire premise for opening the refuge to drilling – to raise revenue to help pay for tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest Americans – is unrealistic and will do nothing to offset the projected budget deficit. Nevertheless, senator Lisa Murkowski and other drilling proponents forced this controversial measure through as part of the tax bill, which was approved by the US senate on Friday through a simple majority vote.
The threats to America’s Arctic don’t stop with the refuge. Already, we are in court challenging Donald Trump’s effort to open the Arctic Ocean to drilling after it was protected by Barack Obama. Drilling is also proposed for sensitive wildlife habitat in publicly owned lands of the western Arctic, where Trump also plans to roll back essential safeguards.
The stakes have never been higher. Long-term greenhouse gas emissions associated with extracting and burning estimated Refuge oil reserves would be staggering. Researchers have calculated that in order to successfully limit global average temperatures below a threshold widely regarded as extremely dangerous, all of the Arctic’s untapped oil must remain in the ground.
What’s more is that if all the fossil fuels that have already been leased on public lands and waters were extracted and burned, it would be impossible to avoid these dangerous levels.
Temperatures in the Arctic are increasing nearly twice as fast as the rest of the world, and the rapid changes are beginning to cause hardship for communities that live there. The indigenous Gwich’in people, who depend on the Arctic Refuge, call the area where drilling is proposed – the Coastal Plain – the “sacred place where life begins”. Their diet and culture are intrinsically tied to the porcupine caribou herd, which migrates to the Coastal Plain to give birth and raise its young. Drilling operations would harm the caribou herd, jeopardizing Gwich’in food, security and cultural identity.
This attack on the refuge is nothing less than a sellout of one of our most cherished landscapes to the highest bidder, all for the short-sighted purpose of funding irresponsible tax breaks and subsidizing the oil and gas industry. We will fight hard to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the other public lands and waters in America’s Arctic under threat from oil drilling. We urge Americans across the country to join us.

Any luck with that argument?
It doesn't come easy, but if you reverse engineer the following, it can really assist in shaping your thinking
In the very, very simplest terms, judging the validity of an argument starts centers around this process:
1) Identify the rhetoric (Lines of Argument) from the actual, formal reasons. Separate the persuasive language from the actual claims to truth and fact.
2) Analyze those reasons (claims to truth and fact) by identifying their logic (often in the Implicit Reasons) and evidence.
3) Test and evaluate the logic and evidence; identify logical errors and ask whether the evidence can and has been tested and objectively, repeatedly, factually verified

You know Malcolm wants to tell us what he really thinks, but the muzzle has been placed on his snout.
BQENDThis long relied-upon excuse simply doesn't hold water.
Closer to the truth is that Turnbull has shown himself to be a very poor strategic thinker and tactician and the results are there for all to see.
The only way Turnbull was ever going to steer the LNP away from the rocks they are foundering on would be for him to have stamped his authority before he ever went after the PM position.If he thought wasn't possible to do that, he should have stayed out of that 'game' until his party begged him to take it on - and they would ahem sooner or later.
THEN he could have done what was genuinely necessary for this country - bring back a form of sane conservatism after the most destructive and nihilistic period of 'leadership' and evidence-free policy making in memory (Abbott's).Sadly, very sadly in my view (*), it's abundantly clear to all that Turnbull either sold out himself, his party, and possibly the foreseeable future of the country as a whole, merely to 'take the top job' - OR ""what he really thinks"" was a sham all along.
Whatever the truth may be with respect to Turnbull - what we do know is that his 'coalition' is chock-a-block full of self-aggrandising, self-righteous bullies.You may not like Shorten, but you'd have to admit that his 'team' have fewer fruitcakes and wreckers standing about throwing personal-interest molotov cocktails whenever a chance comes up.
Perhaps get over who's in the 'big chair' and concentrate more on electing some really decent local candidates - that strengthens the overall outlook.
PS: I note you don't even mention The Greens - IF you are genuinely interested in 'say what they mean and mean what they say' - then you might look somewhat kindly in their direction. Thy too 'stumble' in the cut and thrust of negotiation (Certainly don't concur with much of they voting record), but... worth a look if veritas is genuinely what you seek.

Martin Parkinson was sacked by Abbott from the Treasury department after he came to power in 2013, alongside a handful of other departmental heads. He was brought back to the public service by Turnbull to be secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet. 
In a wide-ranging interview with the Policy Shop podcast, hosted by Glyn Davis, the vice-chancellor of the University of Melbourne, Parkinson says the brutal treatment he experienced had a broader impact.
He says Abbott could have achieved the same outcome he wanted to achieve “far more subtly if people had stopped to think about it, and without the damage I think it did to the public service because there were instances after that happened of senior colleagues reporting their staff saying, well I’m not going to put my hand up for a controversial role because this is what happens”.
“You follow on the democratically elected, legally mandated directions of the government of the day and you get sacked as a result.”
From the tail end of the Howard government, through the Rudd and Gillard periods, Parkinson was prominent in bureaucratic efforts to implement an emissions trading scheme, setting up a climate change department, before returning to the Treasury.
Abbott, who was part of the Howard government at the time the then prime minister supported emissions trading, later campaigned vociferously against the so-called carbon “tax”, which was not a tax but a carbon price with a fixed period.
Abbott sacked Parkinson after winning the 2013 election, against the advice of senior Liberals, but Parkinson was asked to stay on in Treasury on an interim basis, serving for a further 15 months.
He says in the interview he had a “perfectly professional” and “very open and honest” relationship with Abbott, who listened to his advice, sometimes agreeing and sometimes disagreeing. “You couldn’t ask for anything more.”
Parkinson said the damage Abbott had caused by the sacking had been subsequently “ameliorated, but there’s no question that for the service as a whole, I think it came as quite a shock”.
The departmental head also reflected in the conversation with Davis about the breakdown in consensus over carbon pricing which has plunged the Australian parliament into a decade-long deadlock over climate policy.
Parkinson describes “almost a conspiracy of silence between the true believers of climate change and the true deniers of climate change”.
“The true believers did not want to talk about adaptation because they felt that that would take away from a focus on mitigation, and the true deniers didn’t want to talk about adaptation because to do so you would have to talk about the fact that climate change was real,” he says.
“So the debate became one around the merits of a particular approach to mitigation which was an emissions trading scheme.”
Parkinson says the global financial crisis prompted a shift in the position of the business community to carbon pricing. “Suddenly a lot of people in the business community who had been supportive of action on climate change, found themselves in a much more existential situation of trying to save their businesses ... In that environment, they were much more focused on that than on supporting action around climate change.
He also reflected on the disruption technology has caused to the media cycle, and how that has affected the public policy debate.
Parkinson says in the 1980s journalists had more time to write longer, more analytical pieces about policy debates, which helped inform public debates but “if you look around now, the journalists don’t have the opportunity, they don’t have the time to do those thoughtful pieces”.
He says the media cycle is focused on “gotcha” moments and sensationalising routine internal processes. “You begin to try and have a conversation with stakeholders about an issue and all of a sudden the social media campaigns are running either for or against the policy option.”
Parkinson says stakeholders now take definitive positions on policy before it is finalised, and the tempo has increased as a consequence “and that makes it much, much harder to do this sort of thoughtful, careful analysis and policy design that in the past we were able to do”.
“Now it doesn’t mean it can’t be done, but it means we have to do it in different ways,” he says. “We have to find different groups of trusted interlocutors. We have to find different vehicles in which we can engage.
“I’m not sure that we’ve quite found our equilibrium yet. I think it’s still a work in progress.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/06/turnbulls-department-head-says-tony-abbott-damaged-public-service

The advertising was published in the form of a Facebook post that used testimonials from real customers to extol the virtues of the BMW i3. That model is unusual among electric vehicles, as in addition to the electric drive, it also has a small petrol engine. However, unlike “hybrid” cars, which have a petrol-driven engine that can take over from the electric system when it runs out of charge, on longer journeys or at higher speeds, the i3’s petrol engine is only used to maintain the charge on the electric drive.
In the Facebook ad the car was described as “a clean car and helps to give back to the environment”. A complainant suggested that the presence of a petrol engine meant this statement was incorrect.
BMW argued that the nature of the petrol engine, in maintaining charge for the electric engine rather than taking over from it when needed, meant its description – which came from a user – was accurate. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) took a different view, saying that the petrol engine had an emissions value that could be quantified, and has ordered the advertisement to be withdrawn.
The ASA said: “We told BMW to ensure that in future they made clear their environmental claims related to the all-electric vehicles only and not to make environmental claims about their products unless they held sufficient substantiation.”
BMW did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said it did not comment on individual cases, and declined to comment on the broader issues of how “clean” cars can be defined.
The question of what constitutes “clean” driving is a vexed one. Electric vehicles produce no emissions at the point of use, but the power they consume does produce greenhouse gases if it comes from fossil fuels, such as coal or gas-fired power stations. This means even the cleanest electric vehicle can only have as little impact on the environment as the electricity grid from which it is powered.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/06/bmw-electric-car-ad-banned-over-misleading-clean-car-claims

BQSTART
However, some anthropogenic warming is estimated to have already occurred by 1850 (Hegerl et al. 2007; Schurer et al. 2013; Abram et al. 2016) as greenhouse gas concentrations had started increasing around a century earlier (Fig. 1). On the other hand, the 1880s and 1890s were cooler than the preceding decades because of the radiative impact of aerosols from several volcanic eruptions (Fig. 1), which may have compensated for the earlier anthropogenic influence. It is therefore plausible that a “true” preindustrial temperature could be warmer or cooler than 1850–1900, depending on the balance of these two factors. A key question which we will consider is how representative the 1850–1900 period is for preindustrial global average temperature.

BQENDWell, the obvious answer is that you have two alternatives.
Either you get elected as World President, or alternatively you do some sort of takeover as World Dictator. You can then try to impose your view on others.
In the meantime, thanks for your opinion. It is noted. We will actually decide what to do based on a much more balanced view of the competing priorities. And if you don't know what they are, then I suggest that you take some time to find out.

You are nowhere near as wrong as Anteaus, but you are still wrong.
Greenhouses retain their heat by preventing convection.

BQSTART
But even without changes in external forcing, the climate may vary naturally, because, in a system of components with very different response times and non-linear interactions, the components are never in equilibrium and are constantly varying. ... Many processes and interactions in the climate system are non-linear. That means that there is no simple proportional relation between cause and effect. A complex, non-linear system may display what is technically called chaotic behaviour. This means that the behaviour of the system is critically dependent on very small changes of the initial conditions. ... Climate varies naturally on all time-scales.

The following are the answers to the questions about the ""blade"" (or ""uptick"", as they put it) made by the authors of the paper.
BQSTART
Q: What do paleotemperature reconstructions show about the temperature of the last 100 years? 
A: Our global paleotemperature reconstruction includes a so-called “uptick” in temperatures during the 20th-century. However, in the paper we make the point that this particular feature is of shorter duration than the inherent smoothing in our statistical averaging procedure, and that it is based on only a few available paleo-reconstructions of the type we used. Thus, the 20th century portion of our paleotemperature stack is not statistically robust, cannot be considered representative of global temperature changes, and therefore is not the basis of any of our conclusions.
...
Q: Is the rate of global temperature rise over the last 100 years faster than at any time during the past 11,300 years?

You will have to quantify and specify. When we know the actual issues you are concerned with we can examine their liklihoods.
But it has to be remembered, there are many more demands on the world that simply acting on climate change. We have 7.5 billion people who need clothing, food, shelter and where we can development. We have to balance risks of climate with risks in terms of development and stability. This is an incredibly heavy burden on all who accept it.

It is vitally important that we convey this tail risk as well as the most probable outcomes. 
But there are strong cultural biases running against any discussion of this kind of tail risk, at least in the realm of climate science. The legitimate fear that the public will interpret any discussion whatsoever of tail risk as a deliberate attempt to scare people into action, or to achieve some other ulterior or nefarious goal, is enough to make almost all scientists shy away from any talk of tail risk and stick to the safe high ground of the middle of the probability distribution.
The accusation of “alarmism” is quite effective in making scientists skittish in conveying tail risk, and talking about the tail of the distribution is a sure recipe to be so labelled.

It is clearly written – an authoritative summary of the science, and easy to understand.
The first main chapter deals with changes to the climate and focuses much attention on global temperatures. When most people think of climate change, they think of the global temperature – specifically the temperature of the air a few meters above the Earth surface. There are other (better) ways to measure climate change such as heat absorbed by the oceans, melting ice, sea level rise, or others. But the iconic measurement most people think of are these air temperatures, shown in the top frame of the figure below.
The top chart is shown as a temperature “anomaly,” which means a departure from normal. Right now the anomaly is nearly 2°F, meaning that we have warmed 2°F from what the normal temperature should be. The graph shows four datasets, so it doesn’t matter whose temperature data we use; the results are the same. Global land-air temperatures have been rising pretty steadily since approximately 1960.
The next graph shows ocean surface temperatures. They too are rising and have been increasing for a number of decades. Sea surface temperatures are determined from satellites, from sensors on ships, and from floating instruments spread across the ocean. Over the decades, we have obtained better coverage of the ocean. Decisions are made from different research teams on how to combine measurements from different instruments and how to interpolate between measurement locations. But regardless of the decisions made, we see the temperatures rise.
The third graph shows sea level. It has been rising for more than a century. Sea level rise is a favorite measurement for scientists because it integrates the heat added to the Earth’s climate. The heat ends up in the ocean waters and causes the waters to become less dense. The lower density of water causes much of the sea level rise in the graph.
The center two images in the lower rows respectively show the amount of heat in the ocean and changes to Arctic ice. We see that ocean heat content is increasing and the amount of ice is decreasing. The lower right image represents the mass of the world’s glaciers. The decrease in glacier mass as glaciers warm, melt, and flow to the oceans is shockingly fast.
Take some time to think about these climate signals. The figure shows nine different measurements, and all of them are consistent with a warming climate. So, next time someone tries to argue that we don’t really know if climate change is occurring, just remind them that all the signals show a global warming. 
With all nine of these signals, we don’t really need to just focus on the surface temperatures in the top frame. I don’t prefer surface temperatures because is they’re noisy. Some years they go up, other years down. You can’t just use one hot year to prove the world is warming, or one cold year to prove that it is cooling. If you insist on using surface temperatures, it is better to look at long-term trends, or decadal temperature trends. There is a clear steady rise in the decade-by-decade trend.
These data from the USGCRP report are roadmaps. They show where we have been. They only give a suggestion about what will come in the future. With this in mind, all we can say is the world is changing and all the changes we observe are consistent with a warming world. A common sense view would help us understand that if we don’t change course, these trends will continue. But just by looking backwards in time, it is hard to predict where we will be in five or ten decades.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/dec/06/us-government-report-finds-steady-and-persistent-global-warming

I'll say it again. Atmospheric water vapour content is determined by temperature. A rise in temperature results in increased water vapour. Nowhere did I say that CO2 is the only thing that can do this - only that the other things that can are not doing so at present.
It follows that you are wrong when you say water vapour ""can operate independently"". It is a greenhouse gas and hence will cause warming if its atmospheric content increases. But, as we have seen, it can only increase if something else causes a temperature rise first. And that is what our CO2 emissions are doing at present.

And here is a much more recent study not included in my link...
BQSTART
The first assumption assigns low probability to ice dynamic mass loss in regions of slow flow, giving a mean dynamic trend of 17 ± 10 Gt yr−1 and a total mass imbalance of 57 ± 20 Gt yr−1. The second assumption considers a long-term dynamic thickening hypothesis and an a priori solution for surface mass balance from a regional climate model. The latter results in estimates 3 to 5 times larger for the ice dynamic trends but similar total mass imbalance. In both cases, gains in East Antarctica are smaller than losses in West Antarctica.

To address this question, a team of scientists led by the University of Bristol and including the University of Wollongong, Australia have studied the problem by combining different satellite observations within a statistical model that is able to separate the processes related to ice mass changes over the continent. 
Professor Jonathan Bamber from the Bristol Glaciology Centre which is part of the School of Geographical Sciences, said: ""We used similar data sets to the NASA team but added other satellite data from a mission called the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) to help solve for mass gains and losses. ""We then conducted different experiments, using similar assumptions made in the NASA study but found that in every experiment, mass loss from the west always exceeded gains in the east.""
The researchers concluded that over the study period, 2003-2013, Antarctica, as a whole, has been contributing to sea level rise and that the gains in East Antarctica were around three times smaller than suggested in the 2015 study.

Here is a recent quote from another blog site which interviewed her:
""Susan Crockford, a Canadian zoologist and regular contributor to the conservative-run think tank The Heartland Institute, told Motherboard at a recent conference in Washington, DC that polar bears are actually ""doing better"" than they were 50 years ago.
The disappearing summer sea ice in the Arctic that worries ecologists, she said, ""really doesn't matter to [polar bears]. Because they've got a lot less [ice] than they've had since 1979, and a lot of bears are doing better,"" she said.

The findings do not mean that Antarctica is not in trouble, Zwally notes. “I know some of the climate deniers will jump on this, and say this means we don’t have to worry as much as some people have been making out,” he says. “It should not take away from the concern about climate warming.” As global temperatures rise, Antarctica is expected to contribute more to sea-level rise,though when exactly that effect will kick in, and to what extent, remains unclear.

Shepherd et al 2012... http://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6111/1183 We find that there is good agreement between different satellite methods—especially in Greenland and West Antarctica—and that combining satellite data sets leads to greater certainty. Between 1992 and 2011, the ice sheets of Greenland, East Antarctica, West Antarctica, and the Antarctic Peninsula changed in mass by –142 ± 49, +14 ± 43, –65 ± 26, and –20 ± 14 gigatonnes year−1, respectively. 
Barletta et al 2013https://www.the-cryosphere.net/7/1411/2013/tc-7-1411-2013.htmlFor the whole GRACE period (2003–2011) our trend estimate for Greenland is −234 ± 20 Gt yr−1 and −83 ± 36 Gt yr−1 for Antarctica (−111 ± 15 Gt yr−1 in the western part). We also find a clear (with respect to our errors) increase of mass loss in the last four years.

Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. Limiting climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together with adaptation, can limit climate change risks.

And the media is to blame | Lisa Hymas,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/07/climate-change-media-coverage-media-matters,0,"Which story did you hear more about this year – how climate change makes disasters like hurricanes worse, or how Donald Trump threw paper towels at Puerto Ricans?
If you answered the latter, you have plenty of company. Academic Jennifer Good analyzed two weeks of hurricane coverage during the height of hurricane season on eight major TV networks, and found that about 60% of the stories included the word Trump, and only about 5% mentioned climate change.
Trump doesn’t just suck the oxygen out of the room; he sucks the carbon dioxide out of the national dialogue. Even in a year when we’ve had string of hurricanes, heatwaves, and wildfires worthy of the Book of Revelation – just what climate scientists have told us to expect – the effect of climate change on extreme weather has been dramatically undercovered. Some of Trump’s tweets generate more national coverage than devastating disasters.
Good’s analysis lines up with research done by my organization, Media Matters for America, which found that TV news outlets gave far too little coverage to the well-documented links between climate change and hurricanes. ABC and NBC both completely failed to bring up climate change during their news coverage of Harvey, a storm that caused the heaviest rainfall ever recorded in the continental US. When Irma hit soon after, breaking the record for hurricane intensity, ABC didn’t do much better.
Coverage was even worse of Hurricane Maria, the third hurricane to make landfall in the US this year. Not only did media outlets largely fail to cover the climate connection; in many cases, they largely failed to cover the hurricane itself. 
The weekend after Maria slammed into Puerto Rico, the five major Sunday political talkshows devoted less than one minute in total to the storm and the humanitarian emergency it triggered. And Maria got only about a third as many mentions in major print and online media outlets as did Harvey and Irma, researchers at the MIT Media Lab found.
The media has a responsibility to report the big story, and to help the public understand the immediacy of the threat
When Trump visited Puerto Rico on 3 October, almost two weeks after Maria assailed the island, he got wall-to-wall coverage as journalists reported on his paper-towel toss and other egregious missteps. But after that trip, prime-time cable news coverage of Puerto Rico’s recovery plummeted, Media Matters found, even though many residents to this day suffer from electricity outages and a lack of clean water, a dire situation that deserves serious and sustained coverage.
Scientists have been telling us that climate change will make hurricanes more intense and dangerous, an unfortunate reality made all too clear by this year’s record-busting hurricane season. “These are precisely the sort of things we expect to happen as we continue to warm the planet,” climate scientist Michael Mann, a distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Penn State, told Huffington Post.
But while nearly three-quarters of Americans know that most scientists are in agreement that climate change is happening, according to recent poll, only 42% of Americans believe climate change will pose a serious threat to them during their lifetimes. Too many still believe – wrongly – that climate disasters are just something that will happen in the future. They are happening now. 
In the first nine months of 2017, the US was assailed by 15 weather and climate disasters that each did more than a billion dollars in damage – in the case of the hurricanes, much more. The combined economic hit from Harvey, Irma and Maria could end up being $200bn or more, according to Moody’s Analytics. And then in October, unprecedented wildfires in northern California did an estimated $3bn in damage. 
Climate change can be hard to see and intuitively grasp. It’s a relatively slow-moving scientific phenomenon caused by pollution from all around the globe. It’s not usually dramatic to watch like a candidate debate or the fallout from a White House scandal.
But an extreme weather event is a moment when people can see and feel climate change – and if they’re unlucky, get seriously hurt by it. When those disasters happen, media outlets need to cover them as climate change stories. And when a number of them happen in quick succession, as they did this year, the media have an even greater responsibility to report the big-picture story about climate change and help the public understand the immediacy of the threat. 
If we are to fend off the worst possible outcomes of climate change, we need to shift as quickly as possible to a cleaner energy system. We could expect more Americans to get on board with that solution if they more fully understood the problem – and that’s where the critical role of the media comes in. As the weather gets worse, we need our journalism to get better.

The extent of area burned by wildfires each year appears to have increased since the 1980s. According to National Interagency Fire Center data, of the 10 years with the largest acreage burned, nine have occurred since 2000, including the peak year in 2015 (see Figure 2). This period coincides with many of the warmest years on record nationwide (see the U.S. and Global Temperature indicator).

Although numerous factors aided the recent rise in fire activity, observed warming and drying have significantly increased fire-season fuel aridity, fostering a more favorable fire environment across forested systems. We demonstrate that human-caused climate change caused over half of the documented increases in fuel aridity since the 1970s and doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984. This analysis suggests that anthropogenic climate change will continue to chronically enhance the potential for western US forest fire activity while fuels are not limiting.  http://m.pnas.org/content/113/42/11770.abstract

We were told that most, if not all, aboriginal life in the Western Hemisphere got here over a long-lost ice bridge between Asia and the Americas.

Very high CO2 levels were produced around 5 million years ago in an event called the PETM, when lots of sequestered carbon became released - there are a number of processes being suggested for that.
After that, CO2 levels very slowly reduced over tens of millions of years.
CO2 in rain makes a weak acid, which causes chemical weathering of rocks.
In the case of those tens of millions of years, the weathering was particularly happening to the rocks of the rising Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau.
Rivers carry the carbon compounds down to the oceans, where various processes (such as the formation of calcareous shells by organisms) eventually deposit the material on the ocean floor.
This is the long, slow, part of the carbon cycle:
""Surface uplift of Tibet and Cenozoic global cooling"" - Garzione 2008
It took around 20 million years for CO2 levels to fall sufficiently for glaciation to begin in Antarctica, at the Eocene-Oligocene transition.
Of course, if we burn all the fossil fuels we've already located, we'd create enough CO2 to reverse that process, and eventually Antarctica would be ice-free.
There's a scientific paper on that - ""Combustion of available fossil fuel resources sufficient to eliminate the Antarctic Ice Sheet"" - Winkelmann et al 2015.

CO2 has been falling for tens of millions of year. So one really have to ponder the entire geological history of Earth - and the subsequent history of evolution to understand these trends. 
You even have to ponder the evolution of the Sun to get things right. We are talking about changes taking millions of years. 
People - no - a global shared system of shared information has and is spending life-times of work to get these things approximately right.

My hometown is climate change's latest victim | Steven Thrasher,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/08/fire-raging-ventura-county-climate-change-victims,0,"An unbearable amount of Ventura county in southern California, where I was born and raised, is simply gone. And as I hear about site after site from my childhood simply disappearing into scorched earth, I am realizing that climate change is not only erasing the present, it is also destroying the physical touchstones to my own past.
Victim to hot temperatures and high winds, some 90,000 acres have burned, hundreds of structures have been destroyed, and tens of thousands of people have been evacuated or lost power in Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. 
But it is coastal Ventura, where I was born, that has driven home so personally what climate change looks like. 
I was, of course, relieved that my relatives were all accounted for, and that my brother, sister-in-law and nephew evacuated safely on Monday night. (Their house survived, though the fire came just a couple of blocks from it.) My sister, north of Santa Barbara, has been taking in friends and family who have evacuated. 
But it is heartbreaking to see the photos of the aftermath and to take stock of all that has been lost – both the things that can be be replaced, and the things that can’t. 
Hundreds of schools in Oxnard, Ventura, and Los Angeles have been closed all week. This massive loss of education time – not to mention the economic precariousness for families deprived of childcare – is yet another impact of climate change.
When I was trying (in vain) to fall asleep on Wednesday night, I read journalist John Sepulvado’s tweets from Ojai, in which he said he was “able to separate my emotions from the story until I hear a coyote wail in pain or see cats scurry. Meanwhile, sirens ring and ash falls.” 
I found myself thinking about the fire jumping rural Highway 33, where I learned to drive, and thought about the bird-filled cages of an old sanctuary I visited just off that road in my youth. And about those howling coyotes. And of all the horses stabled out that way. 
I'm able to separate my emotions from the story until I hear a coyote wail in pain or see cats scurry. Meanwhile, sirens ring and ash falls
I wondered if these animals were escaping, or if they were being cooked alive. 
They, too, are the victims of climate change. 
I am hearing from friends and family that the air is simply too bad to do much of anything physical outdoors. And yet, I saw that photo of farmworkers out in the fields, still doing the work while breathing air which will make them sick. Strawberry fields are toxic worksites filled with deadly chemicals even when they are not on fire. 
I am terribly worried about the economic suffering these fires are causing. An entire apartment complex destroyed in Ventura contained some of the only affordable housing in the city: will what replaces it also be made affordable and available to the displaced, or will disaster capitalism replace it with multimillion-dollar condos? 
I think people look at Ventura County – and, noting it sits on the Pacific Ocean between Malibu to the south and Santa Barbara County to the north – think it is a rich place. It is not. There are a lot of poor people in Ventura County, many of whom work at one of its two military bases, in agriculture, or in service jobs. 
But while the wages for many of these jobs are low, housing is very expensive. Some of the apartments and homes lost were rental units occupied by poor people who likely didn’t have insurance and will have lost everything, and will have no other affordable housing options in the county.
They, too, are victims of climate change. And while Ventura County residents are coming together to help each other, the increasingly cruel federal government is neither providing an adequate response to climate change nor an adequate social safety net even in the best of times.
In 2012, I got to see what climate change looked like wet, when the city of my adult life, New York, was deluged by Hurricane Sandy. But at least I got to help a bit with recovery efforts. 
Five years later, I am watching powerlessly from afar a very different manifestation of climate change – one that is made worse by a terrible lack of water in my hometown. 
They’re two side of our climate crisis, and neither is pretty. ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/08/fire-raging-ventura-county-climate-change-victims

But a combination of short and longer-term events have conspired to spark a ring of fires that have dotted the LA region, spearheaded by the 96,000-acre Thomas fire that looms over the city of Ventura.
More than 200,000 people in the potential path of fire have been told to evacuate, with more than 300 homes and other buildings already destroyed, hundreds of schools shut down and the 101 freeway closed off. The singer Lionel Ritchie had to cancel a concert to help family members flee the flames. Plumes of smoke have extended more than 1,000 miles into the Pacific. 
So why are such unusually strong fires plaguing southern California?
Before the current spate of fires, Cal Fire had already called 2017 a “very difficult and trying year” for the state, most notably marked by the fires that tore through Napa Valley in October, killing 22 people and damaging more than 5,600 buildings.
Unseasonably warm weather in southern California – April until September was the warmest on record – combined with extremely sparse rainfall in the Los Angeles area to create prime wildfire conditions. The dry Santa Ana winds, reaching 70mph in places, have helped spread the flames at an extraordinary rate – the Thomas fire grew at around an acre per second as it developed and is still nowhere near contained.
The seeds of the current fires were planted nearly a year ago when a warm weather system flowed in from Hawaii and deluged much of California in weeks of rain, breaking the hold of the state’s worst drought on record.
The rains mainly came in the north of the state, replenishing key reservoirs, but the south also had a very wet winter. This spurred growth of combustible shrubs and trees that then became kindling dry during a warm summer and autumn – three weather stations surrounding LA recorded their hottest ever November.
This created plenty of fuel for the fires. Natural forces aren’t causing more wildfires to initially spark – the vast majority of fires are started deliberately or inadvertently by humans – but once they take hold they have plenty to nourish them. 
The exact role of climate change upon 2017 wildfires in California is still the subject of some discussion among scientists. But it’s clear that this year, nationally, has been a big one for fire – more than 9.2m acres have burned so far in 2017, already far in excess of the 6m acre average established over the past decade. About half a million acres in California have combusted.
The national bill for wildfire damage in 2017 stands at around $10bn and it’s likely that the threat to property, as well as life, will grow in the future due to climate change. The fire season has lengthened and caused increasing amounts of land to be chewed up in recent decades. A study published last year found that the total area burned in the western US over the past 33 years was double the size it would have been without any human-caused warming.
The warming temperatures dry out vegetation that then becomes more flammable. And once large areas burn, they release carbon that feeds further warming. With huge mega droughts expected in the future in California, huge fires could well accompany the hanging of tinsel and arrival of Santa Claus on a regular basis for people in the state in the decades ahead.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/07/why-are-ferocious-wildfires-plaguing-southern-california

The scene was recorded by the conservation group Sea Legacy during a late summer expedition in Baffin Island. “My entire Sea Legacy team was pushing through their tears and emotions while documenting this dying polar bear,” photographer Paul Nicklen wrote on social media after publishing the footage this week. 
The video shows the bear struggling to walk as it searches for food. The bear eventually comes across a trashcan used by Inuit fishermen, rummaging through it with little luck.
The bear, which was not old, probably died within hours of being captured on video, said Nicklen. “This is what starvation looks like. The muscles atrophy. No energy. It’s a slow, painful death.” 
The film-makers drew a direct line between the bear’s state and climate change. “As temperatures rise and sea ice melts, polar bears lose access to the main staple of their diets – seals,” the video noted. “Starving, and running out of energy, they are forced to wander into human settlements for any source of food.”
The association echoed a 2015 study from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature that ranked climate change as the single most important threat to the world’s 26,000 polar bears. Researchers – who described the bears as the canary in the coal mine – found a high probability that the population would decrease 30% by 2050 due to the changes in their sea ice habitat. 
As climate change boosts Arctic temperatures, sea ice – crucial to the bears for hunting, resting and breeding – is melting earlier in spring and refreezing later in autumn. The growing number of ice-free days could push the species past a tipping point with widespread reproductive failure and starvation in some areas, the report noted.
Satellite data published last year revealed that the number of ice-covered days across the 19 Arctic regions inhabited by polar bears declined at a rate of seven to 19 days per decade between 1979 to 2014. 
Since posting the footage, Nicklen has been asked why he and his team did not help the bear. “Of course, that crossed my mind,” he told National Geographic. “But it’s not like I walk around with a tranquilizer gun or 400 pounds of seal meat.” Feeding polar bears is also illegal in Canada.

No they haven't. All you have seen is normal predation, which all species have evolved to cope with. No predator can affect the overall numbers of any prey in a normal ecosystem.

My mother and I were visiting Brownsea Island, off the Dorset coast. We entered a dark hide, opened the window and looked out across the lagoon. And there – shining like a beacon – was a Persil-white apparition: my first little egret.
Back then, this ghostly member of the heron family was a very rare visitor to Britain. Nowadays, little egrets are so numerous that we hardly give them a second glance. On my local patch, the Avalon Marshes in the heart of Somerset, I have seen up to 60 in a single feeding flock. And, according to the magazine British Birds, there are now more than 1,000 breeding pairs, as far north as the Scottish border.
As it turned out, that little egret was a trailblazer for a host of other herons to cross the Channel and establish themselves as British breeding birds. Today, no fewer than seven species breed within a short cycle ride of my home. They include great white and cattle egrets (the ones we usually see in nature films in Africa, perched on the backs of buffaloes), little bittern, and the latest arrival, the nocturnal night heron, which nested in Britain for the first time in recorded history last year. I also regularly see glossy ibises, while the odd white stork has recently turned up. Both are, like the egrets, visitors from continental Europe. None of these species was here when we moved to Somerset a decade ago.
To put this in perspective, when I saw my first little egret, there were only two species of heron breeding in Britain: the familiar grey heron and the impossibly elusive bittern. Now bitterns are so common that my son George has managed to video them on his smartphone. Part of their success is down to the creation of swaths of wetland habitat on the Avalon Marshes, which this year deservedly won the national lottery award for the best environment project.
But the factor that brought most of these species here is undoubtedly climate change, which is altering our birdlife at a faster rate than at any time in recorded history. For along with those herons and egrets, we are also seeing black-winged stilts, hoopoes and even bee-eaters, a species usually associated with the Mediterranean, yet which has nested in Britain several times during the past decade.
These new arrivals are one of the headline messages in the latest report from the RSPB, The State of the UK’s Birds 2017. And there’s no doubt that the colonisation of so many new species is good news – especially for the growing army of birders who flock to the Somerset Levels. Indeed they have proved such a big attraction that I am now running guided tours.
It’s not just these newcomers that are benefiting from a warmer climate. Earlier springs have encouraged a host of resident species to begin nesting several weeks ahead of schedule. For birds such as the blackbird and robin, which can raise two or more broods of chicks in a good year, this early start can be a real advantage.
But for migrant birds, many of which travel here each spring from sub-Saharan Africa to raise a family, the picture is a lot more complicated. Again, some appear to be responding to change: observations made by keen amateur birders for the British Trust for Ornithology show that swallows now arrive in spring roughly two weeks earlier than they used to in the 1960s – clearly in reaction to a warming world.
Yet as the RSPB report notes, there are major downsides to climate change. Numbers of several species clinging on as British breeding birds are falling rapidly. These include the dotterel, a rare example of a bird where the female takes the upper hand in courtship; the whimbrel, a smaller cousin of the curlew; and the Slavonian grebe, now confined as a breeding bird to a handful of Scottish lochs.
Even the chiffchaff and blackcap, whose numbers have more than doubled since 1970, may struggle to cope if predictions of more extreme warming come to pass.
The eminent German scientist Peter Berthold, who has made a lifelong study of migrating birds, once suggested that the first stages of global warming would lead to a “honeymoon period”, during which migrants will benefit from earlier springs and the greater availability of insect food.
But if temperatures continue to rise inexorably, Berthold has predicted that the resulting droughts, habitat changes and food shortages are likely to bring major population crashes. That is especially true if, as seems highly likely, the Sahara desert – the major obstacle all long-distance migrants need to overcome on their twice-annual journeys – continues to expand.
One of the biggest issues facing both migrants and breeding birds is what scientists call “asynchronous response”. This occurs when different species react to the same change in conditions in different ways. For example, oak moth caterpillars, on which both resident great tits and migrant pied flycatchers feed their chicks, are appearing earlier and earlier each spring.
Great tits are already responding to this change by shifting their own breeding cycle earlier too. But for pied flycatchers, which spend the winter in west Africa, deciding when to head north to breed is usually governed by subtle shifts in day length around the spring equinox.
The likelihood that they will be able to bring forward their departure from Africa and arrival in Britain, so that the hatching of their chicks coincides with the earlier peak of caterpillar availability, is a long shot, to say the least.
Meanwhile, while we may be excited by exotic new species in the south, the picture is a lot less rosy farther north. The RSPB report paints a bleak picture for Scotland, home to the southernmost breeding populations of species normally found in the Arctic.
The snow buntings and ptarmigans nesting on the high tops of the Cairngorm plateau rely on regular snow to create the specialised ecosystem on which they depend. In a warming world, if that snow disappears, then so will they.
I find this frustrating, because more than 20 years ago, in my first book Birds and Weather, I forecasted many of these changes. It seemed obvious to me that if temperatures rose as rapidly as was then being predicted (and has indeed come to pass), then the consequences for birdlife were going to be serious.
Even so, I never imagined that the changes to both our climate and bird distribution would be so rapid, or so extreme. In only a couple of decades, we have seen new arrivals in the south and population declines in the north, together with the continued loss of many farmland birds, for which global warming may be the final factor that tips them over the edge. So given the speed of change in the past quarter century, what differences in our birdlife can we expect by 2040? Again, I think the story of new colonists in the south and departures in the north will continue. I would not be surprised if there were soon a dozen species of long-legged waterbird, including spoonbills, squacco and purple herons, strutting around the Avalon Marshes.
But even in the south, we are likely to lose some familiar birds, as they move north. The latest BTO Atlas survey, from 2007-11, showed that birds such as the willow warbler – by far our commonest summer visitor – have shifted their ranges north and west, and may soon cease to breed in south-east England.
And for my Scottish friends, the losses are likely to outweigh any gains. While nuthatches have now arrived in southern Scotland, and reed warblers are hot on their heels, this hardly compensates for the imminent loss of those specialist birds of the high tops. Nor does it make up for the potential disappearance of other classic Scottish species, such as the common scoter and black-throated diver.
Most worryingly, if the sand eels on which many seabirds feed their chicks continue to shift northwards to cooler seas, then the spectacular seabird colonies of the Scottish islands – aptly described by veteran conservationist Roy Dennis as “our Serengeti” – may disappear too. That would be a tragedy.
In the end, climate change does far more damage than simply shifting the timing of the seasons and making some locations suitable for new species or unsuitable for existing ones. Its most momentous consequence is the way it changes the very nature of delicately balanced ecosystems.
As temperatures continue to rise, familiar habitats will be transformed out of recognition, so that specialist species, which have evolved to be perfectly suited to their particular home, will not be able to adapt rapidly enough to cope.
Conversely, the species that will do well are generalists, able to adjust their feeding and breeding behaviour in response to higher temperatures. I admire gulls, crows and wood pigeons for their ability to live alongside us; but I don’t want to live in a world where they are the only birds I see.
Back in 1995, I ended Birds and Weather with a sentiment that seems more apt than ever today.
Ultimately, we may find that we are powerless against the combination of pressures we have set in motion. Like passengers on a rollercoaster, we can only hope that the ride will eventually come to an end, and that when it does, we and the birds will have survived.

PTARMIGAN
The toughest British bird, perfectly suited to living all year round on the high tops of the Scottish Highlands, could struggle if the frozen ecosystem on which it depends disappears.
▶ PUFFIN
Warming seas around the British Isles are forcing sand eels, one of the puffin’s main sources of food, farther north and out of the reach of breeding colonies. Breeding productivity has plummeted and a population crash is predicted to follow.
▼ SPOTTED FLYCATCHER
One of our latest migrants to arrive, in mid-May, this aerial acrobat may not be able to cope with earlier springs. By the time it has chicks in late June, the glut of insects that it must catch to feed them will have already gone. 
▲
SNOW BUNTING
Another specialist of the high tops, it breeds in snow-filled corries, where no other small bird can survive. Warmer temperatures could allow lowland species to move up the mountain and compete for food. 
◀
SNOWY OWL
In the late 1960s, a short spell of climatic cooling allowed a pair of snowy owls to colonise the Shetland island of Fetlar. Soon afterwards, the trend towards warmer summers forced this magnificent bird to retreat back north, almost certainly never to return.
CUCKOO
Already suffering a huge decline because of drought in its African winter quarters, and the loss of large moth caterpillars due to intensive farming, it is vulnerable to even greater shifts brought about by climate change.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/10/ptarmigan-squacco-climate-change-british-birdlife-changing

Campaigners said the European Investment Bank, which is expected to support the transadriatic pipeline (TAP) with one of its largest ever loans on Tuesday, was acting against the EU’s climate change commitments.
The bank has been privately urged by the EU’s climate and energy chiefs to approve the loan because the project’s backers “need to urgently secure adequate funding” as they enter a capital-intensive construction phase.
But opponents of the plan said that approving the loan on the second anniversary of the Paris climate deal being agreed would be an affront to Europe’s efforts to curb carbon emissions. 
“The EU, which considers itself a climate action champion, simply cannot afford its financial arm, the EIB, supporting any component of the southern gas corridor,” said Xavier Sol, the director of Counter Balance, an alliance of European NGOs.
The timing is sensitive for Macron, who has convened a special summit in Paris on Tuesday to explore ways of financing projects to tackle climate change.
The TAP is the westernmost section of the southern gas corridor, a series of pipelines transporting gas from the Caspian Sea to Europe.
The Brussels-backed the project nearly a decade ago as a way of reducing the bloc’s reliance on Russia, which is the biggest supplier of the EU’s gas imports.
The names of the energy firms behind the project have changed over the years as companies bought and sold their stakes. Today the pipeline consortium consists of BP, Azerbaijan gas firm Socar, Italy’s Snam, Belgium’ Fluxys, Spain’s Enagás and Switzerland’s Axpo.
Hundreds of miles of land have been cleared in Greece and Albania for the pipeline, and about 2,000 olive trees in Italy are due to be temporarily moved for construction. The project is described as 60% complete, and the hope is for first gas supplies to pass through it in 2020. 
While the size of the EIB loan means it is significant for the project, industry sources claimed that the pipeline’s completion does not hinge on the finance.
Critics have focused not just on the environmental impact of the pipeline, but human rights issues in Azerbaijan, which is producing the gas.
“Granting such loan, especially after Azerbaijan’s membership in the extractive industries transparency initiative had been suspended in March over its government’s continued crackdown on media and civil society, means the EIB is turning a blind eye to gross human rights violations,” said Sol.
One energy expert said that while the criticisms were valid, on balance the project should be supported, because it would bring more competition to Europe’s gas supplies, be a significant job creator and squeeze out dirtier energy sources.
“There is actually room for gas demand growth in south-east Europe, albeit to back out coal and at times fuel oil from power generation, but also in other parts of the energy economy, notably space heating, and industry,” said Dr Tim Boersma, an expert on global natural gas markets at Columbia University.
Boersma said the benefits did not negate human rights issues, but the shared interests that Europe and Azerbaijan would have over gas trade could help dialogue about concerns. He also pointed out that some reports have suggested Russian gas could end up being delivered through the pipeline, which would undermine the effort to diversify supply.
A spokesperson for the TAP said: “There is a strong market rationale for our project. Europe needs new sources of natural gas to meet its long-term demand, fuel economic recovery and diversify energy supply. 
“Gas – as the cleanest fossil fuels – will continue to play a key, strategic role in the energy mix for decades to come. Therefore, we remain confident that TAP will secure external funding for the project.”
The EIB said it could not comment before its board meeting on Tuesday.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/10/eib-accused-eu-climate-goals-gas-pipeline-loan-european-investment-bank-summit-paris

Do you guys actually read the graphs or just trust the headlines? Emissions are well down overall.
The only way to make emissions look higher is to exclude the bit that has reduced significantly. That's whats called selective picking and choosing of data to get the results you want. But it's Fake News.

The first phase of the project took about 2 years.
When BE then reported that their research agreed with other researchers that:

- suddenly the so-called climate sceptic websites rejected BE, and never mention it.
The sceptical scientists, of course, now accepted that their check on other scientists' work had confirmed that the science published on this matter is good science - because those sceptical scientists were real sceptics.
Going back even further, when Exxon got its own scientists to investigate climate change in the 1970s, those scientists found that CO2 from burning fossil fuels was causing global temperatures to rise.

Greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise in recent quarters, with the most recent the second highest for any quarter since 2011, despite electricity emissions being driven down by wind generation.
The government’s official public release of data on emissions is now six months behind and NDEVR Environmental’s estimations attempt to mirror that methodology. Released in partnership with Guardian Australia, the results have proven very accurate when compared with data eventually released by the federal government.
The ever-increasing emissions are taking Australia further from both its carbon-reduction commitments made in Paris and the much bigger reductions demanded by the science-based targets, recommended by the government’s Climate Change Authority.
NDEVR found emissions in the most recent quarter soared to levels only seen once in the past six years.
That came despite massive jumps in wind-generated electricity in Victoria and New South Wales, which more than doubled, pushing down emissions from the National Electricity Market.
But emissions from transport were at record levels, with jumps in the use of diesel and aviation fuel.
Emissions in all other sectors either remained stable or increased slightly.
Matt Drum, founder of NDEVR, said their results show carbon emissions are not going to drop until proper climate policy is in place.
He said the drop in emissions from electricity was driven by market forces, not policy. “If you don’t foster renewable energy, it’s only going to get worse,” Drum said.
In both 2015 and 2016, the government quietly released data showing rising emissions on the days before Christmas, with this year’s data still not released just two weeks out from Christmas.
And, for the past two years, documents released under freedom of information laws have shown the government has had the data for months before releasing it.
“They might drop it just before Christmas again but it’s not much of a Christmas present for Australia’s emission profile and it goes to show that Australia’s climate policy needs a lot of work,” Drum said.
Last week, the Climate Council called on the government to end what it called “climate censorship”.
“At a time when Australia’s federal climate and energy policy remains in limbo, it has never been more important for transparent pollution information,” the Climate Council chief executive, Amanda McKenzie, said. “Continuing to keep the information hidden just raises questions about what there is to hide.
“For several years, there’s been a consistent delay from the Department of the Environment and Energy’s national greenhouse gas inventory on releasing vital emissions data. This raises serious questions over the federal government’s transparency on Australia’s pollution levels.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/11/australias-transport-emissions-in-past-year-the-highest-on-record

Fortunately, with Richardson’s paper, there is now a solid peer-reviewed rebuttal, proving that Soon’s funders weren’t paying for high quality work.https://www.realskeptic.com/2015/06/02/moncktons-fundamentally-flawed-simple-climate-model/', u'recommendation_count': u'4', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1513550092000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'scientists could rebut', u'effect': u'claiming that'}], u'author_id': u'13496713', u'in_reply_to': u'109839209', u'id': u'109842086', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'John Samuel', u'text': u'If you want to peruse the new paper yourself, you can.

27 November 2017Written by world-leading scientists, Climate updates describes how our understanding of the science of climate change, and its impacts, have progressed since the fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
From considerations of how high sea level could rise, to how climate change might affect extreme weather, and what impact climate change will have on food production, human health and species extinction, this report addresses a number of topics that have been a focus of recent attention or where there is significant new evidence.
Climate updates is by no means a comprehensive review, but provides answers, drafted by experts, to some of the questions that are frequently asked of climate scientists by policymakers and the public.

Looking at your sloganeering such as the irrelevant facts such as SUVs and your diversion tactic of changing the subject to the 1930s dust bowl and other anecdotes show where you are coming from. You do need to read the replies as they rebut your main points.
The Dust Bowl of the 1930s was a ""perfect storm"" of conditions, and I have never seen anyone argue that it was not natural. The dust bowl was also followed by a number of cold years, which just proves the case for natural variability. But such a ""perfect storm"" of conditions is rare.
The global warming of the last 30 years is not natural, it is a steady increase of temperatures over a long period of time, not just a couple of years. An steady increase in temperatures leads to a steady increase in fire weather, which is shown by the wildfire season becoming longer. I argue that the increase in wildfire weather is the true metric, and the increase in wildfire is a consequence of this.

Hello Harry, no need to apologize and I'm sorry you think me pointing out facts is dishonest but I'm afraid the facts aren't going away. I've posted evidence that fires are not increasing globally, I've posted evidence that fires are no longer being suppressed in the US and acres burned has gone up steadily every since. Now some people choose to believe that increase in area burned is a result of Climate Change but I choose to believe it's because the US is not actively suppressing wildfires anymore.

Yes, this is just an ad-hoc event, it's important to note that trend in wildfires globally is down and the only reason the trend in acres burned is because the fires are no longer being suppressed. Also, the trend in the numbers of fires is down in the US too.

Yes, yes, we all know that. 
You may have posted three times the implied claim that the increase is due to changes in fire management, but on none of those occasions have you posted any evidence to support the claim.
On the other hand, peer-reviewed research concludes that global warming is a major factor. You need to show what they got wrong.
BQEND
I posted evidence in nearly every post, see figure 16.1 in the link, it backs up exactly what I've been saying - https://www.fs.fed.us/research/sustain/docs/indicators/indicator-316.pdf
It shows a big drop off in acres burned since they started actively suppressing fires and a slow rise since the decision was made not to suppress fires.
BQSTART
In the 1960s, policies governing wildfire suppression changed due to ecological studies that recognized fire as a natural process necessary for new growth. Today, policies advocating complete fire suppression have been exchanged for those who encourage wildland fire use

global area burned appears to have overall declined over past decades, and there is increasing evidence that there is less fire in the global landscape today than centuries ago.

For the western USA, they indicate little change overall, and also that area burned at high severity has overall declined compared to pre-European settlement.

While the average annual area burned globally has changed surprisingly little during the last few decades, there are worrying trends in some regions such as larger blazes and longer fire seasons in the western US as a result of land management and a warming climate. 
Just like boreal Canada, temperatures in Siberia are increasing faster than in many other parts of the world and this trend is expected to continue. Rising temperatures lead to drier vegetation, to fuel the fires, and more lightning, which increases the risk of fire. A hotter climate also lengthens the season during which fires occur.

Examining trends from 1984 to 2006 for large ecoregions in the north- and southwest USA, Dillon et al. [71] found no significant increase in the proportion of annual area burned at high severity for five of the six regions considered, with the southern Rockies being the exception. For the Sierra Nevada region (California), which was not covered in the previous study [71], Hanson & Odion [72,73] found no general increase in fire severity within the period 1984–2010. Considering ten national forests in California for the same period, Miller & Safford [74] found a significant increase in burn severity for yellow pine–mixed conifer forests. They attribute this largely to decades of fire suppression and other management practices rather than climate, which have led to major changes in forest composition and structure, increases in density and fuel-loading, and hence fire behaviour. Covering the much larger area of the dry forest landscapes of the western USA, including large parts of those examined in the aforementioned studies, Baker [75] found that the rate of high-severity fire in the period 1984–2012 was within or below that of historical century- to millennial-scale estimates.

Four days ago the fire index for Southern California was 296. The threshold for an extreme fire index is 165. And 296 is the highest fire index So Cal has ever experienced according to local firefighters. Fire index is a measure of fire risk. So, if these reports are correct, this region has never seen fire danger hit such an extreme intensity.

The extent of area burned by wildfires each year appears to have increased since the 1980s. According to National Interagency Fire Center data, of the 10 years with the largest acreage burned, nine have occurred since 2000, including the peak year in 2015 (see Figure 2). This period coincides with many of the warmest years on record nationwide (see the U.S. and Global Temperature indicator).

We demonstrate that human-caused climate change caused over half of the documented increases in fuel aridity since the 1970s and doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984.

California’s record wildfires are similarly giving us a glimpse of our future hellish climate if we continue with our current behavior.
This year, California experienced its worst and most expensive wildfire season on record. This surprised many, because while the state recently had its worst drought in over 1,200 years, the 5-year drought ended in 2016. However, California was hit by the opposite extreme in 2017, with its wettest rainy season on record. 
Though it seems counter-intuitive, the wet season contributed to the state’s wildfires. The resulting vegetation growth created fuel for the 2017 fire season, particularly after being dried out by high temperatures. 2017 was the hottest summer in record on California, breaking the previous record set just last year by a full degree Fahrenheit. As Stephen Pyne put it, “Whether it’s exceptionally wet or exceptionally dry, you’ve got the material for a fire in California.”
California’s wildfire season normally ends in October – big wildfires are relatively rare in November and December. But fires are raging in Southern California two weeks shy of Christmas, impossible to contain due to intense Santa Ana winds, creating hellish scenes.
A 2006 study published in Geophysical Research Letters found that global warming would push the Southern California fire season associated with Santa Ana winds into the winter months. As a 2015 study published in Environmental Research Letters found, Santa Ana fires are especially costly because of the speed at which they spread due to the winds and their proximity to urban areas. That study concluded that the area burned by Southern California wildfires will increase by about 70% by mid-century due to the drier, hotter, windier conditions caused by global warming.
A 2010 study published in Forest Ecology and Management found that global warming may extend the fire season year-round in California and the southwestern USA. These December fires will become more commonplace in a hotter world. We’re literally getting a glimpse at Christmas future, and though there are other factors at play, human-caused global warming is largely to blame.
A 2015 special report in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society found that “An increase in fire risk in California is attributable to human-induced climate change.” A 2016 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that human-caused global warming doubled the area burned by wildfires in the western USA over just the past 30 years.
Add to that a new study just published in Nature Communications finding a connection between Arctic sea ice and high pressure ridges of California’s coast that can block storms from passing over the state. These results suggest that as Arctic sea ice continues to disappear due to global warming, California may see less rainfall and thus even worse droughts, which along with higher temperatures would lead to worse wildfire seasons.
Of course, climate-intensified extreme weather isn’t limited to California. In 2017, intense heat waves, droughts, wildfires, hurricanes, and floods impacted virtually every state in the country. America was absolutely pummeled by climate change this year.
When the Ghost of Christmas Future showed Ebenezer Scrooge how miserable his life would become, Scrooge changed his behavior to avoid that outcome. So far, although Americans are more concerned about climate change than ever, their president and the party in power of government aren’t even willing to talk about the problem. In the midst of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt said:
...to discuss the cause and effect of these storms, there’s the... place (and time) to do that, it’s not now.
Three months later, the administration has yet to discuss the cause and effect of those storms, although climate scientists have concluded that climate change made the impacts of the hurricanes worse. In fact, a recent study by MIT climate scientist Kerry Emanuel found that global warming made the extreme precipitation associated with Hurricane Harvey six times more likely.
One wonders how much worse climate-intensified extreme weather must become to convince America’s leaders behave as rationally as Ebenezer Scrooge. Will they change their greedy, selfish behavior before these fiery Christmases become commonplace?",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/dec/11/californias-hellish-fires-a-visit-from-the-ghost-of-christmas-future

I find it bizarre that you think nuclear power to be a realistic option for addressing climate change - besides the fact that new nuclear is now by far the most expensive energy option (in the UK at least) the fuel is finite and there are many countries in the world where it simply is not an option. Furthermore although the accident rates are lower than conventional power the impacts of the accidents can be far greater. 
Rose and Sweeting calculate [1] that the overall probability of a core-melt accident in the next decade, in a world with just 443 reactors, is almost 70%. (Because of statistical uncertainty the probability could range from about 28% to roughly 95%.) The United States alone, with 104 reactors, has about a 50% probability of experiencing one core-melt accident within the next 25 years. Increasing nuclear to a level of significance for climate change would multiply these risks many times.

As to the other question, whether meat is in practice necessary, it probably is. You have to have some source of B12. Contrary to some vegan propagandists, there are only two source: one is animal products, the other is synthetic as in pills.
As a matter of practice, the mass of the population is not going to go down to Boots and buy and take B12 pills. For them, meat is a necessity.
To anticipate the inevitable reply, by the way, yes, humans can and do synthethize it. But unlike ruminants, we do it at a point in the digestive process later than where absorption takes place. It is useless to us.
Veganism requires you to take synthetic B12. The alternative is deficiency and illness, including anaemia. Whatever the merits of veganism, ethically and for health, we cannot have evolved as vegans, because pre-1900 you couldn't either live as a strict vegan or raise vegan children.
Any cultures that appeared to do that turn out to have got animal B12 from foodstuffs contamination by pests. Under modern Western sanitary conditions, none of that, deficiency is the consequence.
None of which has any bearing on the critical point: the well off in the Guardian have no business proposing to impose regressive taxes on food in Britain in pursuit of their hobbies.

""If animals are organically farmed on grass rather than grain, and the meat is butchered and eaten locally, then it is an entirely sustainable food and should not be unfairly taxed in the same way that industrially farmed foods are.""
BQENDThe point that Damien is making is that apparently 15% of greenhouse gasses come from meat that is farmed. The animals (particularly the cows, but basically all ruminants) are producing methane as a result of being alive, not as a result of us eating them. So, regardless of how you keep them, these animals will continue to generate greenhouse gasses.
The weakness in this argument, as far as I can see, is that if we did not eat meat, either cows or some other ruminants would keep eating the grass. Or it would rot on its own through bacterial and fungal action. And the same or similar amounts of methane would be released.

""The funny thing about our society is it loves it’s dogs and cats but it can’t quite figure out that a pig and a lamb and cow are the same thing""
BQEND???
Cats and dogs are generally not good to eat, but have other practical uses around the home and farm. The yellow dogs that the Chinese use for food give greasy meat that I dont particularly enjoy eating, although some may. I am not sure if anyone routinely eats cats, although the reason for leaving the heads on rabbits in the butchers is to ensure that people can see it's a rabbit. So possibly cats may be edible and palatable.
At least 13,000 years of experience (Gobekli Tepe) suggests that cows are useless as household pets. Pigs are not great company indoors, and although lambs are lovely, sheep are less so. And therefore not useful for anything much other than keeping the grass and wildflowers down and, of course, eating. Pigs are great recyclers of household waste, a role that they still carry out now in our more industrialised society. Lots of rubbish that would otherwise be rotting in landfill is used by pigs to turn into very pleasant meat.

""Using meat tax revenues to subsidise healthy foods is one idea touted to reduce opposition.""
BQENDThis is a slightly odd notion that suggest a lack of depth of thought about the issue. Most of the ""healthier"" foods are those that are less refined and less processed. Other than those foodstuffs that require some treatment to achieve practical shelf-life, all of those refining processes must increase costs. And yet, the more ""healthy"" something is, the more likely it will have a higher sales price.
I would suggest that the supply chain makes considerably more profit already from ""healthy"" foods, because they can command a higher price.

BQENDThanks TimmyG2
Just as a bit of advice, when you look for cancer and meat as search terms in Google, you then need to read the papers to see what they actually say.
Both of the references you linked are to do with inappropriate cooking methods. The first shows the accumulation of potential carcinogens in breast tissue increasing with the extent to which eaten meat is overcooked. The second proposes boiling of meat to avoid exactly this risk. This is cancer related to cooking method. Something that you will also experience if you cook vegetable protein at excessive temperature also, and something already claimed in case of burnt toast and overcooked potatoes. Neither of which is meat, I should perhaps remind you. The United Kingdom Food Standards Authority has gone as far as to publish guidelines on cooking toast. In this case the suspect chemical is Acrylamide, a product of heating starch
So, to summarise, your post blames meat for what is in fact poor cooking methods. Poor cooking methods are also responsible for making carcinogens out of vegetables.

The global livestock industry causes 15% of all global greenhouse gas emissions and meat consumption is rising around the world, but dangerous climate change cannot be avoided unless this is radically curbed. Furthermore, many people already eat far too much meat, seriously damaging their health and incurring huge costs. Livestock also drive other problems, such as water pollution and antibiotic resistance.
A new analysis from the investor network Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return (Fairr) Initiative argues that meat is therefore now following the same path as tobacco, carbon emissions and sugar towards a sin tax, a levy on harmful products to cut consumption. Meat taxes have already been discussed in parliaments in Germany, Denmark and Sweden, the analysis points out, and China’s government has cut its recommended maximum meat consumption by 45% in 2016.
“If policymakers are to cover the true cost of human epidemics like obesity, diabetes and cancer, and livestock epidemics like avian flu, while also tackling the twin challenges of climate change and antibiotic resistance, then a shift from subsidisation to taxation of the meat industry looks inevitable,” said Jeremy Coller, the founder of Fairr and the chief investment officer at the private equity firm Coller Capital. “Far-sighted investors should plan ahead for this day.”
Maria Lettini, director of Fairr, said: “As implementation of the Paris climate agreement progresses we’re highly likely to see government action to reduce the environmental impact of the global livestock sector. On the current pathway we may well see some form of meat tax emerge within five to 10 years.”
Nations begin to implement sin taxes as consensus forms over the harm caused by the product, the analysis notes, and today more than 180 jurisdictions tax tobacco, more than 60 tax carbon emissions, and at least 25 tax sugar. 
The first global analysis of meat taxes done in 2016 found levies of 40% on beef, 20% on dairy products and 8.5% on chicken would save half a million lives a year and slash climate warming emissions. Proposals in Denmark suggested a tax of $2.70 per kilogram of meat.
Meat taxes are often seen as politically impossible but research by Chatham House in 2015 found they are far less unpalatable to consumers than governments think. It showed people expect governments to lead action on issues that are for the global good, but that awareness of the damage caused by the livestock industry is low. Using meat tax revenues to subsidise healthy foods is one idea touted to reduce opposition.
“It’s only a matter of time before agriculture becomes the focus of serious climate policy,” said Rob Bailey at Chatham House. “The public health case will likely strengthen government resolve, as we have seen with coal and diesel. It’s hard to imagine concerted action to tax meat today, but over the course of the next 10 to 20 years, I would expect to see meat taxes accumulate.”
Marco Springmann, at the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food at the University of Oxford, said: “Current levels of meat consumption are not healthy or sustainable. The costs associated with each of those impacts could approach the trillions in the future. Taxing meat could be a first and important step.”
The need for a high meat tax could be reduced if breakthrough technologies emerge to drastically cut the emissions from livestock, said Lettini, but none exist today. Another, more promising option is the nascent but fast-growing industry in plant-based meat alternatives, such as the meat-free Impossible burger. Bill Gates has invested, and major meat and dairy companies are now piling in with investments and acquisitions.
“There are huge opportunities in the market,” said Lettini. “If we can start replacing meat protein with plant-based protein that has the same look, taste and feel as meat, where real red-blooded meat eaters are happy to dig into a burger that is plant-based, we are changing the world.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/11/meat-tax-inevitable-to-beat-climate-and-health-crises-says-report

Yes it is. If you or I buy from a renewable green tariff, then the provider needs to buy more renewables, driving up the demand for renewables, and driving down the demand for non-renewables.
BQEND
The government already forces the electricity industry as a whole to buy renewable energy (29% of the total this year, iirc). Unless ""green"" tariffs amount to more than 29% of consumption, one customer buying more renewable energy means another can get away with buying less. 
In other words, ""green"" tariffs on their own do not make any difference, and won't, unless they are far more widely adopted.
BQSTART
I appreciate that Google being net 100% green may be an issue for you, but it's real, no matter how hard you try to spin it otherwise.
BQEND
It isn't real. Google runs on whatever power mix supplies the grid in the areas they operate. If Google pay a wind farm for electricity, and the wind farm has a drop in production because of low wind speeds, does Google:
A. Shut down their data centres
B. Switch over to battery backup
C. Use whatever power is supplied from the grid, typically a mix of coal, gas, nuclear etc.
The answer is C. Google does not shut down operations when the companies they have contracted with cannot supply power, and it doesn't have the battery power to continue operations.
Google pays renewables companies for electricity, it actually consumes whatever electricity the grid supplies.
BQSTART
So if the average wholesale price is around £40/MWh, and doesn't truly reflect all of the FF and nuclear costs, then I don't see how these renewables can be ""vastly more expensive"", since the difference is less than 2p/kWh, and possibly zero soon.
BQEND
Reliability. On Friday wind electricity production in the UK was over 9 GW. On Sunday it dipped as low as 1.2 GW, now it's 4.5 GW.
Some other form of generation has to sit idle when the wind is blowing ready to take over when the wind drops. That costs money. The alternative is to spend billions on storage (too expensive) or simply do without power when wind speeds are low (also too expensive).
What companies like Google do is buy renewable energy but consume a mix of coal, gas, nuclear, wind, solar, hydro etc. That way they can claim to be green without having to pay the unsupportable costs that truly running on renewables would require.
BQSTART
But back to the main issue - for green tariffs or green companies, they need to inject an amount of RE generation into the grid equal to or greater than what they take out/sell.
BQEND
No, they don't. They need to buy something called REGOs (Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin). Like ROCs (Renewable Obligation Certificates) REGOs are handed out free to renewable generators. They hand them over to customers who buy their electricity. But because there is no compulsion to accumulate REGOs, and most renewable electricity is sold to ""normal"" electricity companies, REGOs are very, very cheap. In 2016 European REGO prices were 27 - 66 pence per MWH. That's how much it costs a company to claim to be 100% ""green"".
Imagine a chain of supermarkets in the UK. They consume 1 TWH of electricity in a year. They pay for 1 TWH of renewable electricity generation. That electricity is fed into the grid as and when it's generated. The supermarket chain consumes 1 TWH of electricity over the year, as and when it's required. The mix of electricity the supermarkets use will be the same as the mix on the UK grid. It will cost the supermarket chain about £100 million a year to buy the electricity they require. The cost of buying the REGOs so they can claim to be 100% ""green"" will be about £500,000. 
It's a good deal for the companies involved.

The industry has long argued that it can considerably reduce carbon emissions by increasing efficiency and reducing waste, but academics are challenging industry assumptions. A new paper, due to be published by US researchers later this month, will forecast that information and communications technology could create up to 3.5% of global emissions by 2020 – surpassing aviation and shipping – and up to 14% 2040, around the same proportion as the US today.
Global computing power demand from internet-connected devices, high resolution video streaming, emails, surveillance cameras and a new generation of smart TVs is increasing 20% a year, consuming roughly 3-5% of the world’s electricity in 2015, says Swedish researcher Anders Andrae.
In an update to a 2016 peer-reviewed study, Andrae found that without dramatic increases in efficiency, the ICT industry could use 20% of all electricity and emit up to 5.5% of the world’s carbon emissions by 2025. This would be more than any country except the US, China and India.
He expects industry power demand to increase from 200-300 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity a year now, to 1,200 or even 3,000TWh by 2025. Data centres on their own could produce 1.9 gigatonnes (Gt) (or 3.2% of the global total) of carbon emissions, he says.
“The situation is alarming,” said Andrae, who works for the Chinese communications technology firm Huawei. “We have a tsunami of data approaching. Everything which can be is being digitalised. It is a perfect storm. 5G [the fifth generation of mobile technology] is coming, IP [internet protocol] traffic is much higher than estimated, and all cars and machines, robots and artificial intelligence are being digitalised, producing huge amounts of data which is stored in data centres.”
US researchers expect power consumption to triple in the next five years as one billion more people come online in developing countries, and the “internet of things” (IoT), driverless cars, robots, video surveillance and artificial intelligence grows exponentially in rich countries.
“There will be 8.4bn connected things in 2017, setting the stage for 20.4bn internet of things devices to be deployed by 2020,” says the leading internet analyst firm Gartner.
The industry has encouraged the idea that the digital transformation of economies and large-scale energy efficiencies will slash global emissions by 20% or more, but the scale and speed of the revolution has been a surprise.
Global internet traffic will increase nearly threefold in the next five years says the latest Cisco Visual Networking Index, a leading industry tracker of internet use.
“More than one billion new internet users are expected, growing from three billion in 2015 to 4.1bn by 2020. Over the next five years global IP networks will support up to 10bn new devices and connections, increasing from 16.3bn in 2015 to 26bn by 2020,” says Cisco.
A 2016 Berkeley laboratory report for the US government estimated the country’s data centres, which held about 350m terabytes of data in 2015, could together need over 100TWh of electricity a year by 2020. This is the equivalent of about 10 large nuclear power stations.
Data centre capacity is also rocketing in Europe and Asia with London, Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam expected to add nearly 200MW of consumption in 2017, or the power equivalent of a medium size power station.
“We are seeing massive growth of data centres in all regions. Trends that started in the US are now standard in Europe. Asia is taking off massively,” says Mitual Patel, head of EMEA data centre research at global investment firm CBRE.
“The volume of data being handled by such centres is growing at unprecedented rates. They are seen as a key element in the next stage of growth for the ICT industry”, says Peter Corcoran, a researcher at the university of Ireland, Galway.
Using renewable energy sounds good but no one else benefits from what will be generated, and it skews national attempts to reduce emissions
Ireland, which with Denmark is becoming a data base for the world’s biggest tech companies, has 350MW connected to data centres but this is expected to triple to over 1,000MW, or the equivalent of a nuclear power station size plant, in the next five years.
Permission has been given for a further 550MW to be connected and 750MW more is in the pipeline, says Eirgrid, the country’s main grid operator.
“If all enquiries connect, the data centre load could account for 20% of Ireland’s peak demand,” says Eirgrid in its All-Island Generation Capacity Statement 2017-2026 report.
The data will be stored in vast new one million square feet or larger “hyper-scale” server farms, which companies are now building. The scale of these farms is huge; a single $1bn Apple data centre planned for Athenry in Co Galway, expects to eventually use 300MW of electricity, or over 8% of the national capacity and more than the daily entire usage of Dublin. It will require 144 large diesel generators as back up for when the wind does not blow.
Pressed by Greenpeace and other environment groups, large tech companies with a public face , including Google, Facebook, Apple, Intel and Amazon, have promised to use renewable energy to power data centres. In most cases they are buying it off grid but some are planning to build solar and wind farms close to their centres.
Greenpeace IT analyst Gary Cook says only about 20% of the electricity used in the world’s data centres is so far renewable, with 80% of the power still coming from fossil fuels.
“The good news is that some companies have certainly embraced their responsibility, and are moving quite aggressively to meet their rapid growth with renewable energy. Others are just growing aggressively,” he says.
Architect David Hughes, who has challenged Apple’s new centre in Ireland, says the government should not be taken in by the promises.
“Using renewable energy sounds good but no one else benefits from what will be generated, and it skews national attempts to reduce emissions. Data centres … have eaten into any progress we made to achieving Ireland’s 40% carbon emissions reduction target. They are just adding to demand and reducing our percentage. They are getting a free ride at the Irish citizens’ expense,” says Hughes.
Eirgrid estimates indicate that by 2025, one in every 3kWh generated in Ireland could be going to a data centre, he added. “We have sleepwalked our way into a 10% increase in electricity consumption.”
Fossil fuel plants may have to be kept open longer to power other parts of the country and the costs will fall on the consumer, he says. “We will have to upgrade our grid and build more power generation both wind and backup generation for when the wind isn’t there and this all goes onto people’s bills.”
Under a best case scenario, says Andrae, there will be massive continuous improvements of power saving, renewable energy will become the norm and the explosive growth in demand for data will slow.
But equally, he says, demand could continue to rise dramatically if the industry keeps growing at 20% a year, driverless cars each with dozens of embedded sensors, and cypto-currencies like Bitcoin which need vast amounts of computer power become mainstream.
“There is a real risk that it all gets out of control. Policy makers need to keep a close eye on this,” says Andrae.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/11/tsunami-of-data-could-consume-fifth-global-electricity-by-2025

BQSTART
Yes there is, money. The nuclear subsidies are so great that there wouldn't be any money left for the PV and wind.
BQEND
BQENDWell we're doing both so that evidently is not true.
The reason that we are doing both is because solar and wind are intermittent - you indicate that you want to build them around gas pants instead of nuclear plants but the thing is we have to cut emissions, not just think up inventive ways to keep the gas industry afloat.

New nuclear is about £100/MWh now, v's approx £40-£60/MWh for wind and PV, but let's say £60.

In the later part of the 1990s, 'paradigm shift' emerged as a buzzword, popularized as marketing speak and appearing more frequently in print and publication.
BQEND
BQSTART
A paradigm shift (also radical theory change),[1] a concept identified by the American physicist and philosopher Thomas Kuhn (1922–1996), is a fundamental change in the basic concepts and experimental practices of a scientific discipline. Kuhn contrasted these shifts, which characterize a scientific revolution, to the activity of normal science, which he described as scientific work done within a prevailing framework (or paradigm). In this context, the word ""paradigm"" is used in its original Greek meaning, as ""example"". 
The nature of scientific revolutions has been studied by modern philosophy since Immanuel Kant used the phrase in the preface to his Critique of Pure Reason (1781). He referred to Greek mathematics and Newtonian physics. In the 20th century, new developments in the basic concepts of mathematics, physics, and biology revitalized interest in the question among scholars. It was against this active background that Kuhn published his work.
Kuhn presented his notion of a paradigm shift in his influential book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962)

 in Europe both gas and coal are losing out to renewables, led by wind. Subsidies and mandated market shares started the process but now wind, on and offshore, is achieving cost reductions to the point where suppliers can compete without help. The low prices for offshore wind agreed in this year’s capacity auctions in the UK are the strongest signal of the shape of things to come.
Gas demand in Europe is 12 per cent lower than it was 10 years ago. Chinese and Indian demand continues to grow but the dramatic gains by solar power, where costs have fallen 85 per cent since 2009, are opening up the market

60,000 acres is 242 sq km or an area around 16 x 16 km. As as well as housing wind turbines all that land can be used for grazing, crops, fish farming or/and filled with solar panels. Try that around a nuclear station.
BQEND
BQENDThere's certainly no reason not to co-locate wind or solar with nuclear.
Interestingly @PatLogan covered the issue of relative onshore supply density the other day.
BQSTART
 The largest onshore wind turbines in the UK are about 3MW each, and onshore wind in the UK averages about a 26% capacity factor. That means, on average each would make 6,800 megawatt hours.
And, of course, it's less reliable output. We'll come back to that later.
So, even if we're just matching average annual production between the two options, it's not an issue of just a few wind turbines. It's about 3,700 wind turbines to replace Hinkley.
So, how big an area would those cover? If we take the UK's biggest windfarm - Whitelee, near Glasgow - that's got 215 turbines. So we'd need about 17 Whitelees.
And Whitelee covers 5300 hectares. So, we're talking about around 90,000 hectares. A little under 2/3rds the area of Greater London. If it were a square, it'd stretch 30 kilometres on a side. If the North West corner were at Hinkley, the South East corner would be near Yeovil. It'd take in most of the Quantock and Blackdown AONBs.
Or to put in in a way that might mean more to many, if that North East corner were the centre of Reading, the South East one would be about 5km south of Guildford...
Supply you town, and I'll tell you how far the farm would spread if centred on it.
But that's not the half of it. Wind's intermittent, and pending development of economical mass storage (which ain't here yet), you need back-up. So, you're still going to have to build a gas-fired station to be available for the periods what winds output drops low - and it'll be running, on average at between 1/3rd and 1/2 power.
And this is to replace just ONE nuclear station, capable of supplying about 7% of average demand, or 5% or so of peak demand.https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/108976862

These show the accelerating change with temperature of water's equilibrium vapour pressure in air. Yes, heat energy drives tropical storms, by locally higher oceanic temperatures permitting rapid water evaporation into already warm but hitherto under-saturated air. This jump in the proportion of water vapour, much less dense than air, reduces local atmospheric density, driving a fast-rising air column. The storm vortex gathers and intensifies around that up-rushing moist, less dense column, drawing up vast masses of water vapour from the hot ocean surface into the circulating rain clouds above.

This unnecessary article describes an initial attempt to model a long-term change that will not be relevant to existing on-shore wind facilities for 50-100 years.
BQENDYou've hit the nail on the head, especially as wind farms are designed/costed to be viable during their lifetimes (20-25yrs off-shore, 25-30yrs on-shore).
But here's the kicker, the infrastructure cost for off-shore wind is about 40%, that's for the cabling, bases, and substations. So if the generation drops by 5-10% for their replacements, but said replacement will be 40% cheaper (even if technology doesn't improve) then that sounds OK.

I think 2017 has been a significant year, with so many milestones, such as the cost of off-shore wind, the rapidly growing deployment of storage (which 'they' say is too expensive to be deployed), PV taking over around the world as costs are just getting silly now, the big leap in public approval for EV's, Tesla's semi, the cancellation of expensive nuclear projects as it becomes unable to compete, and so on.

However, some places, including eastern Australia, will see winds pick up.
The research is the first global study to project the impact of temperature rises on wind energy and found big changes by the end of the century in many of the places hosting large numbers of turbines. 
Wind farms have grown more than fivefold in the last decade and plunging costs have made them a key way of reducing carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning. But in the central US, for example, the power of the wind could fall by nearly a fifth.
“We found some substantial changes in wind energy,” said Kristopher Karnauskas at the University of Colorado Boulder, US. “But it does not mean we should not invest in wind power.” It does mean such changes need to be taken into account in planning future wind farms, he said, and also in assessing how much wind farms overall can cut global emissions.
The research, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, used the same climate models and projected future emissions as the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Losses of wind energy stretched from the central US to the UK, Russia and Japan for both medium and high emissions scenarios. If emissions remain high in the future, wind energy increases were also seen a smaller number of regions.
The biggest fall was in Japan, where wind farm building is just beginning to accelerate, with wind energy projected to fall by 58kW, or about 10%. The central US was second with 49kW but because the average current winds are generally weaker than in Japan, this represents a larger 17% drop. The UK is anticipated to fall by 36kW, or 5%.
However, the wind energy in eastern Australia would jump if there is strong global warming in future. “That is the biggest increase on the whole map,” said Karnauskas. Here, wind energy would rise by 48kW, or 23%. Eastern Brazil and west Africa would also see big rises, 35% and 40% respectively.
The reason these coastal areas would see increased wind energy is that the world’s land is warming faster than the ocean and that difference is the energy source for those winds. “The more it warms, ironically, the more it increases the wind power there,” said Karnauskas.
In the northern mid-latitudes, however, the major driver of wind is the temperature difference between the Arctic and the tropics, and the Arctic is warming very rapidly, reducing that difference.
The scientists had to convert the wind speeds predicted by the climate models into wind energy, because temperature, pressure and humidity all affect the power of the wind. “More dense air is going to blow harder on a wind turbine,” said Karnauskas.
Prof Brian Hoskins, at Imperial College London, UK, and not involved in the study, said: “It is important to try to estimate how climate change is likely to influence all our activities. This is a good example.”
The new study analysed average monthly wind over broad areas and Hoskins said smaller scale changes could be more important for particular wind farms. Dave MacLeod, at the University of Oxford, said other higher resolution work had found different results in the US.
Karnauskas acknowledges the uncertainties and said the work provides a starting point for more focused work: “It points to places that need detailed studies. Until now, we were really missing a consistent global view of the issue.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/11/global-warming-will-weaken-wind-power-study-predicts

The “Make Our Planet Great Again” grants – a nod to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan – are part of Macron’s efforts to counter Trump on the climate change front. Macron announced a contest for the projects in June, hours after Trump declared he would withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord.
More than 5,000 people from about 100 countries expressed interest in the grants. Most of the applicants – and 13 of the 18 winners – were US-based researchers.
Macron’s appeal “gave me such a psychological boost, to have that kind of support, to have the head of state saying I value what you do”, said winner Camille Parmesan, of the University of Texas at Austin. She will be working at an experimental ecology station in the Pyrenees on how human-made climate change is affecting wildlife.
In an interview with the Associated Press, Parmesan described funding challenges for climate science in the US and a feeling that “you are having to hide what you do”.
Trump has expressed skepticism about global warming and said the Paris accord would hurt US business by requiring a reduction in climate-damaging emissions.
“We will be there to replace” US financing of climate research, Macron told the winners in Paris on Monday.
“If we want to prepare for the changes of tomorrow, we need science,” he said, promising to put in place a global climate change monitoring system among other climate innovations.
The research of the winning recipients focuses on pollution, hurricanes and clouds. A new round of the competition will be launched next year, alongside Germany. About 50 projects will be chosen overall, and funded with €60m ($70m) from the state and French research institutes.
Initially aimed at American researchers, the research grants were expanded to other non-French climate scientists, according to organizers. Candidates need to be known for working on climate issues, have completed a thesis and propose a project that would take between three to five years.
The time frame would cover Trump’s current presidential term.
Some French researchers have complained that Macron is showering money on foreign scientists at a time when they have been pleading for more support for domestic higher education.
Macron unveiled the first winners at a startup incubator in Paris called Station F, where Microsoft and smaller tech companies announced projects to finance activities aimed at reducing emissions.
Monday’s event is a prelude to a bigger climate summit Tuesday aimed at giving new impetus to the Paris accord and finding new funding to help governments and businesses meet its goals.
More than 50 world leaders are expected in Paris for the One Planet Summit, co-hosted by the UN and the World Bank. Trump was not invited.
Other attendees include Arnold Schwarzenegger, who took a spin on a Parisian electric bike Monday to call attention to health problems caused by pollution.
The Hollywood star and former California governor argued that Trump’s rejection of the Paris climate accord doesn’t matter, because companies, scientists and other governments can “pick up the slack” to reduce global emissions.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/11/macron-awards-grants-to-us-scientists-to-move-to-france-in-defiance-of-trump

That is why I will join other world leaders gathering in Paris today for the One Planet Summit.
There is a clear moral imperative for developed economies such as the UK to help those around the world who stand to lose most from the consequences of manmade climate change. But by putting the UK at the forefront of efforts to cut carbon emissions and develop clean energy, we can also make the most of new economic opportunities. And by taking action to create a secure natural environment, we are fulfilling a duty we owe to the next generation.
Britain has always led the way in facing up to these challenges. But only through collective international action can we succeed in keeping temperature rises within manageable levels. The landmark 2015 Paris agreement represented the world’s collective determination to protect our planet for the future, and I am proud that the UK ratified this agreement in 2016. This week, I am setting out further action the UK will take.
We also stand firmly with those who find themselves on the frontline of rising sea levels and extreme weather
We have already made huge progress. Since 2012, the carbon-intensity of UK electricity fell by more than twice that of any other major economy. Last year the UK succeeded in decarbonising at a faster rate than any other G20 country. Our low-carbon sector is growing rapidly, with over 430,000 jobs in low-carbon businesses and their supply chains across the UK. Investment in clean power has also driven up the percentage of our electricity generated by renewables to a greater amount than coal.
Burning coal to generate electricity is one of the dirtiest and most destructive ways of generating power. In September I confirmed that we would phase out unabated coal-fired power generation by 2025. More and more businesses are coming to recognise the enormous commercial opportunity that this represents. This week more than 20 new partners – including Sweden, California and large businesses such as EDF – have joined the alliance, committing to the shared goals of ending coal power and switching to cleaner sources of energy.
Clean energy is already an easier, cheaper and safer option than coal in many of the poorest countries. y adopting 21st-century methods such as solar and wind power and energy storage, developing economies can today leapfrog the dirty technologies of the past.
Next autumn the UK will demonstrate our global leadership in clean transportation when we host a ground-breaking zero-emission vehicle summit. Seizing the opportunities presented by the shift to clean growth is at the heart of our industrial strategy. We will secure the UK’s position at the forefront of emerging green technologies, and help to deliver good quality jobs across the country. Locking in clean and sustainable economic growth while protecting our planet for the next generation will remain twin objectives for government and for business in the years ahead.
As well as our action at home, we also stand firmly with those who find themselves on the frontline of rising sea levels and extreme weather. This year has brought to life the devastating impact that such extreme weather events can have, from hurricanes in the Caribbean to flooding in India and Bangladesh.
The UK is already working closely with countries in the Caribbean, Asia and Africa to build resilience against natural disasters and climate extremes and we will provide an additional £53m funding to extend this work. Many of the small island states that are threatened by rising sea levels are members of the Commonwealth, so when the UK chairs next year’s Commonwealth summit, we will make climate a major focus of discussion and further action.
By maintaining our commitment to tackling climate change and its effects, the UK can build a clean, green economy which is fit for the future and by so doing, protect and enhance our natural environment for the next generation.

The prime minister set out her commitment to dealing with climate change in an article for the Guardian, echoing David Cameron’s 2005 efforts to show the Tories cared about global warming.
Ahead of this week’s climate change summit in Paris, May said: “There is a clear moral imperative for developed economies like the UK to help those around the world who stand to lose most from the consequences of manmade climate change.”
She described coal as “one of the dirtiest and most destructive ways of generating power” and hailed the “enormous commercial opportunity which the shift to cleaner forms of energy represents”. 
May’s commitment to the issue of climate change was questioned when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change shortly after taking office last year. Later, her appointee as environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, had to ask officials whether climate change was real.
However, the prime minister insists “tackling climate change and mitigating its effects for the world’s poorest are amongst the most critical challenges the world faces”. 
At the summit she will announce a £140m boost to funding for poorer communities affected by climate change through deforestation or vulnerability to natural disasters and extreme weather, plus £15m of additional support for reconstruction on Dominica in the Caribbean, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September.
It comes at a time when Conservative MPs are being asked by party officials to show off their green credentials after internal polling showed the level of concern among younger voters about environmental issues. 
The party has been alarmed by the backlash against May’s support for a free vote on foxhunting, the omission of a ban on the ivory trade from the manifesto and its lack of support for an amendment that would have recognised in UK law that animals feel pain. They have since backtracked on all three issues.
The environment secretary, Michael Gove, will publish a draft bill on Tuesday that explicitly enshrines animal sentience in domestic law. It will also increase the maximum prison sentence in England and Wales for animal cruelty from six months to five years. 
“Animals are sentient beings who feel pain and suffering, so we are writing that principle into law and ensuring that we protect their welfare,” Gove said. “We are a nation of animal lovers so we will make Brexit work not just for citizens but for the animals we love and cherish too.”
Gove is also said to be pressing for more of the UK’s overseas aid budget to be spent on cutting plastic pollution after it emerged that 90% of the waste in the ocean came from 10 rivers in Africa and Asia, according to a report in the Times.
The Guardian revealed this month that Conservative MPs had been hauled in by No 10 to be briefed on seven new policy principles underpinned by a focus on the environment in an attempt to turn the situation around.
As the final episode of the BBC’s Blue Planet II finished on Sunday evening, many Tory MPs published messages on Twitter to push the government’s environmental policies, accompanied by Conservative-branded graphics.
The change in strategy comes a decade after Cameron tried to make the party focus on green issues, changing the Conservative logo to a tree, installing a wind turbine on his roof and visiting the Arctic to learn about global warming – where he was mocked for metaphorically trying to “hug a husky”.
However, he moved away from this agenda over the course of his premiership and reportedly ordered officials to “cut the green crap” from energy bills and ban the expansion of onshore windfarms as he came under pressure from rightwingers in the party.
May still has a number of senior MPs in the Conservative ranks who have expressed scepticism about green policies, including the Brexit secretary, David Davis, who once argued against the “ferocious determination to impose hairshirt policies on the public – taxes on holiday flights, or covering our beautiful countryside with wind turbines that look like props from War of the Worlds”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/12/theresa-may-puts-tackling-climate-change-back-on-tory-agenda

The study reveals that kittiwakes and gannets are among a number of seabirds that have now joined the red list of under-threat birds drawn up by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
Dr Ian Burfield, global science coordinator at Birdlife International which carried out the study for IUCN, said the threat to these birds pointed to a wider environmental challenge.
“Birds are well studied and great indicators of the health of the wider environment. A species at higher risk of extinction is a worrying alarm call that action needs to be taken now.”
The study found that overfishing and changes in the Pacific and north Atlantic caused by climate change have affected the availability of sand eels which black-legged kittiwakes feed on during the breeding season. 
This has caused “disastrous chick survival rates”, it says, with nesting kittiwake numbers plummeting by 87% since 2000 on the Orkney and Shetland Islands, and by 96% on the Hebridean island of St Kilda. 
Globally, the species is thought to have declined by about 40% since the 1970s, justifying its move from the “least concern” category to “vulnerable” on the Red List.
“The alarming decline of the black-legged kittiwake and other North Atlantic and Arctic seabirds, such as the Atlantic puffin, provides a painful lesson in what happens when nations take an ‘out of sight, out of mind’ approach to conservation,” said Marguerite Tarzia, European marine conservation officer for BirdLife International.
The study also found that the number of Cape gannets – which breed around Namibia and South Africa – has dropped 50% since the 1950s as food stocks dwindle from overfishing and climate change.
The study also found that the yellow-breasted bunting, once super-abundant, has declined by 80% since 2002, putting it in the highest category, “critically endangered”. It blames illegal trapping in China. 
In the North American Arctic, the report found the snowy owl population is much smaller than previously thought and in rapid decline. It said climate change, which has caused snow to melt and reduce rodent cover, was one the key factors.
However, the study did find some positive trends. The Dalmatian pelican has seen its numbers increase in Europe thanks to the introduction of artificial nesting rafts and disturbance prevention. In New Zealand two species of kiwi are more numerous to the control of predators and a programme of egg rearing.
Burfield said: “Thankfully success in kiwi and pelican conservation shows that, when well resourced and supported, conservation efforts really do pay off.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/12/climate-change-overfishing-push-seabirds-to-extinction

“You want to talk about something that saves lives? It’s the access to energy around the globe,” Perry said, countering a woman worried about deadly hurricanes and a man whose hometown is being submerged by the rising Philippine Sea. “I am proud to be a part of this industry. I am proud to be an American.”
It was an opportunity for the former Texas governor to champion an industry he’d long embraced by showing fealty to the petroleum council, an arcane federal advisory committee dominated by energy executives. Picking up on Perry’s message was interior secretary Ryan Zinke, who has pledged to fast-track drilling and open more areas to fossil-fuel development.
The two took turns reassuring the council’s nearly 200 members during a meeting at the opulent Hay-Adams hotel in Washington DC, that the White House would be a friend, not foe, to big oil. “We’re now in the business of being partners, rather than adversaries,” Zinke said. “If I were in the industry, I’d be pretty happy.”
It wasn’t the first time that global warming had been cast aside by the energy department’s petroleum council, successor to a wartime body created by Harry Truman. In 1972, the council buried the industry’s own climate research with the help of top executives at the  American Petroleum Institute, a longtime ally that once shared a building with the council.
API has gone beyond the lobbying typical of trade associations, helping spawn permanent substructures within the executive branch that ensure its voice is heard. These government entities, which include the petroleum council and an obscure but powerful White House office, have for decades worked in tandem with API to fortify the oil and gas industry, often, its critics say, at the public’s expense.
API’s history on climate issues goes back farther than most realize. As early as 1959, it grappled with global warming, hosting a conference where the looming, manmade catastrophe was discussed. As the environmental movement was blossoming, API – with the government’s support – was working behind the scenes to undermine it by distorting projections of regulatory costs. An enduring false narrative was constructed: the economy or the environment.
For nearly a century, API has enjoyed special access to the executive branch, furtively shaping policy from the inside. Now, under Donald Trump, the industry smells victory on multiple fronts with a White House that openly detests regulation as much as it does. Days before Trump’s inauguration, API president Jack Gerard heralded the “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to reshape energy policy.
Fifty-two environmental rules have since been overturned or are in the process of being rolled back. API has publicly supported at least 23 of these actions. In May, the institute also sent a  25-page wish list to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Among the items it wants reconsidered: tougher standards for ozone – the main ingredient in smog – and regulation of methane, a greenhouse gas that is far more potent than carbon dioxide.
API officials did not respond to interview requests.
On its website, the institute says, “We negotiate with regulatory agencies, represent the industry in legal proceedings, participate in coalitions and work in partnership with other associations to achieve our members’ public policy goals.”
“I asked my staff for a joke, but it’s still going through cost-benefit analysis,” Neomi Rao said from a podium in October, drawing hearty laughs from a mostly male crowd of lobbyists, lawyers and policy analysts at the Heritage Foundation – a conservative thinktank based in Washington.
It was a tongue-in-cheek nod to the little-known agency Rao has led since July – the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which she called a “small but mighty” division of the White House Office of Management and Budget. “If you are a very pro-regulatory administration, then you are not going to appreciate the work that OIRA does,” Rao warned the audience, likening her office to a “roadblock” against burdensome policies that hurt the economy. “The pace and scope of deregulation that’s occurred is truly unprecedented, and we’re just getting started.”

Standard Oil’s monopoly is broken up by the US supreme court. The trust which had been set up by John D Rockefeller in 1882, had gained control of nearly 90% of US oil production.
The US joins the first world war and supplies allied forces with oil. President Woodrow Wilson appoints multiple oil executives to war-effort committees and nationalises the railways.
Brought together by the war, oil executives form a trade body, the American Petroleum Institute (API) in 1919. Ten years later, another trade association, the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) is formed to represent smaller companies.
During the second world war, the US government worked closely with the oil industry, putting a federal  investigation into its monopolistic practices on hold. A peacetime version of a wartime committee becomes the National Petroleum Council, an advisory committee that exists today.

President Trump announces the US exit from the Paris climate agreement, citing industry-hired economists that call the accord a bad deal for US businesses. Supporting the move is Scott Pruitt, a climate-change sceptic, who Trump appointed to head the EPA.
Rao – a constitutional scholar who clerked for conservative supreme court Justice Clarence Thomas and often shared pizza with the late Antonin Scalia – has embraced her role as “regulatory czar”, pledging to surpass a Trump executive order to eliminate two existing regulations for each one created. Her staff of roughly 50 reviews the costs and benefits of all major federal rules, providing the stamp of approval needed to turn proposals into regulations – or spiking them.
Though she is an ardent supporter of leaner and more restrained government, she plans to staff up OIRA and broaden its powers.
How, exactly, she’ll do this is a mystery – much like the inner workings of OIRA itself. The agency has routinely come up short of basic transparency guidelines recommended by the Government Accountability Office, garnering a reputation on Capitol Hill as a black box that heavily edits or kills regulations with little explanation in Republican and Democratic administrations alike. Cass Sunstein, who led the office during the Obama administration, has since defended the practice of derailing particular rules by putting them on a “shit list.”
While OIRA has resisted public scrutiny, it has held its doors open for industry. 
Since April 2014, 35 of OIRA’s 712 meetings on proposed EPA regulations have been with API representatives – including a 2015 conference call with the institute’s president, Gerard, over ozone. The institute, along with the American Chemistry Council and ExxonMobil, ranked among the top 10 groups that met with OIRA from 2001 to 2011. Such encounters wield influence: a 2015 study by University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers found the agency was more likely to edit rules when lobbied by industry than by public interest groups. Rao’s office did not respond to requests for comment, but on its website OIRA notes it will meet with “any party interested in discussing issues on a rule under review”.
Bias toward industry can be traced to its founding. Though OIRA was created in 1980, its roots date to the EPA’s formation in 1970. As a counterweight, Richard Nixon established the National Industrial Pollution Control Council, an advisory committee within the Commerce Department made up entirely of industry executives.
Members regularly reviewed and commented on draft regulations before they were released to the public, weighing in on matters such as leaded gasoline and the Clean Air Act.
Industry members of the committee – which was overseen by secretary of commerce Maurice Stans – coordinated a public-relations effort emphasizing the enormous costs the oil industry claimed it was absorbing to improve the environment.
In February 1971, the pollution committee advised Nixon aides to prioritize costs. The White House budget office obliged that October by creating a new program called Quality of Life Review, which assessed major environment, health and safety regulations. Tapped to lead the agency was bureaucrat Jim Tozzi, who had shown a passion for deregulation at the US Army Corps of Engineers.
Quality of Life became all about reining in the EPA, Tozzi explained during an interview with the Center for Public Integrity. Occupying a floor of the Executive Office Building next to the White House, his office quickly went to work on the EPA’s proposed Clean Air Act guidelines. “I was like a little despot,” Tozzi said. “Somebody needed to regulate the regulators.”
Under Jimmy Carter, the Quality of Life program became OIRA in 1980, with Tozzi as deputy administrator. In 1983, Tozzi left the agency to join a law firm headed by William Ruckelshaus – the EPA’s first administrator, a Nixon appointee and an early champion of cost-benefit analysis. Tozzi now runs the Center for Regulatory Effectiveness, a think tank he founded and staffed with former OIRA employees that assesses regulations.
Tozzi said his plan for policing the EPA – and every other federal agency – has survived nine consecutive administrations and looks bright under Rao. “The Trump administration,” he said admiringly, “has gotten the number of regulations going out to a trickle.”
As Nixon’s pollution control committee quietly lobbied on industry’s behalf, the National Petroleum Council was doing its part to paint Big Oil as a linchpin of the US economy.
A council environmental report in 1972 – prompted by an oil spill off Santa Barbara, California, three years earlier that left an estimated 3m gallons of crude oil in the Pacific – cast the disaster as an anomaly and urged government to continue fostering oil and gas development.
Citing research by API, the report also played down climate change. “Carbon dioxide concentrations do appear to be increasing for reasons not well understood,” the council wrote, adding that scientists would have to wait until the year 2000 to determine “whether or not a serious problem exists”. Even if the gas were having an effect, controlling such a ubiquitous pollutant could “impose impossible administrative and enforcement burdens”.
But things weren’t as ambiguous as the council made them sound. API papers on atmospheric pollutants in 1968 and 1969 made it clear that rising carbon dioxide levels came from the burning of fossil fuels and that warming was inevitable. The 1968 paper warned that there could be “melting of the Antarctic ice cap, a rise in sea levels [and] warming of the oceans”, while the 1969 paper noted that carbon dioxide levels would rise “as our combustion economy continues to consume increasing amounts of fossil fuel”. Several authors of the petroleum council’s report likely knew this, given that they were top API officials – including the president, Frank Ikard, and public-affairs executive PM Gammelgard. 
Carroll Muffett, president of the Center for International Environmental Law, an advocacy group that tracked down the climate studies says API’s research during the 1960s makes the case “compellingly that the science is really sound”.
Muffett claims the petroleum council’s report is proof that high-level API executives were aware of the grave threats of warming and worked to hide the revelations.
Digging through archives, Stanford University researcher Ben Franta found what he believes is API’s earliest public reckoning with climate change: a November 1959 conference it hosted at Columbia University where a renowned scientist posited the emerging threat before 300 “government officials, economists, historians, scientists and executives”.
Within years, API was feverishly commissioning air-pollution research that resulted in the 1968 and 1969 papers. “API had this long-running awareness of climate change and climate science, and in that history the message they were getting from scientists was that climate change was real,” said Franta, who is writing his dissertation on the trade group’s activities. “If they wanted to head off that threat, they were going to have to think about acting then.”
API leaders have played key roles at the National Petroleum Council, a federal body chartered in 1946 whose reports claim to be nonpartisan and in the national interest. The council’s roots date back to World War II as a quasi-government agency that aided the war effort. It later became an adviser to the interior department and is now attached to the energy department, which did not respond to requests for comment. Members of the privately funded council are prohibited from lobbying and self-dealing but a review of its secretive, 71-year history shows it has long carried water for industry, minimizing environmental concerns while promoting deeper and riskier drilling. 
The council refused to provide the Center for Public Integrity with any of its subcommittee records, and declined to provide all documents prior to 1973 – including records underlying its 1972 environmental report. Its executive director declined to comment.
The council’s composition and views have been fodder for complaints from those outside of industry. Its leaders have been the biggest, loudest voices in oil; until February, former ExxonMobil CEO and current secretary of state Rex Tillerson was council chairman. Halliburton CEO Dick Cheney led the group before he became vice-president in 2001.
Of 192 members on the council’s roster, 144 come from the oil and gas industry. Over its lifetime, the council claims, almost a third of its 2,800 recommendations have been “fully implemented”.
These recommendations – to open more of the Arctic to drilling, for example – stand a good chance of being embraced by the Trump administration. At the petroleum council’s meeting in September, energy secretary Perry put his audience at ease. “The government’s not going to be in your way,” he said.

Large companies, investors and national and local governments met in Paris on Tuesday to celebrate the second anniversary of the signing of the landmark 2015 agreement, which bound nearly all developed and developing countries for the first time to keep global temperatures below 2C, the threshold scientists regard as the limit of safety.
Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, arranged the One Planet conference to bring together governments, businesses and others to help find ways to meet the Paris goals. It followed a meeting of governments in Bonn, Germany, last month under the auspices of the UN, aimed at fleshing out the technicalities of the Paris agreement.
Donald Trump, president of the US, has vowed to withdraw his country from the agreement, but this action cannot take effect until November 2020, the day after that year’s US presidential election.
The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change said its members and related groups, with more than $26tn under management in total, would work with companies to help them reduce emissions over the next five years, in accordance with the Paris goals. This would not include divesting from companies with large fossil fuel holdings, however.
Companies also made pledges: for instance, the French insurer Axa, the world’s third-largest insurance company, said it would divest €2.4bn in coal assets and €700m in tar sands assets, and put in place a new policy of not investing in companies with more than 30% of their power or revenues from coal, or planning to build more than 3,000MW of coal-fired electricity generation.
Local governments signed the One Planet charter, which requires cities and their mayors to use their public procurement and policy decisions to promote green technology, including renewable energy and zero-emissions buildings, as well as better arrangements for waste and recycling.
Nearly 200 civil society organisations, from nearly 60 countries, called on governments at the meeting to end subsidies and public finance for fossil fuels, and for the World Bank to end fossil fuel finance. The signatories included Greenpeace, the Climate Action Network, WWF, Christian Aid and Oil Change International.
A group of economists including Jeffrey Sachs and Yanis Varoufakis also called for no more to be spent on fossil fuels, while more than 50 companies including Adidas, Alliance, H&amp;M and Philips signed another declaration calling for the polluting fuels to be phased out.
But green campaigners were concerned that the measures announced at the conference were insufficient to drive forward the Paris agreement goals.
Rachel Kennerley, of Friends of the Earth, said: “[The conference] should resolutely move cold hard cash away from dirty, polluting energy, and instead invest in clean energy, if we are to avoid the earth’s temperature rising by 3C [which scientists say is likely on current trends]. The [One Planet conference] will fail if it just delivers a rehash of previous commitments, because the scale of the challenge faced clearly cries out for a radical and immediate response.”
Alex Doukas, of Oil Change International, said companies were still investing in, and receiving government funding for, “exploration for more oil and gas that can never be burned if we have any hope of limiting the damage from climate change.”
Lord Stern, former chief economist of the World Bank, and author of the 2006 review of the economist of climate change that found tackling emissions would be much less costly than the effects of global warming, also called on Europe to take a lead. He said the current price on carbon under the European emissions trading scheme was too low, and called for a price of $40 to $80 a tonne of carbon dioxide by 2020 in order to reach the Paris agreement goals.
He said: “Fossil fuels must be confronted with their real costs, and polluters must pay, if markets are to work and emissions are to fall at the rate necessary. However, a carbon price by itself cannot deliver the required design of cities and networks that will be crucial to reducing emissions on the scale necessary. Carbon pricing must be supported by other policies to drive the low-carbon transition [including] regulation to drive out coal from our power systems quickly, and stopping the sale of new cars powered by fossil fuels over the next couple of decades.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/12/calls-for-greater-fossil-fuel-divestment-at-anniversary-of-paris-climate-deal

The EU funds will form part of the bloc’s External Investment Plan, and will be focused on sustainable cities, clean energy and sustainable agriculture. The announcement was made at the One Planet Summit in Paris on Tuesday, held to mark the second anniversary of the landmark 2015 pact. 
French president Emmanuel Macron hailed the progress made at the event and said it was possible to create alternatives to the fossil-fuel driven economy, but that more effort was needed globally.
Miguel Arias Cañete, commissioner for climate action and energy for the EU, said the Paris agreement was already resulting in more investment flowing to moves to combat global warming. He said: “These kinds of investments are of critical importance if we are to move from aspirations to action. The EU’s plan will scale up much-needed investments across Africa and the EU neighbourhood region.”
He said new jobs would be created, and the knock-on effects would include poverty reduction, improved health and better access to technology in poorer regions.
Neven Mimica, commissioner for international cooperation and development, added that the aims included supporting the digitalisation of small and medium-sized companies, essential for sustainable development and reducing poverty.
The EU and its member states are the world’s biggest providers of climate finance, with a total of more than €20bn provided to developing countries last year.
Other measures unveiled at the conference included large companies, such as the French insurer Axa and the ING bank, partially divesting from fossil fuels, and local governments from across the world signing up to improved goals on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
Theresa May, the UK prime minister, said developed countries had a responsibility to help the world’s poor adapt to the expected ravages of climate change, and pledged £140m to poor countries to help them do so.
However, the Liberal Democrats attacked her participation, arguing that the government had failed to put the UK on track to achieve its goals on emissions reduction, for instance by withdrawing support for clean energy and selling off the Green Investment Bank, a move which was criticised by the government watchdog. Lynne Featherstone, the Lib Dem spokeswoman on energy and climate, said: “I don’t know how Theresa May has the front to show her face [at the international conference]. Her record on the environment is a disgrace – she has failed to take the ambitious steps needed to decarbonise our economy and protect our planet.”
The World Bank vowed to phase out most of its finance for oil and gas by 2019, and publish more data on the impacts of its investments on climate change. The group, which has been criticised by environmental campaigners for failing to take action on its fossil fuel investments in the past, also formed a partnership with the Global Covenant of Mayors aimed at providing $4.5bn for cities to adapt to the effects of climate change. 
Bill Gates, one of the world’s richest men, also joined the pledges, vowing that his philanthropic foundation would devote $300m (£225m) to helping the world’s poorest farmers adapt to the effects of climate change.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will spend the sum over the next three years, providing smallholders in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia with the means to protect their farms from the droughts, heatwaves and floods that are expected to be the result of a changing climate. The money will be spent through governments and direct grants.
Nick Austin, director of agricultural development at the foundation, told the Guardian he expected poor farmers to bear the brunt of climatic changes, at a time when the world’s burgeoning population is putting ever greater pressure on food supplies.
Adaptation to the effects of climate change, also termed resilience, has become a greater focus for environmentalists as scientists have warned that some changes to the climate are becoming inevitable, even if the world succeeds in limiting global temperature rises to 2C.
Austin said: “We recognise that adaptation has been a vastly under-invested opportunity . [There is] an upside in economic opportunities for resilience to climate change. Agriculture will benefit, but there is still a long way to go.”
In a separate move, Microsoft will spend $50m on artificial intelligence technology aimed at protecting the planet against climate change, the company said on Tuesday.
Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, told the Guardian the investment would spur technological change that would help deliver clean energy and cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions.
He gave the example of using artificial intelligence to create “smart” buildings, that would use less energy by responding to and anticipating their occupants’ behaviour. It could also be used in agriculture to increase crop yields in the face of the effects of global warming, which is expected to cause droughts, floods and heatwaves across the globe.
However, not everyone was impressed by the deals emerging from the One Planet summit. Brandon Wu, director of policy and at ActionAid USA, said the poor were still being short-changed by rich countries. 
“Despite the hype, the One Planet summit delivering little for the world’s people who are most vulnerable to climate change,” he said. “People in poor countries already living with increasingly severe hurricanes, floods and other disasters made worse by the climate crisis, need commitments for real money from rich countries.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/12/eu-announces-9bn-in-funding-for-climate-action

It was bound to happen. In fact, my colleagues have planned for this. More on that later.
On December 4th, the folks in the Climate Monitoring group at the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) did what we do pretty much every 4th of the month: we processed the previous month's data to prepare our initial US climate report. The data from Utqiaġvik, Alaska, was missing, which was odd. It was also missing for all of 2017 and the last few months of 2016. This was even weirder, because we knew we’d kinda marveled at how insanely warm the station had been for several weeks and months during 2017.
What happened?The short version: in an ironic exclamation point to swift regional climate change in and near the Arctic, the average temperature observed at the weather station at Utqiaġvik has now changed so rapidly that it triggered an algorithm designed to detect artificial changes in a station’s instrumentation or environment and disqualified itself from the NCEI Alaskan temperature analysis, leaving northern Alaska analyzed a little cooler than it really was.
How did that happen? Why is it important? What are the impacts?

We get those warnings from governments, even the climate-denying ""conservative"" governments (which hate conservation more than just about anything), one of which recently invented a new, climate change era category of bushfire: Catastrophic.
This is not just because people build wooden homes in the paths of bushfires on the edges of expanding cities, although that does seem a silly thing to do. Climate change (the sort we are dealing with) typically causes less rain to fall in many places, leading to tinder-dry vegetation in places where more moisture would usually prevent fires or make them less extreme. California has been in the grip of a years-long drought, so its fires this year are unprecedented in living memory and records. Many reservoirs have long been empty, so there is also a lot less water available to fight the fires once they start, making them last longer and destroy more properties, even those not built in foolish places.
In tropical rainforests elsewhere, climate change has dried out forests that were previously much too wet to burn at all, causing enormous and unprecedented damage. Once a forest like this has burned once, it will be easier to light again because its means of preserving moisture has been crippled. It doesn't matter that many of these fires are started by humans wanting to clear land for beef cattle or oil palms, the fact is that it would be very hard to burn trees that had their normal amount of moisture preserved in their trunks and the soil, without dousing the whole forest in petrol first.
So the California fires, while not solely attributable to climate change, have been made much worse by the predictable effects of climate change. In much the same way that smoking a single cigarette won't kill you, but a lifetime of smoking will set you up for cancer. And the climate deniers, like the cancer deniers (after all, they are the same people in some cases) will continue to draw succour from the public's ignorance of a very complicated issue like climate science and climate change.

They are working to understand how fast it is occurring, which areas are changing fastest and why, and how the mechanics of rapid climate change actually work so that we can do something to make our future on this planet something better than a living hell.
It's a cute reversal of the professional climate deniers' argument to claim that the climate deniers themselves do not exist. Sadly they do exist, and are richly rewarded by the fossil fuel companies whose interests their propaganda serves. Much more richly rewarded than the legitimate climate and other scientists could ever dream of being for their work. And yes, it's likely that fossil fuel companies know that climate change is an existential threat to life on Earth (our human lives anyway, and especially our complex global civilisation), and may even occasionally say in their publicity material that they want to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, but experience shows us that their main priority is to keep the gravy train they have been riding for a century going regardless of the consequences for the rest of us, or even for their own children. They think that their ill-gotten wealth will somehow protect them. Maybe it was something they were told at Davos by those economists who have consistently failed to predict the economic future, let along something complex like climate change.
If you want to see an end to wasting money, you could start by charging all the career climate deniers with fraud and locking them up without food, water or medical care, like Australia already does to people who have committed no crime. Then you could end the many billions of taxpayer-funded subsidies and handouts paid annually by corrupt governments to the climate deniers' patrons, the fossil fuel and associated companies, and Murdoch style propaganda agencies. You could also save about a trillion dollars annually by making those entities pay their full taxes. Ending funding to pointless research into things that will never exist like ""clean"" coal and ""windfarm syndrome"" would save millions more.

So the expansion of Climate Change research was absolutely and completely essential to get this message across.
I also agree that now we have established this a truth, we should invest everything we've got on engineering solutions and lifestyle alternatives that will rapidly reduce our impact and start to clean up what we've done so far

The annual report released on Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration showed slightly less warming in many measurements than a record hot 2016. But scientists remain concerned because the far northern region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the globe and has reached a level of warming that’s unprecedented in modern times.
The Arctic has traditionally been the refrigerator to the planet, but the door of the refrigerator has been left open
“2017 continued to show us we are on this deepening trend where the Arctic is a very different place than it was even a decade ago,” said Jeremy Mathis, head of NOAA’s Arctic research program and co-author of the 93-page report.
Findings were discussed at the American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans.
“What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic; it affects the rest of the planet,” said acting NOAA chief Timothy Gallaudet. “The Arctic has huge influence on the world at large.”
Permafrost records show the frozen ground that many buildings, roads and pipelines are built on reached record warm temperatures last year nearing and sometimes exceeding the thawing point. That could make them vulnerable when the ground melts and shifts, the report said. Unlike other readings, permafrost data tend to lag a year.
Preliminary reports from the US and Canada in 2017 showed permafrost temperatures are “again the warmest for all sites” measured in North America, said study co-author Vladimir Romanovsky, a professor at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks.
Arctic sea ice usually shrinks in September and this year it was only the eighth lowest on record for the melting season. But scientists said they were most concerned about what happens in the winter – especially March – when sea ice is supposed to be building to its highest levels.
Arctic winter sea ice maximum levels in 2017 were the smallest they’ve ever been for the season when ice normally grows. It was the third straight year of record low winter sea ice recovery. Records go back to 1979.
About 79% of the Arctic sea ice is thin and only a year old. In 1985, 45% of the sea ice in the Arctic was thick, older ice, said NOAA Arctic scientist Emily Osborne.
New research looking into the Arctic’s past using ice cores, fossils, corals and shells as stand-ins for temperature measurements show that Arctic ocean temperatures are rising and sea ice levels are falling at rates not seen in the 1,500 years. And those dramatic changes coincide with the large increase in carbon dioxide levels in the air, the report said.
This isn’t just a concern for the few people who live north of the Arctic circle. Changes in the Arctic can alter fish supply. And more ice-free Arctic summers can lead to countries competing to exploit new areas for resources. Research also shows changes in Arctic sea ice and temperature can alter the jet stream, which is a major factor in US weather.
This is probably partly responsible for the current unusual weather in the United States that brought destructive wildfires to California and a sharp cold snap to the south and east, according to NOAA scientist James Overland and private meteorologist expert Judah Cohen.
“The Arctic has traditionally been the refrigerator to the planet, but the door of the refrigerator has been left open,” Mathis said.
Outside scientists praised the report card.
“Overall, the new data fit with the long-term trends, showing the clear evidence of warming causing major changes,” in the Arctic, said Pennsylvania State University ice scientist Richard Alley.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/12/arctic-permafrost-sea-ice-thaw-climate-change-report

Last week it was Hammerson, the Birmingham Bullring folk, bidding for Intu, owner of Gateshead’s Metrocentre.
Now, on grander scale, French giant Unibail-Rodamco is paying $25bn (£18.5bn) to own Westfield, the Australian outfit that has erected its multistorey car parks, with malls attached, in east and west London.
The new duo claimed “compelling” rationale for the deal but never quite got round to saying what it’s supposed to be. It can’t be the cost savings since they are tiny in the context of a company that will own €61bn-worth of assets. 
The savings are worth just €100m, of which only €60m is attributed to eliminating “corporate overheads”, which presumably means closing Westfield’s Australian office.
Instead, the impetus for this deal seems to be the idea that greater size offers better protection from the rise of online shopping. The new firm will certainly be big. Unibail brings 69 shopping centres in Europe, including Forum des Halles in Paris. Westfield, aside from the two London sites, has interests in 33 centres in the US.
At the margin, maybe size helps. An international fashion brand seeking shops across Europe and the US could save time and hassle by making a single call to the Unibail/Westfield combo. 
In the end, though, property is always local. It’s hard to understand why painting the “world famous Westfield brand” on the Unibail centres is supposed to pull in more punters. Even the two London Westfields feel very different.
The calculation, then, is that investment risk in the age of Amazon is best spread across a broader portfolio of properties. That’s not so silly from the point of view of Sir Frank Lowy, Westfield’s 87-year-old founder, who regards Unibail as “the natural home” for the business he built. But a compelling logic? The rush to consolidate looks more like a defensive kneejerk reaction.
When Donald Trump began the process of pulling the US out of the Paris agreement on climate change in June, a few optimists suggested there might be a silver lining to his damaging action. The rest of the world might be so appalled that it would show greater unity.
The good news, to judge by three developments this week in the financial world, is that there are reasons to be cheerful. First, the World Bank said it will no longer finance upstream oil and gas projects after 2019; the only exceptions will be in the poorest countries where other sources are energy are hard to secure. 
Second, Bank of England governor Mark Carney announced that an initiative to push companies to reveal their direct and indirect exposures to global warming is gaining traction. 
The UK’s big six banks have signed up and are committed to saying how much they have lent to companies that pose the biggest risks to the climate. Eight out of 10 of the largest asset managers and insurance companies are also part of the effort and say they are committed to financing a lower-carbon global economy.
Third, US oil giant ExxonMobil has finally agreed to bow to its shareholders’ wishes and reveal data on how governments’ actions to limit the increase in global temperatures will affect its business. We await details, but at least Exxon, after years of resistance, has accepted that it must publish.
These are all small steps – and, note, greater disclosure of risks is not the same as mitigating actions. But they are welcome signs. 
So is the fact that, while there was no official US presence at the Paris summit at which Carney spoke, there were plenty of American non-government organisations and city mayors. Trump’s lead, it seems, is being rightly ignored.
H/2 Capital Partners, when it takes ownership of Four Seasons, the UK’s largest care homes operator, must open up and tell us what it stands for.
The reticent style was vaguely understandable while H/2 was buying up Four Seasons’ debt at a discount to face value. But, when it claims control of the business from current owner Terra Firma, the US hedge fund will be responsible for the care of 17,000 elderly people who will want to know that it brings more to the industry than a keen eye for property values.
Spencer Haber, H/2’s founder, apparently likes cats, dogs and toucans (he produced a film about the latter). It’s not much to go on, and there’s no point checking the corporate website for past deals because there isn’t one.
Bland statements about bringing “responsible private capital” are not enough. Who are you, and what’s your track record in the US?",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/dec/12/westfield-sale-amazon-shopping-centres

In a statement that delighted campaigners opposed to fossil fuels, the Bank used a conference in Paris to announce that it “will no longer finance upstream oil and gas” after 2019.
The Bank ceased lending for coal-fired power stations in 2010 but has been under pressure from lobby groups also to halt the $1bn (£750m) a year it has been lending for oil and gas in developing countries.
The Bank said it saw the need to change the way it was operating in a “rapidly changing world”, adding that it was on course to have 28% of its lending going to climate action by 2020. At present, 1-2% of the Bank’s $280bn portfolio is accounted for by oil and gas projects.
In exceptional circumstances, the Bank said it would consider lending for oil and gas projects in the very poorest countries but only where it helped the poor get access to energy and the project did not conflict with commitments to reduce greenhouse gases made in the 2015 Paris climate change accord.
The announcement was made at the One Planet Summit, convened by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the World Bank president, Yim Yong Kim, and the UN secretary general, António Guterres, to mark the two-year anniversary of the agreement.
The Greenpeace International climate campaigner Gyorgy Dallos said: “The end is clearly coming for the oil and gas industry as the pace of change accelerates.”
Dallos said the Bank had sent a damning vote of no confidence in the future of the fossil fuel industry. “The world’s financial institutions now need to take note and decide whether their financing is going to be part of the problem or the solution,” he said.
Stephen Kretzmann, an executive director of the Washington-based advocacy group Oil Change International, said: “It is hard to overstate the significance of this historic announcement by the World Bank.
“Environmental, human rights, and development campaigners have been amplifying the voices of frontline communities for decades in calling for an end to World Bank financing of upstream oil and gas projects. [Now] the World Bank has raised the bar for climate leadership by recognising the simple yet inconvenient truth that achieving the Paris agreement’s climate goals requires an end to the expansion of the fossil fuel industry. It is time for all of the institutions, countries, investors and individuals who are still in the Paris agreement to stop funding fossils – once and for all.”
The World Bank announcement came as the Bank of England’s governor revealed that there was growing global support for a new initiative designed to help pave the way for a low-carbon economy by persuading companies to come clean about their exposure to climate change risks.
Speaking at the Paris summit, Carney said 237 companies with a combined market capitalisation of $6.3tn (£4.7tn) were now backing the scheme.
Britain’s six leading banks – Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and Standard Chartered – have all supported the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, set up by Carney in his role as chairman of the Financial Stability Board, an international body charged with preventing a repeat of the 2008 banking crisis. 
Under the plan, companies pledge to use their financial reports to disclose their direct and indirect exposure to global warming under a range of different scenarios. Banks are obliged to say how much they have lent to companies with climate-related risks.
Carney said 20 of the 30 globally systemically important banks and eight out of 10 of the largest asset managers and leading insurance companies were committed to informing investors. Leading construction, consumer goods, transport, mining and energy companies have also signed up.
“Markets need the right information to seize the opportunities and mitigate the risks that are being created by the transition to a low-carbon economy,” Carney said. “This solution, of the market and for the market, is truly entering the mainstream.”
UK sources said that London was becoming a hub for climate change-related finance, with green bonds issued in more than 40 different currencies, including the Indian rupee and the Chinese yuan. 

Michael Bloomberg, the chair of the taskforce, said: “Climate change poses both economic risks and opportunities. But right now, companies don’t have the data they need to accurately measure the risks and evaluate the opportunities.”

Sadly I live in his electorate, (though it's a nice part of the world, no thanks to him) I've only ever seen him once in a decade, though he turns up at every minor community event, or letter opening in the area for a photo op.

Such a downpour was a very rare event, scientists said, but global warming meant it was 15% more intense. The storm left 80 people dead and 800,000 in need of assistance.
The scientists from the World Weather Attribution (WWA) initiative usually publish their assessments of the role of climate change in extreme weather events around the world as soon as possible. However, in this case they waited for the work to be confirmed by peer review because of the current US government’s opposition to strong action on climate change.
The researchers said their new work shows global warming is making extreme weather events worse right now and in the US. The cost of the damage caused by Hurricane Harvey has been estimated at $190bn (£140bn), which would make it the most costly weather disaster in US history, more than Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy combined.
A series of new reports have found that extreme heatwaves, droughts, floods, storms and wildfires across the planet have been made more likely or more intense by rising global temperatures. The UK’s Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) analysed 59 studies of the influence of climate change on extreme weather published in the last two years and found warming has made matters worse in 70% of cases and better in just 7%.
Another report, published on Wednesday by the American Meteorological Society, assesses 21 different extreme weather events in 2016, from US snowstorms and South African drought to ocean hotspots and Arctic heating. Most of the events can be attributed, at least in part, to human-caused climate change, the scientists found.
Hurricane Harvey made first landfall on 25 August and then stalled over Texas, with torrential downpours dumping a year’s worth of rain on Houston and surrounding areas in a few days. In east Harris County, a record 132cm (52 inches) of rain fell over six days, the highest storm total in US history.
The WWA scientists used both historical rainfall records and high-resolution climate models to determine the influence of global warming. “This multi-method analysis confirms that heavy rainfall events are increasing substantially across the Gulf Coast region because of human interference with our climate system,” said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) and lead author of the new study published in Environmental Research Letters.
“It was very a rare event – they were very unlucky,” said van Oldenborgh. But the research shows the chance of it happening was raised threefold by climate change. 
The team also estimated that, even if the world limits warming to the internationally agreed 2C limit, the likelihood of such extreme downpours will triple again. “But, if we miss those targets, the increase in frequency and intensity could be much higher,” said Karin van der Wiel, also at KNMI. 
“The link between global warming and more extreme weather is nowhere more obvious than in the US. Even if Donald Trump isn’t seeing the picture, many others are,” said Richard Black at the ECIU.
Friederike Otto, at Oxford University, said: “We’re now finding that for many kinds of extreme weather event, especially heatwaves and extreme rainfall, we can be quite confident about the effect of climate change. The ECIU report shows just how quickly knowledge is accumulating, and I think it’s only going to accelerate.”
Climate scientists have long predicted that global warming would increase extreme weather, based on simple physics that means warmer air can contain more water vapour and therefore lead to more intense rain. 
Major storms are powered by the warmth of the water at the ocean’s surface, and therefore hotter seas lead to more violent storms. But the fast developing science of climate change attribution now means the role of climate change in many events happening today can be clearly seen.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/global-warming-made-hurricane-harvey-deadly-rains-three-times-more-likely-research-shows

not one tropical hurricane made landfall in continental USA
BQENDPray tell what is a ""tropical hurricane""? I know what a hurricane is, what a tropical storm is and what a typhoon is. Perhaps it is a hurricane in the tropics? Then since the contiguous lower 48 US has no landmass in the tropics your statement would be tautological.
Now in terms of hurricanes, many storms of saffir simpson 1+ made landfall in the time you specified.
As for the ""landfalling US"" meme, Atlantic basic tropical storms account for something in the order of 11% of global tropical storm activity. The contiguous US is pretty much at the end of their range, so small changes in atmospheric circulation can steer them further out too sea without any change in frequency. (Obviously a tiny number hop to the Pacific).
Now our friend was trying, (ever so trying) to interject a dispute something or other. One has to be charitable with such folk, however the paper cited does raise a new metric for global tropical storm activity and to dispute its conclusion one would need an argument that the metric is wrong or the trend is somehow confounded.
Had you some more wit about you on this fine wintery morning and were super keen on the Atlantic, you could have READ the paper (oh how I amuse myself) and produced this:

BQSTART
igure 1 | A measure of the total power dissipated annually by tropicalcyclones in the North Atlantic (the power dissipation index, PDI) comparedto September sea surface temperature (SST).The PDI has been multipliedby 2.1 £ 102 12and the SST, obtained from the Hadley Centre Sea Ice andSST data set (HadISST)22, is averaged over a box bounded in latitude by 68 Nand 188 N, and in longitude by 208 W and 608 W. Both quantities have beensmoothed twice using equation (3), and a constant offset has been added tothe temperature data for ease of comparison. Note that total Atlantichurricane power dissipation has more than doubled in the past 30 yr.
BQEND
And were one to be keen to underplay the human CO2 link one could have cited Dunstone 2013

Anthropogenic aerosol forcing of Atlantic tropical storms
But as so often with me, beware geeks bearing links, we are seeing an increase in Atlantic tropical storm (TC) power dissapation index (PDI) that correlates with sea surface temperatures. Some of that correlation may be due to a reduction in athropogenic aerosols. That means that not all of the current increase in PDI is human CO2 caused, but as we increase the CO2 in the atmosphere this WILL LIKELY INCREASE PDI.

There are about 8 million research scientists in the world.
Around 70,000 or so publish research papers connected to climate change.
The confusionist sites constantly quote the same handful of scientists, because they don't have anyone else.
Most of their handful are retired, and are connected to various political 'think-tanks' in the USA - and, in some cases, to fringe religious groups.
In fact, climate change is probably the most scrutinised area of science ever.
The current scientific position on climate change meets the standards of other scientific paradigms like evolution, plate tectonics, and relativity.
In contrast, the PR groups that promote climate confusionism have no professional standards to meet, and are only answerable to the vested interests which fund them.
As you pointed out, not one professional scientific organisation on Earth agrees with the so-called climate sceptics, not in any country, nor in any field of science.

The next ice age was not due to start for another 50,000 years.
The two main factors that have, for the last 2.6 million years, determined the temperature of the Earth's climate, are Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation (NHHLSI) and atmospheric CO2 level.
NHHLSI, which is determined by orbital and axial cycles of the planet known as Milankovitch Cycles, reached a peak 19,000 years ago melting glacial ice bordering the North Atlantic sending a pulse of fresh meltwater into that ocean which shut down the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) stopping the supply of cold deep dense water to the Southern Ocean resulting in warming of the Southern Ocean.
The warmer and then 40 metres shallower Southern Ocean oxidised high carbon deep sea oozes increasing atmospheric CO2 from 200 ppm to 280 ppm over 10,000 years and causing global greenhouse warming. The system which caused this global warming fed back positively for 10,000 years as the oceans rose 40 metres from 19,000 to 9,000 years ago. 
With an extra 40 metres of water covering the deep sea oozes CO2 levels steadied at 280 ppm and global temperatures remained steady for 4,000 years before starting to decline very slowly as NHHLSI declined very slowly in the face of 280 ppm CO2.
From 19,000 to 10,000 years ago temperatures rose as CO2 levels rose at about one fortieth of the current rate. Sea level rises at that stage, with that cryosphere, lagged the global temperature rises by around 200 years.
CO2 from the combustion of fossil fuels in very large quantities has produced a 40% increase in CO2 from 280 to 400 ppm in just around 100 to 150 years compared to the 10,000 years for the same percentage increase from 200 to 280 ppm.
For large parts of the last 2,000 years sea levels have not risen and if CO2 levels had stayed at 280 ppm while NHHLSI declined over the next 50,000 years toward what would have been the start of the next ice age, there is no reason to expect sea level would not have gone down as the Earth's climate cooled. However, CO2 in excess of 400 ppm completely overwhelms the cooling effect of declining NHHLSI and if the Earth's atmosphere still contains CO2 at they level 50,000 years hence the next ice age will be postponed.', u'recommendation_count': u'10', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1513226349000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': None, u'effect': u'warming of the southern ocean'}, {u'cause': u'the warmer and then 40 metres shallower southern ocean', u'effect': u'global greenhouse warming'}, {u'cause': u'which', u'effect': None}], u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'109653721', u'id': u'109684630', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'surferdave', u'text': u'Erik, please please stop pushing that outdated Manuel paper. 12 years old already and in the next 10 years after publication in 2005 not one tropical hurricane made landfall in continental USA.

I gave the talk at the University of Iowa in 2004 and at the 2005 meeting of the American Geophysical Union. 
This led to calls from the White House to NASA headquarters and I was told that I could not give any talks or speak with the media without prior explicit approval by NASA headquarters.
After I informed the New York Times about these restrictions, NASA was forced to end the censorship. But there were consequences. 
I had been using the first line of the NASA mission statement, ""To understand and protect the home planet,"" to justify my talks. Soon the first line of the mission statement was deleted, never to appear again.

I think many also has well to read this simple - and yet comprehensive and well linked walk-through on hurricanes with focus on US but with some reflections on global data as well

It is really important to get the message across that AGW does NOT mean that we should start to see all measurements line up as in some perfect North Korean show of perfect synchronicity and parallell patterns. 
A lot of the signals we search for are retrieved by good old Fourier analysis or wavelets (yay for the Abel-prize to Yves Meyer). Which means that many signals are not there to pick out as raw information. 
(We mention strength of hurricanes as kinetic energy alone, for example - whereas the latent heat budget is 400 times higher - affecting rain-dumping like a lot)
The information signal is so complex that it is not enough to just do some low/highpass filtering. One may need to wavelet it - or break it into principle components to understand it. 
Event-statistics - it is a beast on it's own as one must treat it as rank-order (at colleague levels). 
We must not teach ""disappointment"" from ""hiatus"" on events. Even global mean temperature can ""hiatus"". 
The system is chaotic. And if science is completely wrong on hurricanes (it is not according to forecasting) - that does not mean that AGW is wrong.
The difference between denial and science is that science follow evidence. This can not be said often enough.

One of many important systems NASA has to study climate are the GRACE gravity satellites which are excellent at keeping tabs on overall ice sheet mass balance.
A year or two ago the glaciologist Richard Alley pointed out an excellent reason to continue to fund ice dynamicists who are the scientists who specialize in potential rates of future sea level rise. He noted that our current atmospheric CO2 levels, if sustained long enough, would eventually raise sea levels enough to force 10 percent of the world's population to move.
Coastal planners would likely benefit from knowing whether to expect around a meter of sea level rise over the next 100 years, or 2 or more, and with the current state of glaciology, we can't say yet.

Here's a paper by Dr. Kerry Emanuel finding a trend, titled Increasing destructiveness of tropical cyclones over the past 30 years
BQSTART
Here I define an index of the potential destructiveness of hurricanes based on the total dissipation of power, integrated over the lifetime of the cyclone, and show that this index has increased markedly since the mid-1970s. 
This trend is due to both longer storm lifetimes and greater storm intensities. I find that the record of net hurricane power dissipation is highly correlated with tropical sea surface temperature, reflecting well-documented climate signals, including multi-decadal oscillations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and global warming. 
My results suggest that future warming may lead to an upward trend in tropical cyclone destructive potential, and—taking into account an increasing coastal population—a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-first century.

It was bound to happen. In fact, my colleagues have planned for this. More on that later.
On December 4th, the folks in the Climate Monitoring group at the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) did what we do pretty much every 4th of the month: we processed the previous month's data to prepare our initial US climate report. The data from Utqiaġvik, Alaska, was missing, which was odd. It was also missing for all of 2017 and the last few months of 2016. This was even weirder, because we knew we’d kinda marveled at how insanely warm the station had been for several weeks and months during 2017.
What happened?The short version: in an ironic exclamation point to swift regional climate change in and near the Arctic, the average temperature observed at the weather station at Utqiaġvik has now changed so rapidly that it triggered an algorithm designed to detect artificial changes in a station’s instrumentation or environment and disqualified itself from the NCEI Alaskan temperature analysis, leaving northern Alaska analyzed a little cooler than it really was.
How did that happen? Why is it important? What are the impacts?

The American Meteorological Society has a new synthesis report out on extreme weather of 2016
BQSTART
Over the past six years, more than 130 peerreviewed papers evaluating the potential connection between extreme weather and anthropogenic climate change have been presented in this annual special edition of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. Of the roughly 89 papers that did identify a climate change signal in the authors’ analysis of an extreme event, each found climate change had shifted the odds of an event happening. Prior to this year, however, none had determined that humancaused climate change was an essential factor in the occurrence of the event. In this year’s report, for the first time, we present three new research papers that conclude the extreme magnitude of a particular weather event was not possible without the influence of human-caused climate change
BQEND
BQSTART
Twenty-one of the 27 papers in this current edition identified climate change as a significant driver of an event, while six did not. Of the 131 papers now examined in this report over the last six years, approximately 65% have identified a role for climate change, while about 35% have not found an appreciable effect. Nevertheless, over the past six years, researchers have identified the robust influence of climate change on temperature-related extremes, making such hightemperature events quantifiably more intense and more frequent.

For at least the last 100 years, sea level has been rising at an average rate of about 1.8 mm (0.1 in) per year.[8] Most of this rise can be attributed to the increase in temperature of the sea and the resulting slight thermal expansion of the upper 500 metres (1,640 feet) of sea water. Additional contributions, as much as one-quarter of the total, come from water sources on land, such as melting snow and glaciers and extraction of groundwater for irrigation and other agricultural and human uses.[9]

Globally this is the widely accepted picture. 
BQSTART
We present new sea-level reconstructions for the past 2100 y based on salt-marsh sedimentary sequences from the US Atlantic coast. The data from North Carolina reveal four phases of persistent sea-level change after correction for glacial isostatic adjustment. Sea level was stable from at least BC 100 until AD 950. Sea level then increased for 400 y at a rate of 0.6 mm/y, followed by a further period of stable, or slightly falling, sea level that persisted until the late 19th century. Since then, sea level has risen at an average rate of 2.1 mm/y, representing the steepest century-scale increase of the past two millennia. This rate was initiated between AD 1865 and 1892. Using an extended semiempirical modeling approach, we show that these sea-level changes are consistent with global temperature for at least the past millennium.

But we certainly aren’t perfect; we’ve made some pretty silly choices. One of the dumb choices politicians in the United States want to make is to defund climate science so we wont be able to prepare for increased disasters in the future. We can see how shortsighted this in when compared alongside with the costs of disasters.
Just think about the respective magnitudes. Estimates put the costs of the three big 2017 hurricanes (Harvey, Irma, and Maria) at approximately $200 billion. It is somewhat challenging to estimate the actual cost because not only is there rebuilding that must occur, but there are also lingering damages from loss of power, dislocation of people, and other long-lasting factors. Some reports estimate that the damage may end up being as high as $300 billion – a staggering amount.
It isn’t just hurricanes that cause damage. As I write this, terrible fires are devastating parts of California, damaging property and agricultural lands. This is on top of earlier fires elsewhere in the region, which followed closely on record droughts that had persisted in the preceding five years.
Earlier in the year the United States had other disasters that reached a billion dollars or more in damages (two floods, seven severe storms among others). Noaa provides an excellent summary. 
These disasters are not limited to the United States, of course. Extreme weather fueled by human carbon pollution is occurring around the world. 
But in the midst of this, President Trump and many Republican elected officials want to decrease our spending on climate science. In the United States, we have flagship organizations like Nasa and Noaa that are our eyes and ears on the climate. But throughout the year, Trump has worked to get Nasa to sharply reduce or even stop climate research. Nasa has two main missions. One mission is exploration – going to Mars, the moon, and sending exploration satellites that look outward. The other part of Nasa’s mission is to look inwards, at our own planet. To do this, they use many instruments, including satellites to measure what is happening on Earth. 
Trump and his administration want to jettison the Earth research portion of Nasa’s mission. This obviously isn’t to save money; the amount we spend on Earth-focused missions is very small. Rather, it is to halt research into the Earth’s climate. The following chart compares the cost savings from budget cuts with the extreme weather costs just this year in the USA.
Climate scientists have won the war on the facts. We know it is warming, we know how fast it is warming. We know what is causing the warming. And, we know what to do about it. Since Trump (and sadly the Republican Party as a whole) have lost that battle, they have decided to blind us so we just won’t know what is happening. 
We should be investing in science and the instruments that scientists need (satellites, airplanes, computers, other sensors). And we should invest in the people. Without funding and jobs in climate science, how will we encourage the next generation of bright minds to enter this field? 
Perhaps that is the goal of the Trump Administration and the Republican officials. It is so sad that an entire political party has become branded as anti-science.

You appear incredulous that EDF would have made the claim of cooking Xmas dinner on HPC power in 2017
BQEND
Of course I'm not incredulous. I'm pointing out that the delays have largely been government inspired, not the fault of the nuclear industry. When de Rivaz made those remarks in 2007, was he aware he wouldn't get final approval to build until 2016?
And do you think approval would have been delayed so long if the government hadn't hoped wind and solar would achieve the reductions necessary? The point is that renewables have proved a distraction, with green lobby groups and an industry grown fat on subsidies pushing for renewables, rather than nuclear. 
BQSTART
Your hindsight is paranoid fantasy. Show me the UK budget for new nuclear cut in favour of any renewable.
BQEND
Cut? It was never allocated to nuclear in the first place. Faced with reducing emissions the government chose the easy, relatively ineffective route of renewables because it was much more popular.
BQSTART
Likewise with nuclear we have to have something we can switch on quickly when demand rises.
BQEND
Nuclear has a problem with demand fluctuations. Renewables have a problem with demand fluctuations in the same way, but also have a problem with supply fluctuations. 
If you size nuclear to UK demand you have less than half as much over production, and less than half as much under production, as a wind/solar mix.
And it's much, much easier to adapt to variable demand than variable supply. We need to decarbonise heating and transport, and that will provide plenty of off peak demand that nuclear can fulfil. We can use electric cars to not only soak up off peak supply, but provide electricity back to the grid at peak times.
Intermittent renewables present a much bigger problem. Because supply can be low for days or weeks, we can't rely on electric cars for peak supply, we can't rely on being able to recharge them off peak, and we can't decarbonise heating because a week of no heat in winter would be disastrous. 
BQSTART
but we know what to build - including flow cells, sodium sulphur batteries and ammonia plants, once we displace enough of that gas headroom so they have space to work.
BQEND
They are too expensive.
BQSTART
The ammonia plant we have to build anyway to decarbonise our globally massive N fertiliser production.
BQEND
How do you run high temperature, high pressure industrial processes with an intermittent supply? Using expensive renewable electricity to replace very cheap gas is going to make fertiliser prohibitively expensive anyway. Using expensive, intermittent electricity is going to make a difficult problem insurmountable.
BQSTART
Remember that this government has used Planning in England to deliberately block onshore wind to pander to the UKIP tendency in marginal seats.
BQEND
Actually they've blocked onshore wind because we've already built more than planned. Renewables advocates might envision an all renewables grid, but sensible people in charge of supplying our electricity do not.

BQEND
No. I've got data from a solar model which I've cross-checked with minute-by-minute output from my panels.
A tilted panel pointing roughly south (say between SE and SW) will collect energy starting earlier in the morning and till later in the evening than a horizontal panel. Peak for my panels is a month before and after the solstice because that is when the sun shining directly onto my panels at midday. Peak for a horizontal panel would be the Solstice day when the Sun is highest in the sky.
A horizontal panel is fine for the equator where the sun is directly above at midday.
Also the panels work more efficiently in winter because they are cooler.

BQEND Since
1965. Commercial utility scale wind turbines in this country go back to the mid to late 90's, and they were small. Significant onshore wind (now blocked in England by specific anti wind power planning policy) only really got going after ROC in 2002, solar later still. So have a look at the graphs Environmental Progress show since 1965, over three decades before any significant additions of wind and solar, and ponder on the word 'correlation'.

No, if we hadn't fallen for the false promises of renewables we'd have invested in nuclear much earlier and could now be producing much less CO2.
BQEND Interesting hypothesis, but the energy white paper of 2007 put us on course for an ambitious new nuclear build, the first of which (HPC) would be running now. It isn't in case you had not noticed. Meanwhile in that decade, the price of cheap onshore generation has fallen dramatically, the price of expensive offshore generation has fallen below that of nuclear, solar prices have plummeted beyond optimistic forecasts, and all the renewables we put up are generating.

You may not have noticed but we have been on a campaign of adding wind, solar and nuclear. So far what we have added has displaced fossil fuel consumption.
BQEND
It's displaced a small amount of fossil fuel consumption, at very high cost. But it's also locked us in to fossil fuel consumption for decades to come.
From the NYT:
Over the past 10 years, governments and private investors have collectively spent $2 trillion on infrastructure to draw electricity from the wind and the sun, according to estimates by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Environmental Progress, a nonprofit that advocates nuclear power as an essential tool in the battle against climate change, says that exceeds the total cost of all nuclear plants built to date or under construction, adjusted for inflation.
Capacity from renewable sources has grown by leaps and bounds, outpacing growth from all other sources — including coal, natural gas and nuclear power — in recent years. Solar and wind capacity installed in 2015 was more than 10 times what the International Energy Agency had forecast a decade before.
Still, except for very limited exceptions, all this wind and sun has not brought about much decarbonization. Indeed, it has not added much clean power to the grid.
Environmental Progress performed an analysis of the evolution of the carbon intensity of energy in 68 countries since 1965. It found no correlation between the additions of solar and wind power and the carbon intensity of energy: Despite additions of renewable capacity, carbon intensity remained flat.
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/business/climate-carbon-renewables.html
We have been adding renewables in addition to fossil fuels. The impact on emissions has been very small. The tragedy of renewables is that they have proved a popular, easy, ineffective ""solution"" for climate change. They have distracted us from taking sufficient action to meet the 2c target.
BQSTART
If we invested the money we spend on solar on nuclear instead 
then we would have no solar generating now and would have an additional building site not generating anything. 
BQEND
No, if we hadn't fallen for the false promises of renewables we'd have invested in nuclear much earlier and could now be producing much less CO2. 
The only countries in Europe that meet emission targets now use either hydro power or nuclear, or a mix of both. Countries that have invested heavily in renewables are still way off meeting targets.

Because solar ramps up and down so much we need a very flexible source of power to replace it when output is low. That will inevitably be gas.
BQEND For the moment yes, because it is already there and it is next in line on the merit order from the low to zero nuclear gas and solar. You may not have noticed but we have been on a campaign of adding wind, solar and nuclear. So far what we have added has displaced fossil fuel consumption. Sadly as HPC is missing its original 2007 target of running now, all of that displacement has been by solar and wind. Is the grid 'dirtier'? No.

Ask EDF, it was their claim back at the time of the energy white paper.
BQEND
That would have been before the government made it's proposals on nuclear power. In January 2008 the government issued a white paper on nuclear power. That claimed the GDA would take 3 - 3.5 years and construction would begin in 2013/14. In reality the GDA took 5.5 years and construction began in 2016, so I don't think the nuclear industry can really be blamed for delays. 
In hindsight, it's sad how much the competition for subsidies from the wind and solar lobby have held back nuclear in the UK. We could have had much lower emissions now if rational decisions had been taken in the early to mid 00s.
BQSTART
The intention is to reduce the natural gas to effectively zero.
BQEND
Who's intention? That's not really in the plans. Both ERP and National Grid forecast a lot of gas demand for a long time to come. 
The truth is we can't reduce natural gas to zero as long as we have significant amounts of renewables on the grid. We have to have something we can switch on quickly when wind or solar output falls.

Transformers transform in both directions (step-up or step-down). Is there some thing special about substations which stops this from happening?
BQENDYes, raising the voltage on one or more phases of the 'secondary' side of the transformer does not export power to the primary - it is a fall in power demand.
That 'saved' power can be used elsewhere, but it is not a supply which the grid can switch elsewhere.As far as the grid is concerned it is just lower consumption - it cannot fall below zero because frequency would be lost and all the inverters on the street would see that as a brownout and trip out (also from overvoltage at 253v) and volt spikes between phases/ground.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1513288592000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'frequency would be lost and all the inverters on the street would see that as a brownout and trip out', u'effect': u'it can not fall below zero'}], u'author_id': u'14842422', u'in_reply_to': u'109719628', u'id': u'109725314', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'RobinCorry', u'text': u'Alice's little solar-powered train in the pic looks remarkably like an ordinary one.

It is on the cusp of being inexpensive enough for unsubsidised home use, although this power is only available to the household - nt to the grid (other than an uncontrollable and marginal demand reduction)
BQENDNope. It is available to the grid, as virtually all of those PV households will be on-grid (using grid-tied inverters - the clue is in the name). So there reduced demand, or that of their neighbours will be felt by the local DNO, who will require less leccy from the National Grid.
Since all demand from the National Grid comes from consumers, it's rather silly to think that changes in demand from consumers won't impact the DNO's and National Grid.
You post this so many times that I suspect you get confused by what is a national grid, and what is the National Grid (a company running the high voltage network that feeds down to the local grids run by the DNO's).

It’s exciting stuff. We think solar could power 20% of the Merseyrail network in Liverpool, as well as 15% of commuter routes in Kent, Sussex and Wessex. There’s scope for solar trams in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Nottingham, London and Manchester too, and there’s no reason it should just be a British thing either. We’re especially excited about possibilities in San Francisco, Mexico City, India and Spain, but trains and trams all over the world could be running on sun in a few years time.
It’s also a genuine world first. There are a few solar stations – Blackfriars Bridge being by far the coolest – and some trains in India even have solar panels on their roofs, but that’s just to power equipment like lights and fans. No one’s moving the trains themselves with solar. Yet.
What’s especially interesting is how our new innovation came about – in particular the role community energy groups have played in its development (often despite policy support, not because of it, or in response to policy constraints). Looking ahead, there are also important questions to be asked about what role these community groups might play in its deployment.
 The idea came from a community solar group in Balcombe, West Sussex, formed in response to the first anti-fracking protests in the UK, in the summer of 2013. After the drillers, the activists, the press and various other hangers-on had left, the villagers were left with a question our current energy system lets most of us ignore: how should we power ourselves?
They decided they wanted local, community-owned energy, and also that they wanted to go solar. Looking into places to site a solar farm, they initially found the local grid didn’t have the capacity to take more solar. Searching for a way to solve that problem, they looked at the local railway and asked an engineering professor who happened to live locally, “could we plug it there, instead?” His answer was yes, they could, but the technical challenges to get there were a bit too much for a small-scale community group to grapple with. So they found another nearby solar site that could plug into the grid.
But when solar cuts hit the UK in 2015, we dug out the idea. What had been a possible local solution to Balcombe’s grid capacity issues a while back could build into a larger opportunity for renewable energy everywhere. Community energy shouldn’t have had to innovate at that point – renewable energy tech’s pretty great as it is – but with the solar cuts so deep, and onshore wind effectively banned in England, the solar trains idea gave us options. So 10:10 teamed up Energy Futures Lab at Imperial College London, umbrella group Community Energy South, and electrical engineering specialists Turbo Power Systems to find out more under Innovate UK’s Energy Game Changers competition.
Looking ahead, it will be a few years yet before we’re able to deploy the tech necessary to plug solar into trains. It needs building, and it needs testing, but I’d be shocked if it doesn’t happen. What’s less clear is whether community groups will be involved as solar railways roll out. As they’ve been part of this from the get-go, they’re super-keen. But it’s all too easy for the public to be shunted to the sidelines when the big budgets and complexity of infrastructure projects get going.
It’s common for public involvement to be seen as an inefficiency – in science, politics, finance, technology and more – a “nice to have” that takes too much time and effort when we’re in the serious business of things like climate change, economics and keeping the trains running on time.
But the opposite is true, especially when it comes to climate action. It’s the public who are driving change, often despite the actions of policy-makers.
Community energy offers a particularly powerful way to give members of the public a role in decarbonisation. Moreover, by tapping into their energy, enthusiasm and ability to bring other members of the public with them, we’ll get it done faster, as well as fairer. If it wasn’t for community energy groups coming up with this idea, pushing it forward and scoping out the places it could be utilised, solar trains would still be far more than a few years away.

This is admirable, but a critical flaw in the present version would accelerate climate change, allowing countries, power plants and factories to claim that cutting down trees and burning them for energy fully qualifies as renewable energy.
Even a small part of Europe’s energy requires a large quantity of trees and to avoid profound harm to the climate and forests worldwide the European council and parliament must fix this flaw. 
European producers of wood products have for decades generated electricity and heat as beneficial by-products, using wood wastes and limited forest residues. Most of this material would decompose and release carbon dioxide in a few years anyway, so using them to displace fossil fuels can reduce the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere in a few years too.
Unfortunately, the directive moving through parliament would go beyond wastes and residues and credit countries and companies for cutting down additional trees simply to burn them for energy. To do so has fundamentally different consequences because the carbon released into the air would otherwise stay locked up in forests.
The reasoning seems to be that so long as forests re-grow, they will eventually reabsorb the carbon released. Yet even then, the net effect – as many studies have shown – will typically be to increase global warming for decades to centuries, even when wood replaces coal, oil or natural gas.
The reasons begin with the inherent inefficiencies in harvesting wood. Typically, around one third or more of each tree is contained in roots and small branches that are properly left in the forest to protect soils, and most of which decompose, emitting carbon. The wood that is burned releases even more carbon than coal per unit of energy generated, and burns at a lower temperature, producing less electricity – turning wood into compressed pellets increases efficiency but uses energy and creates large additional emissions.
 A power plant burning wood chips will typically emit one and a half times the carbon dioxide of a plant burning coal and at least three times the carbon dioxide emitted by a power plant burning natural gas.
Although regrowing trees absorb carbon, trees grow slowly, and for some years a regrowing forest absorbs less carbon than if the forest were left unharvested. 
Eventually, the new forest grows faster and the carbon it absorbs, plus the reduction in fossil fuels, can pay back the “carbon debt”, but that takes decades to centuries, depending on the forest type and use. We conservatively estimate that using deliberately harvested wood instead of fossil fuels will release at least twice as much carbon dioxide to the air by 2050 per kilowatt hour. Doing so turns a potential reduction in emissions from solar or wind into a large increase. 
Time matters. Placing an additional carbon load in the atmosphere for decades means permanent damage due to more rapid melting of permafrost and glaciers, and more packing of heat and acidity into the world’s oceans. At a critical moment when countries need to be “buying time” against climate change, this approach amounts to selling the world’s limited time to combat climate change under mistaken claims of improvement.
The effect on the world’s forests, carbon and biodiversity is likely to be large because even though Europe is a large producer of wood, its harvest could only supply about 6% of its primary energy. For more than a decade, the increased use of biomass has been supplying roughly half of Europe’s increase in renewable energy. To supply even one third of the additional renewable energy likely required by 2030, Europe would need to burn an amount of wood greater than its total harvest today. This would turn a likely 6% decrease in energy emissions by 2050 under the directive through solar and wind into at least a 6% increase.
Europe’s own demand for wood would degrade forests around the world, but if other countries follow Europe’s example, the impacts would be even more dangerous. Instead of encouraging Indonesia and Brazil to preserve their tropical forests – Europe’s present position – the message of this directive is “cut your forests so long as someone burns them for energy”. Once countries are invested in such efforts, fixing the error may become impossible. To supply just an additional 3% of global energy with wood, the world needs to double its commercial wood harvests at great costs to carbon and wildlife. 
Neither a requirement that forests be managed sustainably nor any other “safeguards” in the various working drafts would stop this. For example, the directive would ban wood if harvests undermined “the long-term productivity capacity of the forest”. Although that sounds good, preserving the capacity of trees to grow back still leaves more carbon in the air for at least decades. Restricting wood harvests to countries with net growing forests – another idea – would still take carbon that forests would otherwise add to their storage and instead put it in the air without meaningful global limits. 
The solution is to restrict eligible forest biomass to its traditional sources of residues and waste. Legislators will likely be able to vote on such an amendment in the parliament’s plenary.
By 1850, the use of wood for bioenergy helped drive the near deforestation of western Europe even at a time when Europeans consumed relatively little energy. Although coal helped to save the forests of Europe, the solution is not to go back to burning forests. As scientists, we collectively have played key roles in the IPCC, in advising European governments, and in forest and climate research. We encourage European legislators and other policymakers to amend the present directive because the fate of much of the world’s forests is literally at stake.

The three-day symposium was billed as a way to help the judges better scrutinize evidence used to defend government regulations.
But the all-expenses-paid event hosted by George Mason University’s Law &amp; Economics Center in Arlington, Virginia, served another purpose: it was the first of several seminars designed to promote “skepticism” of scientific evidence among likely candidates for the 140-plus federal judgeships Donald Trump will fill over the next four years.
The lone science instructor was Louis Anthony Cox Jr, a risk analyst with deep industry ties whose recent appointment as chair of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s clean air scientific advisory committee drew condemnation in public-health circles. Since 1988, Cox has consulted for the American Petroleum Institute, a lobby group that spent millions to dispute the cancer-causing properties of benzene, an ingredient in gasoline, and is now working to question the science on smog-causing ozone. He’s also testified on behalf of the chemical industry and done research for the tobacco giant Philip Morris.
For a $4,000 honorarium, Cox delivered two closed-door lectures at George Mason: “a primer on the scientific method” followed by a session aimed at “understanding what science can and cannot do”. Included in his presentation were slides urging judges to be wary of EPA science on fine particles – a pollutant he has been researching for API.
The symposium included a dinner at Capitol Hill’s upscale Charlie Palmer Steak, whose website says it “moves the political power meetings out of the back room and into private dining spaces”. Events such as the symposium are one way big oil is trying to impart free-market values to judges and attorneys general as the industry gears up for legal battles on multiple fronts.
Based in George Mason’s Antonin Scalia Law School, the Law &amp; Economics Center espouses a free-market approach to policy. A 2013 investigation by the Center for Public Integrity found that the libertarian thinktank hosted more judicial conferences than any other university program in the country, fueled by conservative and big-business donors. Over the past two years, roughly $4.5m of $18.6m in contributions to the Law &amp; Economics Center came from oil and gas interests, including Koch Industries, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and API, which represents more than 650 corporations.
The center claims to have trained more than 5,000 state and federal judges, including three sitting supreme court justices. Almost 1,000 state attorneys general and their staff attorneys have attended its programs. Its advisory board includes three judges on the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit, widely considered the country’s second-most-powerful court and, often, the final arbiter for federal administrative law cases. 
In a White House riven by discord and staff departures, judicial appointments have been a bright spot. Senate Republicans have embraced the chance to fill a glut of vacancies, helping Trump install more conservative judges and potentially transform the legal landscape for decades to come. Once confirmed, a federal judge can serve for life, presiding over an average of 500 to 600 cases a year.

Standard Oil’s monopoly is broken up by the US supreme court. The trust which had been set up by John D Rockefeller in 1882, had gained control of nearly 90% of US oil production.
The US joins the first world war and supplies allied forces with oil. President Woodrow Wilson appoints multiple oil executives to war-effort committees and nationalises the railways.
Brought together by the war, oil executives form a trade body, the American Petroleum Institute (API) in 1919. Ten years later, another trade association, the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) is formed to represent smaller companies.

A Washington trade group with 300-plus employees, API has spent more than $40m to lobby Congress since 2013. But the courts have also been a focal point for API, which has spent the better part of a century helping the oil and gas industry pivot from being a prime antitrust target to being a proactive litigation force. The institute, along with other free-market trade groups, has routinely injected itself into cases in an attempt to shape policy or stall government initiatives. API officials did not grant interview requests from the Center for Public Integrity.
With a new era of environmental deregulation under way, issues ranging from the Obama administration’s clean power plan to offshore drilling in the Arctic are landing in the courts for final say. The stakes are enormous for the industry, which is simultaneously confronting a wave of lawsuits that seek billions of dollars in damages for climate-change impacts. Among the defendants are API members such as ExxonMobil.
Unlike government and the public, industry can afford to wait. “In many of these matters, litigation goes on decades and decades,” said Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “Time is on industry’s side.”
In 1940, API faced a lawsuit so expansive that three pages of the complaint simply listed defendants – all 379 of them.
United States of America v American Petroleum Institute et al alleged wide-scale collusion and price-fixing by 22 major oil companies and their 300-plus affiliates, which controlled a total of $9bn in assets (the equivalent of $160 billion today). 
The case never made it to trial. It was neutered early on by 11 oil executives working closely with the White House to ensure an allied victory in World War II.
After languishing in the courts for years, the lawsuit was dismissed in 1951 by the justice department, which found it to be a logistical nightmare. Gone, too, was the government’s interest in dissolving API as a monopolistic tool of industry. This year, API wriggled out of public scrutiny once more. In yet another potentially landmark case, lawyers suing the US government for inaction on climate change tried to compel the institute to turn over decades of internal records. API had joined the case to help defend the government but dropped out rather than reveal what it knew about global warming and when.
“They’re a highly sophisticated, integrated political operation,” said Bob Brulle, an environmental sociologist at Drexel University. API’s effectiveness, Brulle said, lay in its partnerships with like-minded groups such as the American Chemistry Council, the National Association of Manufacturers and the US Chamber of Commerce – amplifying its message “in a very directed, coordinated way”. In 2016, the institute absorbed its only real competitor, America’s Natural Gas Alliance.
On 30 November 1999, representatives of more than 20 lobby groups met at the institute’s Washington DC headquarters to muster opposition to an EPA plan to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.
Leading that meeting was the API lobbyist Phil Cooney, who in 2001 had become head of environmental policy for George W Bush’s White House, where he altered federal reports to sow doubt on climate change. Under Bush, the EPA retreated from its earlier position, claiming it didn’t have the authority to regulate greenhouse gases after all. Cooney could not be located for comment.
The issue came to a head in 2003, when 12 states sued the EPA to force its hand. Coming to the agency’s defense was the CO2 Litigation Group, a newly formed coalition of 14 trade associations – including API. The coalition represented a spectrum of fossil-fuel companies, which argued that the EPA had “oversimplified” and overstated the certainty of climate change’s effects.
The case, Massachusetts v EPA, was decided in the states’ favor by the US supreme court in 2007. But the matter continued to be tied up in the courts and the EPA bureaucracy, and it wasn’t until 2011 that the agency finally began regulating greenhouse gases. This gave rise to Obama’s 2015 clean power plan, which targeted carbon dioxide emissions and became mired in litigation before the Trump administration marked it for extinction.
The back-and-forth of politics can be dispiriting. For that reason, James Hansen has staked his family’s future – and the planet’s – on the courts. His granddaughter, Sophie Kivlehan, is one of 21 child and teenage plaintiffs in Juliana v United States, a 2015 lawsuit that faults the government for failing to address climate change over half a century.
“What we want is a plan – just for the government to have a plan,” said Hansen, a former Nasa scientist who now directs the Earth Institute at Columbia University and is acting as a scientific expert in the case. Last year, industry groups including API became parties to the case.
It was Hansen’s congressional testimony as director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in the sweltering summer of 1988 that elevated global warming from simmering concern to boiling reality. With “99%” certainty, Hansen explained that the trend was a side effect of fossil-fuel combustion that would worsen without swift action. Months later, a group that would come to include 170 scientists from 25 countries united to confront what it called “the greatest global environmental challenge facing mankind”.
When Hansen returned to Capitol Hill in 1989, he found his testimony heavily edited by the White House Office of Management and Budget under President George HW Bush. The office softened his conclusions, tacked on a paragraph qualifying his findings and otherwise stirred uncertainty about human causes of climate change.
While many have focused on what, and when, companies such as ExxonMobil knew about climate change, Julia Olson – a lawyer with Our Children’s Trust, a legal aid group representing the Juliana plaintiffs – is making a case for government complicity.
After years of litigating environmental cases, Olson realized she was dealing with symptoms of a disease, not the disease itself. “We were just playing a game of Whac-a-Mole. One new part of our fossil fuel energy system would pop up, and we’d challenge it, and then it’d pop up somewhere else.”
She turned her attention to the government, which “chooses the winners and losers” and has long abetted fossil fuels, she said, allowing the industry to drill, mine and build. “Everyone wants Exxon to be the enemy,” Olson said, but “every administration has made that decision to perpetuate fossil fuels.”
After digging through presidential archives, her researchers found what they believe is the earliest White House reference to climate change: a 1961 letter from Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico to John F Kennedy, recounting a meeting a day earlier at which they discussed a Fortune article warning of sea-level rise from a warming climate.
Lyndon B Johnson was the first president to publicly acknowledge such warming. In a speech in January 1965, he described how “a steady increase in carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels” was permanently altering the planet. By year’s end, his science advisory board had delivered a detailed report on the “invisible pollutant” capable of melting ice caps and raising sea levels.
Despite these early warnings, little has been done, Olson said. Since Hansen’s 1988 testimony, there have been more excessively hot years than at any other time on record. Two international accords tackling climate change have been brokered, with the United States conspicuously absent on both.
Though not named in Juliana, API, the National Association of Manufacturers and the American Fuel &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers quickly intervened in the lawsuit, asserting their right to protect their members’ economic interests. The move awkwardly put the fossil-fuel groups on the same side as the Obama administration.
Their involvement in Juliana was short-lived. In late February, plaintiffs filed a detailed 21-page discovery request for API alone, seeking decades of internal communications, policies and reports related to climate change. By late June, all three trade groups had exited a case they had voluntarily joined. A judge allowed them to drop out after they were unable to agree on the causes and effects of greenhouse gases.
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat of Rhode Island, suspects the groups “fled to avoid having to make the disclosures”. A vocal supporter of the Juliana action, Whitehouse believes the courts will hold industry accountable. “You have a judge and you have sanctions for not telling the truth, and that is a combination that for decades the fossil fuel industry has sought to avoid like Kryptonite.”
Other climate-related lawsuits have followed Juliana, which is set for trial in 2018. Last summer, three California coastal communities filed suit against 37 fossil-fuel companies, blaming their greenhouse-gas emissions for rising sea levels. In September, San Francisco and Oakland became the first major US cities to sue oil companies to cover past and future flood damage. In November, a Pennsylvania lawsuit alleged that the Trump administration is using “junk science” to roll back climate policies. A lawsuit pitting Portuguese schoolchildren against 47 European countries for failing to act on climate is in the works.
When Gregory Conko began organizing the October judges’ symposium at George Mason University, he wanted to ensure that participants left knowing science’s limitations. “Even good science cannot always answer the questions regulatory agencies ask,” he wrote to Louis “Tony” Cox, the risk analyst, in a May email obtained by the Center for Public Integrity through a records request. “Even the best science is not capable of yielding normative judgments about whether something is necessarily good or bad, safe or dangerous, etc.”
Conko headed the Competitive Enterprise Institute – a libertarian thinktank known for fostering climate-change denial – before joining Mason’s Law &amp; Economics Center last winter. Before Conko settled on Cox to lead the seminar, Nancy Beck, a former policy director for the American Chemistry Council who is now the EPA’s top official on toxic chemicals, was a candidate, emails show. So was Michael Gough, a toxicologist with ties to the tobacco industry and oil-backed climate-change denial groups. Conko declined requests for an interview.
Like Beck and Gough, Cox has championed narratives amenable to industry’s bottom line but not supported by mainstream science. In 2015, Cox said that “no detectable public health benefits” would result from a stricter EPA ozone limit. His testimony was cited in an op-ed by the API president, Jack Gerard, who ended the column with a warning: “Economic recovery is far from complete, and saddling the nation’s job creators with burdensome new restrictions threatens to deal another blow to the middle-class economy.”
What Gerard didn’t mention was Cox’s history with the institute, which spans decades. At the time the column was published, Cox was receiving funding from both the institute and the American Chemistry Council, which also represents petrochemical companies.
In an interview, Cox denied that industry funding influenced his findings. He criticized EPA science as flawed, saying it assumed links that hadn’t been proven. “I see a tremendous lack of clarity when agencies say there’s reason to believe X causes Y,” Cox said. “The proposition that the science is settled – ‘We don’t need to look at this’ – it’s a bad proposition.”
Cox holds a doctorate in electrical engineering and computer science and a master’s degree in operations research, which focuses on decision-making – both from MIT. Asked about his involvement in the George Mason symposium, Cox said: “Judges in particular should have a healthy skepticism, especially about claims of causality.”
Fellow risk analyst and friend Adam Finkel counts Cox among an elite few who have the credentials for risk analysis, an amalgam of health sciences, economics, policy-making and statistics. But their views on what should or shouldn’t be regulated couldn’t be further apart.
A former director of health standards programs at the US Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Finkel has spent his career trying to strengthen worker protections against toxic substances.
Finkel said it was “disappointing to me that someone as smart as [Cox] is” would take a different view, arguing the weight of evidence was not on Cox’s side. “He’s just lost his way,” Finkel said.

Did you read the paper rocky linked to? It's good work.
We can measure the natural forcings on the planet: solar radiation, volcanic action, cosmic rays, orbital changes. They are going down overall and thus produce a very gently declining temperature. Anthropogenic changes produce a number of effects, which overall produce a much larger rising temperature. That's the basis on which all warming is allocated to humankind's actions. There might be a few percent from natural forcings, but the evidence is now pretty clear that it's all, or almost all human-caused. The IPCC did not disagree with this conclusion, they just stated it conservatively. 
Mann's hockey-stick has been replicated in more than a dozen different studies using different proxies. It is now extremely unlikely that the fundamentals of this (temp is now changing much faster than at any time in the Holocene, and is rising) are wrong.

4) Man-made CO2 is EXACTLY the same as ""natural"" CO2. There is no ""balance"" that has been upset.
BQEND
I mean - the ignorance of this is so astounding.
Man-made CO2 is carbon released from solid form to gaseous form by a chemical reaction. If we were burning trees then this would be part of the balance. But we're not burning trees, we're burning coal. Coal, in the natural balance, is sequestered - it plays no part in the climate because it is solid carbon (made solid by solar energy and photosynthesis hundreds of millions of years ago).
If we bring it to the surface and reverse that reaction then we are releasing it back to play a role in the climate again. One major part of the ""natural balance"" of CO2 in our atmosphere sees trees grow in spring (absorbing CO2) and leaves fall in autumn (releasing CO2).
This is so simple. The fact is that digging up sequestered solid carbon and adding it to the atmosphere as a gas changes the balance.

All the current warming is related to human activity, because the sum of all natural forcings would be cooling the Earth very very slowly now.

You seem to think that 'coming out of the Little Ice Age' happened by some mystical process, or indeed that the LIA itself was caused by some mystical process.
The Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age were concepts introduced about 50 years ago by early climate researchers, particularly Hubert Lamb, based on evidence available at that time, but the more they are investigated the more ephemeral they become.

Natural climate drivers include changes in the sun’s energy output, regular changes in Earth’s orbital cycle, and large volcanic eruptions that put light-reflecting particles into the upper atmosphere. 
Human-caused, or anthropogenic climate drivers include emissions of heat-trapping gases (also known as greenhouse gases) and changes in land use that make land reflect more or less sunlight energy.
Since 1750, human-caused climate drivers have been increasing, and their effect dominates all natural climate drivers.

1) We have never warmed faster in the past 65 million years? Really? Do you know how fast we warmed going into the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum some 56 million years ago? Remember how really hot it was back then? How do you compare the first 100 years back then to when we started keeping records in the 19th century?
2) We have been warming intermittently since the middle of the Little Ice Age. And CO2 has only increased significantly since about the end of WW2. But recent intermittent warming is almost completely due to man-made CO2? Which means.....natural warming has suddenly stopped? And you know exactly how the thousands of variables that affect our climate would behave in the absence of Man-made CO2? Hmmm......the IPCC disagrees, as this would imply our climate could be predicted.
3) Everyone accepts the fact that CO2 is a (minor) greenhouse gas. Not sure why alarmists keep bringing up this point. I hope it isn't because you believe CO2 acts as a thermostat, i.e. higher CO2 concentrations automatically mean higher temperatures. The evidence (agreed upon by skeptics and alarmists), shows otherwise.
4) Man-made CO2 is EXACTLY the same as ""natural"" CO2. There is no ""balance"" that has been upset. 
5) LOL....yes, there is no major scientific organization (and a lot of non-scientific organizations), that haven't jumped on the global warming bandwagon. But these statements are written by politicians and bureaucrats....NOT the scientists. Science is not based on ""consensus"", and there is a spectrum of opinion on the subject of climate change. Oh, and that ""97% of scientists agree"" thing is completely bogus, in case you were wondering.
6) The oceans are not undergoing ""acidification"". No scientist would use that term as the oceans are basic. ""Neutralization"" is the correct term, but ""acidification"" is scarier.

2) There are thousands of variables that affect the climate and we cannot possibly predict how they all interact or how they will change over time.

The greenhouse gas qualities of carbon dioxide have been known for over a century. In 1861, John Tyndal published laboratory results identifying carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas that absorbed heat rays (long wave radiation).

Man-made CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by a third since the pre-industrial era, creating an artificial forcing of global temperatures which is warming the planet.

This is what happens when the hurricane hits Miami,article,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/17/miami-hurricane-2037-climate-change,0,"After the hurricane hit Miami in 2037, a foot of sand covered the famous bow-tie floor in the lobby of the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach. A dead manatee floated in the pool where Elvis had once swum. Most of the damage came not from the hurricane’s 175-mile-an-hour winds, but from the twenty-foot storm surge that overwhelmed the low-lying city.
In South Beach, historic Art Deco buildings were swept off their foundations. Mansions on Star Island were flooded up to their cut-glass doorknobs. A seventeen-mile stretch of Highway A1A that ran along the famous beaches up to Fort Lauderdale disappeared into the Atlantic. The storm knocked out the wastewater-treatment plant on Virginia Key, forcing the city to dump hundreds of millions of gallons of raw sewage into Biscayne Bay. 
Tampons and condoms littered the beaches, and the stench of human excrement stoked fears of cholera. More than three hundred people died, many of them swept away by the surging waters that submerged much of Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale; thirteen people were killed in traffic accidents as they scrambled to escape the city after the news spread—falsely, it turned out—that one of the nuclear reactors at Turkey Point, an aging power plant twenty-four miles south of Miami, had been destroyed by the surge and had sent a radioactive cloud floating over the city.
The president, of course, said that Miami would be back, that Americans did not give up, that the city would be rebuilt better and stronger than it had been before. But it was clear to those not fooling themselves that this storm was the beginning of the end of Miami as a booming twenty-first-century city.
All big hurricanes are disastrous. But this one was unexpectedly bad. With sea levels more than a foot higher than they’d been at the dawn of the century, much of South Florida was wet and vulnerable even before the storm hit. 
Because of the higher water, the storm surge pushed deeper into the region than anyone had imagined it could, flowing up drainage canals and flooding homes and strip malls several miles from the coast. Despite newly elevated runways, Miami International Airport was shut down for ten days. Salt water shorted out underground electrical wiring, leaving parts of Miami-Dade County dark for weeks. 
Municipal drinking-water wells were contaminated with salt water. In soggy neighborhoods, mosquitoes carrying Zika and dengue fever viruses hatched (injecting male mosquitoes with the Wolbachia bacteria, which public health officials had once hoped would inhibit the mosquitoes’ ability to transmit the viruses, had failed when the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that carry the diseases developed immunity to the bacteria). 
In Homestead, a low-lying working-class city in southern Miami-Dade County which had been flattened by Hurricane Andrew in 1992, thousands of abandoned homes were bulldozed because they were deemed a public health hazard. In Miami Shores, developers approached city officials with proposals to buy out entire blocks of waterlogged apartments, then dredge the streets and turn them into canals lined with houseboats. But financing for these projects always fell through.
Before the storm hit, damage from rising seas had already pushed city and county budgets to the brink. State and federal money was scarce too, in part because Miami was seen by many Americans as a rich, self-indulgent city that had ignored decades of warnings about building too close to the water. Attempts had been made to armor the shore with seawalls and elevate buildings, but only a small percentage of the richest property owners took protective action. The beaches were mostly gone too. 
The Feds decided they couldn’t afford to spend $100 million every few years to pump in fresh sand, and without replenishment, the ever-higher tides carried the beaches away. 
By the late 2020s, the only beaches that remained were privately maintained oases of sand in front of expensive hotels. The hurricane took care of those, leaving the hotels and condo towers perched on limestone crags. Tourists disappeared. 
After the hurricane, the city became a mecca for slumlords, spiritual healers, and lawyers. In the parts of the county that were still inhabitable, only the wealthiest could afford to insure their homes. Mortgages were nearly impossible to get, mostly because banks didn’t believe the homes would be there in thirty years.
Still, the waters kept rising, nearly a foot each decade. Each big storm devoured more of the coastline, pushing the water deeper and deeper into the city. The skyscrapers that had gone up during the boom years were gradually abandoned and used as staging grounds for drug runners and exotic-animal traffickers. Crocodiles nested in the ruins of the Frost Museum of Science. Still, the waters kept rising.
By the end of the twenty-first century, Miami became something else entirely: a popular diving spot where people could swim among sharks and barnacled SUVs and explore the wreckage of a great American city.
That is, of course, merely one possible vision of the future. There are brighter ways to imagine it—and darker ways. But I am a journalist, not a Hollywood screenwriter. In this book, I want to tell a true story about the future we are creating for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren. It begins with this: the climate is warming, the world’s great ice sheets are melting, and the water is rising. This is not a speculative idea, or the hypothesis of a few wacky scientists, or a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. Sea-level rise is one of the central facts of our time, as real as gravity. It will reshape our world in ways most of us can only dimly imagine.
My own interest in this story began with an actual hurricane. Shortly after Hurricane Sandy hit New York City in 2012, I visited the Lower East Side of Manhattan, one of the neighborhoods that had been hardest hit by flooding from the storm. 
Even if we ban coal, gas, and oil tomorrow, we’re not going to be able to turn down the earth’s thermostat immediately
The water had receded by the time I arrived, but the neighborhood already smelled of mold and rot. The power was out, the shops were closed. I saw broken trees, abandoned cars, debris scattered everywhere, people hauling ruined furniture out of basement apartments. Dark waterlines were visible on many shop windows and doors. The surge in the East River had been more than nine feet high, overwhelming the seawall and inundating the low-lying parts of Lower Manhattan. As I walked around, watching people slowly put their lives back together, I wondered what would have happened if, instead of flooding the city and then receding in a few hours, the Atlantic Ocean had come in and stayed in.
I have been writing about climate change for more than a decade, but seeing the flooding on the Lower East Side made it visceral for me (I hadn’t visited New Orleans until several years after Katrina hit—the TV images of the flooding there, catastrophic as they were, did not affect me as strongly as my walk through the Lower East Side). A year or so before Sandy hit, I had interviewed NASA scientist James Hansen, the godfather of climate change science, who told me that if nothing was done to slow the burning of fossil fuels, sea levels could be as much as ten feet higher by the end of the century. At the time, I didn’t grasp the full implications of this. After Sandy, I did.
Soon after my visit to Lower Manhattan, I found myself in Miami, learning about the porous limestone foundation the city is built on and the flatness of the topography. During high tide, I waded knee-deep through dark ocean water in several Miami Beach neighborhoods; I saw high water backing up into working-class neighborhoods far to the west, near the border of the Everglades. It didn’t take a lot of imagination to see that I was standing in a modern-day Atlantis-in-the-making. It became clear to me just how poorly our world is prepared to deal with the rising waters. Unlike, say, a global pandemic, sea-level rise is not a direct threat to human survival. Early humans had no problem adapting to rising seas—they just moved to higher ground. But in the modern world, that’s not so easy. There’s a terrible irony in the fact that it’s the very infrastructure of the Fossil Fuel Age—the housing developments on the coasts, the roads, the railroads, the tunnels, the airports—that makes us most vulnerable.
Rising and falling seas represent one of the ancient rhythms of the earth, the background track that has played during the entire four-billion-year life of the planet. Scientists have understood this for a long time. Even in relatively recent history, sea levels have fluctuated wildly, driven by wobbles in the Earth’s orbit that change the amount of sunlight hitting the planet. One hundred and twenty thousand years ago, during the last interglacial period, when the temperature of the Earth was very much like it is today, sea levels were twenty to thirty feet higher. Then, twenty thousand years ago, during the peak of the last ice age, sea levels were four hundred feet lower.
What’s different today is that humans are interfering with this natural rhythm by heating up the planet and melting the vast ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Until just a few decades ago, most scientists believed these ice sheets were so big and so indomitable that not even seven billion humans with all their fossil-fuel-burning toys could have much impact on them in the short term. Now they know better.
In the twentieth century, the oceans rose about six inches. But that was before the heat from burning fossil fuels had much impact on Greenland and Antarctica (about half of the recorded sea-level rise in the twentieth century came from the expansion of the warming oceans). Today, seas are rising at more than twice the rate they did in the last century. As warming of the Earth increases and the ice sheets begin to feel the heat, the rate of sea-level rise is likely to increase rapidly. 
A 2017 report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the United States’ top climate science agency, says global sea-level rise could range from about one foot on the low end to more than eight feet by 2100. Depending on how much we heat up the planet, it will continue rising for centuries after that.
But if you live on the coast, what matters more than the height the seas rise to is the rate at which they rise. If the water rises slowly, it’s not such a big deal. People will have time to elevate roads and buildings and build seawalls. Or move away. It is likely to be disruptive but manageable. Unfortunately, Mother Nature is not always so docile. In the past, the seas have risen in dramatic pulses that coincide with the sudden collapse of ice sheets. After the end of the last ice age, there is evidence that the water rose about thirteen feet in a single century. If that were to occur again, it would be a catastrophe for coastal cities around the world, causing hundreds of millions of people to flee from the coastlines and submerging trillions of dollars’ worth of real estate and infrastructure.
The best way to save coastal cities is to quit burning fossil fuels (if you’re still questioning the link between human activity and climate change, you’re reading the wrong book). But even if we ban coal, gas, and oil tomorrow, we’re not going to be able to turn down the Earth’s thermostat immediately. A good fraction of the CO2 emitted today will stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years. That means that even if we did reduce CO2 tomorrow, we can’t shut off the warming from the CO2 we’ve already dumped into the air. “The climatic impacts of releasing fossil fuel CO2 to the atmosphere will last longer than Stonehenge,” scientist David Archer writes. “Longer than time capsules, longer than nuclear waste, far longer than the age of human civilization so far.”
For sea-level rise, the slow response of the Earth’s climate system has enormous long-term implications. Even if we replaced every SUV on the planet with a skateboard and every coal plant with a solar panel and could magically reduce global carbon pollution to zero by tomorrow, because of the heat that has already built up in the atmosphere and the oceans, the seas would not stop rising—at least until the Earth cooled off, which could take centuries.
 However, if we don’t end the fossil fuel party, we’re headed for more than eight degrees Fahrenheit of warming—and with that, all bets are off. We could get four feet of sea-level rise by the end of the century—or we could get thirteen feet. The long-term consequences are even more alarming. If we burn all the known reserves of coal, oil, and gas on the planet, seas will likely rise by more than two hundred feet in the coming centuries, submerging virtually every major coastal city in the world.
The tricky thing about dealing with sea-level rise is that it’s impossible to witness by just hanging out at the beach for a few weeks. Even in the worst-case scenarios, the changes will occur over years and decades and centuries, not seconds and minutes and hours. It’s exactly the kind of threat that we humans are genetically ill equipped to deal with. We have evolved to defend ourselves from a guy with a knife or an animal with big teeth, but we are not wired to make decisions about barely perceptible threats that gradually accelerate over time. 
One architect I met while researching this book joked that with enough money, you can engineer your way out of anything. I suppose it’s true. If you had enough money, you could raise or rebuild every street and building in Miami by ten feet and the city would be in pretty good shape for the next century or so. But we do not live in a world where money is no object, and one of the hard truths about sea-level rise is that rich cities and nations can afford to build seawalls, upgrade sewage systems, and elevate critical infrastructure. 
Poor cities and nations cannot. But even for rich countries, the economic losses will be high. One recent study estimated that with six feet of sea-level rise, nearly $1 trillion worth of real estate in the United States will be underwater, including one in eight homes in Florida. If no significant action is taken, global damages from sea-level rise could reach $100 trillion a year by 2100.
But it is not just money that will be lost. Also gone will be the beach where you first kissed your boyfriend; the mangrove forests in Bangladesh where Bengal tigers thrive; the crocodile nests in Florida Bay; Facebook headquarters in Silicon Valley; St. Mark’s Basilica in Venice; Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina; America’s biggest naval base in Norfolk, Virginia; NASA’s Kennedy Space Center; graves on the Isle of the Dead in Tasmania; the slums of Jakarta, Indonesia; entire nations like the Maldives and the Marshall Islands; and, in the not-so-distant future, Mar-a-Lago, the summer White House of President Donald Trump. Globally, about 145 million people live three feet or less above the current sea level. As the waters rise, millions of these people will be displaced, many of them in poor countries, creating generations of climate refugees that will make today’s Syrian war refugee crisis look like a high school drama production.
The real x factor here is not the vagaries of climate science, but the complexity of human psychology. At what point will we take dramatic action to cut CO2 pollution? Will we spend billions on adaptive infrastructure to prepare cities for rising waters—or will we do nothing until it is too late? Will we welcome people who flee submerged coastlines and sinking islands—or will we imprison them? 
No one knows how our economic and political system will deal with these challenges. The simple truth is, human beings have become a geological force on the planet, with the power to reshape the boundaries of the world in ways we didn’t intend and don’t entirely understand. Every day, little by little, the water is rising, washing away beaches, eroding coastlines, pushing into homes and shops and places of worship. 
As our world floods, it is likely to cause immense suffering and devastation. It is also likely to bring people together and inspire creativity and camaraderie in ways that no one can foresee. Either way, the water is coming. As Hal Wanless, a geologist at the University of Miami, told me in his deep Old Testament voice as we drove toward the beach one day, “If you’re not building a boat, then you don’t understand what’s happening here.”

Even before this autumn’s devastating hurricanes, Caribbean countries were suffering under unsustainable debts caused by the legacy of colonialism, unjust trade rules, harsh austerity measures imposed in return for bailouts, and past disasters. Now countries such as Antigua and Barbuda, and Dominica, are expected to keep paying debts while struggling to rebuild.
One of the main “solutions” proposed to this cycle of climate-induced disasters and indebtedness is climate risk insurance. This fundamentally unjust measure places the financial burden of climate impacts on people who have done the least to cause the problem of climate change, while ensuring that creditors keep being paid in the event of climate disasters. Instead, debt cancellation is needed to make debts sustainable, and all assistance to adapt to – and rebuild from – climate disasters must be in the form of grants, not loans.Sarah-Jayne CliftonDirector, Jubilee Debt Campaign
• Theresa May’s article failed to explain how the fight to limit climate change is helped by fracking, by the building of Hinckley Point with its absurd overpricing of the cost of each unit of electricity (another example of Conservatives milking citizens to benefit commerce), by the third runway at Heathrow or by her government’s refusal to include environmental costs in the calculation of the value of gross national product, another example of said welfare state.
Her stock answer to demands for more being spent on (for example) the NHS is that increased interest payments on borrowing cannot be borne because they will prejudice future generations, yet the threat to future generations from the effects of climate change is immeasurably greater. Moreover, May has no qualms in leaving future generations with the burden of guarding spent nuclear fuel for hundreds of years. The inadequacy of her policies is plain.Ian TyshWealden Green party, East Sussex

You can't argue for divestment and then claim it won't affect investment. What's the point of that?
BQENDI'm arguing that as the fossil fuel business is run down it will naturally exploit those sources that are already developed and easily recovered, so there will still be money to be made from these. It doesn't need investment beyond the ploughing back of profit. There is still money available for developing fossil fuels, but as that gets tighter the longer term, more risky investments are the ones that will be squeezed.

No, that's putting the cart before the horse. Fossil fuel companies sell us energy we need. Divestment aims to cut off the supply without taking into account of the needs of those who use that energy.

No, we don't - at least not over the timescales being discussed.
BQEND
The timescale, if we begin divestment now, is before 2020. We would have shortages of oil and gas within a couple of years, and that would result in higher prices forcing the poor to reduce their consumption.
BQSTART
That may well be true, but a lot of investment is going into exploration for and development of new sources and this is where divestment would have the biggest impact.
BQEND
Most of the cost of developing an oil or gas field is in building the infrastructure, not exploration. But even exploration usually takes place not long before development. Eradour was discovered in 2011 and in production by 2017.
If we begin divestment now the effects will be felt in a couple of years.

If a gas field is profitable over the timescales you suggest then it will not be significantly impacted by divestment.

It is nonsensical to present this as a black-or-white dichotomy. Any sensible policy to transition away from some damaging activity will tackle both supply and demand.

No, it makes no sense to attack supply. Build a new non fossil fuel power station and demand will fall.

We don't 'absolutely' rely on them. We do rely on energy, but that can come from any source.
BQEND
We absolutely rely on fossil fuels.
For example, wholesale gas costs about 2 - 3p per KWH in the UK. Existing wind power costs about 11p per KWH wholesale. A large number of people could not afford to heat their homes using renewables.
We also rely on fossil fuels for transport, and will for decades to come.
BQSTART
The divestment campaign attacks the unsustainable development of further sources of fossil fuels. If money is sunk now into exploring for and developing fossil fuels, it would often be several decades before those sources are being fully exploited
BQEND
Substantial investment in oil and gas takes place shortly before production, not decades before. For example, the Eradour gas field in the North Sea got the go ahead for investment in 2014 and started production this year. 
A decline in fossil fuel investment now would start to be felt in lower output by 2019. By 2020 we'd be suffering significant declines, and renewables couldn't hope to make up the difference. 
BQSTART
The alternatives are already viable and it only needs the political and economic will to make this happen.
BQEND
The alternatives aren't viable. How does the UK provide heating in the winter when solar barely produces anything and wind speeds can result in wind energy production dropping to almost zero? How does it do so at a price people can afford?
How do we stop using oil for transport when battery production is sufficient for about 750,000 cars a year and world car production is more than 90 million cars a year?
We cannot realistically transition away from fossil fuels yet. We can transition away from the worst fuel of all, coal, but as the Guardian's story about China last week showed, that will require MORE investment in gas production, which is going to be difficult if the divestment campaign takes off.

And they decline at 9% a year. If we don't open new oil and gas fields this year, production will be lower next year. Last year $434 billion was invested in oil and gas production worldwide, and that's probably not enough to maintain production in the long run.

Currently, pensions investment is determined by acting in the interests of those whose money is held (but with the caveat that trustees are permitted to consider ethical issues).
The bodies mentioned in this article made recommendations (primarily around clarity of how those two might be reconciled). The minister appears to be accepting those recommendations, but we won't know the details of that until his proposals are published.
Patrick Collinson has now spun this into an article (again) about how a group of climate change lobbyists wish to control other people's pensions' investments (and presumably they also want to underwrite any losses too).
The reality is that the proposal was that people whose money was invested in these schemes may now have a larger say on investments. This may be wide-ranging or not, but it is not the case that a group of lobbyists now get to control other people's pension. For example, there is as much a possibility that those whose pensions are invested may decide that they wish to invest more in corporations with a poor track record on climate change as there is that they do the opposite.
Indeed, the change potentially opens up all sorts of possibilities (and none). The Guardian's long running campaign on this issue has focused on a single-issue (climate change) without considering other possibilities. 
For example, The Guardian has long been a platform for some pro-Israeli positions - what would their reaction be if the Divestment movement were to target say local government pensions?
There's a lot of people here with very simplistic positions which take no account of either the potential implications, the reality on the ground for those who do have funds invested, or the possibility that the trustees remain with very similar portfolios because the corporations involved as well as being involved in carbon are also involved in green energies.

As you say, it's potentially possible now that ethically-driven investment has wider scope than the current limited rules to avoid investment which may be opposed by the fundamental-driver for the employing organisation. Equally, there's the potential that the pension funds of a group is hijacked by an activist group which represents a small minority of pension members.
What's clear though is that some funds may be panicked into divestment when the share-value change may be nowhere near the precipice scenario they advocate. It's possible, for example, that Shell develops alternatives whilst running down its oil-based business and that these replacement streams prove highly lucrative and as a result it's share price doesn't collapse but remains a very solid investment.
Unfortunately, The Guardian has concatenated the effects of climate change, with a doomsday scenario for share prices which is far from guaranteed, and come to the illogical conclusion that pensions must immediately divest from fossil fuels.

Until now, pension schemes have been hamstrung by “fiduciary duties” that effectively require schemes to seek the best returns irrespective of the threat of climate change. Many have rebuffed calls by members for fossil fuel divestment, citing legal obligations.
But in what has been hailed as a major victory for campaigners against fossil fuels, the government is to introduce new investment regulations that will allow pension schemes to “mirror members’ ethical concerns” and “address environmental problems”.
The rules are expected to come into force next year after a consultation period and will bring into effect recommendations made in 2014 and earlier this year by the Law Commission. 
Guy Opperman, the minister for pensions and financial inclusion, said: “Putting social value at the heart of our pensions system is something that is deeply important to Theresa May’s government. Thanks to these new regulations, savers will finally have the clear opportunity to have their say on where their money is invested and can reflect what is personally important to them, whilst delivering mutual benefits.”
About £87bn a year pours into Britain’s pension schemes, with a significant proportion of it automatically invested into gas and oil companies such as BP and Shell. But a growing body of academic and investment research suggests that reserves of fossil fuels could become “stranded assets” and virtually worthless as countries battle climate change. 
“We are committed to making it easier for people to invest in ways that reflect their values and have a positive impact on the issues they care about,” said Tracey Crouch, the minister for sport and civil society.
Once mocked by the conventional asset management industry, divestment from fossil fuels has moved beyond charity and religious groups into the investment mainstream. In November, the managers of the world’s biggest wealth fund, Norway’s sovereign $1tn fund, recommended divesting from existing oil and gas shares – it holds $5.4bn of Shell shares and $3bn in Exxon – as well as ruling out future investments.
Meanwhile, at last week’s One Planet Summit in Paris, the French financial giant Axa said it would speed up its withdrawal from coal businesses and end insurance for controversial US oil pipelines.
ShareAction, which campaigns for responsible investment, said the new UK rules would empower pension savers to use their investments to fight climate change. 
The charity’s chief executive, Catherine Howarth, said: “ShareAction has been campaigning for change in this area for years. The [Department for Work and Pensions’] decision to propose these reforms is a welcome breakthrough. 
“We urge pension savers in the UK who care about how their money is invested to let the DWP know they fully support this much-needed change in the law. As powerful investors, it is essential our pension funds focus on long-term risks and opportunities such as those connected with climate change and social inequality.”
But Howarth called on the Financial Conduct Authority to speed up its response to the Law Commission’s proposals, claiming the city regulator “is still sitting on its hands”.
Across the world more than 800 institutions, with total investments valued at $6tn, have committed to divest from fossil fuels. 
Local authority pension schemes, which hold £16bn worth of oil and gas company shares in their investment portfolios on behalf of 5.3 million workers in England and Wales, are likely to be the earliest to implement the rules in the UK. 
The Environment Agency and Southwark council in London have been among the first major schemes to divest, and as once independently run council schemes begin a pooling process, divestment is likely to spread to more authorities. 
Aon, one of the biggest advisers to pension schemes around the world, said the divestment campaign was “real and much higher up the agenda” but said many schemes would want to engage with energy companies to encourage renewable alternatives rather than selling their holdings. 
John Belgrove, a senior partner at Aon, said: “In the past, aspects around fiduciary duty and best returns have got in the way of pension trustees [wanting to divest] ... and the subject has been easily kicked into the long grass. These new regulations from the DWP are another step in a series of steps we have seen in this area. But exclusion is still pretty rare. If one looks at the big picture on fossil fuels, the biggest renewable energy developments are coming from the very same firms that extract fossil fuels.”

1) For ""long-term"" trend calculations (typically 30 years or longer for ""climate"" data), individual events like ""major"" volcanic eruptions or ""massive / Godzilla"" El Ninos will not have a large effect ... unless they are ""too close"" to one end of the calculation period.
BQEND
You have this back to front.
Trends are measured over periods of 30 years plus precisely because they are not greatly affected by peaks and troughs ""too close"" to one end of the calculation period.
Trends less than 30 years are more affected, the shorter the period, the more influence start/end conditions will have.

BQSTART
It is for this reason that it is frowned upon to start trend calculations for (surface and/or troposphere) temperature data in 1997/8 ... or to end them in 2016/7 !
BQEND
You have the reason and conclusion wrong.
Starting a 15~20 year trend from the 1998 peak is wrong because short trends are skewed by starting at a peak.
There is no problem with measuring a 30 year trend back from 2017 though, because the period is large enough that ending on a peak does not skew the result significantly.
This can be demonstrated quite easily using the
sks trend calculator:
GISTEMP
1987-2017 Trend: 0.175 ±0.057 °C/decade (2σ)
1986-2016 Trend: 0.166 ±0.054 °C/decade (2σ)
1985-2015 Trend: 0.165 ±0.053 °C/decade (2σ)
1984-2014 Trend: 0.167 ±0.053 °C/decade (2σ)
1983-2013 Trend: 0.164 ±0.054 °C/decade (2σ)
1982-2012 Trend: 0.172 ±0.054 °C/decade (2σ)
1981-2011 Trend: 0.168 ±0.055 °C/decade (2σ)
All of these are within 0.012 °C/decade of each other.
The 30 year trend is very stable regardless of start/end conditions.
Repeating the exercise for 20 year trends shows that these are more affected by start/end conditions:1997-2017 Trend: 0.176 ±0.103 °C/decade (2σ)1996-2016 Trend: 0.160 ±0.095 °C/decade (2σ)1995-2015 Trend: 0.135 ±0.092 °C/decade (2σ)1994-2014 Trend: 0.146 ±0.094 °C/decade (2σ)1993-2013 Trend: 0.174 ±0.097 °C/decade (2σ)1992-2012 Trend: 0.202 ±0.099 °C/decade (2σ)1991-2011 Trend: 0.204 ±0.099 °C/decade (2σ)These have a much wider range of values 0.041 °C/decade.20 year trends vary widely because of the greater influence of start/end conditions.

Well if we have a volcanic event the scale of Tambora would you say its fair to say the models had failed because the temperature was lower than expected when something like that went off?
BQEND
No.
There are (at least ?) 2 ways to approach this ""problem"".
1) For ""long-term"" trend calculations (typically 30 years or longer for ""climate"" data), individual events like ""major"" volcanic eruptions or ""massive / Godzilla"" El Ninos will not have a large effect ... unless they are ""too close"" to one end of the calculation period.
It is for this reason that it is frowned upon to start trend calculations for (surface and/or troposphere) temperature data in 1997/8 ... or to end them in 2016/7 !
2) The ""major"" distortions to the long-term trend come from volcanic eruptions (""cooling pulses"" 2 to 5 years long) and ENSO (""warming spikes"" from El Ninos lasting 2 or 3 years). Attempts can be made to ""subtract out"" these events, and extract the ""underlying trend"".
Just this millennium for surface and satellite temperature data this goes from Santer et al (2001, ""Accounting for the effects of volcanoes and ENSO in comparisons of modeled and observed temperature trends"") through Foster and Rahmstorf (2011, ""Global temperature evolution 1979–2010"") to Christy and McNider (2017, ""Satellite Bulk Tropospheric Temperatures as a Metric for Climate Sensitivity"").
Other thoughts that aren't written up as full-blown peer-reviewed papers in ""serious"" scientific journals include tweets from Gavin Schmidt (of NASA) and blogposts at ""Open Mind"" / ""Real Climate"" / etc.

Dear Dr. Lindzen, The Board appreciates your cooperation in soliciting additional reviews on the paper you recently contributed to PNAS. We consulted the two experts you approved and two others selected by the Board. All four reviews (enclosed) were shared with two members of the Board before reaching a final decision. One of the Board members noted: All of the reviews are thoughtful assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the manuscript in question by leading experts, so they provide valuable hints for (possibly) improving the paper…I sympathize with Rev. 4's comments who concludes that the new paper simply has to explain why the opposite conclusions from the same data set by Trenberth et al. are flawed. If that could be achieved through a major review of the current version (hopefully accounting also for other important referee remarks) then the article would provide a crucial contribution to a most relevant scientific debate. In light of these additional critiques, the Board concurs that the current paper must be declined for publication. I am sorry we cannot be more encouraging at this time and hope the additional reviews will help in revising the work.

The Duhem–Quine thesis argues that no scientific hypothesis is by itself capable of making predictions.[1] Instead, deriving predictions from the hypothesis typically requires background assumptions that several other hypotheses are correct; for example, that an experiment works as predicted or that previous scientific theory is sufficiently accurate. For instance, as evidence against the idea that the Earth is in motion, some people objected that birds did not get thrown off into the sky whenever they let go of a tree branch. Later theories of physics and astronomy, such as classical and relativistic mechanics could account for such observations without positing a fixed Earth, and in due course they replaced the static-Earth auxiliary hypotheses and initial conditions.

The estimated true GMST based on HadCRUT4, but accounting for incomplete coverage and adjusted for blending of surface air temperature with sea surface temperature (SST) from the CMIP5 models, is shown as the dark orange line.
BQEND
I suspect a major problem for ""mobeus"" (it certainly is for me !) is that all of the ""accounting for"" and ""blending"" is done assuming that the (CMIP5) models are ""correct"" !
When you ""infill"" the various ""no data"" areas of the empirical dataset with values either directly from, or heavily influenced by, ""the models"" then it is hardly surprising when the end result moves towards being more ""consistent with"" the model outputs.
From the ""Conclusions and implications"" section at the end of the paper :
BQSTART
Whether there was a hiatus or slowdown at some point is still debated, with some arguing strongly for it and others saying it lacks scientific basis. The conclusions unsurprisingly depend on the time period considered, the dataset and the hypothesis tested, so the diverging conclusions do not need to be inconsistent. 
Natural climate variability has long been known to be important for short-term trends, but the observed temperature during the hiatus differed enough from that projected by climate models to challenge at least some elements of the scientific basis for anthropogenic climate change (for example, how sensitive the climate system is to an increase in CO2; see Methods section ‘Transient climate response’).
BQEND
In your selected image, from ~2001 to 2013/4 the ""pink"" HadCRUT4 (empirical !) dataset clearly shows why many people talk about a ""pause"" or ""hiatus"" for that particular time period (though obviously only 14 years worth of data cannot be considered as ""climate"").
The fact that the original (light blue) model ""projections"" showed a relatively constant warming of ~0.2°C per decade from ~2001 (under ""ENSO Neutral"" assumptions, which was pretty close to reality until 2015), however, requiring ""forcing"" and ""variability"" adjustments to be made post hoc  is more than enough for people to legitimately ""challenge"" models with high ECS values (e.g. the ones ""selected"" in the Brown & Caldeira paper).', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1513877994000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'3985037', u'in_reply_to': u'110019737', u'id': u'110022002', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'John Samuel', u'text': u'Nonsense.

This phenomenon, often termed the ‘global warming hiatus’, caused doubt in the public mind about how well anthropogenic climate change and natural variability are understood. Here we show that apparently contradictory conclusions stem from different definitions of ‘hiatus’ and from different datasets. A combination of changes in forcing, uptake of heat by the oceans, natural variability and incomplete observational coverage reconciles models and data. Combined with stronger recent warming trends in newer datasets, we are now more confident than ever that human influence is dominant in long-term warming.

You have elsewhere propounded the view that the organised attempt to reduce CO2 emissions is also a 'cover' for wealth redistribution, a sort of socialist machination of the UN.

The cleverest climate contrarians settle on the least implausible argument – that equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS – how much a doubling of the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will increase Earth’s surface temperature) is low, meaning that the planet will warm relatively slowly in response to human carbon pollution.
But they have to explain how that can be the case, because there are a lot of factors that amplify global warming. For example, a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, which is itself a greenhouse gas, adding further warming. Warming also melts ice, leaving Earth’s surface less reflective, absorbing more sunlight. There are a number of these amplifying ‘feedbacks,’ but few that would act to significantly slow global warming. 
Clouds are one possible exception, because they both act to amplify global warming (being made of water) and dampen it (being white and reflective). Which effect wins out depends on the type of cloud, and so whether clouds act to accelerate or slow global warming depends on exactly how the formation of different types of clouds changes in a hotter world. That’s hard to predict, so many contrarians have wishfully argued that clouds will essentially act as a thermostat to control global warming.
A new study published in Nature by Stanford scientists Patrick Brown and Ken Caldeira found that so far, the global climate models that best simulate the Earth’s global energy imbalance tend to predict the most future global warming. These results suggest the ECS is around 3.7°C. This is higher than the previous best estimate of 3.1°C, and if correct, would shrink our carbon budget by about 15%.
Out now in @Nature: @KenCaldeira and I show that Earth’s recent energy budget suggests greater future global warming than raw climate model projections indicate.https://t.co/yLHlwAZt5C pic.twitter.com/CsdRMKHLWH
The study found that the biggest contributor to the difference between the accurate and inaccurate models was in how well they simulated cloud changes. And while it’s just one study, several prior papers arrived at similar conclusions. 
For example, a 2010 study published in the Journal of Climate found that climate models that most accurately simulate recent cloud cover changes in the east Pacific point to an amplifying effect on global warming and thus a more sensitive climate. Another 2010 study by Andrew Dessler using satellite observations showed that in the short-term, clouds likely amplify global warming, though the long-term effect may be different.
In 2012, a paper published in Science by John Fasullo and Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research found that similar to the new Nature study, climate models that most accurately simulated observed cloud changes are also the ones that are most sensitive to the increased greenhouse effect. 
Similarly, a 2014 paper published in Nature found that the least sensitive climate models incorrectly simulate water vapor being drawn up into the atmosphere to form clouds in a warmer world. In reality, as lead author Steve Sherwood explains in the video below, scientists observe water vapor being pulled away from those higher cloud-forming levels of the atmosphere.
Former MIT scientist Richard Lindzen (one of the most often cited, and most often wrong contrarian climate scientists) was among the first to argue that clouds act as a climate thermostat. He developed a hypothesis in 2001 that as the atmosphere warms, the area covered by cirrus clouds will contract like the iris of an eye to allow more heat to escape into space, thus slowing global warming. His ‘iris hypothesis’ was quickly disproved by subsequent research, but that hasn’t stopped climate contrarians from continuing to make the argument. 
More recently, other contrarian scientists have used a combination of climate models and recent observational data to similarly argue that Earth’s climate is relatively insensitive to the increased greenhouse effect (they call these “observational estimates” of ECS). This group often likes to refer to themselves as ‘lukewarmers,’ but really they just cherrypick this one way to estimate ECS because it seemed to yield a relatively low result, while ignoring the other methods that point toward a significantly more sensitive climate. 
Over the past two years, climate scientists have identified several flaws in the method that yielded lower estimates of ECS. At this year’s American Geophysical Union conference – the largest gathering of climate and Earth scientists every December – there was a session devoted to this very topic. As one of the presenting climate scientists Andrew Dessler put it:
This leads to one of the biggest “skeptical” talking points: “Observational estimates of ECS are much lower than models” or “Models are too sensitive to CO2”. In the session today, it’s clear that the scientific community has beaten the shit out of this problem. 2/
In a year or so, “Observational estimates of ECS are much lower than models” will be sitting next to “global warming stopped in 1998” or “the surface temperature record can’t be trusted” in the junk yard of discredited skeptical ideas. 5/
There’s still significant uncertainty about how clouds will respond to global warming, but the evidence points to an amplifying effect, or at least not a significant dampening.

BQEND
The ‘pause’ apparent in the data used in AR5 can be attributed to two main factors: observational biases and the variability caused by natural processes. There is some evidence that changes in atmospheric aerosols (small particles in the atmosphere) caused by human activities may have been an additional factor. Improved understanding of observational biases has shown that the rate of surface warming between 1998 and 2012 was greater than the evidence available at the time of AR5 suggested. There is now more evidence that the handling of observational gaps over the Arctic, a region of rapid warming, is important. When these biases are taken into account, a temporary slowdown in the rate of surface warming can still be seen in the data, albeit less prominently. Research since AR5 has strengthened the conclusion that this slowdown was primarily caused by natural variability, associated partly with variations in the surface temperatures of the Pacific Ocean.

Quote from reference:
""But it's the changes in the environment that are the most profound: With temperatures rising faster in the Arctic than anywhere else in the world, the very ground on which communities are built is slumping as the permafrost thaws, and the sea ice that sustains vital animal populations is melting earlier and re-forming later than ever before.""
The permafrost thawing has provided artefacts and a Inuit home being found.A body of a young girl who had died hundreds of years ago was also discovered due to the thawing of a Bluff.
A long article, but really fascinating, which also covers cultural changes the Inuit need to bear through climate change and modernity:

Few of the simulations result in less than 2 degrees of warming—near the low end of the IPCC estimates—but some result in significantly more than the 4 degrees at the high end of the IPCC estimates. This pattern (statisticians call it a “right-skewed distribution”) suggests that if carbon dioxide concentrations double, the probability of very large increases in temperature is greater than the probability of very small increases.

Estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) from global climate models (GCMs) (1) and paleoclimate records (2) are generally consistent with a range of 2° to 4.5°C, but a number of studies based on historical instrumental records (3–7) yield a lower range of 1.5° to 3°C (8). These systematically lower observational estimates have been interpreted as demonstrating that GCMs are overly sensitive to CO2 forcing and that the ultimate amount of warming that Earth would experience at a given concentration of greenhouse gases is less than previously thought (5, 7).

They set up a project called Berkeley Earth in 2010.
They found independent funding, including from sceptics in the business community.
Many so-called climate sceptics said this was exactly what they wanted, and they would accept what BE reported.
The first phase of the project took about 2 years.
When BE then reported that their research agreed with other researchers that:
- the Earth is warming;
- has been since the 19th century;
- and that greenhouse gases produced by human activity are the cause....
- suddenly the so-called climate sceptic websites rejected BE, and never mention it.
The sceptical scientists, of course, now accepted that their check on other scientists' work had confirmed that the science published on this matter is good science - because those sceptical scientists were real sceptics.
In addition, Exxon got its own scientists to investigate climate change in the 1970s - those scientists found that CO2 from burning fossil fuels was causing global temperatures to rise.
Exxon didn't tell anyone of course - their research was uncovered recently.
Really, if there was anything fundamentally wrong with the basics of climate science, it would have been uncovered by now.
All the distractions endlessly quoted by so-called climate sceptics turn out to amount to nothing at all once they get checked out carefully enough.

The biggest failure of all is the governments failure to take care of its citizens.
I hope this will make sense to those reading because it is something I have concluded based on my time reading, studying, and understanding the relationship between people and organizations:If the government doesn't take care of its people someone else will, and then they will no longer be the governments people.
The people denying climate science have been under someone else's care of partisan organizations and charismatic individuals, even if that care is only an illusion, and yet you are still questioning how this can happen?

How did we understand that we can use heat to cool a fridge? My mother and fater bought a camping wagon when I was a kid - and I pondered that for ages: How could one light the same gass we used for boiling the kettle to keep the fridge cold? 
It is deeply counter-intuitive and paradoxical. Fire causing chill. But when you learn about it - it makes perfect sense. After all - everyone is happy to cool their home by plugging it into electricity - or by cooling the cabin in a car by firing up an ICE. 
It has value to understand how that works and know it is not a paradox that lighting up gas can make stuff cold.

For most people - a ""paradox"" is often an expression of cognitive dissonance. 
Most commonly a paradox is expressed emotionally (We have all heard the sad stories where family hate gay people - finding own child coming out as gay - and have to resolve the paradox - or kick own child out of family)
But education can also be paradoxical. As kids we are used to think that one needs cold to freeze water - common sense. So when physics comes around and say ""freezing water release heat"" it is easy to go into intellectual melt-down. 
Physics also say that on a warm sunny day when them cumulus clouds form and become a thunder-storm (that we often sense as a drop in temperature and air-pressure just before it starts to rain) - the clouds release a huge amount of latent heat in the process that feels cold. 
There are not many true paradoxes in the universe. And they all come from lack of understanding. Dark energy for example. That is a paradox because the best of the scientists who discovered it existing can not yet explain yet how it really work. 
It is a bit like giving a LED flash-light to Euclid or Archimedes. ""Lumens"" was linear to heat (an oil lamp gives heat, sun gives heat) - so a LED bulb becomes a paradox - in the form of ""cold light"". 
These two were not read up up quantum physics. So of course it is a paradox to discover ""cold"" light emitting diodes. But they were also really smart - so if we go time-transpose them, I am sure they would have read up on a couple of thousands years of physics in a short time. 
I know this, because very average kids like myself could do the same. 
The biggest idiot on the planet alive is half aware that Energy equals mass scaled to the speed of light, for example. The Genius of Newton had no idea about this. Newton did not even know that light has a speed-limit. 
He would solve the first sensation of paradox faster than any living person and actually understand why it is true that mass is a form of energy (something most of can not if we are true). 
And as deniers do - they reintroduce paradoxes with their theories. One can not measure global temperature - but one can measure the temperature of the moon or the sun as evidence - that is introducing a paradox. 
When deniers claim that the sun drives AGW in a period when measured temperature goes up and deniers themselves accept that the sun's activity trend down - that introduce a paradox. 
When deniers claim that CO2 is not a GHG - that is a huge paradox (it is in fact breaking science) - especially when deniers say that GHG is good as plantfood - and good for the planet since we can make more food once the permafrost is melted - even logic starts to curl up in the fetal position hugging own knees while crying a bit). 
Science spent 100 years to check if general relativity provided an interesting paradox (by not producing gravity-waves). It would be much more interesting if it did. Same with the Higgs - how cool would it not be if it turned out that the standard theory left a big gaping whole of paradox to explore? 
Now science is busy fusing the paradox of having large-scale relativity and small-scale quantum. Coupling fluid- and thermo-dynamics around CE 1900 is a good example of dealing with paradoxes. 
Paradox is just like before - existing because we are not smart enough. 
How can fusion of atoms provide energy - at the same time as fission also cause energy - from knowing that energy can not be created? It should indicate that one process store energy and the other process release? Right? Sounds like a paradox. But is it if one think about it enough? No. 
In the mean time - deniers are happy to report that they observed cold local weather outside as a paradox.', u'recommendation_count': u'8', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1513881768000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'the best of the scientists who discovered it existing can not yet explain yet how it really work', u'effect': u'that is a paradox'}, {u'cause': u'very average kids like myself could do the same', u'effect': u'i know this'}, {u'cause': u'we are not smart enough', u'effect': u'paradox is just like before existing'}, {u'cause': u'fission', u'effect': u'energy'}], u'author_id': u'4706143', u'in_reply_to': u'110021209', u'id': u'110023287', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'rockyrex', u'text': u'If you have a different opinion to the global scientific community, you must be basing it on some evidence.

I don’t believe in global warming. The evidence tells us it’s real. Nearly two hundred years of meticulous scientific studies has established that it’s not a natural cycle this time: it’s us. And my own research demonstrates the severity of the consequences for all of us, particularly those less fortunate than us who are already suffering. We care about a changing climate because it exacerbates the risks we face today: hunger, poverty, disease, and injustice. Yet when we hear Christians discussing climate change, often the predominant responses are negative: hostility, anger, and denial, a stew of toxic emotions underlain by fear. Fear of losing an identity that’s based on politics and ideology, if we get on board with a “liberal” issue; fear of rejection by our family, our community, even our church; or fear of losing our comfortable lifestyle in search of what’s right and just.

Ok 
How about trusting the pollen? Plants do not meet up in conferences telling each other that thermometer are proving that they must start to produce it earlier and for longer. 
How about trusting fish - changing spawning areas (they can not see the location or national borders from under water?
How about insects? In my experience they do attend scientific conferences, but that do not mean they conspire with scientists. 
Glaciers are certainly not attending scientific conferences just to feel politically obliged to do as told. So belive them. 
Science does not invent such things. Science discover such things and why non-political life like trees or fish collectively do such things

Remember: The SI-definition of a meter were used to be based on a stick measuring 1 meter with expensive material a short time ago. Now it is defined by the speed of life. 
The only SI measure currently defined by an artefact is the ""gram"" (or kilogram). 
Regarding temperature: Most favour the Boltzmann's constant of 1.3806505×10^−23 J/Kelvin - since it represent the colour temperature of stuff.

Because it can not be anything else (unless you believe in magic). 
We are all solar powered. Clouds, winds, trees, humans- all solar powered. So it is not so strange that ice-ages are paced (and reinforce) small changes in our orbit causing ice-ages. It is not so strange that a tropical volcano shooting ash into the stratosphere (and blocking sun-light) case an intermittent cooling period until the fine particles rain out over a few years. 
In the 19th century the physics of black-body radiation was well known. And they knew that our atmosphere kept Earth much warmer (and with a lot less amplitude/variations) than pure uninterrupted radiation balance. They also knew the primary molecules that this (CO2 and H2O). 
Newton had already shown conservation of energy (it can not be created or destroyed - it can only shift form (In a car we create heat in the engine - and use the energy of that to not just heat the engine - but also to make it move - so potential energy becomes heat that becomes kinetic energy). 
These things are fundamental laws of the universe on every scale. 
So here you have in principle all you need to start pondering reality of AGW. 
You can change global temperature by adjusting of distance and inclination to our Sun. Or you can choose the composition of the atmosphere (by the injection of volcanic ash or by it's gas-composition). On very long time-scales the output of the Sun also varies (it is increasing output) - but that is way outside the history of humanity to ""feel"". 
So - deep in principle there are not very many ""energy-nobs"" we are regulating as external forcings. Distance to sun and composition of atmosphere pretty much does it - since we are solar powered.
Importantly - this is before we start taking into account the feedbacks - where a lot of stuff gets involved - even peculiar things like how light Earth is (albedo) and such things. 
I repeat - this in the external forcings of Earth. 
Yes - there is a lot of internal variability that cause the planet to vary in temperature from day to day or decade to decade internally. 
Most of this (El Nino/La Nina/Pacific Decadal Oscillation/Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation etc etc etc) are cause by the energy of our planet is shared and exchanged by two fluids: Ocean and Atmosphere. And before you now scream ""ha - atmosphere is a gas - not a fluid, I must say that yes - our atmosphere is a fluid. The exact same physics is in action (but with different constants). 
In terms of how this work for temperature - think about where you go swimming in spring. Spring/early summer temperatures shoot up fast in the air. And it takes weeks, even months before the sea catch up with the air-temperature. The heat capacity is very different. And this cause all sorts of interesting things to occur. Most of it is really beneficial. One can open the door to the fridge without everything instantly going + 20 degrees C when one open the door, for example. Or for us humans who live where it is often minus 20 - we can step out from the sauna and dive into -20 degrees snow without instantly freezing to death (or melt all the snow around us instantly). 
Again - it is all about energy and principles of entropy. 
With a gods eye look, by regulating just two things; distance and tilt versus the sun (how much energy we receive where - and the composition of the atmosphere (how much we reflect/hold on to) one understand pretty much all about the mean state of a ""thing"" floating in space. 
This is why climate models do so well for global mean temperature vs observations - by only telling the models what the composition of volcanic ash, solar irradiance and atmospheric composition were during hindcasting. 
Before you dismiss physics - take the time to ponder the very fundamentals. 
That the planet rotate around the sun every year - around own tilted axis every 24 hrs, has a particular configuration of what it land and ocean - share energy between two different fluids with different properties plus the solids - this makes climate express itself more complicated - but zero order it does not make the total energy balance more complicated to figure out. 
We do not invent reality - we discover it. 
You could as well say it is group think that a rock falls to the ground if you release it. If one blow up a mountain with dynamite, if one blow it up from an eruption, if one hold a rock in the hand and drop it - it always fall to the ground. 
In other words - the behaviour is not caused by varying causes of chat cause the stone to fall.

The hottest five-year period recorded in the modern era will be the one we’ve just had.
Communities around the world, and the flora and fauna we share it with, feel the effects of that steady rise through extreme weather, droughts, heatwaves, shifting rains, melting ice and rising sea levels. 
Levels of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, deforestation and land clearing keep climbing.
But some remain convinced that the whole thing is an elaborate hoax and readily find a home for their conspiracy theories and pseudoscience in conservative media outlets and, too often, on publicly funded ones too.
Climate-science deniers love to fling around accusations that climate change models are massively over-egging the global warming pudding and should not be trusted (climate scientist Zeke Hausfather has a great technical explainer on this).
While many pseudo-sceptics are quick with an unfounded criticism, it’s rare for them to put their own alchemy to the test by making firm projections about what’s to come.
But sometimes they do and the results are often spectacularly and comically bad. Let’s have a look at a few.
In 2005, two Russian solar physicists, Galina Mashnich and Vladimir Bashkirtsev, accepted a $10,000 bet with the British climate modeller James Annan that will be concluded in a couple of weeks. 
At the time, Annan had been looking around for sceptics willing to put money behind their predictive prowess. 
He bet the two Russians $10,000 that the six years between 2012 and 2017 would be warmer than the six years between 1998 and 2003. 
Temperature data from the US National Climatic Data Centre – since renamed the National Centres for Environmental Information – would be used. 
Annan thought human-caused global warming would keep pushing temperatures higher. The Russian pair thought solar activity would drop away and this effect would be enough to cause global temperatures to fall. 
With only one month of data to go, you don’t need a maths degree to see who is rubbing their hands. 
So far, only two years between 1998 and 2003 rank in the top 10 warmest years, compared with at least five years between 2012 and 2017. 
Annan told me: “Yes I am confident of winning the bet, even the threatened eruption of Agung couldn’t matter … even if it had happened earlier this year. With only a few weeks to go, there is no chance of sufficient cooling for me to lose.” 
In 2011, a group of Australian and New Zealand “sceptics” predicted that temperatures were about to plummet. The year 2011, they said, would likely be “the coolest year globally since 1956 or even earlier”.
Largely ignoring the role of increasing levels of greenhouse gases, the group, led by Australian John McLean, thought instead that the cycle of warming El Niño and cooling La Niña weather patterns would be enough to explain what would happen that year. This natural cycle had entered its cooler phase in late 2010. 
You might have guessed it, but the group was wildly wrong. 
For the globe to be as cool as 1956, the temperatures would have to have been about 0.15C below the 20th century average. Instead, they were about 0.5C above the 20th century average.
According to data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2011 tied as the 11th warmest year on record. At the time, 2011 ranked as the warmest La Niña year on record.
In April 1975, Newsweek magazine ran a story highlighting how some scientists thought the world was heading for global cooling.
Climate science deniers love to cite that Newsweek story to claim there was a consensus among scientists in the 1970s that the world was heading for global cooling. They cited it so often, it became Newsweek’s most popular ever.
The dodgy logic goes like this. Because scientists were wrong then about future temperatures, they might be wrong now about projections of further warming.
Don’t think too hard about the internal inconsistency of the argument where they use some flawed predictions from the 70s to try and disprove the global warming we’re actually experiencing, but that they will also say isn’t happening. 
The real story is this. Some scientific studies in the 1970s did suggest the world was going to cool. But even back then, analysis has shown that for every study predicting cooling there were six studies predicting warming.
In 2008, Prof Ian Plimer, an Australian geologist and mining industry figure, accepted a bet from a British climate policy expert and economic modeller, Dr Chris Hope. 
Hope had been at a conference in Cambridge where, he later wrote, “most of the participants were sceptical about the influence of humans on the climate”.
Hope took the microphone and offered a £1,000 bet that 2015 would be hotter than 2008. Plimer, who thinks climate change is all natural and nothing to do with humans, accepted the bet. 
Oops. According to the UK’s MetOffice, 2015 turned out to be the hottest year on record. In fact, every year from 2009 to 2015 was hotter than 2008.
Plimer continues to be invited on to conservative media outlets to speak as an “expert” on climate change, while publishing books disparaging climate science and renewable energy and serving on the boards of several mining companies, including those owned by Australia’s richest person, Gina Rinehart. 
Plimer gave an interview to the London-based Global Warming Policy Foundation a few weeks ago, shortly after the former Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, had given that group’s annual lecture.
In October on Sky News, Plimer told the News Corp political commentator and fellow climate science denier Andrew Bolt that human-caused climate change was a “fallacy based on fraud promoted by fools”.
As in 2008, Plimer continues to be wrong.
 In 2006 and 2007, the Perth-based geologist David Archibald made several predictions about the coming years and decades. It was going to be cool, cool, cool.
“The sun drives climate change and it will be colder next decade by 2C,” wrote Archibald.
He dismissed the role of extra CO2 in driving temperatures (big mistake) and instead plumped for solar cycles as the key driver of global temperatures. He predicted that years would get progressively cooler heading out to 2030. 
According to Archibald, this would see temperatures peaking in 1998, with temperatures bottoming out around the year 2025 to levels not seen since at least the late 19th century.
What happened? When Archibald made his “prediction”, 1998 was the hottest year on record and he thought it would stay that way until at least 2030. 
Now, 1998 has dropped all the way down to eighth warmest, according to the US government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 
Archibald last made headlines in early 2017, when the geologist was running for the far-right One Nation party in Australia’s federal election, and called single mothers “ugly” and “lazy”.
Don Easterbrook is a geology professor at Western Washington University who has been making predictions of imminent global cooling for the best part of two decades. 
Easterbrook, a regular at climate science denial meetings run by the Heartland Institute, rejects the role of increasing CO2 and thinks that all you need for predicting future climates is to look at natural cycles of the past. 
So in 2001 Easterbrook thought: “If the cycles continue as in the past, the current warm cycle should end in the next few years, and global warming should abate, rather than increase, in the coming decades.” 
So it was any minute now for cooling. In 2006 Easterbrook said: “The current warm cycle should end soon and global temperatures should cool.” 
In 2008 he wrote that his “predicted cooling seems to have already begun”.
That year he also wrote: “In a nutshell, in 2001 I put my reputation on the line and published my predictions for entering a global cooling cycle about 2007 (plus or minus three to five years), based on past glacial, ice core, and other data ... If the present cooling trend continues, the [United Nations climate change] reports will have been the biggest farce in the history of science.” 
So, what happened? 
According to NOAA, the following year, 2009, was the fifth warmest year on record, 2010 tied for the warmest, then 2011 and 2012 were relatively cool at the 11th and 10th warmest years. When the data was in for 2013, it was the fourth warmest year. The years 2014, 2015 and 2016 were all progressively ranked warmest on record.
That global cooling is just round the corner though. Any minute now.
Kevin Long is an Australian mechanical engineer and one of those “long-range” weather forecasters who pull together things like moon cycles and sun spot activity to make predictions. 
In January 2014, Long declared the world was heading for “the most rapid global cooling trend for two centuries” and that during 2016 this event “should become very obvious to all”.
Long said it was “unlikely” the public would be told about the coming global cooling, because of all the “anthropogenic global warming propaganda” that the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change was endlessly “peddling”, backed by an “extremely biased world media”. 
So how’s that rapid global cooling trend going? We sort of know already, but 2017 is likely to be the second or third warmest year on record. 
Fellow Guardian environmental blogger Dana Nuccitelli wrote a whole book about the predictive qualities of this failed army of “sceptics”, called Climatology versus Pseudoscience: Exposing the Failed Predictions of Global Warming Skeptics. 
Apart from being wrong, all these failed predictions have one thing in common: they all reject the role that human emissions of carbon dioxide are having on global temperatures.
The natural cycles used by many to make predictions, such as El Niño or the Pacific decadal oscillation or the activity of the sun, are well known and well studied.
But as the failed predictions show, those natural cycles have lost their grip on the world’s temperature. Carbon dioxide is increasingly in charge.
So allow me to make a couple of predictions. 
First, based on their record, climate-science deniers will keep telling you that global cooling is just around the corner or that all that extra CO2 will be just great anyway. 
Second, many will look to the comments section to yell that climate models are broken and global temperature records are being nefariously tampered with. 
In short, the climate fail army will descend. ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2017/dec/19/checkmate-how-do-climate-science-deniers-predictions-stack-up

To be accurate, all new nuclear power plants under construction including the EPRs under construction at Hinkley Point in the UK are much safer than the Mark I BWRs at Fukushima. The EPR is more than 100 times safer with remarkably little chance of being hit by a 14m high wall of water at Hinkley Point.

The late-year release of the climate policy review, which points to allowing Australian businesses to increase their emissions as their production grows, comes as new figures confirm Australia’s annual greenhouse gas emissions are the highest on record when emissions from land use change are excluded, as well as projections suggesting the country will increase its emissions all the way to 2030 and beyond.
The new official emissions data confirm projections produced exclusively for the Guardian six months ago. In both 2015 and 2016, the government quietly released this data showing rising emissions on the days before Christmas. This year they were released almost a week before Christmas.
The review of climate policies by the Department of Environment and Energy signals the government will keep the emissions reduction fund, the centrepiece of the Direct Action policy, but it doesn’t quantify the cost of rolling it over.
The government will have to make a decision in the May budget about how much to allocate to the fund, which currently sees taxpayers pay for carbon abatement rather than big polluters. The fund started at $2.55bn and about $260m remains in the fund now.
While some climate policy experts had thought the Turnbull government might use the review to toughen the existing safeguards mechanism in order to curb emissions growth, the climate policy review goes in the opposite direction, suggesting baselines could “increase with production, supporting business growth”.
The safeguards mechanism sets emissions “baselines”, or limits, for big polluters. The new climate review points clearly to loosening it, to ensure business does not face restraints on growth, with changes to be implemented in the 2018-19 compliance year, in consultation with industry.
It says the mechanism needs to be “fairer and simpler” and it says changes are required to “address the risk of potential constraints on business growth raised by a number of stakeholders through the review”.
As well as opening the door for businesses to boost their emissions, the new review also flags the use of international permits to help Australia meet its international emissions reductions commitments – a practice Tony Abbott ruled out when he was prime minister.
While Abbott used to characterise the trade of international credits as “money that shouldn’t be going offshore into dodgy carbon farms in Equatorial Guinea and Kazakhstan”, the climate review says “access to high-quality international units will provide greater flexibility to business and government in meeting emissions reduction targets”.
The climate policy review backs a new light vehicle fuel efficiency standard to reduce transport emissions, without being definitive, and it declares Australia will meet its international climate commitments.
It also confirms the government will in 2018 start developing “a long-term emissions reduction strategy by 2020” but it qualifies the objective by noting the “strategy will not be prescriptive”. 
Despite the climate change policy review declaring the government’s current set of policies can meet Australia’s greenhouse gas reduction commitments, the latest data shows Australia is continuing to increase its emissions, making the targets harder to achieve.
Australia’s total emissions in the three months to June 2017 were 136.2 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent – more than any other June quarter since 2011.
But the those emissions were the highest for any June quarter on record when emissions from land-use change are excluded, which the government says are the most unreliable and appear to not account for massive emissions caused by a tree-clearing crisis gripping eastern and northern Australia.
The figures now form a clear trend, with the emissions over the previous four quarters also the highest on record, when unreliable emissions from land-use change are excluded.
The government also quietly released its annual emissions projections today, concluding that, despite commitments to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, they will be higher in 2030 than they are today. 
The projections do not include any modelling of possible vehicle emissions standards, or a national energy guarantee (Neg). However, since emissions are forecast to grow in all sectors, reductions in electricity and transport will not be enough to meet the government’s 2030 targets.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/19/coalitions-climate-policy-review-reveals-it-will-loosen-pollution-safeguard

Instead, Trump’s NSS paper emphasised the need for the US to regain its economic competitiveness in the world. 
That stance represents a sharp change from the Obama administration’s NSS, which placed climate change as one of the main dangers facing the nation and made building international consensus on containing global warming a national security priority.
White House officials said on Sunday that the Trump NSS was the culmination of 11 months of collaboration between all the leading security, foreign policy and economic agencies of government. The exclusion of climate change as a national security threat appears, however, to conflict with views previously expressed by the defense secretary, James Mattis. 
“Climate change is not identified as a national security threat but climate and the importance of the environment and environmental stewardship are discussed,” a senior administration official said. 
Another official said Trump’s remarks when he announced he was taking the US out of the Paris climate accord “would be the guidepost for the language in the NSS on climate”. 
In that speech in June, Trump declared “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris” and alleged the agreement “hamstrings the United States while empowering some of the world’s top polluting countries”.
The Federalist website, which first reported that Trump would drop climate change from the NSS, quoted the draft document as suggesting the Trump administration would actively oppose efforts to reduce the burning of oil, gas and coal for energy.
“US leadership is indispensable to countering an anti-growth energy agenda that is detrimental to US economic and energy security interests,” the website quoted the document as saying. 
“Given future global energy demand, much of the developing world will require fossil fuels, as well as other forms of energy, to power their economies and lift their people out of poverty.”
 A senior official said on Sunday the main difference between the Trump NSS and its predecessors was a new emphasis on border security and economic issues.
 “The economic piece … gets much more attention,” the official said. “The insistence that economic security is national security.”
In unpublished testimony provided to Congress after his confirmation hearings in January, Mattis said the US military had to consider how the thawing Arctic and drought in global flashpoints would pose present and future challenges.
 “Climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today,” Mattis said in written answers to questions posed after the public hearing by Democratic members of the committee. 
 Mattis and the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, are reported to have argued against leaving the Paris climate agreement.
Officials said the new NSS was based on Trump’s previous speeches on national security and foreign policy. The president was said to have decided to break with normal practice and launch it with a speech. 
 “As far as we have been able to determine, no president has ever rolled this out with a speech before,” a senior administration official said. 
“The president was briefed on the document all the way along but when it was near completion and when it was shown to him what it looked like, he was very excited and he personally said he wanted to introduce it to the American people and to the world.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/18/trump-drop-climate-change-national-security-strategy

For generations it was known simply as BHP or The Big Australian until its merger 16 years ago with the South African miner Billiton. 
But from today, the world's biggest miner by market value will dump the merged BHP Billiton brand and go back to the future as plain BHP.
The move to recapture BHP's status as a household name rather than a multinational giant comes as BHP defends itself from the activist US fund manager Elliott Associates, which is urging the company to abandon its dual listed structure in Australian and Britain.
The rebranding strategy in BHP's ""Think Big"" campaign features a bold uppercase logo replacing the lowercase BHP Billiton insignia introduced with the Billiton merger in 2001.

The strategy to reposition BHP's image comes after reputational and financial damage from the deadly Samarco dam collapse in late 2015.
BHP senior management has also been criticised over a record of poor investments over the past decade, including the Billiton acquisition and shale oil in the United States.

BHP, Rio Tinto deliberately sinking the price of iron oreGlenn Dyer | Sep 10, 2014 1:10PM 
It’s not greedy unionists or meddling governments that have caused a slump in iron ore prices—the smoking gun is in the hands of Rio, BHP, Fortescue and Vale.
Buckets of crocodile tears were shed this week, not to mention the eruption of schadenfreude that was felt at the collapse of iron ore wannabe Western Desert Resources, and especially the possible losses racked up by rich lister shareholders Bruce Mathieson and Scott Perrin and high-profile businessmen Rick Allert and Roger Corbett.
The iron ore price plunge—from US$130 a tonne in late 2013 to US$83.20 overnight Tuesday—is not a reflection of a fading China, weak demand or anything to do with the buy side. It’s all to do with the deliberate strategy of BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group in Australia (and remember Fortescue is still controlled by Mr Charity himself, Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest), and their great Brazilian rival, Vale. These companies have added tens of millions of tonnes of iron ore per month to the global seaborne trade, helping depress prices at a time when they were already weak.
It is a deliberate strategy to flood the global market with as much high-grade iron ore as possible to make life difficult for competitors, such as small- and medium-sized Chinese miners, as well as miners in countries such as Australia, Brazil, Guinea, Canada and India. And the two main culprits are BHP and Rio Tinto. They want to make life tough for their Australian rival, Fortescue, and all three want to make life tough, especially in the Chinese market, for Vale—the only other bulk iron ore exporter of global size.
The justification from the companies is that they are producing as much as the market can bear, and if producers and exporters of lower value/quality ore (which does include Fortescue) in Australia, China and other countries are damaged, well, that’s too bad. Call it the Darwinist approach to survival in the global iron ore trade.
So it’s ramp up the dozers, fire up the truck, trigger the ANFO, load the trains and the ships, and off we go. The bigger the better, as the expansion plans confirmed in the past month or so by the big four confirm.

Four Corners program on BHP “Catastrophic Failure”
http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/2016/02/29/4413666.htm
The Samarco disaster.
The company joint-owned by Australia's BHP Billiton and Brazilian mining giant Vale SA — exhibiting ""repeated, continual negligence"".
Police are seeking the arrest of six Samarco executives who face charges of qualified homicide.
Prosecutor Carlos Eduardo Pinto says Samarco had no warning system in place.
""People were told of the dam burst by phone. It is unimaginable to think that you are in your home, you hear a big noise, and wait for the phone to ring before you get out.""
BHP and Samarco have offered bereaved families a payment of almost $37,000.
Four Corners has seen evidence of a long history of problems at the BHP-owned dam dating back to the beginnings of its construction in 2007, and learned that independent testing of water samples from the river system has found levels of arsenic and lead 10 to 20 times higher than Brazilian regulations allow.
The company’s chief external affairs officer, Geoff Healy, says.
“This is a clean brand change for the company.”
That being dropping the death ridden association that comes with the old brand BHP Billiton.
19 people were killed in a disastrous dam burst at an iron ore joint venture in Brazil in 2015 and the share price sank to a 10-year low.
Oh the poor shareholders!
But not to worry, tens of millions are being spent on whitewashing the criminality.

The three cunningly engineered the MRRT Tax design was so that it was never going to raise much. The falling iron ore and coal prices were a convenient camouflage. 
In the end, Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Xstrata never paid any MRRT.

The warning came in BHP’s review of industry associations, in which it lists the ways BHP’s position differs from that of the MCA. BHP also considers its membership of 20 other industry bodies, declaring it will cancel its membership of the World Coal Association.
The warning to the Minerals Council is likely to be taken seriously, given BHP provides the MCA with 17% of its revenue from membership fees. Additionally, earlier ructions between BHP and the MCA’s position on climate and energy were reportedly the cause of the sudden departure of the MCA’s previous chief executive, Brendan Pearson, in September.
BHP committed to the review in September following a resolution lodged at its AGM by shareholders, calling for the company to terminate its membership of the MCA. That resolution caused a stir, receiving about 10% of shareholder votes, and was followed just days later by Pearson’s resignation.
In the review, BHP noted the Minerals Council of Australia said it supported a “technology neutral” approach to energy policy, but at the same time publicly called for technologically-specific market interventions by government, in favour of coal.
“For instance, the MCA has called for governments to use existing or new mechanisms to fund a new baseload coal plant in the Latrobe Valley,” the BHP review notes.
“Similarly, the MCA has suggested that the emissions intensity threshold of the clean energy target recommended by the Finkel review should be set relative to technology specific factors (ie to accommodate new coal generation).”
BHP also notes the MCA has argued energy reliability and affordability ought to be prioritised over and above emissions goals.
However, BHP concluded it received considerable benefit from being a member of the MCA, and so would not immediately terminate its membership. Instead, it will formally request the MCA refrain from policy advocacy on climate and energy. If it does not do so within a year, BHP will reconsider its membership of the MCA.
In the review, BHP noted its membership fees amount to just under $1.9m per year, and make up 17% of the MCA’s revenue.
BHP found an even stronger list of material differences between its positions and those held by the US Chamber of Commerce on climate and energy, including the chamber’s views that keeping global warming under 2C is unachievable and that the Paris Agreement is ineffectual.
But again, BHP concluded that it gained significant benefit from membership of the chamber, and so would request further information from it before making a final determination about whether to maintain its membership.
When reviewing membership of the World Coal Association, BHP found it gained relatively little benefit from it since the WCA was “primarily focused on information provision”. It concluded it had formed a preliminary view that it would terminate its membership of the WCA, but would seek a response from the WCA to this determination before making it final.
We will continue to call out material differences where they exist
BHP’s chief external affairs officer, Geoff Healy, said while no industry association represents the views of any single member, they are important for sharing best practice, the development of technical standards and policy, and to bring together technical expertise and experience.
“This review makes clear the principles for our ongoing participation in industry bodies. While we won’t always agree with our industry associations, we will continue to call out material differences where they exist and we will take action where necessary, as we have done today.”
“Importantly, we will also continue to communicate our own views directly to investors, governments and civil society and we will redouble our efforts to engage, clearly and constructively, with our industry associations to positively influence the position they take on matters important to our company.”
Healy said publication of Tuesday’s report demonstrated BHP’s support for action on climate change and commitment to transparency.
A spokesman for the Minerals Council of Australia said “BHP has been a valued member of the Minerals Council for many years, and we look forward to that relationship continuing in the future.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/19/bhp-could-end-2m-membership-of-minerals-council-over-policy-differences

China’s top governmental bodies on Tuesday gave their approval to plans for a carbon trading system that will initially cover the country’s heavily polluting power generation plants, then expand to take in most of the economy.
“This is a game-changer,” said Nathaniel Keohane, vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund, a US-based environmental group. “This shows global leadership on the part of the Chinese government.”
China has already set out a target of ensuring its still-growing emissions peak by 2030, a target experts say should be met. Which means the highest point will have been reached and emissions will begin to fall. 
However Keohane said the new emissions trading system could allow that peaking – essential if the world is to remain within the goals of the Paris agreement, to hold temperature rises to no more than 2 degrees C – to take place years earlier.
“That is the key question – can China now peak sooner?” said Keohane. “This process should show us more data [on power plants] and more transparency.”
Under the trading system, power plants will be issued with allowances to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide. Plants that manage to undershoot their targets, by cleaning up and becoming more efficient, will be able to sell their excess permits to other generators, which will be expected to seek greater efficiency as an alternative to paying for their emissions.
China’s power sector is responsible for about 3.3billion tonnes of carbon emissions annually, making this potentially one of the world’s most important mechanisms for reducing greenhouse gases.
The move should put an effective national price on carbon emissions across the Chinese power generation sector. It has been many years in the planning, as the outlines of the system were set out in 2015, and that in turn built on years of trials of provincial emissions trading schemes. The concept has been under review by the Chinese government for more than a decade.
Putting in place the full structures and regulations necessary for the operation of the system will take several months or possibly a year more. Tuesday’s launch gave the go-ahead for important developments, such as the setting-up of an exchange on which emissions permits can be traded, but the Chinese government stopped short of setting out the allocations of emissions allowances to the relevant power plants.
The overall allocation of allowances in the system, across the power sector, is also not yet known, nor is the likely price on carbon that should result. These are likely to become clearer later in 2018.
When fully operational, the system will be extended over several years to cover eight sectors in total: power; iron and steel; non-ferrous metals, such as aluminium; chemicals; petro-chemicals; paper; building materials; and civil aviation.
The government has not yet released details of how the expansion of the system will work, but the power sector is seen as the first stage because it is the greatest source of emissions, and the easiest to measure and the easiest target for energy efficiency measures.
When fully up and running, which could be as soon as 2019, the initial power sector stage of the scheme will already be more than one and a half times bigger than the EU’s emissions trading scheme, currently the world’s largest.
Emissions trading as a concept was built into the Kyoto protocol of 1997. The idea is simple: in order to bring down greenhouse gases, a limit is set on the emissions of countries or companies, and within that limit they can choose whether to reduce their emissions, or pay others to do so. For instance, a rich country could choose to fund renewable energy projects in a developing nation, or a large company could buy emissions permits from cleaner rivals.
In this way, a notional price on carbon should emerge that gives companies a guide to the environmental costs and benefits of reducing their burden on the planet. Overall, given the limit imposed under the system, the result should be a net reduction in carbon.
The US has rejected several attempts to develop such a system as a way of reducing carbon emissions at a national level, though some states have proceeded with their own versions.
Paula DiPerna, a special advisor to the Carbon Disclosure Project, who helped set up the Chinese pilot project, said: “The world should welcome the announcement of a national cap-and-trade in China, which will set new standards for global carbon pricing, address climate change head-on, and help integrate environmental finance with general financial best practices.”
The emerging Chinese emissions trading system may give other governments a renewed interest in such measures.
However, trading systems have been bedevilled with difficulty. The EU’s trading system, the biggest in the world before the Chinese government’s measures, suffered several collapses in the price of carbon even before the financial crisis of 2008, which resulted in a decade-long low in the cost of allowances under the system.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/19/china-aims-to-drastically-cut-greenhouse-gas-emissions-through-trading-scheme

A team at Plymouth University in the UK spent 12 months analyzing what happened when a number of synthetic materials were washed at different temperatures in domestic washing machines, using different combinations of detergents, to quantify the microfibres shed. They found that acrylic was responsible for releasing nearly 730,000 tiny synthetic particles (microplastics) per wash, five times more than polyester-cotton blend fabric, and nearly 1.5 times as many as polyester. [4][5][6][7]Ecologist Mark Browne discovered something scientifically important after months of tediously examining sediment along shorelines around the world. He noticed fiber waste that no one else had predicted. They were tiny, synthetic, and all over the coastline, with the greatest concentration near sewage outflows. Of the man-made material found on the shoreline, 85% were microfibers and matched the types of material (such as nylon and acrylic) used in clothing

The cotton industry relies heavily on chemicals, such as herbicides, fertilizers and insecticides, although a very small number of farmers are moving toward an organic model of production, and organic cotton products are now available for purchase at limited locations.

And as for cars causing millions of deaths worldwide...that's more to do with the people driving them than anything else. A mate of mine is a road safety instructor of international repute. He was once sent by the British Gvt to a 'you know what' nation as part of an aid package to deliver training to local professional drivers (trucks, buses, taxis).
He opened his presentation the way he always did ...outlining that the safety of the driver and those around him was a matter of personal responsibility..they were in control of their actions and the consequences were down to them.

His remarks were translated and there was a growing rumble of disquiet in the room. He was taken to one side and told this was not acceptable.....everything was controlled and destined by allah, and to suggest otherwise was blasphemy.

But Death comes easy for them now, no batteringOblivion at seventy miles an hour, head on,Just the toxic rain of money slathered across The meadows hills and downs.One swallow makes a summer now;Soon she’ll be gone too with the bees, The birdsong and the riotous great clamourThat once welcomed every dawn.And, as we face each silent yearAnd see the dustbowl fells and fields, We’ll weep for what we all have lost:For clouds of midges, nights alive with moths, The scimitars of swallows, martins, swifts,The wrens and sparrows, nightingales and jaysAnd the chanting birds that caroled onceAll across those golden, summer days.

I do see career minded conservationists who believe in commodification of the natural world as a big part of the problem.

Like it or not homo sapien is part of the natural world the best way to preserve nature is to coexist with it & integrate ourselves back into it, rather than simply exploit it to suit our self indulgent lifestyles & ease our guilt by making a small donation to a self interested organization who earn a living from it, but fail to address the real causes of the problem.
Conservation has become a merry go round in most part becoming the problem not the solution that doesn't mean i am against all conservation as an example the David Sheldrick trust have a sensible approach to Elephant ecology & how nature controls populations as opposed human intervention of culling.

I would suggest re-reading & thinking about my comment before replying but i know people rarely do so. Which is why the natural world is being lost at such an alarming rate, because Conservationists rarely look at the big picture!
I would say conservationists are becoming the problem simply because they conserve things on human terms, montiseation & commodification of nature, putting things in pigeon holes, treating wildlife as farm stock, constant intrusive monitoring of individuals. Management & control of the ecosystems & habitats. All done by humans for human interest & human profit.
The reality is its humanity that requires management, control & discipline to allow the natural world to be exactly that ""NATURAL"". It seems most conservationists have lost sight of what is natural & have buried their heads in science that they forget nature.
I really don't think i 'm the blind one here...The idea that all we need to do is find a different way to keep doing the same thing is the problem, its the way we live that has to change not bend nature to our way of thinking. But of course that is what being human has become.

We inhabit parallel worlds of perception, bounded by our interests and experience. What is obvious to some is invisible to others. I might find myself standing, transfixed, by the roadside, watching a sparrowhawk hunting among the bushes, astonished that other people could ignore it. But they might just as well be wondering how I could have failed to notice the new V6 Pentastar Sahara that just drove past.
As the psychologist Richard Wiseman points out: “At any one moment, your eyes and brain only have the processing power to look at a very small part of your surroundings … your brain quickly identifies what it considers to be the most significant aspects of your surroundings, and focuses almost all of its attention on these elements.” Everything else remains unseen.
Our selective blindness is lethal to the living world. Joni Mitchell’s claim that “you don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone” is, sadly, untrue: our collective memory is wiped clean by ecological loss. One of the most important concepts defining our relationship to the natural world is shifting baseline syndrome, coined by the fisheries biologist Daniel Pauly. The people of each generation perceive the state of the ecosystems they encountered in their childhood as normal and natural. When wildlife is depleted, we might notice the loss, but we are unaware that the baseline by which we judge the decline is in fact a state of extreme depletion.
So we forget that the default state of almost all ecosystems – on land and at sea – is domination by a megafauna. We are unaware that there is something deeply weird about British waters; they are not thronged with great whales, vast shoals of bluefin tuna, two-metre cod and halibut the size of doors, as they were until a few centuries ago. We are unaware that the absence of elephants, rhinos, lions, scimitar cats, hyenas and hippos, that lived in this country during the last interglacial period (when the climate was almost identical to today’s), is also an artefact of human activity.
And the erosion continues. Few people younger than me know that it was once normal to see fields white with mushrooms, or rivers black with eels at the autumn equinox, or that every patch of nettles was once reamed by caterpillars. I can picture a moment at which the birds stop singing, and people wake up and make breakfast and go to work without noticing that anything has changed.
Conversely, the darkness in which we live ensures that we don’t know what we have, even while it exists. Blue Planet II revealed the complex social lives and remarkable intelligences of species we treat as nothing but seafood (a point it failed to drive home, in its profoundly disappointing final episode). If we were aware of the destruction we commission with our routine purchases of fish, would we not radically change our buying habits? But the infrastructure of marketing and media helps us not to see, not to think, not to connect our spots of perception to create a moral world view upon which we can act.
Most people subconsciously collaborate in this evasion. It protects them from either grief or cognitive dissonance. To be aware of the wonder and enchantment of the world, its astonishing creatures and complex interactions, and to be aware simultaneously of the remarkably rapid destruction of almost every living system, is to take on a burden of grief that is almost unbearable. This is what the great conservationist Aldo Leopold meant when he wrote: “One of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in a world of wounds.”
In June, this year, a powerful light – 125 watts to be precise – was shone into a corner of my own darkness. Two naturalists from Flanders, Bart Van Camp and Rollin Verlinde, asked if they could come to our tiny urban garden and set up a light trap. The results were a revelation. I had come to see the garden – despite our best efforts – as almost dead: butterflies and beetles are rare sights here. But when Bart and Rollin showed us the moths they had caught, I realised that what we see does not equate to what there is. There are 59 species of butterfly in the UK, but 2,500 species of moth, and our failure to apprehend the ecology of darkness limits our understanding of the living world.
When they opened the trap, I was astonished by the range and beauty of their catch. There were pink and olive elephant hawkmoths; a pine hawkmoth, feathered and ashy; a buff arches, patterned and gilded like the back of a barn owl; flame moths in polished brass; the yellow kites of swallow-tailed moths; common emeralds the colour of a northern sea, with streaks of foam; grey daggers; a pebble prominent; heart and darts; coronets; riband waves; willow beauties; an elder pearl; small magpie; double-striped pug; rosy tabby. The names testify to a rich relationship between these creatures and those who love them.
Altogether, there were 217 moths of 50 species. This, Van Camp and Verlinde told me, was roughly what they had expected to find. Twenty-five years ago, there would have been far more. A food web is collapsing, probably through a combination of pesticides, habitat destruction and light pollution, and we are scarcely aware of its existence.
Moths evolved about 190 million years ago. Butterflies are a relatively recent development, diverging 140 million years later. Most explanations for this split focus on the spread of flowering plants. But might it have more to do with the fact that bats developed echo-location, which allows them to detect their prey, at roughly that time? Could the diurnal butterfly have been a response to a deadly adaptation by the nocturnal moth’s main predator?
Every summer night, an unseen drama unfolds over our gardens, as moths, whose ears are tuned to the echo-locating sounds bats make, drop like stones out of the sky to avoid predation. Some tiger moths have evolved to jam bat sonar, by producing ultra-sonic clicks of their own. We destroy the wonders of the unseen world before we appreciate them.
That morning I became a better naturalist, and a better conservationist. I began to look more closely, to seek the unseen, to consider what lies beneath. And to realise just how much there is to lose.

Well, I supplied plenty of evidence to the contrary, even more so when you consider the giant lithium battery installed by Elon Musk since these articles were written

The giant lithium battery in SA is indeed giant as far a batteries go. As for dealing with the intermittency of solar and wind, it's a pip squeak. 100 MW for 80 mins. What happens if wind goes away for several days? The cost of lithium batteries to deal with that would be to say the least, prohibitive. Then there would be the questions of full life cycle emissions, EROEI (energy returned on energy invested) and consumption of resources.
Grid connected batteries are restricted to grid support and possibly some peak power supply when electricity prices are very, very high - for some considerable time into the future. There is no guarantee that will ever change. Betting the climate on it is reckless.

Here is one example where a Swiss company is extracting CO2 from the atmosphere http://www.climeworks.com/This is reacted with hydrogen from electrolysis of water to produce methanol and derivatives. Audi have used this technologyhttps://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/audi-e-fuels-243In these examples the end product is an energy ""carrier"" and the suggestion is using renewably sourced energy.The US example is actually much better as CO2 is about 140 times more concentrated in seawater than in the atmosphere. Where a nuclear reactor scores so highly (apart from its colossal power) is that it is already heating up the seawater in cooling the reactor and turbines and hence part of the energy required in water splitting is supplied thermally at minimal energy cost.In Iceland a similar technology is being used from geothermal energy.http://carbonrecycling.is/george-olah/In fact the whole synthetic hydrocarbon is summed up in this wikipedia articlehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol_economy

Renewable energy is good for investment, which fossil fuels are not. The renewable energy industry already employs more Australians than the coal industry. Renewable energy is cleaner and healthier for Australian citizens and also for Australian energy industry workers - you do not get asthma, emphysemia or lethal black lung disease from renewables. Renewable energy costs less for households and manufacturing and industry, than fossil fuel energy. Renewable energy is easier to deliver to local households from localised nodes, rather than being delivered via expensive poles and lines that constantly require upgrading, over huge distances - this is why it is the answer to energy delivery to isolated villages in India and Africa, that will help to pull these people out of poverty, despite the outright lies the LNP tell about coal being the answer, when it plainly is NOT. Renewable energy will help to keep the global warming temperature below +2 degrees on pre-industrial era levels; which will help to prevent, floods, drought, malnutrition and starvation, and wild fires, which all result in loss of property, damage to infrastructure and of course loss of life; deadly water borne diseases, like malaria and cholera; loss of homes; loss of livelihoods which will actually increase poverty; heat waves that cause heart attacks and heat stroke; sea level rise which will displace billions of people and create a massive issue with world wide refugees, and will make previously arable land unable to sustain crops and food; whole villages being buried in mudslides due to deluges of rainfall; extreme weather events such as cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes; and challenges to world security as a result of human conflict over the scarce and fast decreasing resources of safe food and clean water; etc.
The LNP claim their policy of locking up innocent, law abiding, refugees in off-shore torture gulags, for the terms of their natural lives, is for the sake of saving lives, yet they maintain an energy policy that will see billions of fellow human being becoming refugees and millions of fellow human beings losing their lives.
In addition to this deliberate disrespect for human life, and human rights, this LNP wishes to prevent the Australian people from benefiting from cheaper power, healthier air, massively reduced destruction of the environment, and the increased employment, that the renewable energy industry offers to all Australians. With battery storage technology now ready to go, there is no down side to renewables.
The LNP obviously hate Australian citizens and human beings world wide, otherwise why would they do this? Ohhh, ... thats right ... sorry for my momentary lapse of reason ... without fossil fuels, the LNP would not get their election campaign funded by the fossil fuel industry, and the Minerals Council and the Murdoch Press would give the government a shalaking.
The trade off for the LNP though, would be that it may be the only hope they have of winning the next election. Because Australians are sick of rich fossil fuel corporations price gouging us consumers, destroying our precious environment, running the government, paying zero tax, harming the health of Australians and running rough-shod over Australia's ex-democracy.
When you consider that in 1956 Exxon-Mobile first became aware that its product was harming the earth's climate, and since then they have funded fake research, hidden factual anti-fossil fuel research, funded politicians to do their bidding, and funded think tanks such as the IPA to perform their PR greenwashing and disseminate climate denial, it is obvious we owe these fossil fuel corporations nothing; certainly NOT our loyalty or support.

Were they to go ahead, these projects would produce as much capacity as 17 Hazelwood power stations and mean half of Australia’s electricity was supplied by renewables.
But many are likely to never get the finance they need, since the government’s 2020 renewable energy target is already set to be exceeded by projects now under construction, according to the latest renewable energy index produced by Green Energy Markets and funded by GetUp.
The government’s target is for 33,000GWh to be produced by large-scale renewables by 2020 but wind, solar and bio-energy projects already under construction are likely to produce almost 40,000GWh of electricity by then.
The further 27GW of large-scale renewable projects proposed, combined with the expected growth in rooftop solar, would mean just over half of Australia’s electricity supply could be met with renewables by 2030.
“Most of these projects will remain dormant until the government puts its long-term Paris agreement commitments into a legally enforceable policy,” the report, authored by Tristan Edis from Green Energy Markets, concludes.
The proposed emissions target in the national energy guarantee – a mere 26% cut in emissions from the national electricity market below 2005 levels by 2030 – would not provide the policy incentive to get the projects built.
 It is estimated they would deliver 13,443 jobs during construction, were they to go ahead.
“There’s going to be another investment drought in renewables unless we get better targets than those proposed under Malcolm Turnbull’s NEG,” said Miriam Lyons, energy campaign director at GetUp.

While neither measure is a plausible course of action, the Greens say it reveals the significance of the gap left by the weak ambition of the government’s plans for the national energy guarantee.
This week the government released projections for Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions to 2030. They showed that based on existing policies, far from any cuts being made, the country’s rising greenhouse gas pollution would continue to increase to 2030 and beyond. It revealed Australia needed to find ways to abate 868m tonnes of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions between 2021 and 2030.
Those projections did not include the cuts that would be achieved if the government’s proposed national energy guarantee was implemented, or savings from vehicle emissions regulations, which have not been agreed to by the government.
Australia has committed to reduce its overall greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030 and it is widely accepted the majority of cuts would need to be made in the electricity sector, as it is the easiest and most cost-effective place to make large emissions cuts.
But the government has refused to consider emissions cuts in the national electricity market greater than 26%.
Independent analysis conducted by the Greens shows that reducing emissions in the electricity sector by that much would still leave at least 583m tonnes of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas to be abated by 2030, through the rest of the economy. 
“The government’s own data shows the cost of caving in to the climate deniers on the backbench,” said Adam Bandt, Greens climate change and energy spokesman. “Because the government’s energy policy is now so coal-focused, it places an impossible burden on agriculture, transport and industry.
“At some point the penny will drop with the Nationals and they’ll be livid. By dropping the ball on energy, the government has left agriculture and transport with ridiculously large tasks, like taking every cow out of every farm or taking every car off every road, just to meet our paltry Paris commitments.”
Janet Rice, the Greens transport spokeswoman, said: “The Turnbull government’s commitment to reducing transport pollution has been woeful so far. For all his selfies on trains, the PM has taken no meaningful action on public transport, zero-carbon electric vehicles, setting strong vehicle efficiency standards, or unchoking our clogged cities.”
Figures released today by the Carbon Markets Institute showed the low-ambition target in the electricity sector would threaten a massive 27 gigawatts of renewable energy projects proposed for development across Australia. Despite those projects being planned, the proposed emissions target in the national energy guarantee would not provide the policy incentive to get the projects built.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/21/coalition-emissions-targets-would-require-taking-every-cow-out-of-every-farm-say-greens

His scientific investigations ranged widely but his most influential and sustained contributions lay in decoding the complex climatic signals encrypted by annual tree rings and thereby positioning the science of dendro-climatology on rigorously tested foundations.
His methods were adopted by researchers worldwide and this led to the growth of a global network of tree-ring data, providing estimates of annual temperature stretching back centuries and in many cases millennia before modern instrumental records began.
Collective international efforts in which Keith played a leading role eventually enabled the average temperature of the Earth to be estimated on an annual basis over the past 1,000 years. This showed that modern global warming has exceeded any of the natural variations in that time.
Tree rings alone could not pinpoint the cause but they proved conclusively that something new was afoot, and confirmed the wealth of other evidence that was presented to governments via the five-yearly assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Keith made important contributions to four of these including the 2007 assessment that was followed by the collective award of the Nobel peace prize to the IPCC scientists.
Keith was born in Liverpool to Raphael Briffa, a machinist from Malta, and his English wife, Dorothy (nee Campbell), a catering manager. He grew up in Speke, attending St Francis Xavier’s college before studying biological sciences at the University of East Anglia. He joined UEA’s climatic research unit in 1977, remaining for 40 years and becoming professor, deputy director and emeritus professor.
In 1983 he married Sarah Raper, a fellow climate scientist. They brought up two daughters on a run-down farmstead that provided ample opportunities for his passion for renovation and building. He brought enormous enthusiasm to all his interests and became extremely knowledgable at each, knowledge that extended to the care and management of a small flock of sheep, later replaced by alpacas. He also had an interest in the arts, and latterly took up metal detecting with a small group of friends, researching the artefacts that can be seen on the website Detecting Norfolk History.
Keith was fun to be with. His capacity for hard work, good humour and affability infected everything he did, while his generosity to fellow scientists and students did much to promote the spirit of collaboration on which modern climate science thrives.
In 2009 he was struck by the first of several bouts of cancer. An optimist, he was determined to keep on living and working with the aid of his doctors, which he did for nearly a decade. The last of his 130 scientific papers was published a few months ago.
He is survived by Sarah, their daughters, Amy and Kirsten, and his sister, Dianne.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/21/keith-briffa-obituary

The number of migrants attempting to settle in Europe each year will triple by the end of the century based on current climate trends alone, independent of other political and economic factors, according to the research. Even if efforts to curb global warming are successful, the number of applications for asylum could rise by a quarter, the authors predict.
Wolfram Schlenker, professor at the school of international and public affairs at Columbia University in New York, and lead author of the study, said: “Europe will see increasing numbers of desperate people fleeing their home countries.”
Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, at the London School of Economics and Political Science, who was not involved with the report, told the Guardian the results should be taken seriously by policymakers, though current forecasting models frequently fail to take such factors into account.
He said: “This study shows how Europe will be impacted by one of the most serious impacts of climate change. Hundreds of millions, perhaps billions, of people will be exposed to coastal sea level rise and shifts in extreme weather that will cause mass migrations away from the most vulnerable locations. We know from human history that such migrations often lead to conflict and war, with devastating consequences. The huge potential costs of migration-related conflict are usually omitted from economic models of climate change impacts in the future.”
Climate change is predicted to result in more droughts, floods, heatwaves, and other extreme weather, as well as more intense storms and rising sea levels. These effects are likely to render agriculture more difficult, if not impossible, across swathes of the globe, including sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia.
These effects will also be felt in Europe, but its lower base temperatures, relative prosperity and advanced infrastructure mean the damage could be contained, and make it an attractive destination for migrants.
Migration, or attempted migration, to Europe has increased markedly in the last decade, with leading causes including the war in Syria, turmoil in north Africa and the middle East, and a burgeoning young population with few economic prospects in many regions of Africa and the middle East.
The new study, published on Thursday in the journal Science, was initiated and largely funded by the EU’s Joint Research Centre, with contribution from the US Department of Energy, and led by scientists at Columbia University in New York.
The authors of the study examined asylum applications in the EU from 103 countries between 2000 and 2014, during which time applications averaged more than 350,000 a year. They compared the applications with information on environmental factors, such as temperature and weather, and adjusted the data for factors such as conflict and political turmoil.
In doing so, they spotted a trend correlating weather and changes in the number of asylum applications. For instance, countries with average temperatures around 20C – the optimum for growing many crops – show a higher number of applications, while there are fewer asylum seekers from areas with cooler temperatures.
The data showed that the more temperatures in a country’s key agricultural regions rose above 20C in the growing season, the more people left their homes for another country. They recorded increases in the number of migrants from hot places such as Iraq and Pakistan when temperatures rose. However, immigration from colder countries fell when temperatures rose towards 20C.
The scientists posit that as the globe warms, the number of people seeking asylum in Europe will correspondingly rise. Warming of 2.6C to 4.8C, which climate experts say is likely unless stronger action is taken to bring down greenhouse gas emissions, would result in as many as 660,000 additional asylum seekers coming to Europe each year by 2100, according to the model.
Linking migration to climate change is controversial. Although many scientists, and many studies, are clear that rising temperatures and extreme weather are likely to increase migration, it is difficult to separate this factor from the myriad other factors that drive people to flee their homes. A drought in Syria from 2006 to 2010 was posited, in a 2015 study, as a factor behind that country’s civil war, which broke out in 2011 and still rages.
Immigration, especially in the wake of the financial crisis and recessions which crippled European economies a decade ago and whose effects are only now beginning to subside, has become one of the hottest political issues in Europe. It was cited as one of the biggest factors in the UK’s referendum on EU membership, and has played a major role in recent elections in Germany and France.
Schlenker said a rise in migration owing to climate change could exacerbate political tensions further. “Europe is already conflicted about how many refugees to admit. Though poorer countries in hotter regions are most vulnerable to climate change, our findings highlight the extent to which countries are interlinked.”
Solomon Hsiang, professor at Berkeley, University of California, and author of a previous study linking conflict and climate change, who was not involved with the current research, said the world must prepare. “We will need to build new institutions and systems to manage this steady flow of asylum-seekers. As we have seen from recent experience in Europe, there are tremendous costs, both for refugees and their hosts, when we are caught flat-footed.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/21/devastating-climate-change-could-see-one-million-migrants-a-year-entering-eu-by-2100

The Bureau of Meteorology has forecast a quiet Christmas Day with generally fine weather across much of the country.
“It’s going to be a beautiful day for many parts, probably one of the most stable and quietest weather days we’ve seen for most, if not all, parts of the country,” senior forecaster Dean Narramore said on Friday.
Some showers and thunderstorms were expected for the area between Sydney and Brisbane, the Top End and the Kimberley Coast, he said.
Narramore said the best forecast for warm and sunny weather will be in Perth and Adelaide.
Inland areas would probably hit 40C, which would be a few degrees above average but not record heat, he said.
Narramore said the temperature would rise midweek in much of southeast Australia before the next “weather maker” moved through on Thursday into Friday, which could result in some showers and storms.
It was too early to predict the weather for New Year’s Eve, he said.
Senior climatologist Dr Andrew Watkins said Sydney and Brisbane should be a little cooler than normal during January, while Melbourne, Hobart, Adelaide and Perth were looking a little warmer.
“We’re looking at some warmer conditions through southeastern Australia and also in the southwest as well - warmer days but also unfortunately a few warmer nights, a bit more uncomfortable for sleeping,” Watkins said.
“In terms of rainfall, possibly a little wetter through New South Wales and Queensland, particularly in the eastern half of the state, but elsewhere the odds aren’t really strongly swinging towards a wetter or drier January.”
Watkins said Australia was experiencing La Niña conditions, but nowhere near as strong as the last La Niña in 2010-12, which caused widespread flooding rain over January.
He said 2017 was likely to have been among the top five warmest years on record for Australia, and in the top 10 for NSW, Queensland, Victoria and possibly South Australia.
Annual rainfall will have been close to average.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/22/fine-christmas-weather-on-the-way-says-bureau-of-meteorology

Asian blush, as it's called, is a sign of high blood pressure. In my case it was related to heart disease thanks to the NSAIDs I used to take for my rheumatoid arthritis. Around the same time my cholesterol went through the roof. Jumping from 85 to 135 to 192 in the space of 1 year. Other than that there are some really nice mild chillis that don't bring too much heat to a dish. There was one I got years ago that was excellent in all forms. You could use them as poppers like those stuffed Jalapeno's, eat them raw like carrot sticks with some dip, dry them out and use them in a variety of dishes to bring that chilli flavour but not the heat. Best thing was it was easy to work out the heat strength because they changed colour so vividly as they were growing. But even when they were fully mature they just weren't hot. Much like a cross between a capsicum and a chilli. I think sometimes they're referred to as the Christmas chilli. If you are going to grow your own things then have a look at ginger, turmeric, and galangal for hedge plants. Mass plantings of herbs also work good. I'm testing this new method of pot farming potatoes for increased production that I hope will work out good. Choke grow really well with passionfruit and passionfruit are excellent for bringing in the bees. There's 5 different type of passionfruit that flower at different times of the year. And don't forget that choke vines will die back in the colder months but then come out charging when spring comes back around. Citrus trees are also good to grow as you can keep them quite small.

Apart from Dastyari, what other highlights have we seen this past year from the opposition leader who has a popularity lower than Turnbull's?
BQEND Since September 2016 Shorten has lead a opposition that has a 24 seat lead over Turnbull's Liberals.
I call that a highlight. Turnbull has to copy ALP's policy to stay popular, another highlight.Every time he does that Turnbull is branded a leftie by his own party. 
At some point people will realise not everything is Shortens fault like Cormann (pathetic as he is himself) Pyne (a grade A backstabber) and especially the prime backstabber Turnbull constantly portray in their political spin added by a bias Murdoch press.
All leaders are mostly backroom bastards that the public hates, its just that some don't get a lot of press about their grub by grab for power.
Look at Turnbull's judgement in UteGate What a complerte bastard he was in that... supported by the Murdoch's and then dumped as they backstabbed Turnbull when it all went tits up for them.
How about the latest visit to the SkyNews bosses asking them to control their dog... Bolt. 
Turnbull is just better at dropping anyone else in the poo and coming out all innocent looking.
BludgerTrack: 54.1-45.9 to Labor
So what does that mean? People like Turnbull but think the government he leads are... batshit crazy.
May he should switch to a ALP seat? 
He may as well he steals their policies and then puts shit on the leader of the organisation.

Duetcher Bank says that by the end of 2017 solar will be same price to generate as fossil generation in 80% of the world market.
By 2020 no matter where you are rooftop solar unsubsidised will become cheaper than the cost of transmission, so even if cost of power is zero solar will be cheaper because it will be cheaper to generate than for companies to send it to you.
Solar plus storage will be cheaper than transmission in 2022 - this in fact is how costs stack up in Australia right now if only our leaders would acknowledge this.
This means in 2022 solar will be the same as oil at $10 a barrel and gas at $5, uncompetitive!
What this means is we are seeing the last rem ants of greed by oil companies, they are milking us for the last few dollars they can squeeze before they are destroyed.

But there is so much more damage from the Howard years yet to be undone. And much that may never be undone. Examine almost any contemporary political problem, from Australia’s growing economic inequality to the declining performance of our school students relative to the rest of the world, to our dying coral reefs, and you will find the fingerprints of John Winston Howard. 
Howard was the most right-wing prime minister we ever had, at least until Tony Abbott. Unlike Abbott, as ineffectual in office as Billy McMahon, the other usual nominee for worst-ever PM, Howard was highly effectual but in a regressive sense.
Let’s get down to examples, starting with the economy.
Saul Eslake, former big bank economist, has memorised a long list of the worst economic decisions of the past 20 years, and almost all the items on it are down to Howard and his treasurer, Peter Costello.

“This is coal – don’t be afraid, don’t be scared”, the treasurer cried out maniacally, before passing it along his front bench where Barnaby Joyce proceeded to fondle it like Gollum his precious ring.
The coal stunt was a none-too-subtle attempt to shift the focus of energy policy away from the imperative of transitioning to a renewable future by opening a new wave of investment in fossil fuels.
The premeditated stunt locked the Coalition in behind a coal lobby that had been running a coordinated campaign to besmirch renewables since an extreme weather event had led to blackouts in South Australia in late 2016.
The lump of coal act was also the final surrender by a prime minister who had built a public persona around his determination to take meaningful action on climate change.
What followed was a year of inaction on energy that history will judge poorly, a running joke of reviews, thought bubbles and reports designed to placate the deniers and chancers who now direct the Coalition.
It means Australia finishes the year with little progress on energy policy save an eight-page framework likely to live up to its acronym, the inaction continuing to retard the developments of renewables to the benefit of fossil fuel interests.
While probably the most revealing finding of this year’s Essential Report shows that the public is way ahead of the politics on embracing renewables, the coal lobby intervention has actually shifted support back, and there are still large numbers of uncommitted voters ready to be wooed back to coal.
The lump of coal works as a broader metaphor for so much else that was wrong with a year when a prime minister captive to his conservative base proved incapable of leading the nation forward.
A copper-plated broadband network, a divisive postal survey on marriage equality, Tampa-era border security panics, union-bashing conspiracies, reds under the beds (only this time Chinese) – all underpinned by a blind faith in trickle down 1980s economics.
And just to throw in a punchline, the parliament was hijacked by a constitutional anachronism that rendered representatives of all the major players as being ineligible to be on the battlefield.
Yet for all its noise and fury, 2017 was a year of political stasis. We finished 2017 with exactly the same polling figures as we finished 2016 – Labor ahead with a decisive but not conclusive two party preferred advantage of 53-47.
As the recent numbers indicate, this actually represents a significant comeback for a prime minister who just a few weeks ago seemed to be facing his own existential crisis.
The PM has benefited from two unforeseen errors from Labor – the suspicious but devastating leaking of compromising details of Sam Dastyari’s pro-Chinese advocacy and the failure of all Labor MPs to deliver on their citizenship paperwork.
But this does not detract from what has been a wretched year for the PM. His company tax cuts stalled, he has achieved little but a set of laws attacking his political opponents and already being seen to be open to abuse.
The marriage equality vote was a step forward for the nation, but the process was expensive and needlessly divisive, the May federal budget was rightly portrayed as Labor-lite, while a bank royal commission has been imposed on a reluctant government.
For Labor it’s been a year of hard yards with some real return on effort around its commitment to policy development. On a range of key issues, Labor has public support and brand advantage: its 50% renewables target, its crackdown on negative gearing, its commitment to reverse cuts to penalty rates, all garnering strong public support.
Opposition leader Bill Shorten’s best moments have been when he has wrapped Labor’s mission into the broader inequality story – linking the endemic tax minimisation of business and the very rich to the flat-lining wages of ordinary workers.
But while Labor finishes the year with a sustained advantage over the Coalition, a final set of Essential questions shows there is no sense of inevitably about a change of government. In a set of questions about the year just past voters are far more upbeat than over recent years.
While hardly ebullient, the public mood is significantly more positive than at the end of recent years. On indicators like family and work, there have been more than double-digit increases in positivity.
There are still cautions over the high number of voters who see their financial situation as deteriorating, but the white-hot anger we have picked up in recent years is not as pronounced.
Likewise with expectations of the year ahead. While it’s fair to say we are not skipping into 2018, we are certainly not dreading it either.
Again, the expectations around work and family are particularly positive, setting up the mood of a more secure rather than scared electorate.
How will this play our politically? Like most things it can break two ways.
For the government, these figures can read as a sign of reassurance, proof that the public are not arming themselves with baseball bats and turning their anger on their elected representatives.
They will take this as a cue to narrow the public debate to the self-interest of income tax cuts that served the Howard government (if not the nation) so well during the last set of economic good time.
For Labor, there’s a different read: the sense that a more optimistic nation is feeling secure enough to embrace a new wave of positive change, not just energy transition but social transition as well, that sees the role of government as doing more than just getting out of the way and letting the free market rip.
Which brings us back to our lump of coal.
When you have something as profound as the accumulated mass of our biological history in your hands what does a wise leader do? Burn it? Conserve it? Turn it into a prop for cheap laughs?
The lump of coal should remind us that everything is transformative, nothing remains the same and that clinging to the past, denying the inevitability of change is anathema to our collective history.
After a year of going nowhere, here’s to a 2018 where we find a way of meeting our historical responsibilities to do something better: both our elected leaders and we, the voting public, inextricably entwined whether we like it or not.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2017/dec/22/a-lump-of-coal-metaphor-for-a-wretched-year-for-malcolm-turnbull

Correct.You have denied the science presented by the RS, describing them as ""hallucinating"".You reject the projections based on science, by scientists whose projections have been confirmed over the last 30 years.
That is denial.
You're in the ""its happening but it won't be bad"" phase of denial.
BQSTART
You called links by deniers hogwash. That's not a strawman, that's recalling a fact.
BQEND
Incorrect.I stated that deniers post a lot of hogwash.
Then you made the claim I had rejected peer reviewed science. That was the strawman argument.
Just posting links does not make the denier's argument correct, because as shown many times deniers post links without actually reading what they actually say, and instead rely on out of context cherry picked quotes.
One denier last week posted a link to a paper claiming it showed polar bear populations were rising. When the in fact the paper stated that the projections were for 2/3rds of the polar bear population to be extripated by 2050. I remember that one well despite it being nuked (the whole thread), because I had to check that my recollection of the definition of extripate was correct. It means remove,. destroy etc.The direct opposite of what that denier was claiming.

That is because those warming periods were caused by an entirely different mechanism; namely, initial warming resulting from orbital changes, then amplification of that initial warming caused by feedbacks, including CO2.

BQSTART
Beginning in the mid-1980s, forest wildfire activity in western US forests underwent an abrupt and sustained regional increase, with nearly two-thirds of that increase concentrated in forests of the Northern US Rocky Mountains between 42° and 50° N latitude [1]. This change in Northern US Rocky Mountain forest wildfire has been linked to climatic factors such as warmer temperatures, dry summers, below-average winter precipitation or earlier spring snowmelt [1–4]. Analyses of reconstructed paleo wildfire and climate indices have also shown similar associations between widespread Northern US Rockies fire years and warm springs combined with warm and dry summers [5,6]. Warming temperatures increase vapour pressure deficit and evapotranspiration, with effects on wildfire, other disturbance and mortality, and forest productivity [7]. 
The timing, extent and severity of wildfire in western US forests is strongly influenced by climate: over seasonal to decadal time scales antecedent climate shapes fuel characteristics such as their amount, connectivity and structure, while seasonal to interannual climate variability governs fuel flammability [8–10]. A changing climate consequently alters forest fuels characteristics across multiple time horizons. Species compositions and productivity may change as higher temperatures affect potential growing-season length and changes in precipitation, and temperature-driven changes in evapotranspiration affect the moisture available for growth [8,9].

It included specific pledges to “conserve and enhance” the world’s forests in order to combat rising temperatures. But in the last two years – 2015 and 2016 – we’ve lost enough trees to cover 493,716 square kilometres, according to satellite data recently released by Global Forest Watch (GFW). This is nearly equal to the entirety of Spain – or about four Englands. 
Currently, deforestation accounts for around 10-15% of annual global carbon emissions. Even as combating deforestation has long been seen as one of the cheapest ways to tackle global warming, GFW’s data shows just how far we have to go. 
“Forests are fundamentally hard to protect – they are in remote frontiers or in countries with weak governance,” said Liz Goldman, a Research Associate at GFW. 
But she added that the rising forest loss “doesn’t mean deforestation pledges are not having an impact – many of these agreements are still at an early stage.”
In 2015, the world lost enough trees to blanket 198,295 square kilometres, an area around the size of Uganda. On the plus side, this was a slight dip from the year before. But it still represented a worldwide trend of rising deforestation since GFW started tracking tree loss in 2001 – even as governments and corporations (increasingly and repeatedly) pledged to do something about it. 
Arguably, the most shocking data in 2015 came from the island of New Guinea, which is considered the third largest block of intact rainforest on the planet, after the increasingly fractured Amazon and the Congo. Deforestation on the island jumped an astounding 70% in 2015, threatening the island’s thousands of species found no-where else – think birds of paradise and tree kangaroos – and its local people who have lived closely tied to the forests around them for millennia. 
The island of New Guinea is split into two distinct political entities. The western half is a remote – but large and rich in natural resources – region of Indonesia, governed by faraway Jakarta. The eastern half of the island is its own country, Papua New Guinea. Both areas, however, saw significant jumps in forest loss beginning in 2015.
“Visual inspection of the data shows that industrial agriculture and logging are the major players in Papua,” Mikaela Weisse, a Research Analyst with GFW, said. “Data from Greenpeace Indonesia shows that 48 palm oil companies have permits in Indonesian Papua, some as large as 45,000 hectares.”
The satellite imagery shows what many have long warned: that the island of New Guinea has become the newest frontier for forest destruction. Logging and palm oil companies, among others, are infiltrating the island, viewing it as a lucrative place to expand operations in an increasingly resource-scarce planet.
The numbers in 2016 were hardly any better for New Guinea. Tree loss dipped slightly in Papua New Guinea but rose in Indonesian Papua – potentially pointing to a new trend of high deforestation across one of the most intact tropical forests we have left. 
As bad as 2015 was for the world’s forests, last year was far, far worse. In 2016, tree loss jumped 51% globally from the year before taking out a total of 297,000 square kilometres. 
“Clearly this is a sign that we need to do more,” said Goldman.
Experts at GFW say the jump in 2016 was driven largely by one thing: fire. In temperate forests, fire is often a natural part of the ecosystem’s life cycle and can even bring about renewal to forests. But fire has no place in tropical forests where it is nearly always caused by humans trying to clear land for planting. 
“These large-scale fires [in the tropics]…damage the forests’ natural structure, affect the habitats of plant and wildlife, and release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the air,” said Goldman.
Such fires can even lead to international crises. In 2015, blazes across Indonesia resulted in a toxic haze that at times covered several Southeast Asian neighbours, cost up to $35 billion and, according to one analysis, likely lead to the premature deaths of 100,000 people due to respiratory issues. 
Indonesia– which has taken the unenviable spot of the world’s largest forest destroyer from Brazil –has tried for years to combat such fires. In 2011 Indonesia installed a moratorium on new logging or plantation concessions on primary forest and peatlands. But it’s not proven as successful as hoped, according to many experts.
“Our data show that the moratorium has not had much of an impact on forest protection,” said Weisse. “Forest loss within moratorium areas has continued to increase in 2015 in all areas except Sumatra, which [has] little primary forest left.”
She added the moratorium may be ineffectual because it’s essentially toothless. Companies defying the moratorium don’t face “legal consequences,” according to Weisse. Already, some are warning that Indonesia won’t be able to meet its climate pledges which hinge largely on reducing deforestation. 
Today, even fires in temperate areas – see California’s epic conflagrations this year – appear to be exacerbated by rising temperatures worldwide.
“There is mounting scientific evidence that climate change is heating up our forests,” Goldman said. 
Hotter, drier forests are more prone to fire and harder to put out. It was no coincidence that 2016 was not only a major fire year, but also the warmest year on record. Moreover, the constant cuts we are making into intact forests are leaving them more vulnerable. Decades of research shows that forest fragments are hotter, drier and more prone to fire than intact forests. 
“There is increasing evidence that climate change, coupled with land use change and fire could lead to forest dieback in places like the Amazon,” said Goldman. 
Already, we have lost around one third of the Amazon Rainforest to deforesters like the cattle and soy industries. Experts increasingly believe that regional rainfall in Brazil is being negatively impacted by carving away at the world’s greatest tropical forest. 
After peaking in 2004, deforestation slowed in Brazil. Indeed, Brazil’s successful efforts in stemming deforestation have long been pointed to as one of the major wins in combating climate change and protecting forests. 2016 changed that. A new government in Brazil views the Amazon not as a region worth protecting, but largely as a resource to exploit. Last year saw forest destruction rise in Brazil to the highest level yet measured by GFW, easily eclipsing 2004. Whether this is a one-off incident or a new trend remains to be seen. 
Together Brazil and Indonesia accounted for nearly a quarter of all forest loss last year.
GFW – which is run by a partnership of University of Maryland, Google and the World Resources Institute – analyses satellite data to track tree loss worldwide at a scale of 30x30 metres. They state that they do not measure true deforestation – the loss of forest to human activities – but tree loss.
“We refer to the data on GFW as tree cover loss because it can’t distinguish plantations from natural forest, or human-caused forest loss from natural loss,” said Weisse. 
In other words, to a satellite natural forests and plantations look the same. So, when a plantation is cleared, GFW measures that as tree loss, even though it will shortly be replanted. 
However, GFW is working on changing how to tracks tree loss. The group has developed a map of primary forests versus plantations for Indonesia in order to come up with more accurate numbers of forest destruction in the country. 
Despite current limitations, the GFW has become instrumental in measuring our impact on the world’s forests, even in near real-time in some places. 
The Food and Agriculture Organization also tracks deforestation, claiming in 2015 that deforestation had slowed worldwide. However the FAO, a UN agency, depends on self-reporting from each country, leading to different measurements in different places and a dependence on self-reporting. The FAO also counts monoculture plantations – such as pulp and paper and rubber (though not oil palm) – as forest, despite the fact that ecologists have been arguing for years that monoculture plantations are in no-way true forests. 
“They’re about as biologically similar to native forests as my front lawn,” William Laurence, a forest ecologist at James Cook University, said last year in Ensia.
Plantations contain fewer species, retain significantly less carbon, and often result in soil erosion and water pollution from inputs of herbicides and pesticides. 
“The truth is that neither GFW nor FAO is perfect or complete, and each has their strengths and shortcomings,” said Weisse. “Rather than see the two systems as contradictory, we believe that we need to rely on both sources to have a complete understanding of the world’s forests.”
The ongoing scale of forest loss means that far more action is required, according to Goldman and Weisse. They say that nations and corporations need to speed up the process of decoupling deforestation from commodity supply chains like beef, palm oil, rubber and wood. At the same time, governments must increase enforcement efforts on-the-ground and make sure companies that defy laws and regulations are adequately punished. Finally, local and indigenous communities need to be given rights to their traditional land. Research has shown that the best forest protectors are indigenous groups – so long as they have secure rights to the forests they depend on. 
But first the world really has to make forests a priority, and not just another issue drowned in meetings, proposals and pledges. Governments have to stop paying lip service while turning a blind eye and more forest funding is needed from wealthy nations. 
“We want to do more than watch [forests] disappear,” said Weisse. “Our hope is that governments, companies, and civil society organisations can use the information we provide on when and where forests are changing to make better decisions.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2017/dec/22/failing-our-forests-in-two-years-weve-lost-enough-trees-to-cover-spain

Industry watchers said the milestone was passed in November, with the growth rate indicating that electric car sales are now running at around 1m a year. The rapid growth is being driven by government incentives, manufacturers launching models for a wider mix of drivers and falling battery costs.
EV-Volumes, a Sweden-based group that tracks the global electric car market, predicted sales will accelerate next year and bring the total number of battery-powered cars on the roads to around 5m by the end of 2018.
Next year will see a raft of new models from big manufacturers, including a longer range version of the Nissan Leaf, the world’s best selling electric car, as well as larger models such as the Jaguar iPace. Despite production problems at electric car poster child Tesla, the US company’s flagship mass market Model 3 has been rolling out to customers in the United States. 
 
EV Volumes said that China, the world’s biggest market for electric cars, was in the “global driver seat” when it comes to growth. Beijing is encouraging drivers to buy electric with a suite of incentives, as it attempts to tackle its smog problems.
China is also the first market targeted by Toyota for the 10 electric car models it plans to sell by the early 2020s. The world’s second biggest carmaker said this month that by around 2025 it would stop launching new petrol and diesel cars without a partially or fully electric version, in a pledge similar to ones made by Volvo and Jaguar earlier this year.
The Japanese firm hopes the moves will see it sell a million electric cars a year by 2030. Industry watchers said the plan marked a shift in direction for Toyota, which led the take-up of hybrid cars with the launch of the Prius 20 years ago.
“For the last decade they have been very much wedded to a hydrogen future,” said Ben Lane, director of Next Green Car.
Toyota’s commitments on electric cars allow the company to hedge its bets, he said. “Until now they’ve not been committed to battery electric. This looks like they’re joining all the other mainstream manufacturers in the battery rollout.”
VW, which overtook Toyota as the world’s biggest carmaker in January, is among rivals who have recently set electric car sales goals, also targeting 1m a year albeit by the earlier date of 2025. The number of models Toyota is planning is similar to rivals such as BMW, which aims to offer 12 by 2025.
Toyota also said that it aimed to launch a new generation of batteries in the early 2020s that would enable electric cars to travel further, using solid-state technology that allows batteries to be cheaper, safer and offer more capacity.
“Solid state batteries are significant because [they] take a lot less time to change, they are lighter and give more range,” said a Toyota UK spokesperson.
This month BMW said it was also pursuing the use of solid-state batteries in electric cars, as it announced a partnership with US battery firm Solid Power. The German firm announced it had sold 100,000 electric cars in 2017, up 60% on last year.
While electric car sales are growing fast, analysts noted that 1m is still a small fraction of the 80m cars sold worldwide each year.
“Fears in the media about [oil] demand destruction from electric vehicles in the short term are misplaced,” said Chris Midgley, global head of analytics at energy pricing agency S&amp;P Global Platt. However, the growth rate indicated by EV Volume’s predictions is pushing the competition between global car makers into the arena of next-generation models.

Here in the catacombs sit scores of Teslas, Nissan Leafs and BMW i3s, plugged into the charging points of the world’s largest public garage for electric cars.
Walter Mulling is on his first visit to the garage, and is excited about the prospect of parking and charging his electric VW Golf for free. “We are in the future,” he says.
Norway is the undisputed world leader on electric cars, run almost exclusively off the nation’s copious hydropower resource. Nearly a third of all new cars sold in the country this year will be a plug-in model – either fully electric or a hybrid – and experts expect that share to rise to as much as 40% next year.
The capital is a glimpse of what’s in store for the UK, where electric vehicles are nearing just 2% of new car sales but registrations are growing at a fast pace, up 38% this year so far. In Oslo, the streets are filled with silent, gliding cars, from large ones such as the Tesla X to smaller models such as the Renault Zoe. For the drivers of these cars, the motivation is simple – they just make financial sense.
Norway’s lead on electric cars has been driven by the government backing them with a wide range of generous incentives and perks, as a way of meeting its climate change ambitions. Buyers do not pay import tax and VAT on plug-in cars, shaving thousands of pounds off the upfront cost. Running costs are lower because electricity is cheaper than petrol and diesel, while road tax is reduced – and will drop to zero next year.
Electric car owners do not pay the mosaic of road tolls, ferry fees and city emissions charges that other Norwegians face. Moreover, they can park for free and bypass traffic by driving in some bus lanes.
“For my type of driving this is perfect,” says Vibeke Krohn, a pension fund executive. She uses a Mercedes B250e, which replaced an old diesel, to drop her children to school, commute to work and run errands. 
“We have one [petrol] car we drive to the mountains and a small electric for the city,” says Krohn, who charges at home and says her only complaint is there are not more public charging points.
Despite the successful take-up of electric car in Norway, there is no guarantee that the lavish political support for battery powered transport will continue. The government made headlines in October with its proposal to end tax exemptions for the heaviest electric cars in 2018, quickly labelled a “Tesla tax” because it would initially affect only two Tesla models.
For Jørgen Næsje, a minister at Norway’s finance department, the rationale was simple. “[Those] people who have the money to buy those very expensive and heavy cars could afford to buy [pay] some import tax,” he told the Guardian, adding his party did not see cars as a “cash cow”.
But electric car advocates argued the change was too early, and the minority government’s partners forced it to drop the measure during negotiations on the tax package. Christina Blu, the secretary general of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association, said the change would have deterred uptake of new large family models that are needed and coming on to the market next year, such as the Jaguar I-PACE.
“Norwegians like to buy big cars because they want to go in the mountains and things like that. If you want to go to 100% share, you have to help electric cars in the large segment,” she says, referring to Norway’s goal of 100% of new cars having zero emissions by 2025.
Viktor Irle, a market analyst at EV-Volumes, which tracks electric car sales globally, says demand in Norway is currently so great that there are months-long waiting lists for new models such as the I-PACE and Hyundai Ioniq.
Ending the exemption for heavier cars would make sense in coming years – but doing so now would shake the market, he says, adding: “I think it’s important to show stability from the political side.”
Ola Elvestuen, the deputy leader of the Liberal party, is pleased the Tesla tax proposal was defeated, but conceded government support will have to tail off eventually. “Over time, gradually, electric owners have to start to pay. But it has to be done in such a way that you don’t stop the transition,” he says.
Elvestuen is also relaxed at the prospect of fuel tax declining as electric cars come to dominate, arguing that overall the effect will be revenue neutral as taxation is shifted to other parts of the economy.
“Of course the government needs its revenue. But this is part of what we call a green tax shift. You have to tax what you want less of, and promote what you want more of,” he says.
Norwegian politicians reject the charge that only an affluent country such as Norway, made rich through oil and gas, could afford such support for electric vehicles. Per Espen Stoknes, an MP for the Green Party and an electric car owner, said: “I think that’s a misperception. I’m glad we’re doing it because it helps [bring] down the prices of electric vehicles, so it’s cheaper for other nations to follow us later. It’s part of a green taxation shift. Norway can do it because you’re rich? It doesn’t add up. It’s about what you tax.”
But in Oslo, not everyone wants a car, regardless of whether it is electric or not. Stoknes sees a shift coming, where electric motors and driverless technology combine to make the current car ownership model redundant.
“It’s very individualist, 20th century,” he said, of the idea of everyone having one or more cars of their own. “The next generation are completely cool with sharing.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/25/norway-leads-way-electric-cars-green-taxation-shift

Global climate warming and associated climate changes have hastened the onset of drought and increased the frequency of droughts in regions that experience drought during extreme El Ninos and in the different regions that experience drought during extreme La Ninas. Global warming has also caused the rain bearing Southern Ocean lows that bring rain to the west and south midlatitude coasts to migrate further south where except for South America, there is no land to speak of. This causes parts of South Africa and Southern Australia to experience long term rainfall deficits which are exacerbated by El Nino droughts.
""It's why we pump CO2 into GREENhouses"".
CO2 is pumped into greenhouses to grow cucumbers. Cucumbers are a group of fleshy vines which grow in rainforests. The Striped Cucumber vine which grows in my local rainforests is named after its red striped deadly poisonous fruit. They are currently growing at a great rate as storm after storm rolls through most afternoons. In their enclosed rainforest canopy environment, sat night when photosynthesis stops producing oxygen, plants grow and produce CO2 while the stunning rates of bacterial and fungal decay typical of tropical and subtropical rainforest, also pump CO2 into the air. The night air under rainforest canopies has been measured at 2,000 ppm. 
Cucumber vines take advantage of this overnight and early morning peak in CO2 by storing the CO2 in their moist fleshy tissues for use when the sun reaches the top of the canopy that they have climbed to; to produce that energy storage food which they use for growth and fruit production.

What have I said that isn't happening?
I said that the energy storage system of plants needs water as well as CO2 and that as the climate temperature increases so does the evaporation of soil moisture. Are you suggesting that an increase in climate temperature has not resulted in an increase in evaporation of soil moisture?
I also said that ENSO phase extremes, that is extreme El Nino and Extreme La Nina events, have become more common. Are you suggesting that hasn't happened?
In cold climates greenhouses are used to grow tomatoes and cucumbers. Where I live in the warm subtropics we don't need to resort to such expensive measures. I remember seeing them as a kid on a family holiday to the beaches north of Sydney and Newcastle.

Do you think climate science is based on folk stories?
Scientific paradigms are built on multiple thousands of pieces of research.
Gravity, evolution, plate tectonics, climate change.
All of them are well-established scientific paradigms.
Climate science is very much like plate tectonics, in that it gives an overall framework to investigations of processes in a range of earth systems.
To change the paradigm someone would need to produce plenty of research-based evidence that does not fit the paradigm, and to offer an alternative paradigm that explains all the previous evidence plus the new evidence.
So-called climate sceptics don't even bother to try doing that.
They just don't like the paradigm, but offer nothing at all based on research.
You want to discuss the geological record? Fine.
The geological record tells us what happens when lots of CO2 is added to the air in a relatively short time.
You could look up the end-Permian, the Toarcian, the PETM, and the ETM2, for example.
These events are marked in the geochemical record by negative carbon isotope excursions.
When igneous activity heated up coal seams in the end-Permian event, the extra CO2 produced by the process caused global warming and ocean acidification, and these led to extinctions.
There's an interesting recent paper on that -
""Initial pulse of Siberian Traps sills as the trigger of the end-Permian mass extinction"" - Burgess et al, 2017.
Plus -
""Catastrophic dispersion of coal fly ash into oceans during the latest Permian extinction"" - Grasby et al, 2011.
Not one professional scientific organisation on Earth agrees with the so-called climate sceptics, not in any country, nor in any field of science.
Adapting slowly to a new stable climate would be one thing, adapting over and over to unstable fluctuations is not the same.

As for the significance of a 0.1 unit pH change, it might help the smartarses to read this article:http://worldoceanreview.com/en/wor-1/ocean-chemistry/acidification/when-carbonate-formation-loses-equilibrium/in which it notes:
BQSTART
In summary, the reaction of carbon dioxide in seawater proceeds as follows: First the carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid. This then reacts with carbonate ions and forms bicarbonate. Over the long term, ocean acidification leads to a decrease in the concentration of carbonate ions in seawater. A 50 per cent decline of the levels is predicted, for example, if there is a drop in pH levels of 0.4 units. This would be fatal. Because carbonate ions together with calcium ions (als CaCO3) form the basic building blocks of carbonate skeletons and shells, this decline would have a direct effect on the ability of many marine organisms to produce biogenic carbonate. In extreme cases this can even lead to the dissolution of existing carbonate shells, skeletons and other structures.
BQENDThus it is particularly stupid to try to dismiss that 0.1 unit pH reduction in oceanic alkalinity.

The other kinds of effects of climate change -- this is coral bleaching. It's a beautiful picture, right? All that white coral. Except it's supposed to be brown. 
What happens is that the corals are a symbiosis, and they have these little algal cells that live inside them. And the algae give the corals sugar, and the corals give the algae nutrients and protection. But when it gets too hot, the algae can't make the sugar. The corals say, ""You cheated. You didn't pay your rent."" They kick them out, and then they die. 
Not all of them die; some of them survive, some more are surviving, but it's really bad news. To try and give you a sense of this, imagine you go camping in July somewhere in Europe or in North America, and you wake up the next morning, and you look around you, and you see that 80 percent of the trees, as far as you can see, have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked. 
And you come home, and you discover that 80 percent of all the trees in North America and in Europe have dropped their leaves. And then you read in the paper a few weeks later, ""Oh, by the way, a quarter of those died."" 
Well, that's what happened in the Indian Ocean during the 1998 El Nino, an area vastly greater than the size of North America and Europe, when 80 percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died.

The oceans are really the key to the climate change issue, whether that be in quantifying how fast it’s happening or how much will happen in the future. As humans emit greenhouse gases (particularly carbon dioxide), we see some major changes that cannot be explained naturally.
The oceans are important because they act as a buffer; that is, they absorb much of the effects of greenhouse gases. In fact, the oceans absorb a lot of human carbon pollution. This is a big help for us because without the oceans, the climate would change much faster. 
But in a certain way, the oceans are hurting us too. Since the oceans absorb so much of our carbon pollution and the resulting heat (93% of the extra heat), they turn a short-term problem into a long-term problem. Just like a fly wheel can be used to store rotating energy in a machine, the oceans store heat energy and chemical energy that can later manifest itself. The oceans also impact our psychology. The pollution we emit today will have effects for many years (partly because of the oceans). We cannot just stop emitting pollution and think this problem will immediately go away. We have to plan ahead. And, importantly, we have to stop emitting before most of the effects are evident.
I like to think of the Earth’s climate like a heavy train. A train cannot stop quickly; the brakes have to be applied far ahead of an obstacle. The ocean is our “climate train.”
Okay with that, what did this new report show? There were four key findings the authors cited. First, as I mentioned, they report that the oceans are absorbing almost all the heat from greenhouse gases. Over the past six decades, the amount of heat at all levels of the ocean has increased. This heating will continue into the future with approximately 5°F warming by the year 2100. This may not sound like much, but it is really enormous heating for water. When oceans warm, sea levels rise (warming water expands). Warm water also evaporates much faster to the air so that the atmosphere becomes more humid, resulting in more heavy rainfalls and flooding. 
The figure below shows the changes in ocean heat (OHC) measured in Joules (a unit of energy).
A second conclusion is that the heat may lead to major changes in the ocean currents. There is a really important flow of ocean waters called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. It is a stream of water that passes from the warm tropics up toward Europe. Then the water gets cold and dense, sinks, and flows back towards the equator. This current is responsible for the warm wet weather in England, for example (compared with other locations with the same latitude). The report discusses a potential weakening of this current. If the current were to weaken (or stop altogether), there would be major effects to the weather in Europe and North America.
A third conclusion from the report is that the oceans are absorbing a lot of the human carbon pollution. For instance, the oceans currently absorb more than one-quarter of carbon from burning fossil fuels. One consequence of this is the oceans are becoming more acidic. The carbon dioxide is changing the ocean chemistry. 
The simple way to think about this is to consider a soda. If you shake a soda and then open the soda, it will fuzz and bubble. This happens because sodas are carbonated beverages. When a soda fizzes, the carbon dioxide is leaving the liquid. What we are doing to the oceans is the reverse process. We are putting carbon dioxide into the ocean waters. Through various chemical processes, it makes the oceans more acidic and that matters for animals that make shells. For many of these animals – particularly those at the base of the food chain – acidic waters can dissolve shells or make them hard to form in the first place. This really matters because if the food chain collapses, then marine ecosystems and human society suffer.
A final main conclusion is the observed decrease in the amount of oxygen in the ocean waters. Especially near the coasts, there are fewer oxygen atoms absorbed in the waters. The decrease will continue and we may see as much as 3.5% decrease in oxygen. 
The report is freely available, and the chapters clearly separate out different topics.

The overwhelming majority of Australia's welfare budget - $150.1 bn out of a total of $164.06 bn - is spent on the aged; people with disabilities; veterans and their dependants; family benefits; and administration costs. About 6% - $10 billion - goes on the roughly 700,000 people looking for work or temporarily too sick to look for work.
Now you know precisely who it is you and your putative ""normal population"" are ""sick of"" and can tell them to their faces next time you're at an old people's home... or an Assisted Care facility... or your local school at pick-up or drop-off times... or perhaps at next year's Anzac Day parade...
(NB: In case you've the urge to tell me some such nonsense as ""everyone could find a job if they really wanted one"", the number of job vacancies in Australia is currently around a quarter of the unemployment figure, for many of which vacancies few people on the dole have the necessary qualifications or experience required. No doubt some small percentage of those 700,000 people don't want to work, but to suggest they are in any sense a significant drag on the economy is simply not supported by the facts.)

But first of all we need to stop eating meat. Why is this always omitted?
BQEND
It isn't 'always omitted'. Just because you didn't read an article doesn't mean it wasn't written, or read by others. George Monbiot alone has written numerous articles on the environmental costs of animal agriculture (five articles in the Guardian in the last six months).
Then there's a matter of perspective: all agriculture - crops, animals, land use change, forestry - account for only 25% of all emissions. It makes sense to write about climate change in a balanced way, not merely to focus on whatever hobby horse you happen to be riding at the time. 
And lastly, meat eating is not mentioned in this article because it's about the GBR, not everything at once.

Here is a definition of morality: ""principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behaviour"".
Moral behaviour is not relative to anything, or anyone, else. It is a standard we set ourselves. What you tell us is that by blaming the problem (falsely) on some issue external to you, this specious linkage gives you an excuse to do things you know perfectly well are very damaging to the environment. Worse still, you appear to be willing to trash everyone's environment so you can go on holiday a few times a year - hard to imagine a more selfish and utterly unnecessary indulgence. What you are doing is - from the perspective of our individual environmental responsibility - simply wrong and you should stop doing it, regardless of what anyone else does. Trying to create some dubious relationship between your behaviour and a demand - wholly impossible to achieve - is merely an attempt to excuse the inexcusable.
Me, I'm a burglar. I rob people a few times a year, but I'll stop robbing people just as soon as people stop buying jewellery, because obviously it's people having wealth that's the problem, not my egregiously amoral, anti-social behaviour.
(And while I'm here, I'll just point out what a crock the population issue is in respect to climate change: 750 million people are suffering malnutrition, while 45% of the world's population live on less that $3 a day.

One of those is the many storms that occur along it, these storms are responsible for the majority of the destruction from siltation & breakage.There is nothing that we can do to prevent these storms, but we must remember the reef has been there for thousands & thousands & thousands of years & has survived all this time.Another problem has been with the Crown of Thorns starfish which feed on the coral polyps of hard corals which kills the coral & weakens the reef structures.Scientists have been studying these voracious creatures for a long time & now have effective programs that are helping to reduce the starfish populations.Some scientists are also farming coral to help replant live coral too! Amazing isn’t it?!Farming of different kinds along the coastline & in the watersheds that empty directly into the Coral Sea is also a great problem because of the use of fertilizers & poisons on the farms & the exposure of soil to sun, wind & rain.Thankfully there are good people teaching & helping farmers understand what they need to do to help the reef by changing some of the things they don’t really need to do & learning new cleaner techniques of farming.Then Lizzy there’s climate change, which you may have heard about, maybe not though.This is probably the greatest threat to not only the reef, but all living creatures in the ocean.So it can be a really scary thing to think about & lots of people just don’t want to talk about it.It’s best to talk it thru so you know how it is happening & how you, your family & friends can make plans about it.So Lizzy, ask if you can explore climate change in a safe environment.I am sure you will discover that there are many things that humanity across the planet can do to help the ocean creatures survive warming temperatures & changing water chemistry.This is going to be a big part of your life, so you need to think very carefully, like, say a scientist, & I’m sure you will be a great help joining in to change the climate back so the ocean regains some balance.Have fun while your at it!Say hi to Ms. Smith ;))', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1514359921000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'i know if you are at least five years old you have a pretty good idea how dissatisfying fairytale answers are in response to serious questions', u'effect': u'well lizzy that \u2019s an interesting question that deserves more than a bambiesque reply'}, {u'cause': u'the use of fertilizers & poisons on the farms & the exposure of soil to sun', u'effect': u'that empty directly into the coral sea is also a great problem'}], u'author_id': u'18271425', u'id': u'110143733', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ThaiGer1', u'text': u'The human species is to the world what cancer is to the body.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1514359907000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'14342392', u'in_reply_to': u'110140030', u'id': u'110143730', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'R Anon', u'text': u'The number of Cows aren't the problem if we stopped the slaughter of the all the cows they would be self sustaining Just like all the humans farting are & burning wood is carbon neutral!

Thank you so much for writing to me. It is really nice of you to have taken the time.
No Lizzy, the Great Barrier Reef is not going to die, not so long as there are enough people who love the reef and will fight to save it. The Great Barrier Reef will live as long as enough generosity and devotion exist in the world to do what is needed. 
But you are brave to ask the question. Australia without the Great Barrier Reef is a horrible thought. How dreary would be the world if there were no Great Barrier Reef!
And I need to tell you the truth. The Great Barrier Reef is very, very sick. You probably have heard about “global warming”. What it means is that we are making the world hotter by burning up coal, oil and gas; cutting down forests, and farming in a way that hurts the environment. We can solve all these problems if we try hard enough – and we definitely need to sort them out, as quickly as we possibly can.
We have already warmed up the sea enough to make the Great Barrier Reef sick with “coral bleaching”. Maybe you have heard of this? It means that the lovely, brightly coloured coral on the reef gets too hot, then turns white and can die. Lots of corals on the reef have already died in this way. It is very, very sad.
But the Great Barrier Reef wants to live! Every single creature on the Great Barrier Reef, from the biggest whale to the tiniest shrimp, is doing its best to stay alive and have babies. And our job is to help them – all those corals and fish and clams and sharks – every last one of them. We must help them all, so that more corals grow again and the Great Barrier Reef can slowly get better.
Have you ever been snorkelling on the Great Barrier Reef? Or watched one of those amazing TV shows that shows you what life is like underwater on the reef? Just think of every little creature that you saw. They all want to live! They all want their home to be saved! And so do all the families of people who live near the Great Barrier Reef and depend on it for their lives almost as much as the fish.
We grown-​ups haven’t always done the best job of looking after the world
I have two daughters, both of whom are a bit younger than you are. They trick me sometimes – like when they hide their dirty socks in my bag as a joke! But I love them very dearly indeed. And when you love someone, you will do anything to make sure that they are safe and well. I think almost everyone in Australia loves our Great Barrier Reef. That’s why I think we must do everything we can to help it.
Do you want to know how we can save the life of the Great Barrier Reef? Let me tell you. We need to stop digging coal, oil and gas out of the ground as quickly as we can. And we need to stop cutting down forests. It is mostly the greed of a few powerful people that is causing these things to happen. So everyone who loves the reef needs to work together as a team to stand up to them. Think about how much faster you can get things done in a team, like when you pick up litter at your school or pack up after play time. Imagine how long it would take if you had to do it all by yourself? When people help each other, we can do almost anything! 
I’m so sorry that our Great Barrier Reef is really sick. We grown-ups haven’t always done the best job of looking after the world, which is strange when you think about it, because we all love our children so much.
No Lizzy, the Great Barrier Reef is not going to die, not if we fight for it with all our love and strength. It will very likely get even sicker first, but then slowly but surely, our Great Barrier Reef will recover and get better. A famous scientist called Terry Hughes, who knows as much about the Great Barrier Reef as anybody, says that it might take a long time and the reef will not be exactly the same as it was in the past. But if we are quick and use all our energy to doing the right things now, then one day the animals will come back and the coral will bloom once more.
Then our Great Barrier Reef will live, and live forever. And a thousand years from now, even 10 times 10,000 years from now, children like you, Lizzy, will be able to swim among the jewelled fish, through the coral gardens of our beautiful reef, with love and wonder swelling in their tender hearts, just as they should.
I’m sorry I haven’t answered all of your questions – there were lots of them! Please thank Mrs Smith for encouraging you to write to me. Teachers do a very important job.
Please also give my very best wishes to all the kids in your class and to your family for a safe and happy summer holidays.
Thank you again for your letter.
With my warmest regards,
David Ritter.

Why? You said computer CO2 was a small part of emissions. It really is not.
You also need to understand that these scientists are not ""fighting"" climate change, they are trying to understand it. It's not up to them to obtain travel and communications solutions that avoid CO2 (beyond what is reasonable). 
Chartering boats is a ridiculous suggestion, though. And that's before you realise that the CO2 costs of a cruise ship are likely higher.

As educated scientists know there is no proof in science.

it's only ideology based on pure reasoning (metaphisics) and modelling based on ideology.
BQEND
Incorrect.AGW is based on basic physics and chemistry from 100-150 ye4ars ago.
Arrhenius first proposed the idea back in 1896, and predicted the changes to the climate system back then.
Since then, thousands of scientists globally from all countries have observed the empirical Evidence(TM) that supports the predictions.
This has been built upon by scientists from multiple disciplines globally over the last century.
This includes the military - industrial complex who carried out many experiments and scientific research to get the IR guided missiles to work using the same basic physics and chemistry that underpins AGW. They might be upset if you told them they were also wrong.
Instead, we do have the ideological resistance by the fossil fuelled shills that totally lack any scientific Evidence(TM).
Your list of deniers can't even muster a Coherent theory that explains the observed Evidence(TM), let alone the Consilience of Evidence(TM). Instead they use a rag bag of often mutually contradictory ideas that have not been accepted by any body of scientists anywhere, in any discipline.

We also have conference rooms with more advanced equipment. Allowing to share slides - doodle on white-boards and all sorts of great things. We use them a lot. 
We also use free online tools a bit - when hacking is not an issue. 
But as with any industry - it is important to know that in geophysics we do have people who are colleges every day around the world - and who never sit down for lunch or a cup of coffee. Imagine the satellite down-link people - or the sensor array scientists that collectively pointed equipment all over the planet towards the general direction where the latest gravity wave originated from. 
It is also important to know that in weeks and months before AGU, lots of non-scheduled meetings are set up. Scientists plan and share the huge research-vessel going down to Antarctica planned for 2019, into the Pacific, there are teams around the world building different instruments for a new generation of Earth monitoring satellites to be launched in 2022 - one is planning for a ""summer-school"" for people studying glacier physics at PhD and post-doc level - to meet up in 2018 on Greenland to finally look at what they calculate and model. 
Hence - these huge conferences are not just to go over to listen at some sessions. It is about ""entire world"" meeting up to share science - and then get a lot of face-to-face meetings done - instead of having a lot of bi-lateral meetings over a long period. 
The big two (AGU and EGU) are also a big thing for PhD and post-doc students to present own data with the big-shots in the house. And as everyone know - to meet the next potential in the post-doc journey - by having meetings with potential next universities. 
The scientific ""prose"" is not really designed to share personality. So it has value to meet face to face. It is even good for ""competing science groups"" hunting for the same answer to share room for a day. 
One can imagine that all surgeons operate from home in the near future. With the nurses helping out with similar robotics from home. All skyping with the patient before and after. Such that the hospital is just a factory where sick people are stored until seeing the robotic arms do the things needed. 
But we are also humans. We do like to give a hug. We do like human interaction and know each other. 
To go to a concert and see and hear holograms of all the musicians performing ""live from home"" - it is not the same. The science of AGW does not want to prevent people from going home for x-mas or meet up.

These scientists study the impact global warming is having on Earth. Unfortunately, their air travel to and from the meeting will contribute to that warming by emitting around 30,000 tonnes of CO2.
As an Earth scientist and AGU member myself, I know the importance of their work. Still, there’s something wrong with this picture. As scientists, our work informs us – with dreadful clarity and urgency – that burning fossil fuel is destroying the life support systems on our planet. There’s already more than enough science to know we need to stop. Yet most scientists burn more than the average American, simply because they fly more.
I haven’t flown since 2012, nor have I wanted to
Few people know how harmful it is to fly in planes, including scientists. In 2010, I sat down and estimated my climate emissions. It turns out that, hour for hour, there’s no better way to warm the planet than to fly. I’d flown 50,000 miles during the year, mostly to scientific meetings. Those flights accounted for 3/4 of my annual emissions. Over the next two years, I gradually decreased my flying.
Eventually, there came a day when I was on the runway about to take off and felt an overwhelming desire not to be on the plane. I saw too clearly the harm it was doing to the world’s children, to all the beings on our planet. I haven’t flown since 2012, nor have I wanted to. 
Climate activists tend to fly a lot. This sends its own contradictory message
Today, while I know that my career could progress slightly faster if I flew, I find it hard to imagine a scenario that would make flying seem worthwhile to me. (If I really want to attend a conference in person, I take the train.) And I’ve realized that the main impact of reducing our emissions isn’t the emissions reduction itself: by modeling change, we tell a new story of what’s possible, shifting the culture and opening space for large-scale change.
In becoming scientists, we didn’t sign up to burn less fossil fuel or to be activists. But in the case of Earth science, we have front row seats to an unfolding catastrophe. Because of this, the public takes our temperature: if the experts don’t seem worried, how bad can it be? 
When we make a conscious effort to contribute less to global warming, we can better communicate the urgency of the Earth system changes we’re seeing. As a citizen and a father, I know I feel a responsibility to sound the alarm. Not to do so, for me, would be a kind of denial. 
I’m not alone. Over 400 academics have signed a petition at flyingless.org, and a few Earth scientists have joined me in telling their stories at noflyclimatesci.org. Together, we’re pushing for increased use of web-based and regional meetings, more remote support from the AGU, and more support from our academic institutions, which ostensibly exist to make the world a better place. 


Like academics, climate activists also tend to fly a lot. This sends its own contradictory message: if the people urging us to burn less can’t even do it, then it must be impossible. But in reality, many of us could cut our emissions in half with little effort. 
People who’ve gone even further than this report that their lives become more abundant and satisfying as a result, not less. 
I’d love to see what would happen if prominent climate activists and outspoken celebrities would consciously, publicly, and radically reduce their own fossil fuel use. They could begin by flying less.
Burning fossil fuel causes real harm, and will become socially unacceptable sooner or later. Those of us who know the seriousness of global warming must do everything we can to stop it, and like it or not, AGU scientists play a key role. Once this shift gains momentum, policy and systems-level change will follow more quickly than we can imagine.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/11/climate-scientists-emit-30000-tonnes-c02

More surprisingly, ships also leave faint trails in the sky, an effect not studied until the 1980s. Like aircraft contrails, ship tracks are formed when water in the atmosphere condenses around tiny particles.
A study in the 1990s set out to discover whether the ships’ exhaust was responsible, or salt crystals thrown up by their wake. A nuclear-powered aircraft carrier with no exhaust left no cloud trail, unlike diesel-powered ships in the same conditions, indicating exhaust particles were the main factor.
Ship tracks are wider and fainter than aircraft contrails, but can easily be seen in satellite images. They are brighter than clouds formed by natural sources, such as desert dust storms, because the particles tend to be smaller and more numerous. This makes them relatively easy to distinguish.
Being away from other sources of exhaust fumes, ship tracks provide researchers with a convenient way of studying how pollution at ground or sea level can affect cloud formation. They can compare the clouds in sea lanes with area free from traffic.
Ship tracks may produce more than just wispy cloud. A study earlier this year by a team from the University of Washington found that lightning occurred twice as frequently in shipping lanes as in adjacent areas. The tiny particles apparently increase “storm electrification,” by a mechanism not yet understood, a dramatic and unexpected side effect of human activity.

One of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the Americas, the reef is home to a dazzling variety of coral and more than 500 species of fish, and provides a livelihood for more than a million people. But now, a combination of mass tourism and poor waste management has left the reef increasingly vulnerable to climate change, placing this natural wonder in serious trouble.
“Throughout the Caribbean, we have seen a massive decrease in coral coverage,” says Michael Webster, executive director of the Coral Reef Alliance, a nonprofit organisation that works on reef conservation in Honduras. “Whereas we might have had 60-70% coral coverage in the past, now it’s down to 5-10% in places.”
Now, the rapidly changing climate could make the damage even worse. “We’re seeing these huge variations in rainfall, temperature, weather,” says Amanda Acosta, executive director of the Belize Audubon Society, a nonprofit responsible for managing reefs off the coast of Belize. “In 2012, we had massive rainfall,” she says. “Last year, we had no rain at all. And in the summer, the sea was as warm as a bath pan.”
The impacts of these rapid weather changes are already being witnessed across the reef system. Jesús Arias-González, a researcher at the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico, conducted a study of the entire region last year and found 22% of the coral colonies presented signs of bleaching from elevated sea temperatures. The bleaching could soon get worse: in September the US’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration began issuing coral bleaching alerts all along the Mesoamerican Reef. While cooler winter waters have since decreased alert levels, such warming events will likely increase as global weather patterns change. 
But although this level of damage is concerning, for many scientists who spoke to the Guardian the more pressing threat is mass tourism. “Climate change happens long term,” Arias-González says. “The massive development happening right now is much more dangerous.”
“The bleaching is certainly getting worse every year,” says Vanessa Francisco, a field officer with Resiliencia, a collaboration between the United Nations Development Program and the Mexican government to strengthen natural protected areas against the effects of climate change. “But the biggest problem we have is pollution.”
The growth of mass tourism as well as farming has resulted in an increase of untreated waste and agricultural runoff on to the reef; a 2010 study found traces of raw sewage, pesticides and illicit drugs in the underground river system of Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula, groundwater that would “eventually discharge into Caribbean coastal ecosystems”. A 2013 study concluded that “domestic waste management and final disposal in Belize, Guatemala and Honduras is a critical problem that needs to be addressed urgently”.
The increase in waste acts as a fertiliser to macroalgae, a kind of fleshy algae that can compete with and eventually smother or kill the corals. According to the Healthy Reef Initiative (HRI), an alliance of more than 30 organisations that monitors the Mesoamerican Reef, macroalgae cover has nearly doubled in the last 10 years across the region. This poses a serious problem because, as Francisco explains, a reef which is in a poor condition due to algae blooms is much less likely to withstand the effects of climate change: “It’s like getting a cold if you have HIV,” she says. “It reduces the reef’s resilience.” 
According to Webster, from the Coral Reef Alliance, these underwater ecosystems are highly adaptable under normal circumstances, constantly subjected to the eroding forces of storms and ocean currents. “Reefs are in a perpetual state of recovery,” he says. “A healthy reef is one that’s growing faster than it’s eroding.” A reef that is ravaged by macroalgae, however, will have a harder time bouncing back from an unseasonably warm current or a severe storm.
Mary Peter, 35, is a diving instructor in the tiny town of Xcalak, on the border between Mexico and Belize. Last year, Xcalak was hit by tropical storm Earl, the deadliest Atlantic hurricane to hit Mexico in 10 years. “It left a lot of devastation,” says Peter. “It destroyed a lot of the top reef structure. Everything was broken off; we were swimming through debris.” Six months on, however, Peter says “the reef is recovering nicely. Those chunks of coral that broke off are integrating back into the ecosystem.”
The increase in waste acts as a ​​fertiliser to macroalgae, a fleshy algae ​​that competes with and kills the corals
This kind of destruction and recovery is part of the reef’s natural ebb and flow: However, with hurricanes and storms likely to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change, the recovery process will become more difficult. When you add overfishing and pollution, the result could be devastating. “The future is going to be warmer, more disturbed, more acidic,” says Webster. “Corals are going to have to adapt. But what if they can’t? If you’re protecting the forest and you lose all the trees, it’s not a forest anymore.”
To stave off damage, scientists and nonprofit groups across the region are working with local communities to reduce overfishing, minimise pollution and strengthen the reef. “Climate change is a world issue,” says Webster. “We’re working to solve problems at a community level so we can give the reef a better chance to adapt to those global problems.”
Miguel Jarillo is a fisherman in Mexico’s Banco Chinchorro, the largest atoll in the northern hemisphere and a Unesco biosphere reserve. Ten years ago, he was trained by the World Wildlife Foundation to monitor the reef, something he has been doing ever since, providing data on the reef’s health for a number of different NGOs and conservation groups, as well as maintaining a more sustainable fishing practice. “It’s become a vice,” he says. “Going out into the sea and looking after my own resource. Because if I don’t look after it, no one else will.” 
In Belize, too, there is an increasing awareness of the reef as a vital economic resource, generating 15% of the country’s GDP. When the government began seismic tests for offshore oil near the reef last year, the outcry from the community in the tourist town of San Pedro was such that authorities shut the operation down after one day. “Without this reef, we’re just like any other Central American country,” says Elis Mei, 34, a tour operator in San Pedro. “This reef keeps our economy going. Without it, we’re done.”
There are signs that conservation efforts are paying off, albeit extremely slowly. According to HRI’s latest survey, coral cover has increased from 10% to 17.5% over the last 10 years. Herbivorous fish, which can help reduce macroalgae cover, have also increased. Five new Marine Protected Areas have been designated since 2011, meaning that the four countries now protect 20% of their territorial sea. Last year the Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto, designated the Mexican Caribbean biosphere reserve, a 5.75m-hectare reserve off the Yucatán peninsula.
But designating marine-protected zones only achieves so much. “Up to now, the decree is just on paper,” says HRI’s Marisol Rueda Flores, pointing out that the Mexican government has simultaneously cut funding from the body that oversees marine parks. “Mexico has some of the best laws for protecting coastal areas – the problem is no one follows them. The government has barely begun to realise the urgency of this situation.”

It seems a better idea all around to educate women everywhere and then many will not have chlidren and many will just have one or two and slowly the population will decrease.
BQEND
You can reduce the rate of population increase really, really fast with the right set of policies. Look at the current population. How many children are there under 5? 
If we used a Tardis to go back 5 or 10 years and introduced policies and programs to a) end child marriage once and for all, absolutely everywhere, b) add other policies to increase the global average age of mothers at birth of their first child by five years ...
how many children aged less than 10, less than 5, would there now be in the world? 
We can't go back. We can, however, get right on top of eliminating child marriage, educating girls and employing girls and women. That, first and foremost would reduce the increase in population even if it changed nothing about the number of children any individual woman eventually bears. 
That, of course, completely removes the obvious detail that, the later a woman starts child-bearing the fewer the total number of children she's likely to have. Whereas, limiting the number of children per woman, even sterilising after having those 2 or 3 children once she's 22 or 23, has virtually no effect on population increase. It's not just how many children are born, it's when they're born that determines how fast populations increase or decrease.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1514563810000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'15155906', u'in_reply_to': u'110158222', u'id': u'110211511', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'addledlady', u'text': u'BQSTART

We're currently over-clocking the earth's carrying capacity by close to 100%, so we would only need to reduce CO2 emissions by 50% to solve the problem, not 100%
BQEND
No. Each year's emissions are not the only problem. The problem is the cumulative surplus emissions which have resulted in the increased concentrations of CO2 in the oceans and the atmosphere. (Never forget that about 50% of CO2 finishes up dissolved in the ocean, thereby acidifying it little by little every year, and more than half of the surplus heat retained because of the atmospheric CO2 concentration is also in the oceans.) 
If we used somethingorother to negate one year's emissions down to nil, physics and chemistry, winds and waves, would respond by releasing some of the retained gas and heat. The science of natural systems is relentless. 
Our only chance is not just to reduce emissions, we have to think about absorbing the accumulated excess CO2 currently overheating our environment. Some people have an ambition to get back below 350.

The roots can grow 3 to 4 metres deep in a few years and, right from the start of the first season, the grass at the surface will stop water from flowing across the top of the soil, though it takes a while before you get the benefit of driving the water metres deep.

It's absolutely true that we can't promise our grandchildren or their grandchildren that they can live in the much more benign world I grew up in in the 50s and 60s. It's also true that we still have the option of making their futures a lot more amenable and successful (in the sense of being able to produce enough food for starters) than if we sit back and say it's all too late. It is too late for what we'd prefer and what we're used to, it's not too late to change course so that the future is better. 
For starters, we can look at carbon sequestration on a massive scale. Not just trees and seagrasses and those more familiar things. How about quarrying rocks that we know - beyond all doubt - will absorb CO2 from the atmosphere literally pound for pound, or on the scale we need, megatonne for megatonne. 
There's a great pdf Olivine against climate change and ocean acidification, a paper by Schuiling and Tickell which has the great advantage of a world map showing all the very large deposits of readily accessible olivine. If we wanted to use this one single process to absorb all of each year's CO2 emissions, we'd need quarrying and crushing activities the same size as our current coal mining activity - but with little to no equivalent need to transport or process the stuff apart from choosing how finely we want to crush it and whether we want to concentrate on releasing it some or much of it near coral reefs, mangroves or other specific locations. 
If we choose to use it to get a head start while we wait for forestry-seagrass-other plantlife to get going, we can start more gradually.

In addition to robust multi-decadal warming, global mean surface temperature exhibits substantial decadal and interannual variability (see Figure SPM.1). Due to natural variability, trends based on short records are very sensitive to the beginning and end dates and do not in general re ect long-term climate trends. As one example, the rate of warming over the past 15 years (1998–2012; 0.05 [–0.05 to 0.15] °C per decade), which begins with a strong El Niño, is smaller than the rate calculated since 1951 (1951–2012; 0.12 [0.08 to 0.14] °C per decade)5. {2.4}

“The observed increase in global carbon emissions over the past 15–20 years has been consistent with higher scenarios (e.g., RCP8.5) (very high confidence). In 2014 and 2015, emission growth rates slowed as economic growth became less carbon-intensive (medium confidence).

“Warming and associated climate effects from CO2 emissions persist for decades to millennia. In the near-term, changes in climate are determined by past and present greenhouse gas emissions modified by natural variability. Reducing net emissions of CO2 is necessary to limit near-term climate change and long-term warming. Other greenhouse gases (e.g., methane) and black carbon aerosols exert stronger warming effects than CO2 on a per ton basis, but they do not persist as long in the atmosphere (Ch. 2); therefore, mitigation of non-CO2 species contributes substantially to near-term cooling benefits but cannot be relied upon for ultimate stabilization goals.

It is the world’s third largest, and nearly 1,400 species of plants and animals and 500 species of fish have been recorded there.
But last year marine scientists found nearly half the reef was missing. They took the latest satellite images, compared them with precisely drawn 250-year-old British admiralty charts and found them nearly identical.
But where the historic charts showed there had been extensive coral reefs close to the shore in the 1760s, the satellite maps revealed just sea grasses and mud. Only those reefs far from the shore were still intact and alive with fish and plants.
So when and why did so much of the world’s third largest reef system just disappear?
Natural forces like spells of extreme rainfall and heatwaves may have played some part, but it is more likely that man was responsible. 
In those 250 years, fishing off the Florida Keys intensified, causeways and cities were built, pollution increased and the flow of freshwater, sediments and nutrients from the land all changed. Any of these factors could have led to the stress and decline of the reef, but it probably took a combination to kill off half the corals.
Something similar to what took place over 250 years off the Florida coast is now accelerating across reefs around the world as natural and new anthropogenic threats emerge and combine with deadly effect.
Corals are intolerant both of temperature and salinity change and it just takes a rise of 1C for a few weeks or extreme rainfall for them to begin to die. In the past 20 years, extreme weather linked to El Niño events and climate change has hit the world’s shallow reefs hard. 
Abnormally warm water caused the world’s first recorded widespread coral bleaching in 1998. Stretches of the Great Barrier Reef off Australia, and other reefs off Madagascar, Belize and the Maldives, were left white and seemingly dead.
Most recovered because corals survive if conditions return to normal. But since then, widespread bleaching and other events have occurred nearly every year, leaving many of the world’s reefs stressed and vulnerable to disease.
Over 20 years the trend of decline and loss has been inexorable. In 2001, and again in 2005, even warmer seas damaged many more reefs. From 2008-11, extreme summer temperatures led to major flooding and pollution in Australia which badly damaged the Great Barrier Reef.
2013 saw sea temperatures rise again and the longest global coral bleaching event on record began in 2014 with another exceptionally strong El Niño. The 2016 and 2017 mass-bleaching events may now have affected nearly two-thirds of the world’s shallow reefs. 
The fear now is that natural resilience is being lost and damaged reefs will not have time to recover before the next extreme event further weakens and then kills them. 
But reefs are now beset with more problems than bleaching. Just as off Florida in the 19th century, local pollution, overfishing, loss of oxygen and excess nutrient runoff have increased, and now growing acidification of the oceans is a real danger. Most organisms can withstand some stress but few can cope with this tsunami of trouble.
Fishing gear dragged along the ocean floor has crushed corals, dynamite has shattered colonies and cyanide has killed hosts of living creatures
Much of the early damage to near pristine Pacific and Indian ocean reefs may have been done in the 1980s when overfishing peaked in tropical and subtropical seas. Shark fishing and the use of cyanide and explosives to supply fish to Hong Kong, Singapore, and mainland China has wiped out whole fish populations. Fishing gear dragged along the ocean floor has crushed corals, dynamite has shattered colonies and cyanide has killed hosts of living creatures.
A vast natural treasure is rapidly being lost. The world’s reefs may only cover 2% of the ocean floor but they are thought to be home to up to a quarter of the world’s 500,000 known species living in the oceans.
Aside from providing food for many millions of people, reefs are now recognised as essential to the whole marine ecosystem. Fish spawn and grow around coral, which in turn helps to regulate carbon dioxide levels in the oceans and protects coastal areas from erosion. Take out any one part of the reef system and the whole is threatened.
Economically, too, reefs are increasingly important. Tourism and fishing on the Great Barrier Reef is estimated to be worth at least $6.4bn Australian dollars (£3.7bn) a year. The Maldives’ tourist economy would collapse without its reefs. Together, the world’s coral reefs have been valued at $1tn a year. 
The full ecological and economic damage done by 20 years of intense exploitation and warming seas is not yet known, but some scientists believe the world may already have lost half its shadow reefs, with the rest likely to be threatened within 30 years. 
The solutions are political and technical and must address the entire marine ecosystem. Protected reserves are urgently needed and fishing must be controlled and policed. 
But the answers will come mainly on land. For reefs to have any chance of surviving, farmers, cities and mining companies must reduce their pollution and prevent the runoff of sediment and nutrients into the seas. 
But above all, climate change must be addressed. If the oceans continue to absorb CO2, the increased acidity will be fatal and coral bleaching will worsen. All that may be left are the deeper reefs. 
The UN target to drastically cut emissions and hold temperature rises to 1.5C must be met. If not, then the the world’s rich, diverse and astonishingly beautiful coral reefs may all but disappear within a lifetime. Recklessness on this scale would have unimaginable consequences.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/27/how-did-half-of-the-great-florida-coral-reef-system-disappear-climate-bleaching

When technological shifts reach tipping points, they shift very, very quickly. Renewables are in most countries now at or below the cost of new coal power stations ( which have debts which must be repaid and which are still being deprecated) As costs drop, they will at some point be cheaper than existing coal power stations even though they have paid off all their debt and are 100% depreciated. At that point it will cease to make sense to dig up transport and burn coal instead of building new wind and solar farms. This tipping point could happen by the mid 2020s. So yes, jobs will certainly be lost, in fossil fuels. But there will be more jobs in renewables, in mining lithium and cobalt for batteries, and in the new industries which develop out of cheap energy. 
There have been two problems with renewables so far: cost and storage. The cost issue is going away, rapidly, in fact it's reversing in favour of renewables. Storage is just starting to be cost competitive, and will be dirt cheap by 2030. I confidently predict that by 2030 there will be no coal-fired power stations still running.

This air current is powered by the difference in temperature between the Arctic and the mid latitudes. This temperature difference is reducing as the Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the world, then just as a river starts to meander when it flows over flat ground, the jet stream is meandering more than it used to.This has the effect of drawing the Arctic air mass further south where it results in unusually low temperatures, or, if it meets moist air, a lot of snow.
A second interesting cooling is occurring in the North Atlantic. This is due to melt water from Greenland interacting with the Gulf Stream. Previously the Gulf Stream water was very salty (due to evaporation) and once it cooled a bit it sank to the bottom of the ocean, drawing the current along.

External revenue being of course that from the coal industry.
The research cuts to be revealed this week include much of CSIRO's contribution to the Oxflux program, which involves many universities as part of the National Research Infrastructure for Australia (NCRIS) program.
The Oxflux research involves understanding how Australia's eco-systems are responding to rising levels of carbon dioxide and to warming temperatures, with evaporation one key area of study.
Also to be cut includes research on how climate change will affect Australia's GDP, trade and the prospect of more refugees as nations face more extreme weather.
""Antarctic and Southern Ocean research is Australia's biggest contribution to understanding how climate change will affect the world,"" he said. ""To cut funding from this area is to face the future with a blindfold on.""

Malcolm Turnbull’s climate change thimble trick
Malcolm Turnbull’s decision to grant a stay of execution to two government green energy agencies hinges more on cooling the heat on him than the environment.
 https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/politics/2016/03/26/malcolm-turnbulls-climate-change-thimble-trick/14589108003045
A trigger for a double dissolution of parliament is like a trigger on a gun. Pull it injudiciously and you can blow your foot off.
A prime minister needs to be very careful about selecting the piece of legislation he or she will use as a trigger. You don’t force the issue unless you think you can win the issue.
To underline the point, consider this fact: the bureaucrats who compile statistical information for the senate currently list no fewer than 12 potential triggers for a double dissolution, but the government has shown no interest in forcing the issue in relation to 11 of them. The twelfth one, the bill to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission, is Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s choice.
The complication is that it is only halfway to being a double-dissolution trigger. It has yet to be rejected a second time by the senate, which is why Turnbull is bringing the parliament back for three weeks of extra sittings in April, at vast expense, in the face of what opinion polls tell us is a great lack of interest from the public.
Yet Turnbull already had another, fully formed double-dissolution trigger, left to him by his predecessor, Tony Abbott. It was the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (Abolition) Bill 2013.
Almost two years ago, in June 2014, the senate voted for the second time to reject the proposed legislation.
Turnbull could have saved a great deal of cost and bother if he had just pulled the trigger that he had. But he would have blown off his foot: the CEFC – set up by Labor in 2012 with a budget of $10 billion over five years to provide financing for renewable energy and energy efficiency schemes – is an extremely successful government initiative.“The net position is $1.3 billion lost, and another billion repurposed. For the government to say this is a ‘new’ funding is rank hypocrisy.”""

The expansion of the human population has necessitated increased rice production and so methane emission from this source. 
As the world warms it both increases the methane emissions from rice paddies, and decreases the crop yield of rice... research on rice grown in Asia has shown that for every 1°C increase in minimum nighttime temperatures crop yields declined 10%.
The global warming potential of methane is 25 times that of carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide is 298 times that of carbon dioxide. This means that 1 tonne of methane is equivalent to 25 tonnes of carbon dioxide. One tonne of carbon is equivalent to 3.67 tonnes of carbon dioxide.
Under current accounting rules, emissions generated during the manufacture and transport of agricultural inputs — such as fertilisers, herbicides, pesticides and agricultural machinery — are not counted as agricultural emissions.
Livestock and the manure they create were the dominant source of methane, accounting for 52% of total national methane emissions, and agricultural soils were the dominant source of nitrous oxide, accounting for 62% of total national nitrous oxide emissions.
Emissions from the fuel used by agricultural vehicles either on-farm or in transporting produce and the fuel used to generate electricity consumed on farm is also excluded.https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/climate-change/how-australia-accounts-agricultural-greenhouse-gas-emissions

The war on science also continues. The New York Times reports that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine has been ordered to stop studying the health risks associated with blowing the tops off mountains to get at the coal seams. This activity has been associated with an increased rate of birth defects and other health problems for those unfortunate enough to be living close to coalmining activities. 
There has also been a purge of government scientists who work on the connection between human activity and climate change.
In fact, there is an all-out effort at the Environmental Protection Agency to abolish use of the words “climate change”. The preferred term is “weather extremes”.
There have also been some terrific appointments. David Zatezalo is to be assistant secretary of labour at the Mine Safety and Health Administration. He’s a former coal company executive who is unhappy about mine safety regulations.
Then there’s Sam Clovis, who has been nominated to be the Department of Agriculture’s chief scientist. He’s not actually a scientist but a former talkback radio shock jock and “incendiary blogger” who says climate change is “junk science”.

As the year draws to a close, it remains on track to become the third hottest year on record and the hottest in a non-El Niño year. Despite the United States and Europe continuing their decade-long decline in greenhouse gas pollution, Australia has been missing in action. Australia’s pollution has been rising year on year since March 2015. This pollution is contributing to driving worsening extreme weather here and around the world.
2017 kicked off with yet another “angry summer” across Australia, characterised by intense heatwaves, hot days and bushfires in central and eastern Australia, while heavy rainfall and flooding hit the west of the nation. In just 90 days, more than 205 records were broken around the country. Temperatures soared beyond 40C during Sydney’s hottest January on record, with news outlets labelling the event as “the summer of sweat”. The extreme summer heat in New South Wales was at least 50 times more likely to occur due to climate change.
Australia is the land of droughts and flooding rains, but the extreme weather events we are now seeing are becoming more frequent and more forceful. The “angry summer” was just one example of this trend.
Australia’s pollution levels rose again throughout March as scientists confirmed the second mass coral bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef in two years. . Weeks later, category-four Tropical Cyclone Debbie struck Queensland and northern NSW, sparking the evacuation of thousands as powerful storms brought heavy rainfall and mass flooding. At least five Australians died. The damage bill of the event reached about $2bn.
Fast-forward to June and Australia entered its warmest winter on record, resulting in more than 260 heat and low rainfall records being broken throughout the season. The University of Melbourne’s Andrew King then confirmed the event was made 60 times more likely owing to climate change.
By September, the US and the Caribbean were lashed by not one but three major hurricanes – Irma, Harvey and Maria – fuelled by exceptionally warm seas. Maria set the record for the most intense Atlantic hurricane to make landfall, obliterating Puerto Rico. Officials still don’t know what the official death toll is. Harvey dropped 1.5 metres of rain on some Texas cities, smashing previous records, displacing thousands of people and causing billions of dollars in damage.
This summer we are again bracing for “above normal” fire season in NSW, with the fire danger period commencing earlier than usual. As a result, the hot and dry conditions of a “weird winter” have led to a worrying outlook for the bushfire season across much of south-east Australia. Each year our fire services are preparing for more frequent and more dangerous bushfires.
The window of opportunity for Australia to act on climate change is rapidly closing. 2017 has been a year riddled with extreme weather events, worsened by climate change. The lion’s share of Australia’s climate pollution comes from energy production from the burning of coal, oil and gas. For decades it has been clear that a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is critical to protecting Australia from worsening extreme weather. What has changed in the last few years is that it is increasingly clear that new renewable energy is cheaper than new fossil fuels, and renewables with storage, like batteries, can power the nation 24/7.
During the last 12 months the energy debate has dominated the front pages; however, we still lack a national approach to energy that can effectively tackle pollution and take advantage of the dramatic reduction in the costs of renewable energy. What we know about the government’s latest energy proposal is that it will strangle renewable energy at exactly the time it needs to grow. Thankfully, state,territory and local governments, along with households and businesses, have been leading the way. More than 1.7 million Australians now have solar on their roof, while state governments have introduced targets in increase the supply of renewable energy.
As 2017 draws to a close the government is finalising its climate change strategy. Failing to tackle climate change is an active decision to accept worsening extreme weather events and the severe damage they will cause to communities and our way of life.

In the Lingang district, pavements are lined with trees, gardens and public squares full of plant beds. Between cranes and construction sites, plans display new buildings enveloped in the green and blue of parks, streams, and water features.
Lingang (also known as Nanhui after it was renamed in 2012) has a mission. As Shanghai’s “sponge city”, it is piloting an ecologically friendly alternative to traditional flood defences and drainage systems in the coastal city which faces long-term risks from rising sea levels.
Rapid concrete development in China has often blocked the natural flow of water with hard, impervious surfaces; to reverse this, the sponge city concept focuses on green infrastructure, such as wetland areas, rooftop plants and rain gardens.
“In the natural environment, most precipitation infiltrates the ground or is received by surface water, but this is disrupted when there are large-scale hard pavements,” says Wen Mei Dubbelaar, director of water management China at Arcadis. “Now, only about 20-30% of rainwater infiltrates the ground in urban areas, so it breaks the natural water circulation and causes waterlogging and surface water pollution.”
In Lingang, the wide streets are built with permeable pavements, allowing water to drain to the soil. Central reservations are used as rain gardens, filled with soil and plants. The large manmade Dishui Lake helps control the flow of water, and buildings feature green rooftops and water tanks.
 Since disastrous large-scale flooding in Beijing in 2012, flood prevention has rocketed up the state agenda. The Sponge City initiative was launched in 2015 with 16 “model sponge cities”, before being extended to 30, including Shanghai.
 “The first thing is to try and preserve or restore natural waterways, because that is the natural way to reduce the flooding risk,” says Prof Hui Li at Tongji University. “In Wuhan, for example, the main problem is that a lot of small rivers were filled in during building. That is a benefit the Lingang area has, as there is still a lot of agricultural land and a manmade lake which has capacity to hold more water during heavy rain. 
 “In the past, humans have taken the land away from the water; now we need to give the land back.”
 Lingang can introduce new innovations into its urban fabric, but retrofitting older areas in Shanghai is difficult. Recent redevelopments include the former industrial West Bund Riverside, using wetlands, permeable materials and raised walkways to make the area naturally “spongey”.
 But it is difficult to create room for new green space. Even existing parks are largely a missed opportunity, says Li, usually built higher than street level and failing to offer a natural escape route for runoff floodwater. Most focus is on green roofs – the Shanghai government wants 400,000 sq metres of new rooftop gardens – or gradually replacing pavements.
 By 2020, the government wants 20% of the built area of each pilot district to have sponge city functions, meaning at least 70% of stormwater runoff should be captured, reused, or absorbed by the ground. By 2030, a huge 80% of each city should meet this requirement. 
 This target puts pressure on new areas to compensate for older districts, where a wholescale retrofit by 2030 seems doubtful.
 There are plenty of other challenges. The central government will only provide about a fifth of funding needed – the rest must be raised by cash-strapped local governments and often unenthusiastic private investors. 
 Academics have warned planning models are not specific enough to accommodate the vast differences in China’s geography, and there is a sharp learning curve to match new concepts with city practicalities. In Lingang, for example, crossing the road is difficult due to the large rain gardens in central reservations.
 Nonetheless, urban planners say additional innovations have emerged from the process, including more sustainable design and relief for China’s water-starved regions by managing stored rainwater.
 “Sponge city infrastructure is beneficial because it is also changing the living environment, helping with pollution and creating a better quality of life in these areas,” says Dubbelaar. “The initial driver for sponge cities was the extreme flooding of urban areas, but the change in mindset, that development should have a more holistic, sustainable approach, is an extra benefit that is evolving during this project.”
 Lingang is clearly hoping its innovative greenery will bring tourists, with several hotel chains around the lake, a maritime museum and tourist information centre already open. One such visitor from the nearby suburbs says she is a fan of Lingang – she doesn’t know the term ‘sponge cities’, but she likes it.
 “I like all the trees and parks,” she considers. “It doesn’t really feel much like a city. I think it’s much more pleasant than other parts of Shanghai.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/28/chinas-sponge-cities-are-turning-streets-green-to-combat-flooding

The primary cause of this mass extinction is NOT global warming but destruction of habitat by humans.
Tigers have seen a 97% decline in the past 100 years. There are only 3,000 to 3,200 left.That is a pretty staggeringly significant decline in that amount of time.More than two-thirds of the African lion population has disappeared in the past 50 years, according to a recent study in the journal Biodiversity and Conservation. The study estimates the number of lions living on the savanna to be as low as 32,000, down from nearly 100,000 in 1960.The Cheetah Conservation Fund estimates that in 1900, more than 100,000 cheetahs were found in at least 44 countries throughout Africa and Asia. The species is extinct from more than 20 countries, and about 10,000 animals remain.In many cases, we are looking at the loss of some of the world's most astonishing organisms on the planet.
To suggest that the main cause of extinctions is through Global Warming is to suggest that it is cause by something ""indirect"".
The decline in insect numbers is frankly astonishing as we seek to control, our environment.

This has to be dealt with as a whole. When we fought the Second War people didn’t just think about what they were doing but things had to be co ordinated, agreed, then acted on.
If an individual had simply said he wanted to fight the Nazis alone it would have been noble but futile unless that act of sacrifice inspired others eg the stand of the Spartan 300, John Brown etc

There are not a fixed number of animal (or bird) species: a diversity that we inherited, and that we are destroying with each one that dies out. Different types of creature go extinct all the time (just look at the dinosaurs) for many different reasons. And when they do, new ones evolve into the new niches that nature produces. (They fit those niches and therefore survive: survival of the fittest - it doesn't refer to physical fitness.)
Yes, climate change does cause extinctions as those animals that cannot adapt to change die off - as they have always done: ice ages, warm spells, volcanic eruptions, drought, disease. However, new species evolve. We are told that last year there were 18,000 new species discovered. Some of those were obviously ones that had existed for a long time, undiscovered in the wild. But some will have been new species that evolved recently to suit the environmental conditions they live in.

Each day increasingly dangerous hurricanes, wildfires, and floods betray the influence of climate change. We are appalled at the accruing losses of life and property. The arguments to address climate change at the recent UN climate conference in Bonn focused most often on these more concrete risks. However, the worst effects of climate change will come not from severe weather but from the irreversible loss of species and ecosystems.
Moulded over millions of years by natural selection, the diversity of species on Earth does more than just inspire awe. They are technical marvels and solutions to problems we do not yet know exist.
Scientific evidence now suggests that the Earth has embarked on its sixth extinction crisis, on a par with those executed by extraterrestrial asteroids and geologic upheavals. But this time we are at fault. Most current extinctions ensue from land use and overexploitation, but climate change is now catching up and accelerating these risks.
A couple of years ago I began obsessively scanning thousands of scientific papers for extinctions predicted from climate change. I collected more than half a million predictions including plants and animals from seven continents and the ocean. Surprisingly, I found that species extinctions would not just increase with global warming, but speed up in a rising arc. If we continue emitting current levels of greenhouse gases, climate change could threaten 16% of species – more than a million – by 2100.
Rising heat is pushing pikas to the top of the mountain, where they have nowhere else to go. They can’t climb sky
Look out of your window and count six species. Now imagine one is gone forever. 
We risk losing common, backyard species like the saltmarsh sparrow. About 50,000 of these yellow-cheeked birds nest precariously above normal high tides along the east coast of the US. Scientists predict that climate-amplified tides will wipe this bird off the saltmarsh – and the Earth – in a few decades.
We are already losing the American pika, a rabbit-like creature adapted to life on western North American mountaintops. Even mild temperatures at mid-20C (mid-70F) transform its alpine coat into a hairy death suit. Rising heat is pushing pikas to the top of the mountain, where they have nowhere else to go. They can’t climb sky.
We have just lost the Bramble Cay melomys. This beach rat lived on an Australian coral cay surrounded by the rising seas of climate change. Last year, scientists mounted a rescue mission, but found nothing but a storm-swept island. 
As more and more species are threatened, we risk losing Earth’s greatest resource: the library of natural selection. By encoding millions of years of the answers to nature’s travails, biodiversity gives us the drugs in our medicine cabinet, the tools in our intellectual workshop, and solutions to the world’s present and future problems. We are burning the greatest books on Earth before we have read them.
The human race is capable of great things, and no greater task lies ahead of us than protecting the greatest diversity of life in the universe. 
First, the US must recommit to the Paris climate agreement and keep the Earth from heating beyond 2C. Above this limit, extinction risks accelerate even faster.
Second, we need the equivalent of a biological Manhattan Project for predicting and preserving biodiversity. We still know so little about life on Earth. We often do not know which species are most at risk or how best to save them. Everyone from citizens to scientists needs to get back outside and study how nature works.
Third, we need to harness the computing horsepower of the software industry to create next-generation forecasts of species’ responses to climate change. We can explore endless permutations of those digital species to predict threats and test solutions. Imagine a computer game that simulates nature, all within our laptops.
Fourth, we need to design robust management strategies to protect the most species possible. We can use corridors to network parks so that species can track moving climates. We can help poor dispersers by identifying and protecting refugees and, in extreme cases, moving species ourselves. We can even help nature adapt to climate change by maintaining large, genetically diverse populations. 
Heat waves, severe storms, and melting sea ice are alarming impacts of climate change. But extinctions are the only impacts that cannot be reversed. Even the disappearing ice will return.
 Every day we wait, the Earth warms, and we climb higher up the arc of extinction.

The year-to-date average temperature across the contiguous US has been 2.6F above the 20th-century average, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), placing it only behind 2012 and 2016 in terms of record warmth. 
December may influence the overall 2017 ranking, but according to Jake Crouch, a climate scientist at Noaa: “We can say with confidence that the year will be in at least the top five,” for record warmth. 
“It’s been another really warm year for the contiguous US,” Crouch said. “The last time we saw a year with below-average temperatures was 1996. So this will be the 21st consecutive year that’s above average. And even though it’s not a record, we are seeing climate change manifest itself.”
Eight states – Arizona, New Mexico, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia – have in fact experienced record warmth for the first 11 months of the year. A national record, however, is out of reach due to the lack of an El Niño, a periodic climatic event that appeared last year and spurred extra heat.
But the fingerprint of climate change extends beyond just temperature. California’s deepest drought on record was broken by intense rainfall at the start of the year, an example of the long dry spells interrupted by ferocious downpours that scientists say are becoming more frequent in a warming world. 
To the north, Arctic sea ice reached a record low wintertime maximum extent as, incredibly, temperature instruments in Alaska malfunctioned due to the surging warmth.
Further south, there was a hurricane season that was unusually punishing. There were six major hurricanes, defined as category three or above, including the first two major hurricanes – Harvey and Irma – to hit the continental US in 12 years.
“This was a hurricane season that wouldn’t quit,” said Timothy Gallaudet, acting Noaa administrator.
Almost certainly, according to a statement issued by the World Meteorological Organization on Tuesday. “Climate change means that when we do have an event like Harvey, the rainfall amounts are likely to be higher than they would have been otherwise,” the UN organisation’s spokeswoman Clare Nullis told a conference. Nobody is arguing that climate change caused the storm, but it is likely to have made it much worse.
Warmer seas evaporate more quickly. Warmer air holds more water vapour. So, as temperatures rise around the world, the skies store more moisture and dump it more intensely. The US National Weather Service has had to introduce a new colour on its graphs to deal with the volume of precipitation. Harvey surpassed the previous US record for rainfall from a tropical system, as 49.2 inches was recorded at Mary’s Creek at Winding Road in Southeast Houston, at 9.20am on Tuesday.
There is a proven link – known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation – that shows that for every half a degree celsius in warming, there is about a 3% increase in atmospheric moisture content. This was a factor in Texas. The surface temperature in the Gulf of Mexico is currently more than half a degree celsius higher than the recent late summer average, which is in turn more than half a degree higher than 30 years ago, according to Michael Mannof Penn State University. As a result there was more potential for a deluge.
Yes, the storm surge was greater because sea levels have risen 20cm as a result of more than 100 years of human-related global warming. This has melted glaciers and thermally expanded the volume of seawater.
While these hurricanes may well have formed without human-induced warming, the extra heat in the Atlantic and in the atmosphere helped fuel the storms. Harvey, which dumped around 25tn gallons of water on the Houston area in just a few days, derived perhaps a third of its strength from the extra heat added to the planet since industrialization, according to one estimate.
The US is moving backwards as far as rational climate policy goes
“The number of hurricanes wasn’t related to climate change, that was bad luck, but the hurricanes were different because of climate change,” said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M University. 
“It’s very reasonable to assume that Harvey was made worse by climate change. Maria and Irma were consistent with the idea that the most powerful hurricanes will get more powerful. This is the kind of stuff we will have to get used to.”
Ultimately, 2017 may well be remembered more for the political response to climate change. The newly installed Trump administration set about tearing up policies designed to address global warming, such as Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, announced the US was to withdraw from the Paris climate accord and repeatedly questioned the scientific basis of climate change. 
Meanwhile, specific regulations curbing planet-warming gases from vehicles and drilling operations were scaled back, with more federal land and water opened up for fossil fuel exploration.
“The US is moving backwards as far as rational climate policy goes and I guess we will have to see whether this is a blip or a long-term trend,” said Dessler. “A lot will depend on the elections next year and whoever the president is in 2020.
“Everyone recognizes that the weather is weird and things are getting warmer, but climate change has become an identity issue. If you see yourself as a good Republican, you don’t believe in climate change. It’s hard to change that viewpoint when it’s part of someone’s identity. It’s like trying to convince someone they should be Jewish rather than Catholic.”
As for 2018, as the Environmental Protection Agency holds a sort of show trial, perhaps televised, of climate science itself, the planet will continue to warm.
“My expectation is that it will be another hot year,” said Dessler. “The climate of the past has gone. This is our new normal. I doubt we’ll ever see a record cold year again.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/28/climate-change-2017-warmest-year-extreme-weather

Donald Trump’s June announcement of an exit from the Paris climate accord confirmed the fears around the world of scientists and politicians about the US’s repositioning on climate change. From Scott Pruitt’s Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, various air and water protections faced being razed in the name of industry first.
Protected land was also in the sights of the administration as it sought to weaken bans around industry activity, like drilling and mining in areas designated national monuments. 
Then there were the hurricanes. 
Irma battered the Caribbean and southern US in August, especially southern Florida, quickly followed by Hurricane Harvey, which caused some $200bn worth of damage, especially to the sprawling city of Houston. 
Then in September, Hurricane Maria caused the worst natural disaster on record in Puerto Rico and Dominica; other islands were also affected. 
As the year came to an end, California has faced some of the worst wildfires in its history.
Oliver Laughland and Laurence Mathieu-Léger travelled through three US states – Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska – in late April along the planned route of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, talking to the people who live there. (In November, it was approved by Nebraska regulators – the last major regulatory hurdle – but legal challenges, and protests, are expected.)
“Our people call it the black snake because it is evil,” says Tressa Welch, as thunder clouds steamroll the blue sky over the plains of Wolf Point. “And like snakes they come out of nowhere; they slither and strike unknown.”
She faces southwards where, a couple of miles away, forks of lightning crack over the Missouri river. The 2m acre Fort Peck Indian reservation straddles this winding water source, providing sustenance for the almost 7,000 Assiniboine and Sioux tribe members here and thousands of others throughout north-east Montana. It is the river that Welch and other Native American activists on the reserve say the Keystone XL oil pipeline – or the “black snake” – will corrupt.
The river maintains the deer, the fish, the native plants, sweet grasses and sacred sage. “Anything that threatens my way of life and my spiritual wellbeing, I consider myself at war with,” she says, her two-year-old daughter by her side. “I will do whatever it takes.”
Oliver Milman and Sam Morris found the more egregious examples of the Trump administration taking a hatchet to climate change language across government websites.
During inauguration day on 20 January, as Donald Trump was adding “American carnage” to the presidential lexicon, the new administration also took a hammer to official recognition that climate change exists and poses a threat to the US. One of the starkest alterations to the White House’s website following Trump’s assumption of office was the scrapping of an entire section on climate change, stuffed with graphs on renewable energy growth and pictures of Barack Obama gazing at shriveling glaciers, to be replaced by a perfunctory page entitled “An America first energy plan”.
Under Obama. President Obama believes that no challenge poses a greater threat to our children, our planet, and future generations than climate change
Under Trump President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule.
In the aftermath of Trump’s announcement on Paris, a big story was how US cities could work round the administration to mitigate the risks from rising sea levels and temperatures. We featured four cities which, in different ways, are in the vanguard of this – New York, Miami, San Francisco and (perhaps surprisingly) Houston.
If Donald Trump advocated on behalf of water, San Francisco, the self-styled capital of “the resistance”, would likely advocate not bathing. The president received just 9% of the vote in a city in which the final elected Republican was vanquished in 2014. 
And, surely enough, after the president made his Paris announcement, San Francisco’s board of supervisors on 6 June introduced a resolution stating that this city would stay the course. “I think it’s important San Francisco goes on record as a city that is committed to this agreement, regardless,” said the city supervisor London Breed, the board’s president. “We’re not going to stop doing what we do best.”
Oliver Milman, our US environment correspondent, has been leading a strand of our reporting on environmental justice – and found this extremely lacking in this town outside Dallas which has no running water.
It’s a sweltering Saturday in October and Pastor Eugene Keahey is becoming agitated. His flock live in a Texas town that hasn’t had running water in 30 years and the donated bottled water they rely upon is in short supply.
“We got six cases of water from a donor but two have already gone in the last hour,” said Keahey, eyeing the line of people waiting for their weekly handout of food and water from the Mount Zion Baptist church in Sandbranch, a largely African American community that lies 20 minutes and a world away from Dallas.
Recent hurricanes in Texas and Florida have diverted the attention of non-profits away from the sisyphean struggle endured in Sandbranch. “I’m going to have to come up with a plan, get on Facebook and beg or borrow water from somewhere,” said Keahey.
“People come for donations from outside the town and it’s difficult to say, ‘No you can’t get water because you’ve got running water at home.’ My test is to say ‘What do you do with the bottled water?’ If they just say they drink it, I have to say no because people here shower, brush their teeth with it, everything.”
Created by Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, the Cascade-Siskiyou monument protects Oregon’s extraordinary biodiversity, from butterflies to trout. But a Trump review threatens to open the landscape to the timber industry.
Dave Willis, a grizzled woodsman and backcountry outfitter, has spent decades laboring to protect the mountains of south-western Oregon, one of the most beautiful, biodiverse regions in the country.
Through grassroots activism, Willis and his conservationist allies have won the support of two US presidents. In 2000, Bill Clinton created the roughly 52,000-acre Cascade-Siskiyou national monument, proclaiming it an “ecological wonder”. Located just outside of Ashland, it was the first such monument established solely for its extraordinary species diversity. It’s a place that harbors rare lilies and endemic trout, Pacific fishers and goshawks, black bears and a stunning array of butterflies.
During his final week in office, meanwhile, Barack Obama added about 48,000 acres to the Cascade-Siskiyou monument, nearly doubling it in size.
Now, the Trump administration is threatening to undo it all.

I try to keep in touch with news related to climate change, and am particularly interested in environmental law. My compulsion to do something positive about climate change was one of the reasons I decided to study law. When I read the opinion piece Civil disobedience is the only way left to fight climate change, by Kara Moses, in spring 2016, it crystallised my feelings about the responsibility we have as a community of humans to do more.
The article made me realise that having a legal framework in place is not the only solution to a problem this complex. More than ever, we need to be proactive in our resistance, whether that takes the form of a quiet or a very vocal protest. 
This piece was written days after 1,000 people successfully closed the world’s largest coal-exporting port in Newcastle, Australia and just two weeks after the Paris Climate Accord was signed. 
It was written mainly from a British perspective, but really resonated with me. In India, where I live, smog pollution is a major problem. Moses discusses how this problem also affects those living in Beijing, and explains the double-edged benefit to employing people in jobs that improve the state of our environment as well as the quality of life for the majority of people on the planet. “The choice between clean, safe, democratic and sustainable energy/jobs or dirty, dangerous and undemocratic energy/jobs is a no-brainer,” she writes.
 Moses implores us not to wait for treaties to be drawn up and politicians to agree on changes they would like to implement, but to work from the ground up, in small ways. She asks us to “take it upon ourselves to do more if we really want climate justice” and “support rather than denounce those willing to put themselves on the line, since we all benefit from their actions”. 
I found her words urgent, clarifying and emboldening. I shared the article with friends, many of whom were similarly moved by it, and when we were asked to complete an internship as part of our course, I chose to work at a law firm that has an environmental focus. When I graduate I hope to work in this field and become someone bringing about positive change both professionally and personally.

On holiday in Florida on Thursday, Trump wondered if global warming might not be such a problem after all.
As severe cold and record amounts of snow swept across the US east coast, Trump wrote on Twitter that his people “could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against”.
“Bundle up!” he added.
The president was reheating two favourite tropes: the conflation of weather with climate to pour scepticism on global warming, and the supposed cost to the American taxpayer of the Paris climate accord, from which he has confirmed the US will withdraw.
Climate scientists, however, have long warned against using individual weather events to ponder the existence or otherwise of global warming. Weather, they point out, refers to atmospheric conditions during a short period; climate relates to longer-term weather patterns.
On Friday, Anthony Leiserowitz, director of Yale University’s project on climate change communication, said Trump’s tweet was “scientifically ridiculous and demonstrably false”.
“There is a fundamental difference in scale between what weather is and what climate is,” he said. “What’s going on in one small corner of the world at a given moment does not reflect what’s going on with the planet.”
The extreme cold snap in the eastern US is a rare example of a place experiencing below-average winter temperatures, he said, a point that was neatly illustrated by a map tweeted out by the Weather Channel on Friday.
1) There is a difference between #weather and #climate. 2) Short-term #cold snaps will continue to occur in a warming climate.3) 2017 will likely be a top three warmest year on record for the globe. (Graphic: Univ. of Maine - Climate Change Institute) https://t.co/kzuugeXi80 pic.twitter.com/gueOsp4yvu
Elsewhere, Matthew England, a climate scientist from the University of New South Wales, called Trump’s comment “an ignorant misconception of the way the earth’s climate works”.
“Nobody ever said winter would go away under global warming, but winter has become much milder and the record cold days are being far outnumbered by record warm days and heat extremes,” he said. “Climate change is not overturned by a few unusually cold days in the US.”
David Karoly, a climate scientist from the University of Melbourne, put it even more bluntly: “It’s winter in the US. Cold temperatures are common in winter.”
Climate modelling showed cold snaps like the one in the US were actually becoming less common as a result of global warming, Karoly said, adding that rapid attribution analysis means scientists are now able to look more closely at “classes of events”.
That type of modelling for the north-east of the US, he said, showed that although there was a great deal of year-to-year variability, the average coldest temperature in December in the region has increased in the past 50 years.
In any case, the US is already getting that “good old global warming”. 2017 is set to be the third-warmest on record, prompting among other things a climate-fuelled hurricane season in the country’s south.
Experts also know climate change is linked to a dangerous pattern of major weather events. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the US is on track to match or exceed the previous record year for extreme weather and climate events costing more than $1bn, including wildfires, hurricanes and flooding.
There had been 15 such events by the end of September, compared with 15 for the whole of 2016 and 16 in the record year of 2011.
Adam Smith, a climatologist at NOAA, said: “Climate change is playing a role, amplifying the frequency and intensity of some types of extreme weather that lead to billion-dollar disasters.”
With Hurricane Harvey devastating Texas and extraordinary wildfires in California, Smith said 2017 was expected to “shatter” the record for the US’s costliest year in terms of weather events. That was 2005, with losses of $215bn from disasters including Hurricane Katrina.
Trump’s tweet also revisited his claim that the Paris climate accord would have cost the US “trillions” of dollars. At a rally in Pennsylvania in April to mark his 100th day in office, Trump said “full compliance with the agreement could ultimately shrink America’s GDP by $2.5tn over a 10-year period”.
The politically non-aligned website Factcheck.org asked the White House for a source for that remark, and was pointed to a 2016 study by the conservative Heritage Foundation which found the Paris agreement “will result in over $2.5tn in lost GDP by 2035”.
While that is an 18-year period, not 10, Factcheck.org found the accuracy of Heritage’s statements depended on which numbers were used. The Heritage study used a carbon tax rate of $36, increasing 3% each year from 2015 to 2035. Other analyses have found the US would have needed only a carbon tax of $21.22 starting in 2017 to meet its Paris target by 2025.
Leiserowitz, meanwhile, criticised the president’s use of social media. “It’s meant to be red meat for his base,” he said. “They’re the ones most likely to be dismissive of climate change and the most likely to vote in the 2018 Republican primaries – so it’s a warning shot for the GOP members in Congress.”
The global warming tweet, he said, was another attempt by Trump to distract from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. 
He added that the idea a cold snap disproves global warming is a “zombie argument”, because though “it’s killed over and over by the science” it “keeps coming back for more brains”.
Trump’s tweet was “troll-like”, the scientist said, showing the president “delighting in sparking outrage among [his] opponents”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/29/donald-trump-good-old-global-warming-us-winter

“The IPCC’s overly conservative reading of the science, they say, means governments and the public could be blindsided by the rapid onset of the flooding, extreme storms, drought, and other impacts associated with catastrophic global warming.”
BQEND
And yet the recent report from the Royal Society, with stellar author list (not a single journalist with an agenda who from memory even seemed to think we had underestimated temperature projections...) seems to consider that most of the statements from AR5 likely remain unchanged. Of course there will be changes where understanding of certain processes has improved and of course all literature published since AR5 will be assessed, but as has been said repeatedly, they can only assess what has been published. For example (re extreme events):
How might this affect the IPCC statement? Further evidence supports the existing IPCC statements. Temperature extremes have become more frequent globally and rainfall extremes have increased in some regions and these trends are likely to continue in the future. More specific statements about the role that human influence has played in changing the frequency of specific types of events, particularly heat waves, are becoming possible. Improved model simulations and physical understanding may strengthen confidence in projected changes in extreme daily and sub-daily rainfall, and in tropical cyclones and the heavy rainfall and the coastal inundation associated with them.

Not a difficult question to answer. There are multiple lines of empirical evidence. Here are just three of them:
- The isotopic signature of the added CO2 matches that of fossil fuels
- The amount and rate of increase are consistent with the use of fossil fuels
- Atmospheric O2 is decreasing at a rate consistent with the increase in CO2, indicating that the CO2 is a combustion product.
Furthermore, if you want the increase to be natural, then you have to be able to identify the natural source, and explain why it suddenly changed.

I have read what researchers have said, the problem is the observational data almost never backs up what they say, I can only conclude that a requirement of their research grants is to follow the Global Warming narrative.

The largest of these errors was demonstrated in a 1998 paper by Frank Wentz and Matthias Schabel of RSS. In that paper they showed that the data needed to be corrected for orbital decay of the MSU satellites. As the satellites' orbits gradually decayed towards the earth the area from which they received radiances was reduced, introducing a false cooling trend.[9] 
Even after the correction for satellite decay UAH continued to infer lower TLT temperatures than RSS based on the same raw data. For example Mears et al. at RSS found 0.193 °C/decade for lower troposphere up to July 2005, compared to +0.123 °C/decade found by UAH for the same period.
Much of the remaining disparity was resolved by the three papers in Science, 11 August 2005, which pointed out errors in the UAH 5.1 record and the radiosonde record in the tropics.[10]

Climate change is the perfect example – acceptance of climate science among Americans is strongly related to political ideology. This has exposed humanity’s potentially fatal flaw. Denying an existential threat threatens our existence.
But that’s exactly what many ideological conservatives do. Partisan polarization over climate change has steadily grown over the past two decades. This change can largely be traced to the increasingly fractured and partisan media environment that has created an echo chamber in which people can wrap themselves in the comfort of “alternative facts” (a.k.a spin and lies) that affirm their worldviews. We’ve become too good at fooling ourselves into believing falsehoods, which has ushered in a dangerous “post-truth” era, with no better example than the subject of climate change.
In its December 2017 issue, the Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition published a paper by Stephan Lewandowsky, Ullrich Ecker, and John Cook, along with an impressive 9 responses from other social scientists, essentially investigating how we can make truth great again.
The December 2017 Alabama special election provided an excellent example of the problem at hand. Despite numerous allegations and evidence that Roy Moore pursued and in some cases sexually assaulted teenage girls while in this thirties, 71% of Alabama Republicans believed the allegations were false. Among those disbelieving Republicans, approximately 90% said that the media and Democrats were behind the allegations. As Donald Trump would put it, they believed the allegations were “fake news.” Similarly, 51% of Republicans still believe that Barack Obama was born in Kenya.
It’s understandable that an Alabama Republican would want to believe Roy Moore. We want our representatives to reflect our ideological worldviews. Motivated reasoning and confirmation bias kick in, and partisan media outlets like Breitbart and Fox News provide the material to affirm those biases.
We now have influential partisan media outlets that help people believe what they want to believe, irrespective of factual accuracy. Inconvenient facts are labeled “fake news” and disregarded. In a nutshell, we no longer inhabit a shared reality, and as a result, major problems are going unaddressed because a segment of Americans rejects inconvenient truths.
“Fake news” has never really meant “This is a lie.” It’s tribal signaling. It means, “I give you permission to ignore this fact that’s not good for our team.” https://t.co/VHLnED159s
To solve this dilemma, Lewandowsky and his colleagues propose what they call “technocognition,” which is described as:
the idea that we should use what we know about psychology to design technology in a way that minimizes the impact of misinformation. By improving how people communicate, they hope, we can improve the quality of the information shared.
The authors propose a number of ideas to help bring an end the post-truth era. One key idea involves the establishment of an international non-governmental organization that would create a rating system for disinformation. There are already some similar examples in existence – Climate Feedback consults climate scientists to rate the accuracy of media articles on climate change, and Snopes is a widely-respected fact checker. The challenge would of course be to convince conservatives to accept a neutral arbiter of facts, and continue accepting it when information they want to believe is ruled inaccurate.
These independent rulings could then be conveyed via technology. For example, Facebook could flag an article that’s based on false information as an unreliable source, and Google could give more weight in returning factually accurate news and information at the top of its search results lists.
The study authors also suggest that inoculation theory techniques could help dislodge misinformation after it first takes hold. This involves explaining the logical fallacy underpinning a myth. People don’t like being tricked, and research has shown that when they learn that an ideologically-friendly article has misinformed them by using fake experts, for example, they’re more likely to reject the misinformation.
The authors also encourage teaching people – particularly students – how to identify misinformation techniques and the other strategies used to create the partisan echo chamber. Younger Americans are already less susceptible to the conservative media bubble. The median age of primetime Fox News viewers is 68, and Alabamans under the age of 45 voted for Roy Moore’s opponent Doug Jones by a 23-point margin. Teaching them how to identify misinformation techniques will help inoculate younger Americans against the corrosive effects of the partisan media bubble.
However, in their follow-up paper addressing and summarizing the 9 responses to their original study, the authors note that technocognition faces one additional major obstacle:
This obstacle is the gorilla in the room: Policy making in the United States is largely independent of the public’s wishes but serves the interests of economic elites.
To illustrate this point, they plot data from a 2014 study by Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page. The study concluded:
When a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites and/or with organized interests, they generally lose. Moreover, because of the strong status quo bias built into the U.S. political system, even when fairly large majorities of Americans favor policy change, they generally do not get it…we believe that if policymaking is dominated by powerful business organizations and a small number of affluent Americans, then America’s claims to being a democratic society are seriously threatened.
The study found that while economic elites’ and business groups’ preferences often result in policy changes, public opinion has virtually no influence on policy outcomes. We see this all the time on issues from climate change to gun control, and in the recent examples of Obamacare (+12% approval but just one vote shy of Republican repeal) and the tax plan (-14% approval but passed by Republicans in Congress). This means it will be difficult to implement policies to shift us away from our current post-fact and post-truth world unless elites or interest groups or policymakers decide it’s in their best interest.
The underlying problem we face is that most American votes seem to be decided based on tribalism rather than policy preferences. As Dave Roberts put it, this is America’s epistemic crisis; it’s the root of America’s moral and intellectual rot, and it’s been aided by the aforementioned growth of the partisan media echo chamber.
To remedy the situation will require that we return to a world of shared facts, perhaps as judged by a neutral arbiter. However, the current politicized post-truth environment has delivered the Republican Party to power, which means they have little motivation to change the status quo.
That being said, Donald Trump’s approval rating is a dismal 37% (by far the lowest of any president in modern American history after one year in office) and congressional Democrats lead Republicans by 13% in generic polls, despite positive economic conditions currently aiding the party in power. These numbers point toward potential wave elections for Democrats in 2018 and 2020. 
That outcome – Republican policymakers paying the electoral price for lying to their constituents and pursuing unpopular policies that benefit themselves and their rich donors – may be the only way to break through the echo chamber. Once they regain power, Democrats would be wise to implement technocognition-based policies, to try and bring an end to the dangerous post-truth era before we foolishly do too much lasting damage to our planet and ourselves.

Dear Carol, Greetings! Thanks for giving us a poem by Maya Chowdhry and the introductory notes reveal “this work is alive to the marvels of its discoveries as well as the ecological peril it reports”,The title also ‘ Microbial museum’ quite interesting with a search into new takes.The very beginning itself is quite fascinating as if taking us into a new world of seas and ‘ice caverns’April ship sets sail, sea freezes ripples, leaves Rothera behind. One hundred and fifty thousand years of snowfall in cylindrical samples, bubble-wrapped, boxed in styrofoam,cores wrenched from ice caverns to Immingham.We get more information on museum and mircrobes, A write more related to Science and watery images.
“The museum’s stated goal is to promote a positive view of microbes, provide “an international platform for microbiology that brings diverse interest groups together to bridge the gap between …..”…In a syntax pertaining to sea and water and related images, we get into a picture of other lives “ and resurrected Creatures.” The poet’s minute observation focused upon here: “blueprints of other lives, the oldest ice sequestersreservoirs of extinct creatures resurrected.”
In the description of cells, there is mutation and growth and reaching the ladder to life.
“The future is thawed, dispatched into a white out.” The conclusive line with a generalized predictive sentiment preparing the ground for a somewhat not wholesome view expressed in a highly poetic image of expression.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1513438005000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'4332489', u'id': u'109791706', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'thinkfirstactsecond', u'text': u'deep sea decor

'Sonars' is probably a metaphor. A pulsed signal, which may be electrically generated, will bounce off any bubbles in a 'flowstream'.

The future is thawed, dispatched into a white out.
In ""Microbial Museum,"" a 15-line poem comprising seven couplets and one closing stand-alone line, the Edinburgh-born poet and transmedia artist Maya Chowdhry seems to trace a journey of flux and mutation as she tracks the changes in climate and the physical world. The adjective ""microbial"" suggests, at one and the same time, contamination and fermentation while the noun ""museum"" denotes a place which exhibits historical or cultural, artistic or scientific, artefacts. The human person's acting out of his/ her life, in all its complexity and contradiction, may be the product as much of the microbial as the genetic while nature is a museum which exhibits the plants and animals, terrain or topography, which constitute the phenomena of the natural world observed (in awe) by human beings, and exploited by them for livelihood and survival.
The poet manages to deploy images and impressions denoting contradiction - contamination and fermentation, turbulence and transformation, extinction and resuscitation - which appear to capture or mirror agitation and arbitrariness in nature. On the one hand, we have not only the English port of Immingham to where ""[o]ne hundred and fifty thousand years of snowfall in/ cylindrical samples, bubble-wrapped, boxed in styrofoam,/ cores wrenched from ice caverns"" are sent but also the British Antarctic territory Rothera - meaning ""flowing water"" - being left behind by the setting sail of an April ship and ripples frozen by the sea.
On the other, we have the spectre of two different but related kinds of thawing. First, there is the thawing of an antediluvian plague enabling ""ancient genes to mix with/ modern ones"" - the inevitable intertwining of past and present, the very definition of heritage or inheritance. Second, there is the thawing, it seems, of the very future of the human race. That thawing embraces flux and mutation, but also human growth or development as a link is established between genetic constitution and the skill of skiing on snow, as well as its transformation of the ocean and the subtle, subliminal impact on the cells of human beings - cells which can cause, or be vulnerable to, disease - as they ascend ""the ladder to life"": ""Skiing genotype slaloms through DNA markers,/ mutating the ocean, creeping into the unsuspecting cells/ of species climbing the ladder to life.""
The poem may or may not be a little too knowing or self-conscious in its itemization of data and schemata; it does, manage, however, to sustain a formulaic, even forensic logic all its own - the physicality of science in dialogue with the artistry of poetry; each, in its particular way, a monument to (human) creation and creativity.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1512993522000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'which', u'effect': None}], u'author_id': u'4795024', u'id': u'109541399', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'marfil', u'text': u'Greatly!

On my first few readings, I took the sentence as a main clause, 'skiing genotype slaloms' and two participial subclause, 'creeping...' and 'climbing...'. 'Skiing' would have been an attributive adjective. But now I see the whole 'sentence' as a participial modifier governed by 'skiing' and saying more abut the course or method of 'prehistoric pestilence'. 
The poem is always going to have this 'boil', this coldly intense degree of grammatical ambiguity, given that some of its sentences follow a conventional subject-predicate form (they have thawed out, just as you say) and some are noun-expressions. The very first sentence, with its spliced, DNA-like clause structure, cues us we'll have to make an interpretive effort to discriminate between these types; grammatically, it's more natural to take it that the unfrozen sea 'leaves Rothera behind', though in sense terms we'd normally take this to be the research vessel. The poem also dispenses with the semicolon to mark off adjoining clauses, in the case of the '[s]uspending cable sonars' couplet seeming to use the line-end instead. I would think its tension between a relaxed subject-predicate syntax and 'jottings' (or nominal notations) crisp and well-judged.

Martin Redfern’s polar diary provides some useful background to this week’s poem. It begins with the “April ship” departing from Rothera, Adelaide Island, where the British Antarctic Survey research station is based. Its cargo, thrillingly representing “one hundred and fifty thousand years of snowfall” in the soil samples yielded by “cores wrenched from ice caverns” is in transport to Immingham. At this point, guided by the title, readers might assume the samples are set to become an addition to an exhibition of ancient microbes. I looked up Immingham Museum to see if it housed such an exhibition. Not so far, it seems: you’d need to travel to Amsterdam to Artis Micropia.
 Micropia sounds as if it’s a fascinating place, featuring living microbes, virtual microbes and interactive installations like the Kiss-O-Meter, whose function needs no explanation. The museum’s stated goal is to promote a positive view of microbes, provide “an international platform for microbiology that brings diverse interest groups together to bridge the gap between science and the general public” and to encourage more study and research into “micro-nature”. Maya Chowdhry would probably empathise with these aims. While she devotes her recent collection, Fossil, to investigating, with wit and precision, unusual geological phenomena and the life cycles of various undersung species, her larger goal is public and eco-political.
 Chowdhry relishes scientific vocabulary, and naturalises it. The terse, compressed, “notebook” syntax she favours in Microbial Museum creates documentary immediacy, an impression of events happening in quick succession, and a vertically layered depth to the language. Connective words – main verbs, articles, and so on, as well as punctuation details like the apostrophe “s” as used to indicate the possessive, may be excluded, while nouns compact into lists. They generate heat, like bodies working at some heavy physical task out of doors in sub-zero temperatures. By contrast, there’s a delicate, ethereal quality to the lines in which “Statistics / held in water vapour measure up to eons of weather”.
 Chowdhry is more interested in thinking about what happens in the dark hiding places underground, or in a hypothetical future, than in Antarctic picture-painting. She’s particularly aware of sound, making the ice cores spark and hiss as the “drill incises annulus ice cuttings spiral surface”, or catching the potential rustle of wings and chitin in those “reservoirs of extinct creatures resurrected”.
 At the sixth couplet, a new and violent narrative emerges for the microbes. They are not simply to be disinterred and studied, but actually resurrected by the addition of new genetic material. The invasiveness of this process is expressed in the skiing metaphor of line 12. 
 The poem knows that the ethics of de-extinction are dubious. Does our species’ uncontrollable inventiveness mitigate its ecological imprudence, can we fix the disruption human advance causes by an even more advanced kind of human advance? Perhaps, if all else fails, we can abandon Earth and colonise Mars. Did I say we? Well, perhaps not everyone will be on that spaceship. And how do we know we will always be clever enough and quick enough for real damage limitation? 
 As it develops, this poem’s focus bypasses the melting glaciers and other “usual suspects” that, tragically, have almost become cliches of global warming. In a collection that mostly delights in biodiversity, the apocalypse suddenly appears, and the bacteria of some “prehistoric pestilence” return to the ecosystem through a horrible collision of “ancient genes” and “modern ones”. “Skiing genotype slaloms through DNA markers, / mutating the ocean, creeping into the unsuspecting cells / of species climbing the ladder to life”. The final image recalls Antarctic weather conditions while bringing back the danger-verb “thaw” in a compelling oxymoron: “The future is thawed, dispatched into a white out.”
 Chowdhry is a transmedia writer and artist: see her collaborative online Ripple installation. But her work is no less alive on the page, and Fossil reveals one of the most appealing voices in the new nature poetry, connecting to the magic and multiplicity of the biosphere while sounding warnings. These poems discover “thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears”, not only in wild flowers, but in fossil butterflies, lava, carrots and black badger Carlin peas. And they know that tears are not what’s needed: what’s needed now are thoughts leading to action.

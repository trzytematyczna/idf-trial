The promise, which follows increasingly dire scientific warnings, was the most positive message yet to come from the ongoing talks in Poland.
The announcement came at the end of a day in which the UN secretary general made an impassioned intervention to rescue the talks, which have been distracted by US, Russian and Saudi moves to downgrade scientific advice.
“We’re running out of time,” António Guterres told the plenary. “To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal.”
The talks have centred on devising a rulebook for implementing the 2015 Paris agreement and raising countries’ level of ambition to counter climate change, but progress has been slow on several key issues and divisions have emerged between four fossil fuel powers – the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait – and the rest of the world.
The UN believes China could play a stronger role in the absence of leadership from the US. Sources said Guterres would make a telephone call to Xi to ask for his help in nudging talks forward.
The EU also wants China, which is a key member of the block of 77 developing countries, to step up to ensure that countries all follow the same rules in being transparent over their greenhouse gas emissions.
Campaigners praised the decision by the High Ambition Coalition group of countries, made up of the EU and four other developed countries, including Canada and New Zealand, as well as the large grouping of least developed countries and several other developing nations, to scale up their emissions-cutting efforts in line with a 1.5C temperature rise limit.
Wendel Trio, director of the Climate Action Network Europe, said: “The spirit of Paris is back. The statement will boost greater ambition at the crunch time of these so far underwhelming talks. For the EU this must mean a commitment to significantly increase its 2030 target by 2020, even beyond the 55% reduction some member states and the European parliament are calling for. We call upon the countries that have not signed the statement so far to stop ignoring the science.” 
Guterres, in a pointed criticism aimed at the four countries that have been refusing to “welcome” the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s special report on 1.5-degree warming, said rejecting climate science was indefensible.
He added: “The IPCC special report is a stark acknowledgment of what the consequences of global warming beyond 1.5 degrees will mean for billions of people around the world, especially those who call small island states home. This is not good news, but we cannot afford to ignore it.”
Frank Bainimarama, the prime minister of Fiji and the outgoing chair of COP23, amplified Guterres’ message. He told delegates they risked going down in history as “the generation that blew it – that sacrificed the health of our world and ultimately betrayed humanity because we didn’t have the courage and foresight to go beyond our short-term individual concerns: craven, irresponsible and selfish”.
The former US vice-president Al Gore told delegates they faced “the single most important moral choice in history of humanity”.
Behind the scenes, delegates said there had been strong progress on finance thanks to a doubling of commitments by Germany and Norway to help poorer nations adapt to climate change and build institutions capable of monitoring emissions. Nicholas Stern, the author of a landmark review on the economics of climate change, praised “the level of ideas and cooperation”.
But others said there were still many disputed brackets in the negotiating text on transparency and other elements of the rulebook.
“There has been some progress, but it’s a very worrying time. There is still a lot more on the table than we hoped for at this stage,” said Helen Mountford, vice-president of the World Resources Institute. “The secretary general is coming in to make sure this COP can land in a good place. He will hold a summit next year to raise ambitions. If he wants success there, then here we need a robust rulebook and clear signals on ambition and finance.”
Janos Pasztor, the former climate adviser to Ban Ki-moon, told the Guardian that Guterres was doing the right thing by intervening at a crucial stage. “He needs to make clear what the IPCC has described as a major challenge, and that we have to deliver on that,” he said.
Pasztor added: “We are talking about the need for massive emissions reductions, that have to happen now, not in the future. It is very daunting. The secretary general has reminded the world of what is at stake, and the political significance of that.”
The contrasts with the Paris climate summit, in terms of the political atmosphere, were striking. David Levaï, who was part of the French government team that helped to broker the successful 2015 conference, said the geopolitical winds were far less favourable today. Globally, the rise of nationalists such as Donald Trump in the US and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil has tilted power towards fossil fuel and agribusiness interests.
He said: “In the year before Paris, all countries made clear that they wanted an agreement. Now, there are repeated attacks on multilateralism, and this has empowered groups that take negative actions.”
Levaï, who is at the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations, expressed hope that the secretary general might make a difference. “The fact that he has come back shows he feels a need to whip countries into order,” he said.
There has been some criticism of the pro-coal government of Poland for failing to press governments to raise their ambitions. But it joined Fiji as co-chair of the Talanoa phase of the negotiations to issue a call for action that recognised the importance of the 1.5C report as the basis for more urgency and ambition.
“The window for action is closing fast. We need to do more and we need to do it now,” said the document, which would form part of the official statement from this conference.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/12/un-chief-antonio-guterres-attempts-to-revive-flagging-climate-change-talks

Monday’s protest came during a panel discussion by the official US delegation, which used its only public appearance to promote the “unapologetic utilisation” of coal, oil and gas. Although these industries are the main source of the carbon emissions that are causing global warming, the speakers boasted the US would expand production for the sake of global energy security and planned a new fleet of coal plants with technology it hoped to export to other countries.
The event featured prominent cheerleaders for fossil fuels and nuclear power, including Wells Griffith, Donald Trump’s adviser on global energy and climate, Steve Winberg, the assistant secretary for fossil energy at the energy department, and Rich Powell, the executive director of the ClearPath Foundation, a non-profit organisation focused on “conservative clean energy”. The only non-American was Patrick Suckling, the ambassador for the environment in Australia’s coal-enthusiast government.
None of the US participants mentioned climate change or global warming, focusing instead of “innovation and entrepreneurship” in the technological development of nuclear power, “clean coal” and carbon capture and storage.
Ten minutes into Griffith’s opening speech, he was interrupted by a sudden, sustained, loud volley of laughter by several dozen protesters that was then followed by a single shout of “It’s not funny”, and then a series of chants of “Keep it in the ground” and “Shame on you”.
Several campaigners read statements. “There is no such thing as clean coal. Coal is deadly from the beginning to the end. They talk about the life cycle of coal, I talk about it as a death march. My father died of black lung, and I am in this struggle with others whose fathers and husbands are dying of black lung right now,” said Teri Blanton of Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, which represents Appalachian coal workers in North America.
After the protesters were led away by security guards, Griffiths said: “In the US our policy is not to keep it in the ground, but to use it as cleanly and efficiently as possible”.
This statement was contradicted by climate analysts, who noted the US environment agency estimates that 1,400 more deaths per year will result from Trump’s proposal to replace the Clean Power Act.
“It’s ludicrous for Trump officials to claim that they want to clean up fossil fuels, while dismantling standards that would do just that,” said Dan Lashof, the director of the World Resources Institute. “Since taking office, this administration has proposed to roll back measures to cut methane leaks from oil and gas operations, made it easier for companies to dump coal ash into drinking water, and just days ago proposed easing carbon pollution rules for new coal-fired power plants.”
Griffith boasted the US had the largest coal reserves in the world and was producing more petroleum than ever. “To achieve economic growth and eradicate poverty, all energy uses are important and they will be utilised unapologetically,” he said.
Echoing a claim often made by Trump, Griffiths said the US would not be subject to agreements that hamstrung domestic growth, while allowing China to operate with high emissions.
This was the second consecutive year that the Trump team was heckled after promoting fossil fuels and nuclear power at the climate talks, underscoring how the US position has shifted since the president took power in 2017.
The US was a key player in forging the Paris agreement in 2015, but its standing has steadily eroded since. In 2017, Trump announced he would pull the US out of the global accord. This year, his representatives have taken a still more destructive stance by aligning with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to try to downgrade a key report by the world’s scientists that warned of the dangers of global warming moving beyond 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.
None of the panelists would be drawn on the study, but Griffith spoke out against “alarmism” that, he claimed, displaced pragmatic solutions to address environmental concerns with prescriptive regulations that put jobs at risk and raised costs for consumers. In fact, scientists say their forecasts about climate impacts have been too conservative, while economists say the shift to renewables has resulted in cheaper energy for many users.
Winberg said the US government was planning to support a new fleet of small, modular coal plants that he claimed would be energy-efficient and have near-zero emissions if combined with carbon capture technology. After initial development in the US, he said they could be exported to other countries. “They offer opportunity for developing nations to access tomorrow’s coal technology to improve energy security,” he said. He also proposed more pipelines to oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico.
Despite this public commitment, the US use of coal is declining because renewables are cheaper, according to Nathaniel Keohane, the senior vice-president for the Environmental Defense Fund nonprofit group.
“Trump is playing politics, but it’s not changing the facts on the ground,” he said. “Coal usage in the US just hit a 39-year low. If we really want to protect our economy, we’ll move aggressively toward 100% clean energy.”
An alternative, non-official US delegation has backed a faster transition to renewables. Made up of city- and state-level governments, business executives and religious leaders, the “We’re still in” group is staging dozens of events in a bid to show action is still possible without White House support.
Nonetheless, many observers at the official US panel were ashamed at the position of their federal government. “I was completely embarrassed to be an American”, said Leo McNeil Woodberry of the Climate Action Network. “Everything they proposed was absolutely wrong. I can’t believe they are putting profits over the planet, and profits over people.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/10/protesters-disrupt-us-panels-fossil-fuels-pitch-at-climate-talks

Give the proceeds to the people,article,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/04/how-to-make-a-carbon-tax-popular-give-the-profits-to-the-people,0,"Two decades ago, Canada’s westernmost province was in the midst of environmental and economic calamity. A small beetle was devouring large swathes of the region’s valuable pine forests, leaving millions of trees dead as infestation spread. The government waited anxiously for cold winters – which would kill the beetles – but year after year the cold never came.
By 2008 the decimation of the forests, along with a series of intense storms walloping the province, prompted British Columbia to take action on climate change. The provincial government introduced a carbon tax, putting a price on fossil fuel emissions. And, crucially, all the money raised was returned to the people in tax cuts.
“It was groundbreaking,” said Karen Tam Wu of the Pembina Institute, an environmental thinktank. “It was the first one in the world that was revenue neutral.”
A decade later, as climate scientists and policymakers converge on UN talks in Katowice, Poland, urgently seek mechanisms to rein in carbon emissions in a bid to halt the inexorable rise of global temperatures, the British Columbia experiment with the tax is setting an example to others.
Economists and environmentalists have voiced support for it; the World Bank has called it a “textbook” way of developing environmental policy. Earlier in October, the economist William Nordhaus, winner of this year’s Nobel Prize for economics, threw his support behind the British Columbia model as an ideal model for export to other economies.
British Columbia is a province known for its environmental lean: yoga and hiking are the region’s main cultural exports. For many Canadians, it seems fitting that the continent’s most progressive carbon tax would originate amid mountains, surf and forest.

But the man who helped to usher it in, the former premier Gordon Campbell, rejects the notion that love for the environment is unique to the region.
“If you talk to people in rural communities, in urban communities, in Ontario or Alberta, and they all care about the environment,” Campbell told the Guardian. “They all want to go to pristine places.”
Troubled by the compounding effects of climate change he saw both at home and abroad, Campbell and his government believed a carbon tax represented the most effective way to address the problem – and it wasn’t a time to point fingers.
“Are we willing to do something to try to stop [climate change] from taking place, to slow it down?” he said. “Even for people who say: ‘It wouldn’t matter, Canada could have all of the emissions in the world and it wouldn’t make any difference.’ That’s not the point. We should do our bit.”
It’s a shame that in some places, carbon tax is seen as four-letter word
The carbon tax isn’t anything new. The world’s best known carbon tax to carry that name began in the European Union in 2005, with the Emissions Trading System. With initial success the price of pollution permits reached more than €20 ($22/£18) for the right to emit a ton of carbon. But heavy lobbying by industry led to a massive oversupply of permits and a price crash to €3 in 2013 – far too low to drive carbon cuts. Reforms have taken the price back above €20 in recent weeks.
China has seen the attraction of carbon markets as an efficient way of delivering the biggest carbon cuts at the lowest cost. Its carbon market is being established and will, on completion, be the world’s biggest.
In the world’s second biggest polluter, the US, 10 east coast states have had a “cap and trade” system for carbon emissions since 2009, under which companies have their greenhouse gas emissions capped and then must trade any surplus or deficit with others. But Barack Obama, while president, was unable to pass a nationwide system. Some prominent Republicans have backed a revenue-neutral carbon tax, but with little success.
Many fossil fuel companies claim to back carbon taxes, notably in Australia, where climate policy rows have toppled prime ministers. The oil giant BP is among the supporters of carbon taxes, yet recently spent $13m (£10.22m) in helping to defeat a proposal in Washington state.
In the rest of Canada, despite the success story in British Columbia, other provinces are dragging their heels. The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has legislated to impose a carbon levy on reluctant provinces, generating a storm of opposition.
Ontario’s premier Doug Ford, who recently repealed the province’s carbon tax, has called it “the worst tax ever”.
“It’s a shame that in some places, carbon tax is seen as four-letter word,” said Wu. “It’s really a key tool in the toolkit to incentivise the transition to a low carbon economy and curb carbon pollution. In British Columbia, it has definitely worked.”
Nonetheless, the outlook for carbon taxes looks bright: 88 nations, representing more than half of global emissions, say they are or will uses carbon pricing to tackle climate change. Furthermore, some states have suggested they would impose carbon border levies on imported goods from nations that do not tax carbon.
By design, the British Columbia plan was simple: it slapped a tax on any fossil fuels used for heating, electricity and transportation. Each person and business was expected to shoulder the burden of pricing pollution; no loopholes, no exemptions.
In everyday life prices ticked up, most noticeably at the gas pump. Companies with emissions-intensive work passed their increased costs on to consumers.
The tax was leading edge at the time. And, unfortunately, 11 years later, it’s still leading edge
But the critical selling point of the plan – the tax’s revenue neutral design – was unprecedented. With a revenue-neutral tax, the government keeps none of the money collected from the levy. Instead, it redistributes all of it – close to $1.8bn in its first three years – back to taxpayers in the form of tax cuts.
As a result, the increase in energy costs for residents was offset by a tax cut of roughly equal value. Anyone willing and able to change their behaviour to reduce emissions would end up in the black.
“The nice thing about the revenue-neutral carbon tax was that it didn’t judge people: if you want to buy something that emits more than somebody else, you’re going to pay more tax,” Campbell said. “People who wanted to have their taxes actually reduced had to change a little bit of their behaviour, and their tax load would have been reduced.”
Low-income residents, as well as those living in rural areas that relied more heavily on fossil fuels, received extra tax and cash benefits.
The tax began as a $10/ton levy on carbon emissions, eventually reaching $30/ton by 2012. In speeches touting the tax, Campbell said the reduction in emissions would equate to removing 750,000 cars from the road in the province.
The move – the first of its kind – placated both conservative economists and environmentalists. And, it worked.
“We saw fossil fuel consumption decrease by more than 17% and in the rest of Canada fuel consumption increased by more than 1%,” Wu said of the four-year period between 2008 and 2012, when the first tranche of increases went into effect.
Fears that the tax would have a negative impact on the economy quickly melted away when the numbers came in, she said. The province grew its economy by 16%, far outpacing any other region of the country.
“It was leading edge at the time,” Campbell said. “And, unfortunately, 11 years later, it’s still leading edge.”
By 2012, when the tax reached its first maximum level ($30 per ton), 64% of the population supported it. By 2016, it garnered the support of nearly 70% of residents.
In Victoria, the province’s capital, residents remain unfazed over the constant increases – a testament of how the tax has drifted into the background. Devon Crosby, who has worked in the oil and gas industry for much of his career, said he has little patience for the current feud across the country. “Look, I’d rather pay an extra 15% on gas for a cleaner and nicer British Columbia.”
For others, the tax cuts outweigh any increased costs. “Money talks,” said resident Kim Hollingsworth. “People need incentives to change their behaviour.” She based her decision to buy a new, more energy efficient heater on the climate rebates – part of the suite of climate policies Campbell introduced.
The revenue-neutral aspect of the tax is novel but has frustrated some environmental groups, who feel the tax does not do enough to reduce emissions. Others felt it was too onerous: between 2012 and 2016 Campbell’s successor as premier, Christy Clark, froze the tax and repealed a number of environmental policies.
“When the carbon tax was frozen, we saw emissions go back up,” said Wu.
By 2021, the tax is slated to reach $50/ton, but the current British Columbia government is examining modifying the revenue-neutral aspect of the programme in order to allocate funding for green infrastructure, deviating from its original revenue neutrality – a move Campbell feels defeats the purpose of the tax in the first place: “I’m not happy when we say it’s going to be revenue-neutral carbon tax and it isn’t really. Don’t play that game with people.”
He remains optimistic that the current feud in the country will dissipate over time. Too many people, he says, are on the defensive, feeling the problems of climate change are not directly their fault.
“I think the relevant question is: are we willing to do something about it when it’s happening?” he said. “And if we can help, are we willing to?”
The numbers that are fuelling international concerns about global warming and climate change are stark. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by a third over the past 100 years, to more than 400 parts per million.
That has happened as a result of sharp rises in annual emissions of greenhouse gases, which have roughly doubled since 1971, to 53.5m tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. (CO2 from industrial processes and from forestry and other land uses makes up about three quarters of greenhouse gases; methane comprises another 16% and nitrous oxide about 6%).
Annual global emissions flatlined for three years from 2014-2016, but rose sharply again last year.
Meanwhile, over the past century, average global temperatures have risen more than 1C.
The one bit of good news is the exponential rise in renewable power supplies, which have surged over the past 20 years to comprise more than 8% of global electricity generation.
Under the 2015 Paris agreement, signatories are supposed to rein in carbon emissions so as to keep global temperatures from rising to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. But the 1.5C threshold is now looming, mechanisms for implementing Paris are still weak, and many observers are predicting that rises of 3C or more are now far more likely by the second half of this century.

Turnbull re-entered the energy policy fray on Tuesday at the New South Wales Smart Energy Summit with a full throated defence of his record, lauding the Snowy Hydro 2.0 expansion, and lamenting the demise of the Neg.
The former prime minister urged his Liberal colleagues to revive the Neg – abandoned as a casualty of the August leadership fight – arguing it was a “vital piece of economic policy and has strong support, none stronger I might say, than that of the current prime minister and the current treasurer”.
Labor is proposing to keep the Neg with a 45% emissions reduction target. The text of the speech the former prime minister ultimately delivered on Tuesday morning, now uploaded on his website, did not address the impact of Labor’s higher target.
But an earlier draft of the speech, did.
“Labor has announced it will adopt the Neg but with a higher emissions target,” the early draft, seen by Guardian Australia, said. “Ours, as you know, was 26% which was only just above business as usual so it obviously had no adverse impact on prices.
“There is some modelling already from Frontier Economics which suggests that Labor’s 45% target will not result in higher prices,” the early draft said. “That assertion deserves sceptical assessment, but it is also important regularly to review these models in the light of the latest technology and market information.
“A great deal depends too on whether a 45% reduction means simply that emissions in 2030 – in that year – should be 45% less than in 2005. If that were the case, implying a hockey stick, the additional cost may not be as high as it would appear.”
Turnbull issued the following statement to Guardian Australia about the unauthorised disclosure of his draft speech to the energy conference. “The notes were obtained by Guardian Australia without my authority.
“They are incomplete draft material. The only remarks released with my authority was the speech that I gave at the conference, a transcript of which is on my website.”
The Morrison government, under political pressure both on climate change and on energy policy, is attempting to portray Labor’s higher emissions reduction target as irresponsible and “economy wrecking”.
The modelling referenced in the early draft of Turnbull’s speech, but deleted in the final version, found that power prices for households would fall by 2030 under four different scenarios modelled by Frontier Economics – business as usual and emissions reduction targets of 26%, 45% and 65%.
That research was commissioned by the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) and the Brotherhood of St Laurence, and was released in September.
Turnbull did not, in his public comments on Tuesday, endorse Labor’s 45% target. He said higher emissions reduction targets needed to be guided by “engineering and economics”.
When the general comments Turnbull made about reviving the Neg fuelled a Labor attack on the government’s energy policy in question time, the former prime minister took to social media to stress that he had not endorsed Labor’s 45% target.
“I have not endorsed Labor’s energy policy,” the former prime minister said on Twitter. “They have adopted the Neg mechanism but have not demonstrated that their 45% emissions reduction target will not push up prices. I encouraged all parties to stick with Coalition’s Neg which retains wide community support.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/05/turnbull-speech-draft-labor-emissions-target-power-bills

These cuts and a series of other measures are also needed to prevent catastrophic climate change, it says.
More than 50% more food will be needed by 2050, according to the World Resources Institute (WRI) report, but greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture will have to fall by two-thirds at the same time. The extra food will have to be produced without creating new farmland, it says, otherwise the world’s remaining forests face destruction. Meat and dairy production use 83% of farmland and produce 60% of agriculture’s emissions.
Increasing the amount of food produced per hectare was the most critical step, the experts said, followed by cutting meat-eating and putting a stop to the wasting of one-third of food produced.
“We have to change how we produce and consume food, not just for environmental reasons, but because this is an existential issue for humans,” said Janet Ranganathan, vice-president for science and research at the WRI.
Tim Searchinger, of the WRI and Princeton University, said: “If we tried to produce all the food needed in 2050 using today’s production systems, the world would have to convert most of its remaining forest, and agriculture alone would produce almost twice the emissions allowable from all human activities.”
The new report, launched at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, follows other major scientific analyses showing that huge reductions in meat-eating are “essential” to avoid dangerous climate change. Another found that avoiding meat and dairy products was the single biggest way to reduce  an individual’s environmental impact on the planet, from slowing the annihilation of wildlife to healing dead zones in the oceans.
The world’s science academies concluded last week that the global food system was “broken”, leaving billions of people either underfed or overweight and driving dangerous global warming. Another new report concluded that the global food system required “radical transformation” if climate change and development goals were to be met, including “widespread dietary change”.
After increased productivity, the WRI report focuses on meat from ruminant animals. The digestion of cattle and sheep produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Beef provided 3% of the calories in the diet of US citizens but was responsible for half the emissions, the WRI said.
The report recommends that 2 billion people across countries including the US, Russia and Brazil cut their beef and lamb consumption by 40%, limiting it to 1.5 servings a week on average. Most of the world’s citizens would continue to eat relatively little beef in the WRI scenario.
But Searchinger said: “The world’s poor people are entitled to consume at least a little more.” The 40% reduction is a smaller cut than in other studies. “We think that is a realistic goal,” he said. “In the US and Europe, beef consumption has already reduced by one-third from the 1960s until today.”
Tobias Baedeker, of the World Bank, said farmers would require a lot of support to make the changes required but that redirecting the world’s huge subsidies could be a “game-changer”. Subsidies of more than $590bn (£460bn) a year are given to farmers in 51 nations, representing two-thirds of global food output, according to the OECD. In the US, these subsidies halve the current price of beef, the WRI says.
The sophisticated marketing and behaviour-change strategies that food companies already used to influence customers could help shift diets, said Ranganathan, as could governments encouraging less meat in schools, hospitals and other public institutions.
Other changes to farming that are needed, according to the WRI, include better feed to reduce methane production from cows, limiting biofuels made from food crops, managing manure and fertiliser better and cutting energy use by farm machinery. It also said the overall demand for food could be cut, with policies to curb population growth such as “improving women’s access to education and healthcare in Africa to accelerate voluntary reductions in fertility levels”.
The WRI report was launched at the UN climate summit in Poland where almost 200 nations are aiming to turn the carbon-cutting vision set out in Paris in 2015 into reality. The rapid ramping up of action is another key goal. Climate action must be increased fivefold to limit warming to the 1.5C scientists advise, according to the UN.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/05/beef-eating-must-fall-drastically-as-world-population-grows-report

First up, I don't believe there is a single credible environmental campaigner or climate scientist who argues that we can continue burning fossil fuels if only we stop eating meat. So your entire premise is a strawman argument.
Then you cherrypick a factoid about UK farming, which even if true (it isn't worth checking) is irrelevant because it is the global contribution to carbon emissions from agriculture that matter. And this is undoubtedly going up, and the global rise in meat consumption is known to be a big contributer.
Then you give a further deeply spurious argument about Californian wildfires. Yes, if/when they happen much carbon is emitted. But overall, plant growth is the most efficient form of carbon sequestration we have, and allowing tree growth - particularly where wildfires are rare (like cooler/wetter countries) - is therefore essential. Instead, having large herbivores chomping away at that growth, releasing it as methane, so that we can then eat them and then release even more methane is absolutely pushing us in the wrong direction.

The how would be a massive massive challenge. More on that in a moment. Because we could rise to a massive massive challenge, but our leaders lack the political courage/will to do it. It can only happen when 'we, the people' demand it of them. At present, politicians simply do not believe people want or would accept what is needed. So we will have to go the brink before they step up. The question is, can the 'political brink' come soon enough that we are not already over the 'climate brink'. If we wait much longer, we will be over the edge and the social and economic consequences will degrade our collective capacity to act.
This is where recognising the collective scale of the challenge is essential. If you took as a case study, a typical UK local authority which might have say, 50 schools, 1000 council homes, 50 office/workplace type buildings and maybe 200 commercially rented buildings they are responsible for. They would be the MOST amenable to decarbonising, at least in theory. They would need to go in and replace every boiler and insulate and reglaze them all, introduce solar and/or district heating solutions and switch to green energy. They would need to go to LED lighting and put in energy saving devices. I can't price that up accurately but you probably are looking at £50-100m easily. Do they have that money or borrowing capacity? No.
Then scale that up across the entire public sector. Then ask how you get the private sector to follow suit. 
So financially, it can't happen in a business-as-usual environment. You have to go onto a war footing. Furthermore, you have to anyway, because to even remotely attempt this, you have to overcome a yawning gulf between our current construction-related workforce and what you would need to achieve it.
And in case you haven't noticed, I haven't even touched on transport, energy production, or agriculture.
So then ask yourself about the mindset change required from politicians brought up with laissez-faire assumptions, who have an ingrained preference for the nudge or 'enabling change'.

In the Antartic we have icesheets that we can see are getting undermined and at risk of breaking up eventually, like Thwaites and Larsen B.

We all die in say 50 years (to be optimistic) so nothing we do now will hurt us when a new generation blame us. 
I also agree that we can do something about it now. And you are clearly a top human being for writing here - since most people are less honest about the perspective than you are. 
A huge part of me agree with you - I am also loving Big Lebowski. If I am lucky I will return to the natural carbon cycle in around 30 years. So hey - why not be a nihilist? 
After reflection upon it I have figured out that I as a carbon based life-form can be a nihilist only if I am superior to all other carbon based life on this planet. I have literally talked with a pine-tree about this subject (not like how kids use the word ""literally"")
After saying this to the pine I came to the conclusion that to be a meaningful carbon-based lifeform and not a god, I had to do what little I can do to at least inform about what I know. 
Nihilism is very closely related to cynicism. And a carbon-based life-form like a pine is neither. 
I came to the conclusion that people are stupid. But the pine I hugged - and the glaciers I spent 30 years of my life to study and do science on deserve better than me making them collateral damage just because I do not like humans much. 
I do like glaciers and pine-trees a lot. 
So I changed perspective. I stopped doing science to save humans. I started to do science for a lichen. This guy 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizocarpon_geographicum#/media/File:Rhizocarpon_geographicum_on_quartz.jpg
It is a fun little guy. First of all it grows at high altitude with low pollution (Pollution kills it) Furthermore it has a pretty interesting biology.- it is a lichen Thirdly it can work as a pretty accurate measure of time. 
I do not care so much about humans. But I would like this little guy to get a chance for another few billion years. And that depends on us - right now. 
We do not end carbon to save us. We end carbon to save lichens. They are symbiotic (living together with something else) , they are base photosynthesis things for 5% of land, they are in effect brilliant. And we are killing them. 
I do not care that I may be the last human to exist - but it buggs me to think that I drag Lichens with me. I after all represented and lived a very short notion of genetics on this planet. Lichen has a very long and profound history on this planet. 
So I advocate end of fossil fuels not to save myself or humans. But for the human raze to consider the beauty of the lichen to live on after us.

BQEND it does hence hydrogen pipelines in existence today are stainlesss steel alloy - it also embrittles metals.
So whilst you can add hydrogen to NG as they are doing in a number of projects a pure hydrogen economy requires renewed infrastructure.
CCS is also not without its costs- a 7% increase in costs is not in the literature, however as you say gas prices are volatile but this will also be put into the cost of hydrogen, but may make electrolysis more economic.
Hydrogen does have its current uses- most of which goes to fertiliser / ammonia production and a number of dirty industries will need to adopt hydrogen in their processes. But to extend it to all transport and heating is huge - far better to combine energy efficiency with heat [easily recovered with MVHE] and even air source heat pumps compete with current gas prices.

The surface mass balance is irrelevant to the risk which is to do with 100,000+ years of compacted snow and ice melting. This is more complicated than the mass balance which is why a deliberately fraudulent organisation like the GWPF never give all of the information:

BQSTART
As noted in the previous post, exceptional winter snow accumulation and heavy, summer snowfall, drove the net snow input mass to 130 billion tons above the 1981 to 2010 average. This was followed by a near-average melt and runoff period, resulting in a large net mass gain for the ice sheet in 2018 of 150 billion tons. This is the largest net gain from snowfall since 1996, and the highest snowfall since 1972. However, several major glaciers now flow significantly faster than in these earlier years. The net change in mass of the ice sheet overall, including this higher discharge of ice directly into the ocean, is not clear at this point but may be a smaller loss or even a small gain. This is similar to our assessment for 2017, and in sharp contrast to the conditions for the preceding decade.Persistent winds from the northeast triggered high snowfall for 2017 to 2018 along the eastern Greenland coast. These winds blew across open ocean areas allowing the atmosphere to entrain moisture and deposit it as heavy snowfall on the ice sheet.

There are undoubtedly exceptions but as a general rule I believe the following are factual.
The national grid is legally disallowed from generating power and so it already has to remain separate.The NG charge the generators for access to the transmission network (TNUoS) and us (via our suppliers) for delivering it to us as far as the substation (DNUoS)
The NG is responsible for frequency/stability and so also buy in peaking services (such as pumped storage and gas plants and emergency capacity on standby for failures)
I don't see how we could ever get rid of the grid - it's essentiall and the population density of cities or even small towns is such that home generation isn't feasible- especially if we are going to start charging EVs overnight.
It's easier (and safer) to have a system where if one part fails or has to be maintained, then the others around it can pick up the load.It's the fundamental issue with increasing intermittency of generation and spreading it around the coast - the more intermittent a systems supply is, the greater the number of interconnections are required to guarantee a supply. 
In point of fact, if we have a too low density grid (by spreading generation and storage over the country) then the grid will be considerably bigger, not smaller, because energy from an intermittent source will always have to be balanced from elsewhere else even if only for short periods.
That means thousands of miles of additional transmission lines.And as Germany has discovered, people will accept or at least tolerate wind turbines, no one wants half million volt transmission lines strung over their homes, schools or national parks.
Keeping a high density baseload power supply in place reduces that.At present, for us, that's mostly (>40%) gas, nuclear, biomass (the largest renewable and one I'm sceptical about) the last of the coal and a smidgen of hydro.
There are things that can alleviate the strain all this of course - community batteries at substations (not domestic) to help everyone, not just the middle classes to share domestic solar; a 'smart' grid using DSM controlled over the internet to schedule when things go on or off. 
I've missed out out loads but that's a general feel for it.

But later in the report the actual process of creating hydrogen from natural gas makes it clear that natural gas is the fuel to do the conversion- which at the very least is a 30% loss in original energy so the overall cost of gas will more because more gas will be consumed in the overall process. And whilst the capex costs for CCS are accounted for the actual energy cost of transporting CO2 and disposing of it is not accounted for.

If we grow beans to eat instead of cows we produce less carbon but just as much ""growth."" If we build green energy generation plants we get just as much growth as with dirty ones but with much less carbon. If we replace carbon based energy with alternatives we get growth without carbon. Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution growth and carbon emissions have marched together but if we just switch and rapidly phase out carbon would that not reduce carbon?
Further even without any growth at all, even during a recession, our carbon emissions today remain sky high. Even if not actually increasing they remain at deadly levels. Carbon emissions come from the use of fossil fuels irrespective of growth levels. Carbon emissions stop when we stop emitting carbon irrespective of growth levels. If we agreed to achieve net zero carbon in 10 years we could do it irrespective of ""growth"" and in fact the demand for new low carbon kit would trigger a huge amount of economic growth as new generating facilities and autos and everything currently emitting carbon has to be replaced over a decade.
I don't actually see how you can stop economic growth short of a total nuclear war or other system collapse or how that is going to substantially reduce carbon emissions if we don't stop burning carbon fuels!
There ARE alternative energy sources and many are cost-competitive with carbon so why not just mandate a global shift? If economic growth also declines in the process (I don't see why it would) so what? The alternative to net zero carbon quickly is net zero civilization and then, I guess, growth would no longer be an issue.

The same climate science that told you about carbon. 
Remember, when Svante Arrhenius did his studies in the late 1800s - he was not primarily focusing on the heating effect of CO2 - he was looking more into the cooling effect under reduced CO2 levels - as an explanation for ice-ages (that was deducted to have occurred back then - long before one could date when that past was time was). 
It took almost a century longer - when all the evidence of Earth orbit and inclination and ice-cores sampling and albedo-feedbacks etc got the data lined up for the current understanding - of an orbital pace-maker with direct physical CO2 and albedo-feedback. Now described physically to the extent that if one dial in max ice-age orbital configuration, albedo and CO2 - climate models do ""spit out"" an ice age naturally. 
It is climate science that has told you about hot Plicocen and Eocen and Holocene Optimum and Eemian. It is climate science that has told you about extreme events such as the Younger Dryas or Marine Isotope stage 4. 
Co2 levels is always a thing. One simply can not make an ice-age with 400 ppm CO2, for example. The energy balance budget does not allow for it (remember - day after tomorrow was a Hollywood disaster film of the type that also allow science to drill to the Earth core because it is unstable (the Core) and similar fun-flicks). 
It is science that tell you that unstable tectonic conditions over hundreds or thousands or millions of years could push the planet out of ""snow-ball"" Earth conditions. Or to spike the global temperature and isotopic levels of the planet for ""brief moments"" in the geological record. 
Please remember, there is nothing ""artificial"" about the CO2 we humans produce. We take carbon - and make it react with oxygen - (what we call ""burning"") - and that reaction cause CO2 as exhaust. 
If one light up coal seams around the planet directly - the result would be the same. CO2. 
But not quite as efficient as we do. Because we open up mountains and expose gigatons of coal every year. Crush the coal. And burn the coal in special-built factories for max burn-rate (or efficiency if you like). 
This exotermic way to make CO2 is simple. 
The internal storage of free CO2 itself is way more complex (what happens when global CO2 naturally fall by ca 100 ppm during an ice-age) . A part of it is ""fizzy drink"" chemistry (not too complex). But the dynamic part of it - that fluids flow in 3D on our planet) is more complex. 
Point of all this that GHG-gasses was always involved in ""everything that happened"" naturally. During LGM CO2 was trending ca 100 ppm below what we call ""natural"" - (the Holocene when human culture emerged). A way to think about this is that for the past 2 million years, CO2 was naturally varying between ca 180 and 280 ppm. In other words, CO2 was mostly below the 280 preindustrial value of the Holocene. 
To be above 300 ppm is causing klaxons and red alarm-lights to go off like crazy. There is absolutely nothing normal about that. Until one start to budget in the amount of carbon being reported dug out and light up by companies since 1700 AD. 
Similarly, natural fast CO2 exchange happens by a rate of ca 0.01 ppm per year - not by 3 ppm per year. 
Lots of people on the internet tell us that 400 ppm is just 0.04% of the atmosphere. So they use the little argument. And then there are the guys who studied a bit of physics in the 1930´s or whatever, who say that the atmosphere is already saturated - and demonstrate that by physics. Sure. If one calculate the radiative effect of the atmosphere as one layer on the molecular level, kind of right. But the atmosphere is an ""infinite"" layer problem. It can not be solved by a uni-directional back-scatter approach - since the problem is omni-directional. 
Paleo-science has always been leaning to the side of higher sensitivity - not lower. Because when we calculate conditions locally, we could not close the equations with what models said back in the days. 
The NASA model Hansen used 4 decades ago was more than good enough for the message. You can run this model on a laptop from 1995 - it is called Edu-ECM. 
Look at figure 6 here and compare it to the present discussion about 1.5 degree targets and 4 degree warmings.

Run-off from this vast northern ice sheet – currently the biggest single source of meltwater adding to the volume of the world’s oceans – is 50% higher than pre-industrial levels and increasing exponentially as a result of manmade global warming, says the paper, published in Nature on Wednesday.
Almost all of the increase has occurred in the past two decades – a jolt upwards after several centuries of relative stability. This suggests the ice sheet becomes more sensitive as temperatures go up.
“Greenland ice is melting more in recent decades than at any point in at least the last four centuries, and probably more than at any time in the last seven to eight millennia,” said the lead author Luke Trusel, of Rowan University.
“We demonstrate that Greenland ice is more sensitive to warming today than in the past – it responds non-linearly due to positive feedbacks inherent to the system. Warming means more today than it did even just a few decades ago.”
The researchers used ice core data from three locations to build the first multi-century record of temperature, surface melt and run-off in Greenland. Going back 339 years, they found the first sign of meltwater increase began along with the industrial revolution in the mid-1800s. The trend remained within the natural variation until the 1990s, since when it has spiked far outside of the usual nine- to 13-year cycles.
Greenland currently contributes about 20% of global sea-level rise, which is running at 4mm per year. This pace will probably double by the end of the century, according to the most recent models used by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. How the new study affects those projections will be the subjects of future study by the authors. If all the ice in Greenland melted, it would raise sea levels by seven metres. At the current pace that would take thousands of years, but the ongoing acceleration could bring this forward rapidly.
“At some point, sea-level rise will be too fast for us to adapt to, so we really have to avoid this situation by reducing emissions,” said the study’s co-author Michiel van den Broeke of Utrecht University. “I think this is one of the many wake-up calls that we have had in the last few decades. It clearly links manmade global warming to sea-level rise.”
The research comes out as policymakers from around the world are attending UN climate talks in Katowice, Poland, where governments are trying to set new rules to keep global warming to between 1.5C and 2C. The authors said the paper underlined the dangers of exceeding even the lower figure.
“On a personal level it is worrying to see this – along with the vast array of other scientific evidence showing that we’ve entered unprecedented or exceptional times,” said Trusel.
“The ice has no political agenda – it either grows or melts. Today it is melting as humans have warmed the planet. The ice sheets have tipping points, and how quickly they impact our livelihoods through sea level rise depends on what we do now and in the very near future.”
Other academics, uninvolved in the paper, said the new study was an important confirmation of what scientists have long suspected: that the recent increase in ice melt is ominously unusual.

While the numbers do not make for happy reading, there are plenty of people trying to do something about them. Our reporter Leyland Cecco writes this week from the Canadian west, where the province of British Columbia has come up with an innovative response to the global carbon splurge.
Luxembourg, meanwhile, has come up with a different idea for tackling greenhouse gas emissions (and city tailbacks), following an example set two years ago by Tallinn, as our Europe correspondent Daniel Boffey found out.
Pioneering startups are playing their part in using technology to combat environmental degradation. In France, Morphosis aims to reduce e-waste – discarded old electronics – by making sure their rare metals are recycled and reused. In Cameroon, Save Our Agriculture improves food security through aquaponics, a farming method where fish nourish the plants that in turn filter their water.
And in the UK, a small army of ramblers is determined to push back against human incursions into the countryside by rediscovering long-lost footpaths buried under decades of manmade eyesores.

It reveals a stark generational divide over whether to increase taxation, with under-45s much less supportive than those aged over 45.
The results suggest that public support for tax rises to fund the NHS, and the health service receiving a growing share of public spending, may be eroded in the coming years.
While overall 41% of the public believe taxes should go up to fund public services such as the NHS, just 33% of 18 to 24-year-olds and even fewer – 30% – of those aged between 25 and 44 agreed.
In contrast, backing is strongest among those aged 45-54 (42%), 55-64 (46%) and over 65 (54%).
Older age groups are also least likely to agree that “we should cut taxes and reduce spending on public services”. Only 8% of over-65s agree, whereas 21% of 25 to 34-year-olds think that should happen.
The split between older and younger adults emerged in a survey of public attitudes by Populus. It carried out online polling of 2,096 UK adults for the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA).
“The NHS can’t afford to keep mitigating our failure to invest in what leads to good health: a welfare system that promotes economic security; investment in early years, education and skills; and better quality jobs for all,” said Ed Cox, the RSA’s director of public services and communities.
Younger people have very different priorities than older age groups, Cox stressed. “Aside from a shared commitment to tackling inequality there is neither a clear consensus on tax increases nor agreement on how any extra money is spent.
“The younger generations who’ll pay for increased spending see climate change and technological adaptation as greater challenges than the ageing society,” he added.
Social care illustrates the chasm of opinion between the age groups. While 54% of over-65s see increasing taxation as the best solution, fewer than one in four of those aged 18 to 44 agree.
A third of 18 to 24-year-olds think that much greater use should be made of volunteers, while just 14% of those of pensionable age concur.
Caroline Abrahams, the charity director of Age UK, stressed that while volunteers play a hugely important role, “they cannot and should not be asked to replace the vital work of trained care workers” and could not plug the gaps in the social care workforce.
“Social care, just like the NHS, is an essential public service providing highly skilled support to people who are often living with complex needs or coming to the end of their life.
“It needs sustainable funding, a well-trained and committed workforce and the capacity to work closely with health, housing and other vital services. As the majority of people in this survey recognise, putting funding on a sustainable footing is a vital first step.”
Asked which policy areas the government should focus on over the next decade to make the UK a better country, those aged 45 and over identified inequality, the ageing society and social isolation and mental health.
However, again under-45s offered a different set of priorities. While isolation did feature in their top three priorities, climate change was the biggest (48%) area of interest for 18 to 24-year-olds and also mentioned by those aged 25 to 44. For those under 45 international relations and Brexit were also key issues.
Cox added that the findings showed that “traditional left-right politics is being flipped on its head, as under-45s back lower taxes and a smaller state, despite overwhelmingly voting Labour in the last election, while Conservative-leaning voters over 65 back higher taxes and spending”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/08/generational-divide-uk-split-by-age-over-tax-rises-for-public-services

Its image appears on license plates, restaurant signs and clothing. It is sold alive, with its claws banded shut, on docks, at highway rest stops and supermarkets. Cooked, it is served everywhere from seaside shacks to the finest restaurants.
Lobster attracts tourists, feeds locals and is a lifeblood for coastal towns.
Its importance has even swelled in recent years as lobsters have been caught in record numbers. Lobster landings – or the amount of lobster caught – have risen fivefold in the past three decades. Lobster has become a half-billion-dollar industry in Maine. And the reason for the boom, according to scientists, is climate change.
The Gulf of Maine is warming faster than 99% of the world’s waters, rising at three times the global average. That warming has created optimal conditions for lobsters to reproduce and survive into adulthood.
“It’s actually been really positive for us. We’ve seen probably the most favourable environmental conditions for lobsters ever,” said Patrice McCarron, the executive director of the Maine Lobstermen’s Association, which represents more than 1,000 members of the state’s lobster industry. 
But while the warming waters have resulted in a lobster bonanza, scientists say climate change will ultimately bring a bust to the boom: As the Gulf of Maine continues to warm, that temperature sweet spot for lobsters will continue to move north. That could result in a similar spike in lobsters in Canada, but leave Maine’s industry broken.
According to a report released earlier this year from the Gulf of Maine Research Institute (GMRI) in Portland, while the lobster population has risen over 500% along Maine’s coast over the past 30 years, the population is expected to drop by between 40% and 62% by 2050.
Climate change has already hit lobster populations in states south of Maine, seeing once-robust lobster fisheries in Massachusetts, Rhode Island – and even Connecticut, New Jersey and New York – decline.
Andrew Pershing, chief scientific officer at GMRI, says it is tempting to think that lobster populations are migrating with temperature, but that is not the case.
“It’s more that the populations that are here can become more or less productive. So lobsters in southern New England, they just can’t produce baby lobsters at the same rate our lobsters can and they have higher mortality, so fewer of them survive to reproduce,” he said. 
While a drop of 40% to 62% would return Maine to levels of lobster landings it saw before the boom, the decades after 2050 could spell disaster.
“If we don’t get carbon under control and we’re looking at three degrees [celsius] of warming by the end of the century, Maine starts to feel like best case Rhode Island and worst case New Jersey,” said Pershing. “And nobody is putting lobsters on license plates in New Jersey.”
Climate change is politically divisive in America, where the president has called it a hoax and said he did not believe his own government’s national climate assessment, which found that climate change could greatly damage the US economy. But in places like Stonington, a tiny lobster town in southern Maine on remote, wind-lashed Deer Isle, climate change is something one can see and feel.
“We can see the effects. We can see different species coming up in the traps,” said Genevieve McDonald, a Stonington lobsterman. “Climate change is real. If you work on the water you can see it. Data is real, science is real, temperature is real.”
McDonald was early in her lobstering career when the number of lobsters soared in the waters off Stonington.
“All of the sudden we had lobsters everywhere, places there were never lobsters before,” she said. “In every nook and cranny and crevice and type of bottom there were lobsters. It was awesome.”
It isn’t just the lobsters and the foreign species showing up off Stonington’s shores that make residents think of climate change. On Tuesday, storm surge saw cars and trucks navigating through seaweed and sea water on the narrow, low-lying causeway, the only road leading off Deer Isle.
In Stonington, lobsters are life. The town has pulled more lobster from the frigid waters than any other Maine port in recent years. Nearly everybody seems to work in the lobster industry or have a role supporting the fishermen. 
“We live in a lobstocracy,” says Carla Guenther, chief scientist at the Maine Center for Coastal Fisheries in Stonington. “It’s central to our politics, our social structure, everything.”
Losing the industry would be devastating. Previously, Stonington had other fisheries – such as for groundfish like cod, haddock and flounder. Ted Ames, a retired Stonington fisherman, saw all of those fisheries collapse over the decades, but when they did, fishermen always turned to something else to make a living. Today, lobsters are everything.
“If you’re stuck with one fishery, you’re good until it hiccups and then you’re out of business. This time around there isn’t any other option,” he said. 
Maine and its lobstermen have worked hard to conserve the lobster population and take pride in their efforts. The number of lobstering licenses is capped and the number of traps is restricted. Lobster licenses are only issued to owner-operators, meaning that there is no industrial lobstering. Small lobsters, big lobsters and egg-bearing females are all tossed back. Traps are equipped with a biodegradable ring that eventually disintegrates, allowing lobsters to escape and survive in case a trap is lost on the ocean’s floor.
But despite their conservation efforts, the fate of the fishery is probably out of the hands of lobstermen.
“There’s only so much our lobstermen can do,” said GMRIs Pershing. “If the rest of the world doesn’t get a handle on carbon, the coast of Maine is going to look really different in 2080.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/08/we-live-in-a-lobstocracy-maine-feeling-effects-of-climate-change-lobster-fishing

A week after a “frightening” fire ripped across their property in Finch Hatton, a small township in the subtropical region of Mackay, better known for its humid, rain-drenched summers, it’s obvious that things have changed.
“It has been unbelievably dry here … the last few years we’re just not getting the rain and then, when we do, it’s often associated with a cyclone.”
This year, early summer heat broke all-time records for Queensland. In Cairns, the tropical port city in the state’s far north, 1,600km (1,000 miles) north of Brisbane, the previous highest temperature in November was 37.2C, set in 1900. On Monday 26 November, the mercury hit 42.6C.
Bushfires are common in Australia but they mostly flare in the south-eastern states of New South Wales and Victoria, where summers can be hot and dry.
But Queensland, much of which is located in the tropics, joins other parts of the globe, such as California and Greece, where unusually hot and dry conditions have fuelled catastrophic fires which are forcing a rethink of what such regions can expect in the future.
But climate change is not only bringing searing heat. Two cyclones in as many years, including the destructive tropical cyclone Debbie in 2017, have left the region’s tropical rainforest exposed and unable to act as a natural firebreak.
Typically, rainforest should be able to self-protect during fire, with closed canopies that allow little sunlight to the forest floor and that keep the vegetation moist. But the cyclones have shredded the canopies, leaving an excess of fuel from debris on the ground, and a lack of rain meant the forest was dry.
Since 22 November, more than 1m hectares has been burnt across Queensland, much of which lies in the tropics. Since the beginning of its bushfire season in August, more than 3.6m hectares have been destroyed.
The most recent fires occurred on a magnitude never before seen in the state. Over a period of 12 days, the Queensland fire and emergency service said it had attended more than 1,200 fires, with help from crews from every state and territory in Australia.
Andrew Piccone, a nature campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation, who did his studies in rainforest ecology, said that Australia would have to consider the future impact of warming conditions on a range of plant, animal and insect species in the wet tropics.
“If catastrophic fire conditions are going to burn the rainforest in Queensland, what that means for the future of the wet tropics world heritage area could be quite concerning,” he said.
On the day the fires took off, Michelle Ready said there was a feeling in the air of “everything crisping up”.
For weeks, small fires had been burning in bushland around the property. She and her husband, Viv Dodt, had prepared by building fire breaks around the home. They were ready when the heatwave hit, taking temperatures to the mid-40sC and bringing with it high winds and low humidity of the kind rarely seen in an area known for its lush forests.
“The only heat that’s come anywhere near it that I’ve experienced was in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt,” Ready said. “The winds – it felt like opening a fan-forced oven. It was frightening.”
The property became surrounded to the south, west and north. Ready watched from the verandah as a fire took off down the mountain, followed by another.
“We’ve never seen anything like it,” she said.
Their early work fire-proofing saved the house. But eucalypt bushland at the back of the farm was lost and macadamias they had been experimenting with in pots before investing in farming them burnt and split from the heat.
The fires took in a region known as the Clarke Connors range and localities including Finch Hatton, Dalrymple Heights and Eungella, a township noted for the national park and subtropical rainforest that surrounds it.
Andy Houley is the rural fire inspector in Mackay and has been fighting fires for decades. He compared the fires to some of Queensland’s worst fire seasons in 1994 and 1972.
“Areas we traditionally rely on to stop fires progressing from one valley to another were not reliable,” he said.
He said 121,000ha around Eungella and Finch Hatton had been lost, including parts of the rainforest as well as dry bushland.
Parks and wildlife service workers will spend coming weeks doing detailed assessments to work out the precise level of damage.
Fortunately, popular tourist areas for local and overseas visitors, including the platypus viewing point in Eungella, appear to have remained relatively untouched.
Houley said rural communities were resilient, but as cyclones increased and weather got hotter and drier, they needed to look more closely at how to adapt to fire danger.
“We can do more planned burning to block areas from fire earlier in the year. We’ve got to focus on that now,” he said. “We can’t change the cyclones but we can certainly adapt.”
Philip Stewart, a fire ecologist with Queensland University’s school of earth and environmental sciences, agrees. He said governments and communities would need to become more proactive in fighting fires and that current processes were too reactive.
“We do need to look at firefighting in a different light,” Stewart said. “We are a fire-prone country and more people are moving into fire-prone areas. We need to have an understanding of the danger of that and look at fighting fire with fire.”
He pointed to traditional burning used by Indigenous communities as a model, where prescribed burning occurs on a larger scale than hazard-reduction burns, which focus on reducing fuel in specific areas.
Stewart said areas of rainforest impacted could take decades or even centuries to recover, adding that the next possible threat to those areas was mudslides as the wet season sets in.
“High-intensity fire tends to create a layer within the soil that is hydrophobic and therefore water repellent causing mass soil erosion,” he said.
“We are seeing this very phenomenon in the USA at Malibu where mass soil movement has taken place due to the heavy rains that followed the high-intensity and severe fires there.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/09/australias-rainforest-under-threat-as-bushfires-rage-in-the-tropics

The climate crisis is worsening much faster than previously predicted. Every single day 200 species are becoming extinct. This desperate situation can’t continue.
Political leaders worldwide are failing to address the environmental crisis. If global corporate capitalism continues to drive the international economy, global catastrophe is inevitable.
Complacency and inaction in Britain, the US, Australia, Brazil, across Africa and Asia – all illustrate diverse manifestations of political paralysis, abdicating humankind’s grave responsibility for planetary stewardship.
International political organisations and national governments must foreground the climate-emergency issue immediately, urgently drawing up comprehensive policies to address it. Conventionally privileged nations must voluntarily fund comprehensive environment-protection policies in impoverished nations, to compensate the latter for foregoing unsustainable economic growth, and paying recompense for the planet-plundering imperialism of materially privileged nations.
With extreme weather already hitting food production, we demand that governments act now to avoid any risk of hunger, with emergency investment in agro-ecological extreme-weather-resistant food production. We also call for an urgent summit on saving the Arctic icecap, to slow weather disruption of our harvests.
We further call on concerned global citizens to rise up and organise against current complacency in their particular contexts, including indigenous people’s rights advocacy, decolonisation and reparatory justice – so joining the global movement that’s now rebelling against extinction (eg Extinction Rebellion in the UK).
We must collectively do whatever’s necessary non-violently, to persuade politicians and business leaders to relinquish their complacency and denial. Their “business as usual” is no longer an option. Global citizens will no longer put up with this failure of our planetary duty.
Every one of us, especially in the materially privileged world, must commit to accepting the need to live more lightly, consume far less, and to not only uphold human rights but also our stewardship responsibilities to the planet.

Australia was the only country apart from the host represented at the event, entitled “US innovative technologies spur economic dynamism”, designed to “showcase ways to use fossil fuels as cleanly and efficiently as possible, as well as the use of emission-free nuclear energy”.
Its panel discussion was disrupted for several minutes by dozens of protesters who stood up suddenly during speeches, unfurling a banner reading “Keep it in the ground” while singing and chanting “Shame on you”.
Patrick Suckling, Australia’s ambassador for the environment, and the head of the country’s negotiating delegation at the climate talks, spoke on the panel. His nameplate bore a US flag.
“Actions speak loudly,” he said, “and as we’ve been hearing, the United States has been a powerhouse … in different approaches to energy security while seeking emissions reductions.
“Australia has a technology-neutral approach to emissions reduction. It’s important that we do so, we need to pull every lever to reduce emissions. We need to be open to innovation and new technologies providing multiple pathways for energy security and emissions reductions.”
Suckling said Australia would continue to invest in low-emissions innovations, including doubling its innovation investment by 2020. But he said carbon capture and storage – “a proven technology” – was important in any model for emissions reduction, and that the technology had broad applications across industries.
But Simon Bradshaw, Oxfam Australia’s climate change policy adviser, said it was “extremely disappointing” to see Australia line up behind the US in pushing a pro-coal ideas.
“It is a slap in the face of our Pacific island neighbours, for whom bringing an end to the fossil fuel era is matter of survival, and who are working with determination to catalyse stronger international efforts to confront the climate crisis. And it is firmly against the wishes of an overwhelming majority of Australians.”
Bradshaw said continuing to use coal was not only uneconomic, but would “be measured in more lives lost, entrenched poverty, rising global hunger, and more people displaced from their land and homes”.
He said the advice of the IPCC showed emphatically there was no space for new coal and that Australia’s position on coal was isolating it from the rest of the world.
The Climate Vulnerable Forum, a group of 48 countries most acutely affected by climate change, has committed to achieving 100% renewable energy production by the middle of the century at the latest. Other developed countries, including the UK, France, Canada and New Zealand, have committed to phasing out coal power by 2030.
Wells Griffith, a Trump administration adviser speaking alongside Suckling on the panel, said the US would continue extracting fossil fuels, and warned against “alarmism” about climate change.
“We strongly believe that no country should have to sacrifice their economic prosperity or energy security in pursuit of environmental sustainability,” he said.
But the panel’s premise – that fossil fuels can be made “clean” through innovation – stands at odds with the recommendations of climate scientists who argue that countries should transition to renewable energy sources as soon as possible or risk catastrophic levels of global warming by the end of the century.
Also at the UN climate talks in Poland, two new reports have cast Australia as a global laggard on addressing climate change.
The Climate Change Performance Index, compiled by the Climate Action Network, ranked Australia 55 out of 60 countries for its actions on climate change. The index ranks countries according to their climate policies, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.
Sweden and Morocco are the leading countries on the list, though no nation is clearly on a below-2 degrees pathway. India, ranked 11, and China, ranked 33, both improved their rankings significantly, having significantly increased their use of renewable energy. The US and Saudi Arabia are 59th and 60th respectively on the list.
“Australia is at the bottom of the class when it comes to climate policy performance,” said Richie Merzian, climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute. “After four years of rising emissions, and a relative absence of climate policy, it is no surprise.”
Merzian said the government was “openly and unapologetically defending the coal industry” despite overwhelming scientific consensus that rapid decarbonisation needed to occur worldwide.
Separately, the Climate Action Tracker has updated its assessment of Australia’s efforts, saying the country’s “climate policy has further deteriorated in the past year, as it focuses on propping up the coal industry and ditches efforts to reduce emissions”.
“The Australian government has turned its back on global climate action by dismissing the findings of the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C and announcing it would no longer provide funds to the Green Climate Fund,” the assessment said.
Emissions from fossil fuels and industry have been increasing by about 2% a year since 2014 in Australia. The assessment argues that Australia’s Paris agreement target was “insufficient” but Australia still won’t meet it.
“While the federal government continues to repeatedly state that Australia is on track to meet its 2030 target “in a canter” the Climate Action Tracker is not aware of any scientific basis, published by any analyst or government agency, to support this. ”

One concerns the future trading status of a small, rich country, and is marked by febrile debate, political histrionics and inflated egos. The other sees the rest of the world trying to control climate change.
The differences between the two shows could not be starker. The UN summit in Katowice, Poland, is a challenge for civilisation, for the benefit of the common good, an existential thriller for 7.5 billion people and all of nature which is being played out in relative calm. In contrast, in Westminster we are witnessing the culmination of a long-running political schism that is of much less consequence to the planet.
Major studies have in the past few weeks made it clearer than ever that we are facing, in David Attenborough’s words at the opening of the summit last week, “a manmade disaster of global scale … our greatest threat in thousands of years”.
First came a UN climate change special report, which showed how we may have only 12 or so years left for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which the risks of floods, drought and extreme heat will increase, and food shortages and poverty are likely for hundreds of millions of people. Then came a Global Carbon Budget study, which showed that, at current trends, the world is heading towards a catastrophic 3C of warming by 2100.
An unseen revolution is taking place: from denial and inaction just two decades ago, countries now dare to think big
To add gloom to the pessimism, some of the world’s biggest investors issued a stark warning to governments at the Katowice summit that failure to act urgently would result in financial catastrophe. And the UN’s World Meteorological Organization has provisionally confirmed that the past four years have been the hottest on record, and that extreme weather caused by manmade climate change now affects all continents.
Taken together, these reports show conclusively that we are on the edge of climate breakdown, and that governments are failing to prevent it. Factor in the dramatic but linked decline in biodiversity, and the potential for collapsed ecosystems and mass extinctions, and we can see we are at an existential crossroads, heading inexorably towards a fatally denuded Earth.
Some leaders, such as the US president, Donald Trump, and the incoming president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, say in wilful ignorance that all this science is wrong and that nothing needs to change – indeed forests must be felled and fossil fuels be further subsidised and promoted as “clean coal”. Others, such as the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, do not deny the science but coldly calculate how much they would lose and try to water down commitments.
In the middle at Katowice are the 10,000 government negotiators and NGOs trying to make rich countries reduce emissions and help poor countries adapt to inevitable climate change. But these UN climate talks depend on the consensus of all countries, so the progress appears incremental, even glacial. And because they do not involve adversarial politicians, they are considered unimportant by most of the world’s media.
Beyond Katowice, though, are many millions of people who expect their leaders to act in the interests of all, and who are increasingly dismayed that the global economic system threatens everyone’s future. We are now in a race against time to address climate change. We have started late, the signs are not good, and the gap between high-level rhetoric and action to reduce emissions is widening. Fury is now building against governments, with the Extinction Rebellion climate protest group taking non-violent direct action, which has spread to 35 countries in just a few weeks.
There are, however, lots of reasons to believe we can meet the challenge. This year, Trump’s decision to pull the world’s second-biggest carbon emitter out of the Paris agreement to cut emissions has backfired. Not only did US emissions fall in 2018, many US states, cities and businesses said they intended to fulfil their Paris obligations.
The transition to a less carbon-intensive energy system is also gathering pace. The share of renewables in meeting global energy demand is expected to grow by at least one-fifth in the next five years . By 2020 it should be cheaper to build new renewable energy plants in most countries than to keep coal or fossil fuels burning. Countries can already save money by retiring coal plants and substituting wind and solar. Soon only subsidies worth around £5tn a year will keep coal alive in many countries. Even more optimistically, the world’s largest developing countries are now in the forefront of the transition to lower emissions. India and China, with nearly a third of the world’s people, are at the forefront of the next solar revolution and, like Europe, are firmly on the path to decarbonisation.
An unseen revolution is taking place in the way we power the world. From denial and inaction just two decades ago, countries now dare to think big. China is to build a giant solar park in the Gobi desert big enough to power 1 million homes; a single project in India will be even larger, covering 10,000 acres of Rajasthan, and one in the desert near Aswan in Egypt should deliver as much power as two nuclear power stations.
The world is full now of major initiatives. Spurred by the commitments made at the Paris climate meeting in 2015, many countries, for example, are furiously planting trees; carbon capture and storage to take the emissions of fossil fuels is becoming a reality; millions of rice farmers have adopted the system of rice intensification which halves the water needed and reduces methane emissions from rice cultivation by up to 50%. These and many others are, so far, only incremental initiatives, coming far too slowly to even brake the warming. These are the seeds of change, lifting ambition, inspiring hope and showing the potential for change on a planetary scale. They also help politicians and bankers understand that getting to net zero emissions in just 40 years is technically and financially possible, and the best investment any country can ever make.
By the end of the week, Britain may have weathered another political storm and people may be able to see a little clearer what is happening. Perhaps then our politicians will lift their heads and turn to address the greatest challenge any generation is ever likely to face.
They will see that people are up for the challenge. If they then don’t respond with urgency, we are not just metaphorically in the soup, we may literally be cooked.

This Antarctic region stores a vast amount of ice, which, if lost, would in the long-term raise global sea level by tens of metres and drown coastal settlements around the world.
Freezing temperatures meant the East Antarctica region was until recently considered largely stable but the research indicates that the area is being affected by climate change.
The vast Totten glacier was known to be retreating but the new analysis shows that nearby glaciers in the East Antarctica area are also losing ice.
To the east of Totten, in Vincennes Bay, the height of the glaciers has fallen by about three metres in total since 2008, before which no loss had been recorded.
To the west of Totten, in Wilkes Land, the rate of height loss has doubled since 2009, with glaciers losing height by about two and a half metres to date.
The data comes from detailed maps of ice movement speed and height created by Nasa from satellite information.
Alex Gardner, a glaciologist at Nasa’s jet propulsion laboratory in Pasadena, California, said: “The change doesn’t seem random, it looks systematic. That hints at underlying ocean influences that have been incredibly strong in West Antarctica. Now we might be finding clear links of the ocean starting to influence East Antarctica.”
Ice in West Antarctica is already in serious retreat, with scientists reporting a threefold acceleration in recent years, meaning it is vanishing faster than at any previously recorded time.
In April, researchers found that hidden melting beneath the ocean surface was also increasing, putting Antarctica on track to overtake Greenland as the biggest contributor to sea-level rise.
Without big cuts in carbon emissions, the melting will continue for thousands of years.
Catherine Walker, at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Centre, in Maryland, used ocean temperature measurements from seals who had been tagged with sensors, as well as computer modelling, to show that the heat delivered to the glaciers in Wilkes Land and Vincennes Bay had increased. Changes in winds and the extent of sea ice are thought to have altered currents.
East Antarctica is extremely remote and relatively little studied. What happens to the glaciers will depend on how exposed to warmer water they are, and that depends on the shape of the land beneath them and the sea bed ahead of them.
“Heightened attention needs to be given to these glaciers,” said Gardner. “We need to better map the topography and the bathymetry. Only then can we be more conclusive in determining whether these glaciers will enter a phase of rapid retreat or stabilise.”
The discovery could mean much higher sea level rises than anticipated, said Chris Fogwill, a professor at Keele University in England, who was not part of the Nasa research.
“The finding has very serious repercussions for climate change and particularly sea-level rise. It has the potential to mean that our sea-level projections could be [in] an order of magnitude higher than we’re anticipating.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/11/east-antarctica-glacial-stronghold-melting-amid-climate-change

For Oswald, the moment of realisation came in 2011.
The 68-year-old lives in the house he was born in and farms 2,500 acres with his son, some of it settled by his great-great-grandfather. The land sits where the Missouri river valley is about four miles wide.
Growing up, Oswald heard tales of a great flood in 1952 which prompted the army to construct levees.
“The next flood wasn’t for another 40 years, in 1993. Heavy rains day after day after day after day until the runoff water and the rain just overpowered the river and the levees,” said Oswald. “Both the ’52 and ’93 floods lasted three weeks. They were abnormal.”
Then came the big Missouri river flood in 2011.
“Heavy rains and heavy snow in the Dakotas and Montana created a huge amount of water. That flood lasted here almost four months. More rain than anybody really ever has any memory of coming down the river,” he said.
Oswald’s farm was underwater for much of that time and the corn lost. Missouri declared a state of emergency. Crops were ruined or never planted. Grain prices surged.
The flooding was memorable in its own right but Oswald also sees it as marking a shift in weather patterns which has forced him to farm differently.
“When I was a kid, my dad would say an inch of rain was a good rain. That’s just what we needed. Now we get four inches, five inches, six inches in one sustained wet spell that lasts two or three days. I don’t ever remember that as a boy. I’ve never seen the sustained wetness in the land that we have now. Even though the river hasn’t gone on the land it’s raised the water table so that the rains that we’ve had this fall, which have been unusually heavy, make it muddy. Continually muddy,” he said.
On 23 November, the National Climate Assessment warned of “substantial damages” across the US in the coming years from increasing wildfires in the west to flooding in the east. But the sharpest rise in temperatures will be between the coasts as the midwest endures longer and hotter summers, heavier rains and droughts that collectively are predicted to significantly reduce US agricultural production.
“Expected increases in challenges to livestock health, declines in crop yields and quality, and changes in extreme events in the United States and abroad threaten rural livelihoods, sustainable food security, and price stability,” said the 1,600-page report, the work of 13 federal agencies.
Climate change is likely to make it harder to grow crops, and to make those that do grow more vulnerable to diseases and pests because of rising humidity. The report said heat and diminishing air quality will take its toll on livestock. Farmers will collectively have to spend billions of dollars to adapt. The effects are already seen from prolonged drought in Kansas and torrential rains in Iowa.
Before the flood in 2011, Oswald, a Missouri river valley crop farmer, was skeptical about the warnings that rising temperatures heralded a more difficult future. Since then, the routines of planting and harvesting that his family has pursued on the same land for five generations have given way to a haphazard cycle governed by waves of extreme heat and intense rains.
“The changes have become more radical. The way the rains come down and the temperatures. You’re constantly trying to manage it,” said Oswald, a former president of the Missouri Farmers Union. “There’s so much unknown about the weather now that it’s pretty hard to do much about it.”
As his son, Brandon, works a combine harvester up and down a field, Oswald kicks the soil with his foot.
“If you look at this, it’s pretty dry right on top but not too far down it’s mud. Two weeks ago there was water standing here from all the rain and the inability of the soil to absorb that much moisture because the level of the river was such that the water level was pretty close to the top of the ground here,” he said.
That mud makes it difficult to plant and to harvest. The rains narrow the number of days when Oswald can get a crop in the ground. If it forces him to delay planting the corn, that means the soybeans will go in late. Worst of all, Oswald said, is that it is all so unpredictable. Where planting was typically spread over the same few days in spring and summer every year, now it can vary by weeks.
Gene Takle, one of the authors of the climate change report and director of the climate science programme at Iowa State University, traces the sharply increased rainfalls to rising temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico. He said that for centuries, the gulf’s waters have been carried as moisture into the midwest and delivered consistent rainfalls that made the region America’s breadbasket.
But as temperatures have risen so has the amount of moisture in a dome of vapour over the Gulf of Mexico. Takle said that at the same time climate change has moved a pressure centre in the Atlantic, known as the Bermuda high, westwards and closer to a band of low pressure over the Rocky mountains creating higher windspeeds across parts of the midwest. That, in turn, has intensified the flow of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
The result is heavier rains dumping huge amounts of water on to fields, alongside rising temperatures.
“Humidity is the the key, the smoking gun, for the increase in our rainfall,” said Takle, a professor of agronomy and of geological and atmospheric sciences.
Takle said that heavy rains in 2013 forced farmers in north-western Iowa to abandon planting altogether on more than 700,000 acres, more than 10% of the state’s land. That came a year after Iowa was hit by widespread drought that also hit the crop harvest.
Some farmers are installing drainage systems to cope with the higher rainfalls, a sign that they know climate change is here to stay. Others are buying expensive new equipment that allows them to plant more seeds in the narrowing windows between rains.
Takle, who grew up on a farm and whose brother still farms in Iowa, said the intense rains have a long-term impact, too. Scientists calculate that dry soil is unable to absorb the water from a rainfall of more than about 1.25in over 24 hours. After that the water starts to erode the soil.
“You start to get excess water moving down slope surfaces and carrying with it any nutrients and nitrogen and phosphates or soil particles,” he said. “We’re getting more of the soil erosion promoting rainfalls. Farmers are using cover crops in the spring period to have some some residual vegetation on the surface to protect it from these extreme events.”
Standing amid his soybeans, Oswald nods north toward the hills on the edge of the valley.
“We farm some upland fields up over that hill a couple of miles,” he said. “They’re rolling hills and they’re terraced. They have structures on them to help control the runoff of the water. But when you have those big rains, none of the terraces or the dams can keep up with that as well as they should. So you have more erosion.”
The size of harvests is already falling. This year, heavy rains have hit soya bean crops, delaying planting or washing out the plants in parts of the midwest, including Iowa.
Alongside the rains are increasing temperatures.
“This year we saw 100-degree temperatures in May which is very unusual,” said Oswald. “I don’t ever remember that in my lifetime or even heard about it. That’s a first ever.”
The Missouri Climate Center recorded that temperatures were above average throughout the spring and summer this year, with September on average 3F warmer than during the 20th century
In the short term, higher temperatures have had some benefit because in parts of the region they extended the growing season and contributed to bigger harvests.
“In the midwest we have about nine days more now than we did 50 years ago,” said Takle. “Part of the increase in yields that we’ve been experiencing over the last 20 or 30 years definitely has been due to the earlier planting and the longer growing season.”
But Takle said those benefits are being lost, and will be reversed in the coming years, as rising temperatures combine with the heavy rains to make growing ever more difficult. He said corn is vulnerable to high temperatures during pollination.
A decade ago, Oswald was on the fence about climate change.
“At a certain point you just have to look at what’s going on in your own world and try to decide what you think the impacts of that are,” he said.
As Oswald’s thinking changed, so did his determination to persuade others of the reality of climate change. As president of the Missouri Farmers union, he had some success in getting a discussion going among its members. But he said climate change is politically charged among farmers in part because some see it as a stick to beat them over their practices.
“One of the problems farmers have is when we start talking about environment, a lot of times Sierra Club comes to mind and Sierra Club is pretty radical in their approach. When you have a group that says cows are the problem, you need to get rid of all the cows, and raising corn is a problem, we need to get rid of all the corn, then you’re not going to have a lot of farmers who want to join in and follow you,” he said.
Still, Oswald believes that denial is in retreat. Where farmers, including him, were once skeptical they now see the change with their own eyes. The problem is what to do about it.
“A lot of them will say there’s nothing we can do about it so we might as well not worry because we can’t have an impact, we just have to live with it,” he said.
But he said as climate change bites, farmers are increasingly accepting of the science as they are forced to spend more money on equipment and seeds to maintain current crop yields.
“It’s become almost an annual assault on their ability to produce good crops. So they are now starting to ask questions and I think are listening a little more to what the scientists are saying about the potential future.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/12/as-climate-change-bites-in-americas-midwest-farmers-are-desperate-to-ring-the-alarm

In Paris in 2015 Australia was a part of a bloc of countries called the “High Ambition Coalition”, which includes the UK, the EU, New Zealand, the Marshall Islands and Fiji. Australia is outside that bloc now.
On Wednesday, 27 countries and the EU in the High Ambition Coalition called for significantly increased targets for carbon emissions reductions by 2030, in response to a dramatic 1.5C warming report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that has dominated negotiations in Poland this week.
“We call on other governments … to join us in striving to step up ambition by 2020 in response to the special report on 1.5C,” it said.
The environment minister, Melissa Price, gave Australia’s formal address to the UN climate talks on Wednesday, saying Australia would “meet and beat” its 2020 Kyoto protocol target and was on track to achieve its Paris goal.
“We are confident that we will meet our 2030 target, which represents a halving of emissions per person,” she said.
“Around the world, countries are laying the foundation for a low-emissions global economy – Australia is no different. We have policies to align strong economic growth with emissions reduction. We are moving towards a new energy future, while ensuring energy remains affordable and reliable.”
But Price’s speech was silent on commitments beyond Australia’s current 26% to 28% Paris pledge for 2030, despite significant pressure from its former coalition partners to lift its target. The Paris agreement was struck with a commitment built in that countries would regularly review and increase their targets.
Her speech did not mention the government’s nascent policy to underwrite power generation with taxpayer money, including of new and existing coal plants.
Also absent was mention of the IPCC’s 1.5C warming report, recognition of which has become the rallying cry for countries urging greater carbon cuts.
The Paris agreement targets, if met, put the world on a 1.5 to 2C warming path, but the 1.5C report warned that the upper end of that range would significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people.
The UN climate talks in Katowice, Poland, have hit a significant impasse, with fierce disagreement over the text for a global “rulebook” to implement the 2015 Paris agreement.
Progress has been slow on several key issues, and divisions have emerged between four fossil fuel powers – the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait – and the rest of the world. Australia is seen as closely allied to the US, having appeared at a US-government pro-fossil fuel event this week.
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, flew back to the talks in Katowice on Wednesday, telling delegates: “We are running out of time. To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal.”
Price, who has kept a low profile during the conference, told delegates the Paris agreement was demonstration of how the international community could work together to address climate change.
“Australia believes that effective international action requires a clear understanding of what countries are committing to, and whether those commitments can be met,” she said. “Paris is premised on parties working together, collectively and transparently …
“Australia calls on all parties to work together to secure a comprehensive, robust, rulebook. Common rules, will lead to action to achieve our shared goals.”
Price said Australia’s natural resources would provide “the low-emissions fuels of the future”.
“Our liquefied natural gas exports could save importing countries around 130m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year.”
Price did not comment on whether Australia would use carryover carbon credits from the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods to meet its Paris targets, but it appears almost certain to use the controversial practice.
Using carryover credits – which would allow Australia to claim surplus carbon credits banked during the Kyoto period, largely through land use changes – has been derided as “fake action” by climate analysts, and criticised by countries such as New Zealand.
Australia’s address to the climate talks was criticised by observers and analysts in Katowice.
The Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, Richie Merzian, said the only things Australia had brought to the UN climate talks were rising emissions and fossil fuel exports.
“To demonstrate Australia’s climate credentials, minister Price’s speech relied almost entirely on policies her government tried to kill off or water down,” Merzian said.
“It was rich of minister Price to rehash [former prime minister Malcolm] Turnbull’s $1bn climate finance pledge, after prime minister Morrison trashed and cut support for UN’s key climate finance body, the Green Climate Fund.”
Simon Bradshaw, Oxfam Australia’s climate change policy adviser, said Australia’s statement would undermine the Pacific’s confidence that it was serious about addressing climate change.
“Australia cannot hide the fact that our emissions are rising and that our addiction to coal is undermining our region’s future,” he said.
“In September, Australia joined other members of the Pacific Islands Forum in reaffirming that climate change is the single biggest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific. Yet our actions fly in the face of that reality.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/13/australia-turns-back-on-allies-as-it-refuses-to-cut-emissions-above-paris-pledge

The Australian Conservation Foundation, GetUp, Greenpeace, Environment Victoria, the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, the Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility and the Australia Institute wrote on Thursday to chief executives of the major lenders, warning the provision of finance for new coal, or retrofits of old coal-fired power stations, would be inconsistent with their public commitments to the Paris agreement.
The pressure on financial institutions follows the energy minister, Angus Taylor, calling for expressions of interest in new power generation projects to be underwritten by taxpayers, including, potentially, new coal builds or retrofits.
The government has made it clear that the new projects must be coal, gas, batteries or pumped hydro to be eligible for the government underwriting. A very tight timeframe is also proposed, with proponents having to put their hands up by January 23.
The environmental groups have told the banks the evidence is in on climate change, and an urgent response is required to combat the risks.
The groups have told the banking chiefs they risk providing finance for stranded assets if they finance new coal projects. “We strongly believe that the provision of finance from your financial institution for any new coal generation project or any retrofit to extend the life of an existing coal generator, would be inconsistent with your public position on climate change, counter to the concerns of your customers, and unmindful of the high risk of any new coal investment resulting in a stranded asset.”
The Investor Group on Climate Change – an organisation representing more than 70 Australian and New Zealand institutional investors with more than $2 trillion of funds under management – has raised similar concerns with Taylor.
The IGCC has told the energy minister subsidising high-emission electricity generation is inconsistent with the objectives of the Paris agreement and exposes the assets to substantive carbon price and transition risks.
“For around a decade, investors and banks have been expressing no appetite for exposure to new coal fired generation assets in Australia and investors are unlikely to provide any capital towards new high emission generation assets moving forward,” the IGCC’s letter to Taylor says.
“Institutional investors would strongly oppose any policy that indemnifies new generation from current and future carbon risk”.
The IGCC also advises the government not to set itself up as the “central planner of generator investment”. It says if the government pursues policies that “effectively nationalise part of the electricity market at short notice” there will be significant impacts on investor confidence and market efficacy.
While progressive groups have moved into overdrive at confirmation that coal is in the mix, the lobby group representing Australia’s resources giants has welcomed the government’s move.
Tania Constable, the chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia, said on Thursday the immediate focus of the underwriting program should be ensuring that investors are able to replace Liddell power station’s capacity “with a technology mix that will maintain reliability and security at the lowest sustainable cost”.
Government conservatives are focused on Liddell, and have wanted Taylor to use his much vaunted “big stick” divestiture powers to extract the ageing power plant from AGL, its current owner. AGL plans to retire the plant and replace it with a mix of gas and renewables.
But the “big stick” legislation cannot be passed before budget week next year, and it appears to lack the necessary support to clear the Senate.
Labor and the Greens are opposed to any taxpayer support for coal projects, and will continue efforts once parliament resumes next year to try to frustrate the Coalition’s program, potentially by attempting to amend the divestiture bill, which stalled in the final sitting week, to include a prohibition on power companies receiving commonwealth support.
The MCA said any contracts agreed under the underwriting program needed to be honoured by a future government.
The government’s policy document suggests phase one of the underwriting program is anticipated to commence in the first quarter of 2019 – which puts some of the decision making pre-election in the event the government goes to the polls in April.
Labor has attempted to warn market participants it does not support taxpayer support for coal projects, but has a policy at the federal level of honouring contracts.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/13/banks-urged-not-to-fund-coal-power-as-government-moves-to-underwrite-projects

The call from 15 small Pacific island states came one day after the Australian government called for expressions of interest in new power generation projects, indicating it would be prepared to use taxpayer money to underwrite new coal plants.
Leaders warned Australia’s relations in the Pacific were being eroded by a perceived intransigence in Canberra over coalmining.
As the COP24 UN climate talks in Poland remained stalled over an unwillingness from major emitters to commit to further carbon emissions cuts, frustrated Pacific states, traditional allies of Australia, said the world must abandon coal-powered energy generation.
The Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, the outgoing president of COP23, said: “We call on all OECD countries to quickly phase out their use of coal by 2030 and for all other countries to phase out their use of coal by 2040. There must be no expansion of existing coal mines or the creation of new mines.”
Australia and the US have both this week said publicly they have no plans to begin phasing out coal-generated power.
“The United States has an abundance of natural resources and is not going to keep them in the ground,” Donald Trump’s international energy and climate adviser, Wells Griffith, told a US-government-run panel discussion on fossil fuels at the UN climate talks.
Australia’s ambassador for the environment, Patrick Suckling, told the same panel: “Fossil fuels are projected to be a major source of energy for a significant time to come.”
Asked whether the Pacific declaration on abandoning coal was directed specifically at Australia and the US, Bainimarama was curt but diplomatic: “We request that everybody increases their ambition – that goes for everyone, all countries.”
The prime minister of the Cook Islands, Henry Puna, told the Guardian the phase-out of coal was critical to the survival of Pacific island states.
“We have made that call,” he said. “It is not directed at any one country, but it applies to all. We know that coal power plants are a significant cause of the climate change we see affecting the whole world.”
The Tuvalu prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, cited the Boe Declaration, which Australia signed in Nauru in September, stating that climate change was the single greatest threat to the security and wellbeing of Pacific peoples.
“It is unfortunate that we are hearing that Australia might continue to go on coalmining, opening up new mines, [such as] the Adani project [for the Carmichael mine in Queensland],” Sopoaga said.
“I was in Canberra last week. I spoke to PM Scott Morrison, and the understanding I got from him was that, yes, they are seriously looking into coal efficiency … and also relooking at the proposal for the Adani project. I said, ‘Prime minister, our partnership onwards, bilateral or regional, in this period of the Boe Declaration, will be centrally influenced by coalmining in Australia and I hope you set a pathway to move away from coalmining and focusing on renewable energy’.”
Sopoaga told the Guardian he proposed an annual high-level meeting between Australia and Pacific partners, specifically focused on countering climate change in the region.
Bill Hare, director of climate analytics and former Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report lead author, said the Pacific states were right to be concerned about coal.
“Their call for an end to coal by 2030 – including new mines – is highly relevant to Australia – their regional neighbour,” Hare said. “The timing is important, just as the government announces plans to underwrite a new coal-fired power station. I hope Australians will listen, even if their government won’t.”
The Pacific island states also called for the establishment of an international protection regime to protect people displaced by climate change.
While Australia has publicly positioned itself with the United States, representatives from several countries say it has played a constructive role inside the negotiating rooms at the climate talks, where the “rule book” for the implementation of the 2015 Paris agreement is being hammered out.
The environment minister, Melissa Price, met the UN secretary general, António Guterres, after the secretary general flew back to Poland, concerned the talks had reached an impasse.
A spokesman for the minister said, as a courtesy, she would not be discussing details of her meetings at the COP.
Price told the Guardian: “Australia takes a technology-neutral approach to our electricity generation. We are focused on reducing emissions through a range of technologies while maintaining the stability and reliability of our grid and keeping electricity prices down.”
But Australia’s schism with the Pacific islands over climate change is a diplomatic discomfort. As China has rapidly increased its involvement and influence across the Pacific through massive infrastructure projects and loans, Australia has sought to buttress its position as the regional hegemon, with a new commitment of $2bn for infrastructure.
But its perceived political intransigence on climate, particular its commitment to maintaining, and even expanding, coal power generation, is alienating it from Pacific neighbours – historic allies, many of which are low-lying atoll nations experiencing the effects of climate change most acutely.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/14/pacific-nations-under-climate-threat-urge-australia-to-abandon-coal-within-12-years

Every time I cornered a fly, I pictured goo marks left on the wall – spots splayed with tiny black guts and twisted legs. My halfhearted swats gave even the most sluggish fly time to escape.
That I genuinely couldn’t hurt a fly might have been something I picked up in church. I grew up attending a Mennonite congregation in Indiana. We weren’t the bonnet-wearing, buggy-riding sort, but we embraced some traditions, like the Anabaptist teaching of nonviolence. This sometimes expressed itself in an instinct for conflict avoidance.
So I was surprised when violence crept into my speech three years ago when I started working as a journalist covering climate change. Some ancient spirit took hold of me, and I found myself deploying the narrative of war. Carbon tax proposals were “battles” to be fought. Greenhouse gas emissions had to be “slashed”. “Eco-warriors” and “climate hawks” were leading the charge.
Coming from a pacifist background, and obsessed with linguistics, I’ve grown uneasy with the way war shapes our words
I’d adopted the language of the climate movement’s leaders. The only way to overcome climate change inaction, the environmentalist Bill McKibben once wrote, “is to adopt a wartime mentality, rewriting the old mindset that stands in the way of victory”. Hillary Clinton reportedly wanted to equip the White House with “a situation room just for climate change”. Other activists are calling for mobilization against global warming on the scale of the second world war.
The whole “fighting climate change” frame rests on the assumption that opposition is the best way to get things done. But that’s not always the case, as the linguist Deborah Tannen wrote in The Argument Culture: Stopping America’s War of Words in 1998. Military and sports metaphors train us to see everything in terms of conflict – this side versus that side – and that perspective limits our collective imagination about what we can do to fix complex problems.
Coming from a pacifist background, and obsessed with linguistics, I’ve grown uneasy with the way war shapes our words. The thought struck me earlier this year: by pitting one group against another, do war metaphors undermine our ability to address the complex problem of climate change, the biggest global crisis we face? Are there other ways to frame our predicament and convey the sense of urgency that’s needed – without dividing us?
My gut feeling was that talking about climate change as a battle between rivals would ensure our ultimate defeat. But the reality might be more complicated.
War narratives are everywhere, so prevalent that they usually pass unnoticed. Politicians and the media have declared wars on poverty, drugs, obesity, and terror. These wars were declared against concepts, trends, and tricky issues with no simple solutions. And none of them have been won.
Reading Tannen’s book, I saw these metaphors in a new light. There’s a “pervasive warlike culture” in the US that leads us to approach just about any major issue as if it were “a battle or game in which winning or losing is the main concern”, she wrote. That tendency has shaped politics, education, law, and the media.
Hostility is definitely in fashion. Anger spreads faster across social media networks than any other emotion, as studies have shown (and anyone who’s spent more than one minute on Twitter can attest). Cable news has devolved into shouting matches. “Americans on both the left and the right now view their political opponents not as fellow Americans with differing views, but as enemies to be vanquished,” wrote Amy Chua and Jed Rubenfeld in a recent Atlantic essay.
Here’s the important thing about this war on climate change: we’re losing it. Scientists have sounded the alarm bells for 40 years; the window to address the problem is shrinking; drastic action on greenhouse gas emissions keeps … not happening. The future of humanity is at stake. 
 It’s an aggressive moral appeal, explicitly trying to arouse an emotional reaction and a commensurate commitment. The enemy is coming. Are you with us?
I get that this war message works for some people. In a study published in the journal Environmental Communication last year, participants read one of three articles about the effort to reduce carbon emissions, which was framed as either a “war”, a “race”, or an “issue”. Those who read the war version perceived the most “urgency and risk” and expressed “greater willingness to increase conservation behavior”.
That’s the spirit behind the Climate Mobilization, a group that invokes the war mentality in the service of climate action. The organization’s director, Margaret Klein Salamon, takes inspiration from the history of the second world war.
Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the US had overhauled its economy and society for the war effort. Government spending soared from 30% of the economy in 1941 to 79% at the peak of the war in 1944. With a shared sense of national purpose, people made sacrifices for the common good. They planted victory gardens, bought war bonds, and rallied to produce the tanks, planes, and machine guns needed to fight a global war.
Klein Salamon said climate change was such an enormous threat to the planet that it demanded similar sacrifices. “That’s really the challenge we face now,” she told me. “Can we achieve the mentality we had as a species that we had [achieved] only exclusively during wartime?”
Her organization has had some success. Cities in California, New Jersey, and Maryland have declared a “climate emergency” and committed to an all-hands-on-deck, wartime-like response. Oakland aims to “reach zero net emissions at emergency speed”. 
But what about places where people aren’t deeply concerned about climate change?
A full 30% still don’t think it’s a thing, despite the overwhelming scientific consensus behind it. And Americans who accept the obvious generally prefer to avoid the subject. Is war rhetoric the right way to bring a divided nation together?
My sister once got into a heated argument with my uncle about the Iraq war in 2003. Pacifism is a core Anabaptist belief, my sister argued, so how could you be a Mennonite and support a war? She vividly remembers him saying, “If you don’t believe in good and evil, well, I’ve seen the other side …” in reference to a near-death experience. That may have been the point when we stopped talking politics with the extended family. It felt like arguing would only make family get-togethers more awkward while accomplishing nothing.
The good news is that there’s a way to break through seemingly intractable disputes
Psychologists call this sort of fruitless argument an “intractable conflict”. An us-versus-them narrative turns people away from logic and into the realm of emotion and values. As the conflict drags on without resolution, partisans become increasingly bewildered by the other side’s beliefs and actions.
A recent study showed how two-sided narratives drive public opinion on climate change. Psychologists from the University of California at Santa Barbara and the University of Colorado at Boulder found that most Republicans believed climate change was real, but didn’t support policies to address the problem simply because they thought Democrats did. Climate change, in other words, has been packaged together with issues such as immigration and gun control, and positions have turned into symbols of opposing sides. Why? “The study suggested that the discrepancies were likely the result of a media landscape that emphasized conflict,” Newsweek reported.
So all those headlines I’d been writing about pipeline fights and carbon tax battles could have been making things worse. Labeling people “climate hawks” or “deniers” only reinforced divisions. I wondered whether the act of picking an enemy – even an abstract one, like climate change – inevitably made enemies of other people.
In the search for an opponent, climate activists have landed on several suspects: climate deniers. Reluctant politicians. Capitalism. The blame points in every direction. 
It reminds me of something I noticed in high school, listening to my classmates yell insults at rival teams during football games.While they called it “school spirit”, I deemed it “zip-code loyalty”: we had been pitted against one another by outside forces, and we really weren’t different from the supposed “enemy”. 
The good news is that there’s a way to break through seemingly intractable disputes. As the journalist Amanda Ripley wrote, the key is not to avoid conflict, but to complicate it.
Ripley pointed to a study hatched at the Difficult Conversations Laboratory at Columbia University, where researchers sat down people who disagreed with each other in a windowless room, then recorded their uncomfortable exchanges. Participants with opposing views on abortion, gun control, or other hot-button issues were paired together and asked to write a joint statement on the subject in 20 minutes.
“Over time,” Ripley wrote, “the researchers noticed a key difference between the terrible and non-terrible conversations: the better conversations looked like a constellation of feelings and points, rather than a tug of war.”
What the participants read before the conversation made a difference. Some were handed an article that presented only two sides to a polarizing argument. Others read a more nuanced version that focused on the complexity of the debate and considered several points of view. Surprise, surprise: people who read the more complex story beforehand were more likely to come up with better ideas for their joint statement and leave more satisfied with the experience.
Hundreds of other studies have shown that the best way to get people to stop demonizing each other is to introduce them to the actual human beings they disagree with. A few months ago, I happened to meet a retired Chevron executive. Considering how often I write about politics and the evils of oil money, our conversation could have gone very badly. It didn’t. I mentioned my work as an environmental journalist, but we mostly talked about food, travel, and family. 
In a similar vein, labor and environmental groups that often squabbled over issues in the past have come together to start talking climate policy. At the Colorado Climate, Jobs, and Justice Summit this fall, union members who work in the fossil fuel industry shared their perspectives on taking care of communities who depend on the industry.
“For many in the environmental community, it was the first time they had heard those stories,” wrote Dennis Dougherty, executive director of the Colorado AFL-CIO, in a column in the Denver Post. “And in turn, it was the first time many workers got to interact face-to-face with folks from the environmental movement and learn how diverse and compassionate its members could be.”
As for getting rid of war metaphors themselves, well, it’s not easy. “I don’t know if it’s possible to express the kind of action that’s needed in peaceful terms,” Bhikkhu Bodhi, a Buddhist monk and climate advocate, told me.
It’s certainly going to require some imagination. Perhaps Earth is running a fever, and we need some wind-turbine ibuprofen to bring down the heat. Or maybe it’s a sinking boat, and instead of scooping water out, our crew needs to patch the hole where it’s rushing in. 
Whatever you choose, I’m putting down my metaphorical weapons and fighting for … no, adopting more peaceful metaphors. And instead of turning differences into fights, I could frame the climate discussion in positive terms – discussing how a shift to renewable energy creates jobs, for example.
Charles Eisenstein, author of Climate: A New Story, agreed that framing an important problem like climate change as a fight stokes partisanship. 
“There is a time and a place for resolving problems by fighting,” he told me, “but it’s kind of taken over everything.”

In a letter published in the Guardian, the new civil disobedience group Extinction Rebellion (XR) says the BBC, “as a respected media voice in the UK, needs to play a key role in enabling the transformative change needed”.
The group came to prominence last month when it organised the largest civil disobedience protest seen in the UK for decades, culminating in the occupation and closure of five bridges in central London. Since then it has grown rapidly and XR branches have sprung up in more than 35 countries.
In the letter, a version of which will be delivered to the BBC on Monday, campaigners request a meeting with the director general, Tony Hall, to “discuss how the corporation can tell the full truth on the climate and ecological emergency”.
They also call on the BBC to make the crisis its “editorial and corporate priority by adoption of a climate emergency strategic plan, at the level of urgency placed on informing the public about the second world war”.
The group, which launched at the end of October with a blockade of Parliament Square in London, said it would hold a peaceful demonstration outside the BBC on Friday.
The rapid spread of XR comes as frustration rises with policymakers who are failing to slow perilous levels of global warming and biodiversity loss. There have been a flurry of reports on the scale of the climate crisis , including one from the UN which said there were only 12 years left to limit some of the most devastating impacts.
During UN climate talks in Poland this month, David Attenborough said that unless action was taken “the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon”.
Several cities in the UK, including London, have now declared a climate emergency.
XR is calling on the government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and establish a “citizens assembly” to devise an emergency plan of action, similar to that seen during the second world war.
During a second wave of civil disobedience this weekend, thousands of people staged peaceful direct action protests in towns and cities around the UK.
The latest XR group to set up internationally was in New York, where activists announced plans at their first meeting this weekend for a US national day of action on 26 January. The group is planning an international week of rebellion in April.
This month 100 prominent figures including the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and the authors Philip Pullman and Naomi Klein backed XR, calling for people around the world to rise up and organise against political leaders’ “paralysis”.
“We must collectively do whatever’s necessary non-violently, to persuade politicians and business leaders to relinquish their complacency and denial,” their open letter stated.

The world’s biggest international oil company has been investigated in the US over allegations that it knew about the dangers of global warming for decades but deceived the public over the risks, a charge the firm has rejected.
EU politicians will now turn their attention to the role the company has played in Europe, where it has a sizeable presence from the huge Groningen gas field in the Netherlands to oil and gas fields in the North Sea.
MEPs on the environment, public health and food safety committee will quiz a series of speakers on misinformation campaigns on climate change, which could include representatives of the company.
The hearing on 21 March, jointly held by the petitions committee, comes after a petition by fossil fuel campaigners calling for a closer look at the information the company “wants to withhold from us now”.
“ExxonMobil has misled the public on climate change for over 40 years. Now it’s time to correct the record and hold them accountable,” said Wenonah Hauter, the executive director of Food &amp; Water Europe, which organised the petition.
She called on the the new US Congress to follow the European parliament’s lead.
“The weak outcome of the climate negotiations in Poland show that we can’t wait – leaders everywhere must take climate denial and climate action seriously,” she said, in reference to the UN climate talks which concluded on Saturday.
The group would like to see lobbyists for the company barred from Brussels because of the firm’s alleged past behaviour.
Molly Scott Cato, the Green MEP for South West England and Gibraltar, agreed that lobbying of EU institutions by companies that had been linked to climate denial should not be permitted.
She said: “Exxon has a shameful history of funding climate change denial – paying for fake science and dangerous lies that have prevented us from taking timely action on climate change and forcing the world into the current climate crisis.”
An ExxonMobil spokesperson said: “We unequivocally reject allegations that ExxonMobil suppressed climate change research contained in media reports that are inaccurate distortions of ExxonMobil’s nearly 40-year history of climate research. We understand that climate risks are real.”
In recent years the company has softened its stance on climate change, urging the US to stay in the Paris climate agreement and agreeing to join an industry alliance on climate change.
The company has recently been targeted by shareholders calling on it to set carbon targets at ExxonMobil’s AGM next year.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/17/meps-to-scrutinise-exxonmobil-alleged-role-in-climate-change-misinformation

Let me quote:
Back at the lab, he discovered that the soil contained bits of a naturally-occuring mold called Tolypocladium inflatum. The species, it turned out, is the asexual form of a known fungus called Cordyceps subsessilis. In its sexual state, C. subsessilis is a parasite that takes over the muscles of scarab beetles, and doesn’t have much value for human health. In its assexual state, however, T. inflatum produces a group of compounds called cyclopeptides that Borel discovered, through tests on lab mice, seemed to suppress the exact immune cells involved in organ-transplantation rejection.

The little fellow lived for an eterinity (in human time-frames) up in the harsh conditions of the permafrost of glaciated terrain in Norway.

That AGW kill polar bears is not the problem - polar beers are just sexed up brown-bears in this context. That AGW can eradicate them small buddies with a history of a billion years before we even discover that they are alive - THAT is the problem. Also for the companies that made a fortune on that little fungi that comes for free by nature.

From Pete Seeger’s 1959 rendition of the African American gospel We Shall Overcome, which became an anthem for the civil rights movement, to Dick Gaughan’s Ballad of ‘84, a clarion call for the Scottish miners’ strike, the combination of one singer and their guitar has had a potent effect on galvanising activists.
Now, folk is turning its attention to the bees.
Bees are responsible for pollinating around 80% of plantlife in the UK and over a third of crops globally, yet from 1985 to 2005 the number of honeybee colonies in the UK fell by 53% and wild honeybees are now thought to be almost extinct across Britain. This is due to a variety of reasons including climate change, infectious diseases, the use of harmful pesticides, and the reduction of natural habitats. These worrying developments have led some to claim that if the bees become extinct, humanity would only have four years left to survive.
The stakes are high and 25-year-old fiddle player Rowan Piggott believes that folk is the answer. “The environmental crisis is one of the biggest issues of my generation,” he says. “All of our political and economic problems pale in comparison, since they tend to go in cycles, whereas we have done irreversible damage with climate change.”
A waifish presence in a tweed jacket, Piggott is surprisingly optimistic about the future. “People’s knowledge of the crisis is very general,” he says, “and they often don’t know what they can do to effect a meaningful change, so that’s why I started the Songhive project, to give people chances to get involved with the bees.”
Since Piggott’s father is an acclaimed traditional Irish folk musician and his mother is a beekeeper, the project seemed inevitable. Piggott noticed an accumulation of folksongs about the plight of the bees, such as Lau’s 2012 instrumental Save The Bees, and decided to create an online archive to raise awareness.
“I thought it’d be a nice way of reminding people that for thousands of years we’ve had a healthy respect for bees as part of our life-cycle and now that people are more distanced from the process of producing food, we have forgotten that and bees have become a mild annoyance,” he says.
With the archive up and running and the folk community responding, Piggott decided to up the ante. “I always had the idea for making a record,” he says, “although I initially thought it would be a compilation of already-recorded music from the archive.” Due to costly licensing fees, the record became a collection of 11 songs written and recorded especially for the project. Piggott invested £1,000 of his own money and raised a £2,000 grant from the English folk dance and song society to print the finished CDs.
Featuring Piggott himself and some of the British folk scene’s young stars, such as Rosie Hodgson and Georgia Lewis, as well as more established acts such as singer Nancy Kerr and songwriter Nick Burbridge, the album combines traditional folk instrumentation with bee-themed lyrics in the service of this environmental cause. Even the bees themselves are almost present, as their buzz is imitated by a shruti drone on Burbidge’s Queen’s Dream of Lost Fields, while Kerr’s Dark Honey addresses the production of honey from the sugary remnants of discarded Coke cans.
Since the CD was released in March, half of its 1,000 copies has been sold, raising £5,000 for a Friends of the Earth campaign, the Bee Cause. Piggott has also been encouraging his audience to learn and perform bee folksongs from the archive and sign petitions. One such petition, to ban the use of the harmful insecticide neonicotinoid, was successful and passed the EU in April.
“The response has been great,” he enthuses, “all ages have gotten involved. The older fans buy the record and the younger ones are active in spreading the message.”
Rosie Hodgson, 26, contributed two compositions to Songhive and believes folk is the perfect vehicle for the environmental message. “Folk music was mostly created and performed by those who were in positions of vulnerability,” she says, “injustice is a common theme and it harnesses the power of a personal story, so one well-placed tale will inspire sympathy for a cause in a way that talking about the cause as a whole will not. There’s a magic that binds people when they sing together, especially in times of hardship.”
Another contributor, Nancy Kerr, has made environmental awareness an integral part of her writing in recent years, with her last album, Instar, comprising folksongs about nature and conservation. For Kerr, born to a family of traditional musicians involved in protest music, folk is an activist’s genre. “The act of relating a narrative that stems from the experiences of disenfranchised people is an act of protest,” she says, “and that makes me view folk music as intrinsically political.”
With CD stock expecting to be sold out by the end of the year, Piggott is looking towards a second album, perhaps widening the scope beyond the bees. “It’s not just bees, it’s other pollinators like butterflies that are in danger – everything’s in trouble,” he says.
For now, though, he is planning a Songhive tour with Rosie Hodgson and some of Songhive’s other musicians. They are currently booking venues that have links to conservation, even hoping to serenade the bees in a wildflower meadow.
“Bees are the perfect species to drive meaningful action because we feel so positively towards them. They are a linchpin species,” Hodgson says.
For Piggott, the bees are a vehicle for optimistic action and a means for folk to be refocused to its political roots. “Folk music here isn’t the people’s music anymore,” he says, “it’s become commercialised and the general public don’t know what it should sound like. This project is about tapping back into that heritage and aiming it towards a cause that people can actively change right now, today.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/20/can-folk-music-save-the-honeybee

The authors said their paper, published in the journal Science, highlights how overstressed and overlapping natural systems are combining to throw up a growing number of unwelcome surprises.
“The risks are greater than assumed because the interactions are more dynamic,” said Juan Rocha of the Stockholm Resilience Centre. “The important message is to recognise the wickedness of the problem that humanity faces.”
The study collated existing research on ecosystem transitions that can irreversibly tip to another state, such as coral reefs bleaching and being overrun by algae, forests becoming savannahs and ice sheets melting into oceans. It then cross-referenced the 30 types of shift to examine the impacts they might have on one another and human society.
Only 19% were entirely isolated. Another 36% shared a common cause, but were not likely to interact. The remaining 45% had the potential to create either a one-way domino effect or mutually reinforcing feedbacks.
Among the latter pairings were Arctic ice sheets and boreal forests. When the former melt, there is less ice to reflect the sun’s heat so the temperature of the planet rises. This increases the risks of forest fires, which discharge carbon into the air that adds to the greenhouse effect, which melts more ice. Although geographically distant, each amplifies the other.
By contrast, a one-way domino-type impact is that between coral reefs and mangrove forests. When the former are destroyed, it weakens coastal defences and exposes mangroves to storms and ocean surges.
The deforestation of the Amazon is responsible for multiple “cascading effects” – weakening rain systems, forests becoming savannah, and reduced water supplies for cities like São Paulo and crops in the foothills of the Andes. This, in turn, increases the pressure for more land clearance.
Until recently, the study of tipping points was controversial, but it is increasingly accepted as an explanation for climate changes that are happening with more speed and ferocity than earlier computer models predicted. The loss of coral reefs and Arctic sea ice may already be past the point of no return. There are signs the Antarctic is heading the same way faster than thought.
Co-author Garry Peterson said the tipping of the west Antarctic ice shelf was not on the radar of many scientists 10 years ago, but now there was overwhelming evidence of the risks – including losses of chunks of ice the size of New York – and some studies now suggest the tipping point may have already been passed by the southern ice sheet, which may now be releasing carbon into the atmosphere.
“We’re surprised at the rate of change in the Earth system. So much is happening at the same time and at a faster speed than we would have thought 20 years ago. That’s a real concern,” said Peterson. “We’re heading ever faster towards the edge of a cliff.”
The fourth most downloaded academic research of 2018 was the Hothouse Earth paper, which considered how tipping points could combine to push the global climate into an uninhabitable state.
The authors of the new paper say their work goes beyond climate studies by mapping a wider range of ecological stress points, such as biodiversity loss, agricultural expansion, urbanisation and soil erosion. It also focuses more on what is happening at the local level now, rather than projecting geo-planetary trends into the future.
“We’re looking at things that affect people in their daily lives. They’re things that are happening today,” said Peterson. “There is a positive message as it expands the range of options for action. It is not just at an international level. Mayors can also make a difference by addressing soil erosion, or putting in place social policies that place less stress on the environment, or building up natural coastal defences.”
Rocha has spent 10 years building a database of tipping points, or “regime shifts” as he calls them. He urges policymakers to adopt a similar interdisciplinary approach so they can better grasp what is happening.
“We’re trying to connect the dots between different research communities,” said Rocha. “Governments also need to look more at interactions. They should stop compartmentalising ministries like agriculture, fisheries and international relations and try to manage environmental problems by embracing the diversity of causes and mechanisms underlying them. Policies need to match the scale of the problem.
“It’s a little depressing knowing we are not on a trajectory to keep our ecosystem in a functional state, but these connections are also a reason for hope; good management in one place can prevent severe environmental degradation elsewhere. Every action counts.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/20/risks-of-domino-effect-of-tipping-points-greater-than-thought-study-says

Brazil was constantly involved in negotiations to ensure COP24 delivered a workable toolbox to limit global warming. So we warmly welcome the positive outcome of COP24, including the agreement to keep working on a stronger global market mechanism for emission reductions.
Unfortunately, there have been several misrepresentations made about Brazil’s positions (Encouraging signs – but new rifts also exposed by hard-won deal at climate talks, 17 December), which do not help in the work ahead for all countries.
Brazil is absolutely opposed to double counting when it comes to carbon credits, and has consistently supported efforts to prevent double counting. We believe that emissions reductions generated under the sustainable development mechanism must be additional to the emissions-reductions targets made by the country where the reductions are generated.
This means that if the private sector develops a project and sells additional emissions reductions to any country, those reductions should be counted only towards the national targets of the purchasing country, with no impact on the targets of the country that hosted the project. If the purchasing country then on-sells those emissions reductions, they should absolutely be required to make an adjustment in respect of their national emissions targets. Otherwise, double counting will occur, which is exactly what Brazil and many other countries have sought to prevent.
Accurate representation of all countries’ positions is vital if the world is to make the necessary progress on climate change. Brazil of course has been a leader not just in global discussions on climate change, but also through its actual actions. We are already meeting our pre-2020 targets in 2018, and look forward to all parties who made pre-2020 commitments to deliver on them, as Brazil has done.Thiago de Araujo MendesSecretary for climate change and forests, environment ministry, Brazil

Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary who is driving the party’s climate agenda, said the UK’s “entire society and entire economy” needed to be refocused to meet the looming challenge of ecological breakdown.
“It could not be made clearer to us and people are starting to realise how incredibly dangerous this situation is,” said Long-Bailey, a close ally of the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the shadow chancellor John McDonnell. “There is no option but to radically transform our economy.”
But, in an interview with the Guardian, she said the crisis was also an opportunity to bring well-paid, highly skilled jobs and economic regeneration to some of the most marginalised communities in the country.
“We have to tackle climate change in a really radical way, the evidence is crystal clear,” said Long-Bailey. “But this is also a wonderful opportunity to invest in those towns and cities that have felt neglected for a very long time … this has to be – and will be – a genuine transformation of the economy.”
Labour’s plan has echoes the Green New Deal being advocated by leftwing Democrats such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders in the US.
And Long-Bailey said the experience of the French president Emmanuel Macron – who has faced widespread protests in part over new environmental taxes – showed that action on the environment must be part of a wider programme of social and economic regeneration.
“If you knocked on a door in Salford, where I am from, although most people care about climate change it is not going to be top of their list of priorities. Most people just want to know how their life is going to be improved.
“So it is important for us to position ourselves as a party that is going to tackle climate change but turn that into an economic opportunity for the vast areas of this country that have seen decades of underinvestment and provide jobs for the future and provide that revitalisation that communities want to see.”
Corbyn put a radical green agenda at the forefront of his conference speech this year and a senior source in the leaders office said both he and McDonnell were “100% committed” to implementing the transformative agenda laid out by Long-Bailey as soon as Labour were in office.
The party’s current target is to get 60% of the UK’s energy from renewable sources by 2030 and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by the middle of the century.
But Long-Bailey said they needed to be “even more ambitious” and set targets for areas of the economy beyond energy, from heavy industries like iron, steel and chemicals to agriculture and land use.
“[Tackling climate breakdown] is one of the central pillars of our industrial strategy … it will take a huge amount of work and we know it is ambitious – but we also know it is not ambitious enough in light of what we heard from the IPCC report – so we know we have got to move very, very quickly on this.”
Labour has brought together a team of experts including leading industry figures, engineers, scientists, consultants and academics, who will report back with a comprehensive plan in the new year, outlining what a sustainable energy mix would look like, how to achieve it – and what benefits in terms of jobs and investment it would bring.
Initial findings from the group suggest that to meet its current targets, Labour would by 2030 need to:
increase the UK’s installed offshore wind capacity sevenfold
bring all 24m homes in the UK up to the highest efficiency standard
triple the UK’s installed solar capacity
But Long-Bailey said this was just the start, with next year’s report likely to add a raft of new radical policy proposals.
“They are working on a very detailed report at the moment about what our future energy mix needs to look like to hit these targets – we are talking about offshore and onshore wind and solar – but it is obviously going to go much further than that.
“This is about so much more than just the energy supply, it is about developing the supply chains and the manufacturing base so we can export our expertise around the world.”
Long-Bailey, seen as a rising star in Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party, said the influx of new, often younger members, had energised the party’s environmentalism and said it could no longer be viewed as “luxury item”, to be dealt with as a separate policy issue.
Instead it was “now embedded into the DNA of every of every single department and every single economic decision we make”.
“It can no longer be a message that if you want to help the climate it is enough to buy sustainable products or source your energy from renewable providers – we have gone beyond that.
“It is critical that our entire society and our entire economy is centred around this mission to tackle climate change … and the really exciting thing is if we do it right we can also improve the long-term prospects of people in this country.”
Part of the challenge, Long-Bailey said, is to paint a picture of the positive future that is possible if society successfully meets the challenge of climate breakdown, as well as being honest about the potentially disastrous consequences of failure.
“When I was little I used to get this magazine called Quest,” she said. “It had science and glimpses into what the future might be like and I used to get excited and think … “Wow, I could be a scientist or an explorer.”
She said it was time to create that excitement and optimism about the future again.
“So in Salford we need to be telling people that by tackling climate change we can have a factory that is going to create wind turbines, is going to manufacture parts for offshore wind and show them that their child in the local school can become an engineer, that they will get proper pay and be in a job that is secure, well valued, with trade unions involved so they have that security and a collective voice,” she said.
“Ultimately people need to know that their kids can have a really good, full and interesting life if we get this right.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/24/labour-government-tackle-climate-change

Artificial intelligence, migration and a healthier old age mean countries no longer needed booming populations to hold their own, she points out. We would like to emphasise the major benefit, briefly pointed out in your article, that having one fewer child reduces a parent’s carbon footprint by 58 tonnes of CO2 a year. In fact, the most important contribution of a reduced birth is its long-term contribution towards mitigating global warming by reducing CO2 emissions. One major challenge to reducing worldwide CO2 emissions is the large variation between nations: 45 tonnes per capita per year in Qatar, compared with 16.5 in the US, 7.5 in China, 6.5 in the UK, 6.4 in the EU, 1.8 in Indonesia, and 0.3 in least developed countries, according to UN classification.
Reducing global carbon emissions while the developing world industrialises will require both convergence toward rates achieved in the most efficient industrialised countries and a global reduction in these rates, a strategy that the IPCC called “converge and contract”. But this strategy, with realistic levels of contraction, appears to fall far short of what is needed, especially with the recent recognition that the previous goal reducing global warming to 2C is insufficient to avoid major adverse impacts. It is here that population decline from falling birthrates can play a key synergistic role with the “converge and contract” strategy, perhaps to the point of making the need for geoengineering for sustainability only temporary.Harold M Hastings, Tai Young-Taft and Chris CogginsBard College at Simon’s Rock, Barrington, Massachusetts, USA

I would love to leave my grandchildren the world I grew up in, but given current circumstances that can’t happen. I applaud the people who flew drones over Gatwick, perhaps checking by a tiny amount the advance of global warming. If we don’t act differently soon, the chaos at Gatwick this Christmas will be as nothing compared to the catastrophe we seem to be refusing to face.Diana HeeksLlanrhystud, Ceredigion

• Re William Westermeyer’s article (In 1993 my agency warned of climate change. In 1995 it was abolished, 27 December), among all the manufactured and empty complexities of human life, it’s easy to forget that we are all just clinging, white-knuckled and terrified, on to this fast-spinning Earth together. In truth, no single one of us has any more idea than anyone else of how best to cling, or why to even bother continuing. Our only real choice comes down to whether we boot our fellow travellers into the void, or help them find a firmer grip – until perhaps this ruined planet shifts and rolls and belches its sorry self free of the whole damned lot of us.Laura CloutIvy Hatch, Kent

The astonishing notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci are to be gathered under the British Library’s roof in June, with his Codex Leicester on display for the first time in Britain since it was bought by Bill Gates. And, while the biggest drum roll in the gallery world this winter is reserved for the Van Gogh show arriving at Tate Britain in late March, a fresh take on another troubled painter comes out in print the same month when the Norwegian author Karl Ove Knausgaard launches his book, So Much Longing In So Little Space: The Art of Edvard Munch. On television, there will be a long-awaited second instalment of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s tragicomic Fleabag, promised for BBC Two in the new year with the addition of Andrew Scott. Meanwhile, the men behind Sherlock, Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat, are breathing life into a new creation, Dracula, for 2019.
At Covent Garden, the Royal Opera House sees a return of Richard Eyre’s staging of Verdi’s La Traviata. And American band the Flaming Lips have announced that their next album, King’s Mouth, out in April, will feature a liberal helping of the Clash’s Mick Jones.
Students of British music history await singer Tracey Thorn’s new memoir, Another Planet: A Teenager in Suburbia, published early in February. But before then bookshops will be piling up apocalyptic thriller The Last, by 28-year-old Hanna Jameson, which sold for a six-figure sum in America.
For the more poetic soul, novelist Joe Dunthorne’s debut poetry collection, O Positive, is out in April.
One to watch: Kieran Hodgson, the mercurial young actor/comedian who managed to beguile Edinburgh audiences last year by talking about the origins of Brexit. His hit one-man show, ’75, comes to London in January. VT
2019 could be the year Apple cements its reputation as the “new Microsoft” – a company with a massive valuation that has ceased to innovate. Iterations of the iPhone still account for the majority of its revenue, and with an entry point device costing £749, it feels increasingly like a company aimed at wealthy baby boomers. Throwing $100bn at next year’s revamp of Apple TV doesn’t feel like a new paradigm.
Moreover, despite some recent deals with Amazon to get its services on Alexa devices, Apple has fallen behind and priced itself out of the burgeoning market for connected gadgets and digital assistants. Google Home or Alexa-based devices are increasingly embedded in homes (and cars) and often don’t play well with iPhones.
Whether you are wired in to Apple, Google or Alexa has become like choosing a football team – you can only support one and it’s impossible to swap.
Meanwhile, Facebook will be hoping its declining popularity in Europe doesn’t turn into a stampede if the EU’s investigations about data sharing result in enormous fines, the advertising it is introducing to WhatsApp in 2019 doesn’t prompt users to join other messaging services, and the cloning of Instagram’s Stories format by Facebook and YouTube doesn’t divert revenue and readers to other platforms.
Well worth a read will be The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight For A Human Future At The New Frontier of Power by Shoshana Zuboff, a Harvard professor. At 704 pages, you’ll certainly have to throw away your phone so that you can concentrate on finishing it without any distractions, which is a start.

The football year will pivot around the Fifa Women’s World Cup in France over the summer, with the USA favourites to retain their title, and England, Germany and France among the pack on their heels. Around the same time, an as-yet-undecided host will stage the Africa Cup of Nations. And, in Portugal, England’s men will hope to win the inaugural Uefa Nations League, a triumph that could yet signify the end of 50-odd years of hurt, depending on the current tournament exchange rate for agonising nostalgia.
The year in cricket will be dominated by the 50-over World Cup in England, followed almost directly by the Ashes, an epic-scale domestic double-bill that offers the summer game a chance to either dig its talons back into the national consciousness or confirm its own shift to the pay-TV periphery.
Then there’s the Rugby Union World Cup, a gruelling 42-day jamboree that kicks off in Japan at the start of September. New Zealand will be favourites because, well, they’re New Zealand. But Ireland and England will also fancy their chances.
Elsewhere, boxing will try to cash in on the sudden wealth of star power in the heavyweight division. The spring could see Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder in an eliminator to face Anthony Joshua, creating in the process the greatest pay-per-view spectacle ever staged in the UK.
Beyond the pitch it seems likely that Football Leaks will continue to dish up further evidence of murky practice. And that Fifa’s entanglement with Qatar and the ineffectiveness of Wada and world doping authorities will continue to come into closer focus.
One to watch: Alexander Zverev. Men’s tennis really does need a new star. Time for the next-best next-biggest thing to start hoovering up the grand slams. BR
1 January 2019 will – so the government says – be the last New Year’s Day that the United Kingdom spends as a member of the European Union. Both Theresa May and the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn insist we must honour the result of the 2016 referendum and end our membership on 29 March. That is in just under 13 weeks’ time.
But whatever they say, the only thing that really is certain in British politics is that nothing is certain at all. Few new years have approached with so much up in the air. Much will be determined by what happens on Brexit – yet no one can be at all sure how Brexit will turn out.
Will it go ahead as planned, be delayed, or stopped in its tracks? With parliament deadlocked and a no-deal outcome looming into view, there is increasing talk of pushing back the date, or holding another referendum to break the impasse. The other possibility is another general election.
May clung on as prime minister before Christmas despite more than a third of Tory backbenchers in her deeply divided party saying they have no confidence in her. But, if she fails to get her own Brexit deal through parliament in January and if any of the three scenarios outlined above happen, it is hard to imagine how she could survive.
Labour, too, is divided on Brexit. For the first time since becoming leader in 2015, Corbyn is coming under fire within his party for refusing to oppose Britain leaving the EU and throw his weight behind a new public vote.
The centre ground, meanwhile, is wide open. Increasingly there is talk of discontented Labour and Tory MPs, perhaps backed by Liberal Democrats, forming a new centrist party from the political rubble left by Brexit.
One to watch: Amber Rudd. She is now back in the cabinet as work and pensions secretary. Although she is a strong Remainer, few are better placed to succeed Theresa May if she does not survive 2019 as prime minister. TH
The new year gets off to an ominous start with the inauguration on Tuesday of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who wants to accelerate mining and agribusiness exploitation of the Amazon, the world’s biggest rainforest. Scientific attention may also be focused on the Arctic, where meteorologists will be watching to see if last winter’s high temperatures were a one-off or a disturbing new trend caused by a weakened polar vortex.
If weather forecasters are correct, 2019 could also be another El Niño year, which means many parts of the world could also be in for another summer of heatwaves, droughts, hurricanes, coral bleaching and forest fires. This will be a crucial year to determine how fast humanity can respond to the growing threat.
On 23 September, the UN secretary-general António Guterres will convene a climate summit to urge government leaders to raise their emissions-cutting ambitions, followed on 11 November by the next regular conference of the climate talks, hosted by Chile. Environmental issues will increasingly shape and be shaped by politics. Buffeted by the gilet jaunes protests, the French president Emmanuel Macron has promised to put climate and biodiversity high on the agenda of the G7 summit he will host in Biarritz from 25-27 August.
If the fossil-fuel championing Donald Trump survives the arrests of his former aides, he is likely to push back against a new bipartisan climate bill and continue unravelling pollution controls for national parks.
In China, President Xi Jinping’s promise to create an “ecological civilisation” will be tested by the massive infrastructure investment of the Belt and Road Initiative. Globally, the big question will be whether emissions can finally start to fall after two years of rapid growth. If not, expect fiercer protests by groups such as Extinction Rebellion and 350.org.
One to watch: Greta Thunberg. In September the Swedish teenager began a solo climate protest by going on strike from school, and more than 20,000 students around the world have joined her.

Forecasters have struggled to achieve a consensus about the prospects for 2019. The International Monetary Fund has warned that it could be a terrible year with much of the postwar financial infrastructure being torn apart.
Washington’s policy initiatives threaten to jam the cogs of international trade, making companies circumspect about pushing into new markets. Uncertainty over a Brexit deal, the US-China trade tariffs stand-off – which could escalate in the coming weeks after a 90-day moratorium ends – and the battles between Brussels and Italy’s new radical right administration also threaten the old order.
Since the 2008 crash, the west has relied on the emerging economies of China, India, Brazil, South Africa and Turkey to drive growth, but each is going through political upheaval and struggling to maintain momentum.
China, in particular, borrowed heavily from its own banks and the more shadowy elements of the financial sector to fund investment. After a crackdown on easy money, it’s not clear how strong the economy’s growth will be in the future. Yet the IMF, which failed to predict the last crash, stands accused of over-reacting to every morsel of poor economic news. Analysts at Oxford Economics are among many who predict 2019 as a period of steady if unspectacular growth. In this outlook, Donald Trump is more bluster than action, China gets back on track and British politicians will secure a deal or a delay for another referendum vote. The Italian government is already on the road to patching up its differences with Brussels. The worst is already in the past.
One to watch: Jerome Powell, the US central bank chief. If Fed rates continue to rise in 2019, money will be sucked into the US from across the world. Developing countries will struggle to find the funds they need to grow. Markets will become more volatile and global growth will slow. If Powell eases back, it will look like he has capitulated to Trump’s bullying, and the Fed’s independence will be in question. Whatever he does, it will have huge implications. PI
Robert Mueller’s FBI inquiry into Donald Trump’s alleged collusion with Russia during and after the 2016 US presidential election is expected to conclude in 2019. A key question is to what extent Trump may have lied and conspired to obstruct justice.
Faced by similar accusations, Richard Nixon resigned in 1974, rather than be impeached. But Trump may try to brazen it out. Newly empowered Democrats in Congress will increase the pressure, just as the race for the 2020 election kicks off. Expect fireworks.
Europe faces great uncertainty. EU parliamentary elections in May may produce further gains for far-right populist and Eurosceptic parties. Key “mainstream” leaders such as Germany’s Angela Merkel and France’s Emmanuel Macron begin the year in a weakened state; the former has been replaced as leader of the CDU by Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. If there is no Brexit deal, April in Britain could be the cruellest month.
Bashar al-Assad’s vow to retake “every inch” of Syrian territory implies an all-out assault is coming on Idlib, the last hold-out province. Many Syrians in Turkey and Jordan appear poised to return home – if the war ends. But the unresolved problem of migrants travelling via north Africa will stoke tensions in Europe. The terrorist threat from Islamic State may intensify as it regroups in Iraq and the Sahel.
Efforts to halt the Saudi-Iranian proxy conflict in Yemen will be a race against time. The UN says millions face famine and disease. Much may depend on what happens to Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince implicated in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo shows signs of becoming an emergency. China will exploit the geopolitical vacuum caused by America’s distractions as trade tensions persist. Elections are due in India, Afghanistan, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria, Canada, Argentina and Israel.
Northern Syria, Taiwan, Venezuela, Cameroon, and Israel’s borderlands are likely 2019 hotspots. Russia-Ukraine enmities will cause more trouble.
One to watch: Iran is in Trump’s cross-hairs, and he could escalate confrontation in 2019 to shift attention from his domestic troubles. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is facing bribery and corruption allegations, and the Saudi leadership is under withering fire over Yemen and the Khashoggi affair. Both might welcome a chance to bolster their positions by settling scores with Tehran. If hardliners in Iran gain the upper hand and resume nuclear activities banned in 2015, the consequences will be unpredictable – and dangerous. ST
The new year will begin in spectacular scientific style when the US probe New Horizons sweeps past the tiny world of Ultima Thule. It will have travelled 4 billion miles to reach the piece of rock about 20 miles in diameter, left over from the birth of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago. The data from New Horizons could revolutionise our understanding of planet formation.
Further space adventures for 2019 will include the launch of China’s Chang’e 5, a robot mission to collect rocks from the moon, while the US will return to putting humans in space when Elon Musk’s Space X company launches its manned capsule Dragon, and Boeing puts its CST-100 Starliner into orbit. Both will carry crew to the International Space Station. Next year should also see the results of efforts by scientists working on the Event Horizon project to produce images of the super-massive black lurking hole at the centre of our galaxy.
The chief medical officer, Sally Davies, has been instructed by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, to produce guidelines in the spring on the maximum time young people should spend on social media. Given the lack of research in this area it will be interesting to see what her recommendations will be.
One to watch: He Jiankui. The Chinese scientist shocked the world this year when he claimed to have created the world’s first genetically edited babies. He is now under pressure to reveal details of his work, which created an outcry because of the ethical questions it raises.

It will be a familiar experience for many. For 24 years the annual UN climate conference has served up a reliable diet of rhetoric, backroom talks and dramatic last-minute deals aimed at halting global warming.
But this year’s will be a grimmer affair – by far. As recent reports have made clear, the world may no longer be hovering at the edge of destruction but has probably staggered beyond a crucial point of no return. Climate catastrophe is now looking inevitable. We have simply left it too late to hold rising global temperatures to under 1.5C and so prevent a future of drowned coasts, ruined coral reefs, spreading deserts and melted glaciers.
One example was provided last week by a UN report that revealed attempts to ensure fossil fuel emissions peak by 2020 will fail. Indeed the target will not even be reached by 2030. Another, by the World Meteorological Organization, said the past four years had been the warmest on record and warned that global temperatures could easily rise by 3-5C by 2100, well above that sought-after goal of 1.5C. The UK will not be exempt either. The Met Office said summer temperatures could now be 5.4C hotter by 2070.
At the same time, prospects of reaching global deals to halt emissions have been weakened by the spread of rightwing populism. Not much to smile about in Katowice.
Nor will the planet’s woes end in 2100. Although most discussions use the year as a convenient cut-off point for describing Earth’s likely fate, the changes we have already triggered will last well beyond that date, said Svetlana Jevrejeva, at the National Oceanography Centre, Liverpool. She has studied sea-level rises that will be triggered by melting ice sheets and expanding warm seawater in a world 3-5C hotter than it was in pre-industrial times, and concludes these could reach 0.74 to 1.8 metres by 2100. This would be enough to deluge Pacific and Indian Ocean island states and displace millions from Miami, Guangzhou, Mumbai and other low-lying cities. The total cost to the planet could top £11trillion.
Even then the seas will not stop rising, Jevrejeva added. “They will continue to climb for centuries even after greenhouse-gas levels have been stabilised. We could experience the highest-ever global sea-level rise in the history of human civilisation.”
Vast tracts of prime real estate will be destroyed – at a time when land will be needed with unprecedented desperation. Earth’s population stands at seven billion today and is predicted to rise to nine billion by 2050 and settle at over 11 billion by 2100 – when climate change will have wrecked major ecosystems and turned farmlands to dust bowls.
Unfortunately many experts believe Earth’s population will actually peak well beyond 11 billion. “It could reach 15 billion,” said Sarah Harper, of Oxford’s Institute of Population Ageing. “All sorts of factors suggest women, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, will still want to have relatively high numbers of children and this might keep the world’s population approaching 15 billion rather than 12 billion.”
The world will have double its present numbers – but with hugely reduced areas of fertile land to provide food. We will be living in a shrunken, scorched planet bursting with human beings. Somaliland gives a grim vision of this future.
In the past few years climate change has killed 70% of its livestock and forced tens of thousands of families to flee from its scorched interior to live in refugee camps. “You can touch it, the climate change, in Somaliland. It is real. It is here,” the country’s environment minister, Shukri Ismail Bandare, said in the Financial Times last week.
Sudan and Kenya are also victims of a drought that has dried the Horn of Africa faster than at any other time in the past 2,000 years. Similarly, in Vietnam, thousands a year are abandoning the once fertile Mekong Delta as rising seawater pollutes paddy fields. By 2050, the World Bank says more than 140 million will become climate refugees.
It will be bad for humans, but catastrophic for Earth’s other inhabitants. Arctic ice loss threatens polar bears, droughts imperil monarch butterflies, and koala habitats are being destroyed by bush fires. In all, about a sixth of all species now face extinction, say scientists, although in the end no creature or plant will be safe. “Even the most resilient species will inevitably fall victim as extreme stresses drive ecosystems to collapse,” said Giovanni Strona of Europe’s Joint Research Centre in a report last week on climate change.
Scientists warned more than 30 years ago that such a future lay ahead, but nothing was done to stave it off. Only dramatic measures are now left to those seeking to save our burning planet, and these can have grim political consequences. In France, for example, President Macron’s new levies on fossil fuels, introduced to cut emissions and to fund renewable energy projects, triggered riots. Had only modest changes been enacted a few decades ago there would be no trouble today, say analysts.
But the most telling example is provided by the US, which has emitted about a third of the carbon responsible for global warming. Yet it has essentially done nothing to check its annual rises in output. Lobbying by the fossil fuel industry has proved highly effective at blocking political change – a point most recently demonstrated by groups such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Heartland Institute, which helped persuade President Trump to pull out of the Paris agreement, thus dashing the planet’s last hope of ecological salvation. “The coalition used its power to slow us down precisely at the moment when we needed to speed up,” said the environmentalist Bill McKibben in the New Yorker. “As a result, the particular politics of one country for one half-century will have changed the geological history of the Earth.”
No region of the US has more to lose from climate change than southern Florida. If scientists’ worst predictions are realised, an entire metropolitan area, currently inhabited by more than six million people, is likely to be swamped by a 1.5-metre sea-level rise before the end of this century, a rise that could see the tourist mecca of Miami simply disappear.
It’s a doomsday scenario that has united the leaders of Miami-Dade county and the cities of Miami and Miami Beach in an attempt to find solutions to the most severe effects of rising oceans before it is too late. Their plan to combat the physical, economic and social challenges of climate change, as part of the global 100 Resilient Cities programme, will play a key role in determining whether the low-lying region will still be habitable in the coming decades or surrendered to the ever-rising Atlantic.
“It’s a problem that can be managed, it’s not a problem that can be fixed and you walk away from,” said Susanne Torriente, chief resilience officer for Miami Beach, where hundreds of millions of taxpayers’ dollars have already been spent elevating roads, constructing higher sea walls and investing in modern, high-capacity pumps and stormwater drainage systems.
“Every generation will add to the work that we have begun,” Torriente says. “We are always learning, it’s a constant process of learning, re-evaluating and improving.”
Up to a million Florida homes, worth an estimated $371bn (£290bn, are at risk of tidal flooding by 2100, one recent study calculated, but the threats facing the greater Miami region are not just coastal. Hurricanes are becoming more powerful because of global warming, say scientists, who point to the destruction wrought by Hurricane Michael in October, while the combination of a low water table and high “king” tides – occurring in autumn – causes regular inland flooding even on dry days.
This means that the new joint action plan being worked on by city and county officials has to be further-reaching than anything that has preceded it, Torriente says. “Our resilience journey began with the climate work, the storm water, [but] this strategy will be much broader and will be defining resilience not only in terms of climate and flooding, but also mobility and housing, property, and how to recover quickly in the event of a hurricane in south Florida.” 
These moves reflect the sense of urgency being felt in Florida, where the state leadership has been criticised for neglecting the environment. Its newly elected senator, Rick Scott, banned staff from using the term climate change during his time as governor of Florida, and will be a close Washington ally of President Donald Trump, who took the US out of the Paris climate agreement.
“We’ll be much more successful if we have more cooperation and more attention at all levels of government, [because] it’s a problem for all of us,” Torriente says. “But we do what we can. Everything we are doing is funded locally, so we can continue to invest.”

It’s a 45-minute canoe journey along the coast from regional capital Morombe to Kivalo in south-west Madagascar. Children frolic in the water, palm trees sway, and fishing nets hang along the beach. This tranquillity is deceptive, however – for Madagascar is ranked as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Higher temperatures, extended drought periods in the south, intensification of cyclones and rising sea levels are all forecast. For good measure, the country’s pervasive poverty restricts its capacity to adapt to such changes.
In Kivalo, this is already a familiar picture. “The southern wind used to start in January and last until July,” says Bikison Thomas, a fisherman. “But it’s still going now in November.” On very windy days, he cannot put out to sea. “There is also more fog,” he adds. Overfishing, higher sea temperatures and the loss of mangrove, a crucial habitat for fish stocks, are also reducing catches.
The Madagascar government is aware of the country’s vulnerability and has ratified the Paris agreement. Climate change is listed in every major policy document but budgets usually fall short of producing effective measures, a point that is demonstrated dramatically down the coast in the town of Morondava, where hotels are grappling with sea-level rise.
Two years ago, Chayune Badouraly bought the Coco Beach hotel. It had a few bungalows and a lovely beach. Badouraly added more bedrooms, a reception area and a restaurant.
But in September, powerful tides destroyed two of his bungalows, and the sea has not returned to its previous level. “We used to have 150 metres of beach,” he says bitterly. “Now it’s minus five.” 
Although there are plans to build sea defences, Badouraly says that could take months, even years, so he’s taken the problem into his own hands and built a 60-metre-long sea wall, a mixture of stone blocks, steel rods and sandbags. “I knew we had coastal erosion problems, but I didn’t think it would be that bad,” he adds. “I would never have bought.”

It is hard to get a grip of the sheerscale of the Thwaites glacier in west Antarctica. It’s more than 300 miles long and 200 wide – and more than a mile thick. It drains an area of ice that is larger than England and stealthily slides towards the sea by several metres every day. Only from satellite images have we understood the shape and power of this ice monster.
These now show the beast is waking up. Thwaites’s uptake of falling snow was once matched, fairly finely, by snow and ice being lost as icebergs. Now it has begun to flow faster, along with some of its neighbouring glaciers. More ice is being lost into the ocean than is being replaced, speeding up global sea-level rise.
The cause of the disruption at Thwaites is straightforward, researchers have discovered. Increasing amounts of warm ocean water coming from the north have been melting the floating parts of the glacier and this, in turn, is letting the inland glacier run more quickly into the sea. This much we know, but we have still to understand how this process is likely to accelerate. At present, Thwaites contributes around 4% of observed sea-level rise, but it is widely agreed that this could grow exponentially. Indeed, some glaciologists believe that a complete collapse of the Thwaites glacier over coming centuries is now inevitable – and that would raise global sea level by several metres, drowning coastal ecosystems around the world, damaging coastal investments and displacing millions of people.
Research on the ice and frigid waters around Thwaites Glacier is urgently needed but carrying that out is tough. Even by Antarctic standards, this area is cold and remote. I have been working in Antarctica for more than 30 years, and I’ve never managed to reach Thwaites. However, the UK and US governments have agreed to send in scientists as part of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration. We are finally going to get the chance to understand this waking monster. At the moment, it is merely yawning and stretching. The question we must answer, urgently, is whether it is about to wake up and roar.

Coral reefs cover a mere 0.1% of the world’s ocean floor but they support about 25% of all marine species. They also provide nature with some of its most beautiful vistas. For good measure, coral reefs protect shorelines from storms, support the livelihoods of 500 million people and help generate almost £25bn of income. Permitting their destruction would put the planet in trouble – which is precisely what humanity is doing.
Rising sea temperatures are already causing irreparable bleaching of reefs, while rising sea levels threaten to engulf reefs at a faster rate than they can grow upwards. Few scientists believe coral reefs – which are made of simple invertebrates related to sea anemones – can survive for more than a few decades.
Yet those who have sounded clear warnings about our reefs have received little reward. Professor Terry Hughes, a coral expert at James Cook University in Queensland, Australia, recently studied the impact of El Niño warmings in 2016 and 2017 on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, the world’s largest coral reef and its largest living entity – and wept when he saw the damage.
“The 2016 event killed 30% of corals, the one a year later killed another 20%. Very close to half the corals have died in the past three years,” he said recently.
For his pains, Hughes has faced demands from tourist firms for his funding to be halted because he was ruining their business. “The Australian government is still promoting new developments of coal mines and fracking for gas,” Hughes said, after being named joint recipient of the John Maddox prize, given to those who champion science in the face of hostility and legal threats. “If we want to save the Great Barrier Reef, these outdated ambitions need to be abandoned. Yet Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions are rising, not falling. It’s a national disgrace.”
This grim picture is summed up by the ethnographer Irus Braverman in her book Coral Whisperers: “The Barrier Reef has changed for ever. The largest living structure in the world has become the largest dying structure in the world.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/02/world-verge-climate-catastophe

It’s May 2018, three years after representatives from nearly 200 countries convened in France in an extraordinary display of international unity and agreed to keep global warming below 2C and to pursue a tougher target of 1.5C.
How the Paris climate agreement will achieve that remains an open question. The rules to govern the deal are due to be agreed at the next United Nations climate change conference in the coal-mining town of Katowice in south-west Poland in December. With the clock ticking, diplomats have gathered in the former West German capital for mid-year talks. Things are not going well.
Negotiators rush in and out of adjoining rooms. In years gone by, Biniaz would have been at the centre of these meetings. From 1989 to early 2017, she was a deputy legal adviser at the US state department and its leading climate lawyer. She personally drafted key passages of the 2015 Paris accord. In global warming diplomacy, few are more respected. She still attends UN climate meetings, but only as an observer, with limited access to the behind-doors wrangling. So in Bonn she stands in a visible spot and the meetings come to her.
“Hi Sue!” calls out Chinese negotiator Xiang Gao, who is standing alongside Andrew Rakestraw, a Trump state department official and Biniaz’s former colleague. Beside these sharp-suited hotshots, Biniaz is an elder: rimless oval spectacles, grey hair loosely pulled back. They fill her in, cracking jokes and sounding hopeful about the stream of talks they are co-chairing. Biniaz writes something down.
Biniaz left the department in 2017 and took up teaching in the law schools of Columbia and Yale as well as a fellowship with the UN Foundation, a Washington DC philanthropic institution. She did so partly because she thought nothing as professionally enthralling as the Paris agreement could ever happen to her again. She also predicted, correctly, that the new president, Donald Trump, would renege on the deal. “I just did not want to be part of an administration that was going to take the position that this was a terrible agreement, because I don’t agree with that,” says Biniaz.
At the UN Foundation she shares an office with two former colleagues from the Obama state department climate team: Julie Cerqueira and Jen Austin.
Between them, Biniaz, Cerqueira and Austin cover the three arms of climate politics outside federal policy: international talks, local and state government, and the business sector. Austin is policy director for the We Mean Business coalition. Cerqueira leads the US Climate Alliance, an umbrella office for “subnational” governments who want to coordinate efforts to combat climate change.
Turnover between administrations is a great Washington tradition, as party devotees slip into the private sector, thinktanks or lobbying firms. But the exodus from the state department climate team has been different, says Biniaz.
“The number of people who have left has been kind of extraordinary and it’s definitely been not just because the administration changed, but it changed into an administration that was very hostile to both the Paris agreement and climate change action more generally,” she says.
Cerqueira says: “A lot of civil servants gave up their nice state department or [Environmental Protection Agency] job or whatever because they are so committed to addressing climate change as fast as possible.” She loved her state job and regrets deeply the change in policy that drove her out.
“You stay in the federal government as long as you feel like you can make a difference and as long as you feel like you can act in good faith and uphold your oath to the constitution,” she says, “and at some point you realise that you can’t do that any more.”
As a result, the most effective diplomatic and legal outfit ever assembled in global climate politics is now spread through the thinktanks and environmental organisations of Washington DC.
“Some people have been calling it climate diaspora,” says Biniaz. “It’s not an organised group. But to varying degrees we keep in touch because our work is related. Well, we keep in touch socially too of course, just because we are friends.”
The 2015 Paris accord drew up the global system to bring down greenhouse gas emissions in only the broadest strokes. At just 27 pages long, it represents what could be agreed at the time. But interpreting the agreement into a concrete set of rules is proving an immensely complicated task. For example, the Paris deal asks all countries to submit their plans to fight climate change. But much is left open as to what those plans should cover, or how often they should be updated, using which metrics and baselines, and how much leeway should be given to poor countries with bad data. These questions can all be split into increasingly finer details, with such eventual complexity that in many negotiating parties, the lead diplomat has only a rudimentary understanding of what their staff are working on. Consensus is proving difficult to find.
If it is ever agreed, the “Paris rulebook” will iron out these technical, in some cases toxic, details. Without it, the deal will collapse.
It is over these troubled waters that Biniaz keeps watch in Bonn. Using intelligence harvested from old contacts, she keeps track of which parts of the talks are in most trouble. When they become stuck, Biniaz arranges small, informal gatherings of key negotiators to try to unblock them.
One evening Biniaz held an after-dinner session. “People are in a better mood when they are fed,” she says. Diplomats sat behind nameplates bearing their own names, instead of the name of their country. These meetings are private and completely off the record. Biniaz believes the relaxed setting can help adversaries “inch toward a point of view”.
Biniaz has hosted at least five such meetings, held with the assistance of the Paris-based Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI), on the margins of the busy 2018 negotiating calendar. These have usually focused on the area of the talks Rakestraw and Xiang oversee, which covers what information countries must provide as they report their efforts to cut carbon pollution. The role is neutral, but there is one ironclad principle under which she operates: the deal cut in Paris is not up for negotiation.
There is an undercurrent at the talks that is disturbing the former US diplomat, who says there are serious attempts afoot to write rules Biniaz thinks “ignore the language” agreed in 2015.
Based on legal language Biniaz helped to draft, Barack Obama and Xi Jinping agreed to universal rules that gave flexibility for the poorest countries. That compromise is credited with making Paris possible. It was good for small, vulnerable nations that feared China’s gigantic future emissions. But for emerging, coal-dependent economies it was hard to swallow. Hence their efforts now to reverse the deal and the possibility that a dual deal could be reached in Poland under which China is subject to different rules than the US.
A group of developing countries, spurred by US betrayal and most likely coaxed on by China, are now trying to create one set of rules for the rich and one for the poor. This approach would govern China’s massive emissions more loosely, which would be unacceptable to the US and EU. If talks fail to produce a rulebook in Katowice over the coming weeks, it will be over this.
It does not help that US diplomatic influence over climate change has collapsed under Trump. Just three years ago the Obama state department, with Biniaz as its lieutenant, ran the show. The Trump administration diplomats who still turn up to negotiate are tolerated, but their power has evaporated.
As an Obama diplomat, Cerqueira built alliances between countries with similar interests. In her new job, the international experience has come in handy. As cooperation and dialogue on climate change with the US federal government has dried up, other – usually European – nations have sought diplomatic connections with governors and mayors across the US. Cerqueira is often their first call.
When the UK and Canadian governments began gathering names for a global pact to end coal power, she says, “they wanted to coordinate on the recruitment of states into the alliance and so we are like a natural fit”. So far, seven US states and two cities have signed up.
A short ride across town from the UN Foundation is the Brookings Institution, where Todd Stern has taken up a fellowship. If Biniaz was the driving intellectual force behind US efforts in Paris, Stern, as Obama’s special envoy for climate change, was its voice and face. His relationship with China’s lead negotiator and government minister Xie Zhenhua was a crucial factor when talks hit the skids in the final hours. The final draft contained a single word – some claimed it was a typo – the US found unacceptable. As the talks threatened to unravel, Xie stepped in, backed the change the US demanded and the gavel came down.
Unlike many of his staff, Stern had no intention of staying on after the Paris deal was struck. He had had enough of the constant travel, the time away from his three children. He began packing up his offices and in May 2016, after striking a final bargain with his old friend Xie for the US and China to ratify the agreement together, he departed. Like Biniaz, he had agreed to teach a course at Yale. He was thinking about writing a book: the story behind the global accord. He was not thinking much about the ongoing negotiation of the Paris rulebook; certainly he didn’t imagine getting involved. Then Trump won.
 “I really had been assuming that Clinton was going to win,” he says. Initially, Stern thought “wiser voices in the room” would convince Trump to remain in the Paris agreement. “Obviously that changed over time.” But he knew immediately that “it wasn’t good and we weren’t going to see anything like a bona fide climate change effort internationally or domestically”.
In September 2017, a few months after Trump had announced his intention to leave the Paris deal, Stern travelled to New York to talk to old contacts as they gathered for the UN general assembly. He wanted to find out what other countries were thinking. How would the negotiations on the Paris rulebook, so critical to its function, be conducted with US leadership stripped away?
Word of the binary system being pushed by China and its allies was circulating. This was something Stern and Biniaz believed they had buried in Paris. If US climate diplomacy has had a defining theme over years and across presidencies, it is that its great rival China must be bound by the same conditions. If December’s talks deliver a dual rulebook, it could stop the US rejoining the deal under a different president, says Biniaz. Neither Stern nor Biniaz denies that making sure this doesn’t happen is guiding their involvement. Six current and former non-US diplomats interviewed for this story said they thought this was at least partly their goal.
Certainly, Stern heard enough in New York to continue turning up. Over the past two years he has dropped in to most major meetings. He lunches and listens and tactfully gives his views. His book has made little progress.
His travels have included a visit to Beijing in May this year, where Xie hosted him at Tsinghua University. The two spent a lot of time together, says Stern, talking about the state of the negotiations.
“My lodestar is: what is the way in which we stay faithful to the Paris agreement?” he says. “Not what does the US want or not, because I can’t speak for the US, and it won’t come as a surprise to you that people aren’t all that interested about what the US likes or doesn’t right now.”
A senior diplomat from a developing country told the Guardian, speaking under condition of anonymity: “Some would say Todd and Sue are trying to keep the whole thing from crumbling. Others would say they are trying to keep some soft power for the US. Others could say they want to still feel relevant, or make sure that their vision of what the Paris agreement should be prevails.”
The US vision of the Paris deal is, broadly, what Obama’s state department got from Paris. They wanted voluntary targets, rather than ones that were in line with their historical responsibility for creating climate change. Once set, countries’ pledges could not be legally binding, or the US Senate would reject them. The world accepted the rule of the Senate. These priorities arguably weakened the power of the deal to cut emissions. Certainly the current paucity of these voluntary efforts (which are supposed to increase over time, at a pace determined by each government) means the world remains on a path to warming well beyond 2C.
 Meanwhile, Trump has argued that Paris “demeaned” the US; that Obama was stitched up; that China will go on building coal plants (it will) while the US cannot (it can, but doesn’t need them).
Despite Trump’s radical reversals of domestic climate policies and threat to withdraw from the deal, his state department still turns up to the negotiations. The US cannot formally leave the Paris agreement until 2020, coincidentally on the day after the next US election. 
The state department continues to advocate the same positions it has for years: common rules, non-binding, voluntary targets. A US department spokesperson said its priority was “to ensure a level playing field” – code for tying China to the same rules as all others. Of course, by flagging his intention to leave, Trump has significantly weakened his diplomats’ chances of protecting these goals.
Because of this, Obama’s most senior climate advisers, who devised great chunks of the Paris accord, are now working in the shadows to defend a vision of the deal that is broadly in line with the efforts of the defanged Trump state department. 
“It’s stupid to think that we would regard them [Stern and Biniaz] as the progressives,” says a former negotiator for a small island nation, noting that in Paris the US had been forceful in cutting off the most vulnerable countries on Earth from any form of reparation for damage they will incur from climate change. 
When countries meet in Katowice this month, Biniaz and Stern will be there. In the final days of the two-week marathon, negotiators will hit a wall. Issues they cannot agree on will be handed to ministers. At that point Chinese and US intransigence could hamper the Paris agreement. “Who will China’s climate chief Xie turn to in that moment?” asks Greenpeace adviser Li Shuo. Stern’s old job at the state department no longer exists. The US delegation will not have anyone at Xie’s ministerial level who knows the deal like Stern. 
For the most vulnerable nations on Earth, Trump’s election has had a little recognised, but insidious impact. In climate terms, it has shifted the emphasis away from improving the Paris agreement to defending it. Stern and Biniaz may well help rescue the deal, but will they want to make it more just?

The loss of share value and company profits are also mentioned. But nowhere do you discuss this in the wider terms of climate change. If the downturn in the economy means that there is less consumerism, then that is a good thing for the planet. The only way we are going to tackle the rising temperature and the ensuing disastrous results is to live simpler lifestyles; this means consuming much less of everything and not being so dependent on a capitalist society where a drop in sales is seen as a disaster.
It is sad that it has taken the mismanagement of this government to reduce consumerism; but more needs to be done with regard to education, enforcement and information about the effects of shipping produce all around the world. Until a drop in the retail market is seen as a benefit, there is no hope.Jackie JonesBrighton
• Michael Gove’s proposals for waste (Packaging producers to pay full recycling costs under waste scheme, 18 December) could progress faster, but they are welcome. However, the processing of currently non-recyclable plastic is not properly addressed. This is “all the other plastic crap that we burn”, as a senior manager in the recycling industry once told me. Included in this are toothpaste tubes, used Biros, crisp and chocolate wrappers, bits of toys, disposable razors, “string” bags for satsumas and onions etc. Every kilo burned creates three kilos of CO2, but it’s technically recyclable using a process called pyrolysis, which takes any plastic waste and converts it into diesel fuel or new plastic.
The items are small; scaled up, the volume is large. I have filled a two-litre drinks bottle every week. In developing countries, people cram it into plastic bottles with a stick to make ecobricks for construction. There’s limited potential for these as building material in the UK, but they could be brought into our recycling stream. I’m doubtful that current sorting processes can extract these bits and pieces, but if households were to change their habits and always have a plastic bottle on the go, they could be collected weekly as a clean source of renewable material that is easy to handle. Furthermore, children love doing it. Schools could make it part of every school day and receive incentives or rewards for the carbon captured and hydrocarbon reused. The environmental lesson would be of immense value.Patrick CosgroveChapel Lawn, Shropshire

The rapid spread of the movement, which consisted of 10 people in the UK six months ago, comes amid rising frustration with policymakers who are failing to slow perilous levels of global warming and biodiversity loss.
The distinctive banner of the group was evident at a rally on Saturday attended by several thousand climate campaigners in Katowice, the city hosting the conference. Campaigners also held Skype workshops for activists in Berlin, after training sessions in the US, Australia, Canada, Ireland, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Ghana and Poland.
“In the two months since our first action, we have expanded more than we imagined,” Liam Geary Baulch, an environmental activist, said. “We are now planning to change our structure so it can accommodate up to 2 million people.”
Extinction Rebellion rose to prominence last month when thousands of activists blocked five London bridges, glued themselves to public buildings and disrupted traffic with “swarming” protests that led to dozens of arrests.
This form of direct action has struck a chord in other countries. The Dutch activist Sjoerd de Koning said he would be among 60 people starting a chapter of the movement in The Hague next week.
“We saw what was going on in London and thought this is what we have been looking for for a long time – peaceful civil disobedience targeted at politicians,” he said. “There is a lot of energy in this movement and it’s global.”
In Poland, most environmental campaigns until now have been locally focused on issues such as smog in Silesia, deforestation in Białowieża and wetland destruction in Rospuda, but activists are starting to sign up to Extinction Rebellion, which some see as a potential umbrella organisation.
“We can all unite under this and make our voice heard,” said Izabella Mier, a member of a food sovereignty group. “It’s incredibly inspiring to bring different organisations together for a common goal. We’re looking for a way not just to be worried about climate change but to do something.”
The Warsaw chapter held its first meeting two weeks ago, when about 50 people watched a video about the bridge blocking actions.
Wiktor Kotowski, a wetland scientist at the University of Warsaw, signed up online and then printed his own Extinction Rebellion T-shirt, which he wore while speaking at a side event during the climate talks.
“After I heard the Polish president open the conference with a bullshit claim that we can protect the climate by burning coal, I thought I had to do something,” he said. “This is a moment when scientists should get more active in society. I’ve been thinking this for a couple of years.”
The movement has received mixed levels of support from other international climate campaign groups. The US-based 350.org – which has organised direct action protests against gas and oil pipelines – has been an enthusiastic backer, while Greenpeace has so far offered help only behind the scenes.
Extinction Rebellion organisers say it will be necessary for chapters in each country to adapt tactics according to the local political situations.
The challenge was highlighted in Poland by the government’s initial refusal to allow entry into the country by 350.org campaigners, reportedly on the grounds that they were a “threat to national security”. 
Unlike anti-World Trade Organization protesters, black-bloc anarchist groups or gilets jaunes demonstrations against austerity and fuel-tax rises in France, environmental campaigners say their actions have focused on non-violent civil disobedience.
On Sunday, 100 academics and other prominent backers of Extinction Rebellion called for people around the world to rise up and organise against the “paralysis” of political leaders.
“We must collectively do whatever’s necessary non-violently, to persuade politicians and business leaders to relinquish their complacency and denial,” the open letter stated, which was signed by Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein, Bill McKibben, and the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, among others.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/10/extinction-rebellion-goes-global-international-civil-disobedience-climate-talks-poland

Ricardo Salles, the former environment secretary for São Paulo state, was recommended for his new role by business and agribusiness groups and announced as minister in a tweet on Sunday by the far-right president-elect, Jair Bolsonaro.
Environmentalists said the appointment was a serious setback to protection at a time when deforestation and illegal mining in the Amazon were on the rise.
Bolsonaro has said protected Amazon areas hold up development, has advocated commercial farming and mining on indigenous reserves and attacked the “fines industry” of Brazil’s environmental agencies.
Marcio Astrini, the public policy director at Greenpeace Brazil, said Salles was “not chosen for his history of environmental protection. He was chosen because he accepts Bolsonaro’s agenda.” Astrini said neutering environmental agencies and reducing protected areas could make deforestation “explode”.
“This is not an environmental agenda. It is an agenda of threats to the environment,” he said.
Salles told the Folha de São Paulo newspaper on Sunday that Brazil suffered from a “proliferation” of environmental fines that had an “ideological character”. He questioned figures showing the highest deforestation in a decade and called the global warming debate “innocuous”.
“The discussion over whether there is or isn’t global warming is secondary,” he said. Asked if the new government, which takes office on 1 January, could exit the Paris climate deal – a threat made by Bolsonaro during campaigning, on which he later backed down – Salles said it would “look item by item at the most sensitive points … remembering that national sovereignty over territory is not negotiable”.
A lawyer who specialised in company administration, Salles was environment secretary of São Paulo state under the conservative governor Geraldo Alckmin. In 2017, São Paulo state prosecutors sued Salles for “administrative improbity”.
Prosecutors alleged in court documents that Salles took part in altering maps delineating an environmentally protected area in São Paulo state “with the clear intention of benefiting economic sectors, notably mining”.
Salles denied the accusations in his Folha interview and said he had highlighted “crass mistakes” in the “ideological work” that had been done in the environmental protection area concerned, adding that the state environment council had approved the plan. The case continues.
He stood unsuccessfully for Congress in October’s elections for the business-friendly New party, and has argued that Brazilian agribusiness is “under threat” and criticised the Landless Rural Workers Movement.
Salles was recommended for his new role by the Brazilian Rural Society – an agribusiness group, which aligns him with the new agriculture minister, Tereza Cristina, formerly president of the powerful agribusiness lobby in Congress.
The Climate Observatory (Observatório do Clima), a non-profit environmental network, said his appointment effectively fulfilled another Bolsonaro campaign promise to subordinate the ministry of environment to the ministry of agriculture. It warned of potential boycotts to Brazilian agricultural products if the country dismantled its environmental protection.
“Modern agribusiness will pay the price when markets close to our commodities,” it said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/10/environmental-fines-are-ideological-says-brazil-minister-ricardo-salles

Thunberg began a solo climate protest by striking from school in Sweden in August. But more than 20,000 students around the world have now joined her. The school strikes have spread to at least 270 towns and cities in countries across the world, including Australia, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the US and Japan.
“For 25 years countless people have come to the UN climate conferences begging our world leaders to stop emissions and clearly that has not worked as emissions are continuing to rise. So I will not beg the world leaders to care for our future,” she said. “I will instead let them know change is coming whether they like it or not.”
“Since our leaders are behaving like children, we will have to take the responsibility they should have taken long ago,” she said. “We have to understand what the older generation has dealt to us, what mess they have created that we have to clean up and live with. We have to make our voices heard.”
The conference of nearly 200 nations is taking place in Katowice, Poland, and its main task is to turn the vision of tackling global warming agreed in Paris in 2015 into concrete action. On Monday, Sir David Attenborough told the summit that without action “the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon”.
Thunberg, who had a meeting with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Monday, said: “What I hope we achieve at this conference is that we realise that we are facing an existential threat. This is the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced. First we have to realise this and then as fast as possible do something to stop the emissions and try to save what we can save.”
On Tuesday, Guterres said: “Our younger generations will have to help drive, and complete, the work we start today. We need to harness their energy, invention and political power to raise climate ambition.”
Toby Thorpe, a school student from Hobart, Tasmania, who took part in the recent school strikes in Australia and is also at the UN summit, said: “We are in this together. Together we are strong and we will not give up.” Australia’s resources minister, Matt Canavan, had dismissed the school strike – “the best thing you’ll learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole queue” – but the Senate later approved a motion in support of the students.
Thunberg said the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world was amazing. “It proves you are never too small to make a difference,” she said. Her protests was inspired by US school students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of school shootings. But initially her classmates refused to join in: “I had to do it alone.”
The first two weeks of Thunberg’s strike were spent protesting outside the Swedish parliament. Now she spends every Friday on strike. “I like school and I like learning,” she told the Guardian. She said her strike would end when Sweden begins cutting its carbon emissions by a dramatic 15% a year: “Sweden is such a rich country and we have high per capita emissions, so we need to reduce more [than others].”
She also had a message for other school students: “You don’t have to school strike, it’s your own choice. But why should we be studying for a future that soon may be no more? This is more important than school, I think.”
Thunberg’s father, Svante, said: “As a parent you cannot support your child striking from school. I said to her you have to go out and do it for yourself.” But he added: “It’s OK in the holidays.”
The Thunbergs are descendants of Svante Arrhenius, the Nobel-prize-winning scientist who in 1896 first calculated the greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide emissions. Thunberg’s father was named after him, and said much of Arrhenius’s work has stood the test of time, but not everything. “He thought we’d be [at today’s levels of warming] in 2,000 years’ time,” said Svante Thunberg.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit

The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, a potential 2020 presidential candidate, and Democratic socialist congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who campaigned on a “Green New Deal”, elicited cheers with promises of an economic boom from massive investment in renewable power.
“What we are trying to do tonight is be part of the revolution in terms of the need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and to not only save the planet but create millions of good-paying jobs in the process,” Sanders said.
Ocasio-Cortez said the climate movement was “going to be the Great Society, the moonshot, the civil rights movement of our generation”.
Speaking at the US Capitol, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez blamed corporations for taking advantage of people and oil and gas companies for ravaging the environment. Ocasio-Cortez said the media should cover the poor more.
Van Jones, a cable news commentator, and Bill McKibben, founder of the environmental group 350.org, sat in on panel discussions. One young activist rapped about the environment. A woman in the audience draped herself in a monarch butterfly cape.
“It is clear that it is the young people who are at the forefront of the movement,” Sanders said.
Some of the young people came looking for specific solutions to push lawmakers to support. Two Texas college students majoring in political science said before the event began that they showed up to hear more about Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal.
In the event, neither lawmaker discussed details or how to pursue them when Donald Trump has denied manmade climate change, planned to exit an international climate pact and slashed environmental protections.
Speakers framed the conversation around work that could begin in 2020, if Democrats take back the Senate and the White House. But scientists say the world must have plans in place soon to avoid the worst of a heating Earth.
Democratic leaders – even those who will soon be in charge in the House – do not have a strategy to ratchet down climate pollution. Ocasio-Cortez participated in a sit-in at the office of the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, to urge her to come up with a plan. Pelosi has said she will pursue restarting a select committee on climate change.

In September, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission published a report that said “the law requires” relevant companies to “include a discussion of climate risk” in their annual report.
Market Forces, a group that advocates for environmentally sustainable investment, assisted shareholders at company annual general meetings. Almost all of those companies ignored or dismissed climate change as a financial risk to their business.
“Directors are legally required to consider climate risk. Failure to do so may constitute a breach of their legal duties,” Market Forces campaigner Rachel Deans said.
“It appears directors are openly admitting to breaking the law at their shareholder meetings and Asic seems to be well aware of it.”At the Prairie Mining AGM, chairman Ian Middlemas was asked whether the board supported the Paris agreement targets. “It’s not on our radar,” he said.
“I think they are the sort of questions that are for people that are producing product and have got an actual operation. We’re just simply exploring.“So I’m not sure ... just trying to think of what’s a good example … it’s like if you have a toddler at home and someone asks which university will he go to, well the answer is ‘we will work it out when he is 18’.“I’d love us to be in a position where we have to have an idea about climate change, and an idea about Paris you know … what you just raised. But it’s sort of like having an idea of what happens in Sydney when you live in Perth.”
When asked whether Senex Energy followed a 2C or 3C climate increase target, the company’s chairman Trevor Bourne said: “We don’t operate our company on either.“Whether it is two or three [degrees] that is a bigger issue for the government to address. If they get off their backside and do something about it, it would make our investment decisions much clearer.”
In September Asic audited 60 companies and found only 10 identified climate as a material risk.
Among the findings of that report was that companies were legally bound to “include a discussion of climate risk when it could affect the entity’s achievement of its financial performance or disclosed outcomes”.
“Directors should also consider the requirement to include any relevant analytical comments and specify how risk factors that are within the control of management will be managed.”A legal opinion, written for the Centre for Policy Development, warned of potential consequences for a lack of disclosure.
“It is likely only a matter of time before we see litigation against a director who has failed to perceive, disclose or take steps in relation to a foreseeable climate-related risk that can be demonstrated to have caused harm to a company,” the opinion said.
Deans said it was not just a legal requirement, but also a responsible business practice.
“Shareholders are frustrated that companies are not looking at the financial risks climate change poses to their business,” she said. “It is likely we will see more cases of directors being sued if they don’t start taking climate risk seriously.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/05/australian-mining-giants-may-be-breaking-law-by-ignoring-climate-change-risks

But will we? Representatives from almost 200 nations are currently meeting in the Polish coal-mining town of Katowice to try to turn the pledges made in Paris in 2015 into a political reality. There are, with children in Australia walking out of school to protest the climate inaction, signs of generational optimism. On the other hand, we have Donald Trump dismissing his own government’s climate report, while the incoming Bolsonaro administration is refusing to host next year’s climate talks in Brazil. There is still time to save the world but at the moment, Robin McKie writes, a climate catastrophe looks inevitable – and everywhere will be affected. With the White House actively uninterested in the process in Poland, a key role will fall to Obama’s “climate diaspora” – a group of former state department climate officials now working in the private sector who are doing all they can to protect the goals agreed in Paris. In a fascinating piece, Karl Mathiesen profiles the likes of Sue Biniaz and Todd Stern, who are trying to save the Paris accord from their own president.
As Emmanuel Macron sat with other G20 leaders in Buenos Aires, the group of tax protesters known as the gilets jaunes held a third weekend of demonstrations. The violence in France brought the government to crisis point. The battle with the “yellow vests” is the biggest challenge to Macron since he took office last May, writes our Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis. We also look at who the protesters are, what they want – and how French fuel costs (the catalyst for the uprising) compare to those in the rest of Europe. Elsewhere this week, there was a detente in the ongoing trade battle between the United States and China. Our economics editor Larry Elliott warns that, with protectionism playing well with US voters, carmakers shouldn’t count their chickens. In Honduras, the killers of environmental activist Berta Cáceres were found guilty and, in Germany, a trio of candidates are lining up to replace Angela Merkel as leader of the Christian Democrats.

As Sir David Attenborough told the UN climate change conference in Poland, “the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon”. We have even worked out, with scrupulous care, what we must do to avoid this or to mitigate the effects of climate change. We know what to do. We can see how to do it. There’s only one problem: we do almost nothing.
Figures released today by the University of East Anglia for the conference in Katowice show that global carbon emissions will be higher than ever before this year. In fact they will rise by nearly 3%, an astonishing and terrifying annual figure at a time when the need to diminish them has never been more urgent. The main driver of this growth has been the increased use of coal, which is rapidly approaching its previous peak level, from 2013. There is a particular irony in that this conference is being held in Poland, a country that still derives 80% of its electricity from coal, even if this is less grossly polluting than it was in the Communist era. In fact emissions there are down 30% from their peak in 1988. But far more must be done. To limit global warming to the Paris agreement goal of 1.5C, CO2 emissions would need to decline by 50% by 2030 and reach net zero by around 2050.
All this destructive activity far outweighs the progress that has been made on the use of renewable resources. That is considerable, but so long as renewables are understood only as a pastime for the rich, they will be wholly insufficient to meet the problems before us. The Paris goal often looks like a drunkard’s resolution that everything will be different as soon as tomorrow comes. Everything has stayed much the same, and the balance of expert opinion is that three degrees is now more likely than the target figure of half that.
It’s not just coal. China is now the biggest emitter of carbon, followed by the US and the EU as a whole, then India, Russia, and Japan. Oil use continues to grow. The worldwide demand for energy is outpacing efforts to deal its climate-altering side effects. In a characteristically greedy and destructive way, the Trump administration proposes to destroy one of the last great Arctic wildlife reserves in order to drill for oil there. The great oil-producing nations of Saudi Arabia and Iran both figure among the top 10 carbon-emitting countries despite having hardly any other components to their economies. Add to this the effects of deforestation in the Amazon, which will accelerate under the Bolsonaro government, and the future looks unimaginably grim. Climate change will exacerbate, as it already does, the world’s existing political and economic divisions.
The most worrying feature of the latest UN report is the suggestion that the relatively good performance of the years 2014-16 in reducing carbon emissions was the result of an economic slowdown. The political consequences of the resulting discontent are with us still. They produced Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro and gravely weakened the EU. All those factors make a sane policy on climate change less likely. The purely physical feedback loops that drive climate change, such as the reduction of reflective ice surface, are now well enough understood. But it may be that the long-term message of the years since the Paris summit is that this understanding is not enough. We must also learn somehow to disrupt the political and economic feedback loops which are driving our civilisation to the brink of catastrophe.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/05/the-guardian-view-on-climate-change-too-much-too-soon

The change is mostly symbolic – but nevertheless sends a strong signal. Companies in the US are not building plants that burn coal because burning natural gas is cheaper and creates less pollution. Renewable power has also eaten into coal’s market share.
But the Obama-era rule for new coal plants has long been a target of the industry. It would have effectively required technology to capture the carbon dioxide that traps heat on earth and causes climate change. That technology is not in use on a commercial scale. A draft replacement rule would allow new coal plants that meet certain efficiency requirements.
The acting Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Andrew Wheeler, said the Obama administration was “disingenuous” when it decided coal-plant carbon capture technologies were adequately demonstrated. He said the change to require efficiency efforts instead of carbon capture will encourage “clean coal” in the US and worldwide through technology exports.
“You will see a decrease in emissions worldwide because of an increase in investments in new energy technologies,” Wheeler argued.
The EPA’s own economic analysis contradicts him. It concludes that the rollback will not do anything to boost coal power in the US because any new fossil fuel plants will burn natural gas, not coal.
Wheeler argued affordable energy benefits low-income people most and invited the National Black Chamber of Commerce to speak as a supporter. Experts say, however, that coal plants are shutting down because they aren’t as affordable as other options.
Michelle Bloodworth, CEO of the coal industry group the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, said ahead of the event that “there is no silver bullet when it comes to developing new coal units in today’s marketplace but in announcing this proposal the EPA has outlined a regulation that both follows the law and allows new more efficient coal plants to be a viable option in the future.”
Nixing the rule could invigorate coal backers worldwide, sending a message to negotiators of an international climate pact in Poland that the US is trying to bolster the future of the fossil fuel. Trump, who has questioned manmade climate change, has said he will exit that pact, the Paris agreement.
David Doniger, a climate director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move “will be judged harshly by future generations”.
“The science is clear: operating large fossil fuel plants without carbon capture and storage is a disaster for the climate. What we need instead is swift and decisive action to curb dangerous climate change,” Doniger said.
Fifteen health and medical groups, including the American Lung Association, opposed the EPA announcement.
Across the federal government, Trump agencies have sought to slash rules for fossil fuel production and use. The environmental protection agency is also rescinding an Obama rule that aimed to shift the US away from coal use and toward more natural gas and renewable power. And the agency is expected to roll back a standard requiring coal plants to limit their toxic mercury pollution. Many plants shut down in 2015, in part so that they wouldn’t have to spend money to comply with that rule.
This year, coal use in the US is expected to be at its lowest point since 1979, according to the energy information administration. Coal consumption has fallen 44% since its peak in 2007, the agency said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/06/trump-rolls-back-climate-change-rule-that-restricted-new-coal-plants

In an op-ed in the Washington Post and a letter to Trump, the New York Democrat said that his party “will have an extraordinary opportunity to force action on climate change” after taking control of the House of Representatives in the recent midterm elections.
Infrastructure has been viewed as one area – perhaps the only area – where Trump and Democrats could strike a deal to advance significant legislation. Trump is mounting another push for a $1bn package to upgrade roads, bridges and railways across the country.
However, Trump has repeatedly and controversially expressed skepticism about climate change, including calling it a hoax.
Schumer said that for Democrats to get behind an infrastructure package, it must include money and policy changes to promote renewable energy, and harden US infrastructure against damage from climate change.
“For too long, Congress has failed to act in a meaningful way to combat the threat posed by climate change,” he wrote in the op-ed. “Powerful special interests have a stranglehold on many of my Republican colleagues; some GOP legislators even refuse to acknowledge that climate change is happening.”
Trump’s administration last month issued a report warning of dire consequences from climate change, but the White House sought to bury the assessment and Trump said he does not accept its conclusions. “I don’t believe it,” he said.
His administration is easing carbon emissions standards for new coal-fired power plants.
Schumer, in his letter to Trump, said an infrastructure package should include tax incentives for production of clean electricity, energy-efficient homes and office buildings, and electric vehicles.
He also proposed federal spending on transportation, water, waste and sewer systems that will be more resistant to damage from the stronger storms fueled by a warming world. And he said a package should fund energy-efficient upgrades to public buildings, and restrict methane emissions from power plants.
Schumer cited the wildfires that have ravaged California and damaging hurricanes this season as evidence that climate change is an “existential threat”.
“Climate change is real, caused by humans, and its impacts are already being felt in communities across the country,” he said. 
If it does not include at least some of the climate proposals, the minority leader said Trump’s infrastructure bill “should not count on Democratic support in the Senate”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/07/democrats-trump-infrastructure-deal-climate-change-schumer

‘We do not know what truth is in the ethical sense. Truth is a question of what facts are selected or omitted in support (of) an ideologocal narrative’.Factually one may remember Plato in this respect.However, an absolute ethical relativism is absurd. There is not yet that much nihilism that it is usual and accepted that people are killed everywhere on the streets because of different opinions, to say it very bluntly. A fact is that it happens, which indicates different ethical standards. A fact is too that children may be raised by ethical standards, may it be for their family’s and social comforts.Agreeing with you on ‘cultural nationalism’ used against supranational regulation of capitalism, especially in the uk and usa, one may question too which culture is that common in a country ( in other countries it has been hard to find). Imho it is always valuable to consider that a a more nuanced approach might be achieved by a political system which is not dominated by definition by 2 main parties.Experiencing political systems with a variety of political parties may lead to the conclusion that one may test each other’s ‘truths’ or values, may more or less respect them, while being aware of the fact that one needs to compromise to govern, in order to have more than the needed 50% of the votes which are represented by more than 50% of parliamentarians. Moreover, one may regard not only the short-term, but also the long-term needs (f.i to secure the country against floods); also because political parties may be confronted with the consequences of their own decisions.In the uk and the usa internal discussions inside political parties may have the same considerations, be it that these discussions are not always public, and the public might not pay attention to these considerations that often.Anyway, not any system may be perfect, but there are differences in many respects.Agreeing too on your questioning of ‘moderate’: it may be different per country, and it may be different too in time.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1544293048000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'different opinions', u'effect': u'that people are killed everywhere on the streets to say it very bluntly'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'the conclusion that one may test each other \u2019s \u2019'}, {u'cause': u'also political parties may be confronted with the consequences of their own decisions', u'effect': u'moreover one may regard not only the short term'}], u'author_id': u'15685422', u'in_reply_to': u'123476514', u'id': u'123479980', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'jifferyvtwo', u'text': u'When I listen to the BBC R4 Today programme, I am dismayed by the presenters' and ""political experts'"" lack of interest in subject matter.

The Treaty of Rome brought about the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC), the best-known of the European Communities (EC). It was signed on 25 March 1957 by Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany and came into force on 1 January 1958. It remains one of the two most important treaties in the modern-day European Union (EU).

Almost always some people will counter with articles from other, alternative, news sites which, of course, portray his actions in a completely different light and which would appear on the surface to disprove the thrust of the original post.
And then it does not matter how many other sources they are shown, they resolutely stick to the version they have read for themselves on the sites where they have found their opinions echoed and refuse to even countenance the possibility that they might be wrong.

Powerfully appropriate observation.
As the 20th C developed through the darkest pit of depravity, faced unimaginable man-made horror, there were great figures and great minds to plot a course. Lloyd George, Keynes, Churchill, all had weight and reach. Churchill for all the flaws, and there were many (given to psychotic 19th C public school indifference to suffering in the name of national greatness), had a ballast keel purchase in the storm and could always foresee beyond the immediate difficulty (he knew Britain had a 50/50 chance of surviving as an island fortress through aerial ability, and had long read the trumped up dictator's next move as inevitably throwing the Wehrmacht's mighty dice into the mouth of the Russian bear and losing. 
Today there are no great figures to face the impending catastrophe of the Anthropocene. No leadership at all. When was the last time you heard a Churchillian speech about facing the challenge of this millennium? May and Corbyn whittling on about Brexit or austerity, Trump some 1950s claptrap about taking America back to being the workshop of the world, Merkel, well, what? Macron? What? Going back Obama? What? Being nice and fair to all folks? Bush, fighting poor terror groups by smashing them with a ""Hulk smash"" fist? There's nothing that sets the pulse racing, about how we can wake up and become what the Enlightenment once promised, a rational, wise, intelligent species, yes we can listen to physics, cosmology, NASA and the best of the world’s academy, we “can” make a better world unified by the collective challenge of global survival and create a much better, cleaner world. And why? Fear? The corruption and rot in the media and lobby system? legalized corruption in the West? a moral corruption that means our species is addicted to only incremental change based on a tame and servile leadership? Think of the White House. Someone like Obama who could talk, both he and his wife could write, he always kept his powder dry with incremental change on energy and pollution because he believed the leadership required was beyond him and his round of advisers. So there were no rousing speeches except now then almost off the cuff, because he believed his administration would have been murdered by the corruption in Congress, online and in the media as it was over healthcare. The global infrastructure of political-economic organization simply swamps the best of wills and puts out any flame. 
Yet Trump proves that a radical wrecking ball to the system can in part succeed. The only problem is the man is a complete whack job moron who doesn’t even know what millennium he’s in and makes a Mussolini look like a genius. Imagine a Churchill in his place with a huge brain and fire in the belly for creating a new world of smart and clean growth, of forging a global pact to fight the corruption that hinders radical technological and innovative infrastructure change. Pie in the sky? Of course. Times have changed. Until someone really breaks the mould because it’s ready to fracture. Not service a reality TV show clown moment*.

That’s why we cannot deal with crisis | Ian Jack,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/08/age-lacks-gravitas-brexit-coverage,0,"What is a national crisis? Eighty years ago the social researchers Charles Madge and Tom Harrisson decided it was “one of those things, like epidemics and earthquakes, which suddenly arrive to threaten the security of ordinary lives. In the ordinary way, the interest of private people in public events is fitful and vague: at times of crisis it extends and increases.” As the founders of the Mass Observation project in 1937, the first crisis Madge and Harrisson and their hundreds of volunteer diarists had examined was the fallout from the abdication in December 1936 of Edward VIII. But then in September 1938 came Munich, and Neville Chamberlain’s three trips to meet Hitler to avert the outbreak of war. This was a crisis of a different order: the United Kingdom experienced nothing like it again in peacetime until the present post-referendum years of bitter division and anxiety.
Some of the personal reactions recorded by Mass Observation in 1938 feel remarkably familiar. “It’s a fucking mess, ain’t it?” “No one knows what’ll happen.” “I can’t understand it properly, but it doesn’t seem too good to me.” In London at the height of the crisis, a 38-year-old woman writes: “We don’t bother much about it … not because we are not thinking about it. Life’s too short to keep on with war, war, war.” And another woman adds: “Oh, when I see the paper I turn the page over. Suppose it’s because I’m windy …”
If we want to see the world differently and, just possibly, avert the collapse, we need different kinds of information
I catch sight of my own behaviour in these last two reactions: my need to escape what passes for reality by switching off shows such as BBC1’s Question Time, or exchanging Radio 4’s Today programme for music on Radio 3. On Thursday’s edition of Today an unrepentant leave voter in Bedford gave Nick Robinson a biscuit analogy (perhaps inspired by the comedian Peter Kay) in which the UK had behaved like “a soggy rich tea” in its negotiations with the “solid Hobnob” that was the EU. “If we’d have sent a Hobnob with chocolate on we’d have won,” he said, suggesting Alan Sugar as the best man for the job. All of this was said seriously. He might have been the 40-year-old chauffeur who in 1938, when asked his opinion on what should be done, replied: “Keep out of foreign entanglements, that’s best. Old England’s the best country in the world.” Certain feelings endure.
What has changed is the media’s tone. In 1938, another world war was certainly a more frightening prospect than the national belittlement that faces us now; even so, the coverage of Brexit deserves a register that has gone missing. Gravity may be the word. We have forgotten how to be grave.
In 1938, Mass Observation saw its primary purpose as drilling through the patriotic rhetoric of Fleet Street newspapers to the land that Irish poet Louis MacNeice described as “the kingdom of individuals”. Newspaper editorials spoke confidently and generally. According to the Daily Mail: “The British nation unreservedly places its complete trust in the prime minister, Mr Neville Chamberlain.” A London evening paper, the Star, began an editorial: “ENGLAND SPEAKS. The country remains admirably calm in these hours of deepening crisis … It is the steady spirit of a nation that has made up its mind and faces the future unafraid.”
Madge and Harrisson noted that the trouble with this kind of statement wasn’t that it was true or false – the trouble was the assumption on the newspaper’s part that it didn’t need to find out. “More subtle,” they wrote, were the statements that appealed to facts without establishing the facts objectively. It was here that the fabulous figure, the Man in the Street, played a key role. According to one writer, the Man in the Street had made up his mind that Hitler was “the supreme menace to the peace of the world” and until he was “in some way disposed of” nobody could sleep easy. Other Men in the Street backed Chamberlain’s approach and believed it would save Europe from war. Only when Madge and Harrisson did some elementary research did a much more complicated picture emerge of fear, bewilderment, anger, resolve and ignorance, in proportions that changed among the public as the crisis advanced.
The writers blamed the British press’s inadequate and almost mendacious coverage of British public opinion on the people they described as “the Intellectual Few”; editors who rarely met “ordinary people” or, when it came to big political questions, encouraged their reporters to discover what they felt. Similar criticism is directed today at the “metropolitan liberal elite”. In 1938, Mass Observation could differentiate between newspapers committed to foreign and political and news coverage for “the administrative and professional classes” and the mass-circulation papers for which “a plane crash in Edmonton is front-page news, when a war in Spain is crowded right out of the paper”.
In their irreverence and sentimentality, and their interest in celebrity and the sensational, British newspapers and the broadcast media are now much closer to the audiences they pursue. News – including political news – has become a kind of entertainment. How many ministers will resign today? Did you see Corbyn mess up again? It may be no less informative, but in the telling a formal style of address has almost vanished, to be heard occasionally and eccentrically in the announcements of royal birthdays that come before the early-morning bulletins. And sometimes formality is desirable, as a way to dignify our grief or apprehension: not for nothing do undertakers wear black.
The present crisis will shrink soon enough. Compared with other crises circling in the stack and waiting to land – species extinction, human population growth, mass migration, resource exhaustion – Brexit is small stuff, a pointless distraction. But how can news bulletins cope with these things? How should they be ranked? A bearded man carrying a sandwich board – “The End is Nigh” – was once a familiar character in cartoons, but now the joke falls flat. “Collapse of civilisation is on the horizon” was how the Guardian headlined its report of David Attenborough’s speech this week to the UN’s climate summit in Poland. It appeared on the front page, though it was not the lead item.
If we want to see the world differently and, just possibly, avert the collapse, we need different kinds of information. What has mattered until now is money. The indices that appear without fail – fixed on the printed page and changing on the screen – show the fluctuations of the FTSE 100, the Nikkei, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq and the currency exchange rates. Imagine if instead the same little boxes showed the average global temperature, the extent of Arctic sea ice, the rise in sea level and the parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere. Day by day, the changes would be tiny – consoling in their minuteness. Comparison with the same set of figures for the same day 20 years before would be needed to show their ominous development.
There they would be: sober, factual, grave and rarely consulted; but always warning against the ultimate crisis, like an old-fashioned sermon on hell.

Huntley says her work increasingly shows voters broadly connect environmental issues such as climate change, energy, clean air and water, food security and waste with capacity for leadership.
“Voters have looked at both parties falling apart on climate change and now it’s as if the leader who can decide on climate change and environment policy and get their party to stick and still walk out the door intact is the real leader,” Huntley said.
“Environment has almost become a proxy for leadership capability at a federal level in the same way capacity to deal with infrastructure has been a proxy for leadership at a state level, as we just saw in Victoria.”
In conjunction with the Cultural and Indigenous Research Centre Australia (CIRCA), Huntley of Vox Populi Research, carried out qualitative research for the Wilderness Society and the Nature Conservation Council of NSW.
It was aimed at understanding voter perceptions of the current federal government on environmental issues and the issues that are cutting through and concerning voters.
The research deliberately targeted swinging voters who lived in outer suburban areas while excluding Greens voters. CIRCA also excluded anyone who were solely focused on environmental issues as well as those who strongly agreed that there was too much government regulation related to environmental protection.
The report said environmental issues were important to participants generally and were placed in the top three or top five depending on other concerns, such as whether they saw environment issues as connected to issues such as health and future economic prosperity.
“The first thing is people have assumed that the recent plateau in the Greens vote, given the intense dislike of the two major parties and range of issues, means the environment is not an important issue,” Huntley said.
“However it’s more that environment now encapsulates a broader suite of issues and it kicks in for people as to whether government is future focused, whether government can confront issues that are not straightforward and whether government can face the people [and companies] who give them money [political donors] at election times.”
Her comments come after independent Kerryn Phelps campaigned hard on climate change before winning Malcolm Turnbull’s seat of Wentworth. Daniel Andrews Labor government was returned with an increased majority – a result which Liberal Senate president Scott Ryan said was a result of the Liberal party straying too far from its moderate “electoral base” in a clear nod to centrist voters.
Tony Abbott also faces a tough campaign in his blue ribbon Liberal seat of Warringah from a range of community groups and activists, who rank environmental issues as high on their agenda.
At the same time, the opposition is under pressure from the Labor Environment Action Network (Lean), which has warned the ALP ahead of its December conference that it will not give up on securing a significant overhaul of federal environment laws in the first term of a Shorten government.
Unprompted, voters mentioned water health, waste and recycling and rapid urbanisation as their top environmental concerns in Huntley’s research. Groups were also asked to rank their top concerns from a list and they nominated climate change and “weak or ineffective laws” over forest logging, threatened species, coal seam gas mining, coal mining and deforestation/tree clearing.
Topics raised in a general environmental discussion included “climate change, rubbish in parks and national parks, decreasing wild life, and the impact of both rampant consumerism and rapid urbanisation on the environment”.
“Participants reflected on the deterioration of natural areas of personal importance to them over time,” Huntley’s report says.
Participants believed “while all levels of government needed to play a role (ideally in a collaborative way) the federal government could provide the framework and was best placed to provide incentives for good environmental behaviour”.
Asked who were the worst environmental offenders, unprompted, participants listed fracking and logging industries, oil and fuel companies, “big business”, manufacturing, transport and consumerism in general.
The CIRCA research found overall, participants believed federal governments had the the ultimate responsibility for protecting the environment.
Participants nominated trusted sources of information on the environment as high profile science communicators like David Attenborough, Brian Cox, David Suzuki, Karl Kruszelnicki, Steve and Bindi Irwin and Craig Reucassel’s ABC program, War on Waste. The CSIRO remains the most trusted government body on environmental issues.
Separate analysis by the Wilderness Society of the 2016 Australian Electoral Study data by the Australian National University found 23.8% who identified the environment as “extremely important” in how they voted were not always loyal to one party. This equates to around 3.2 million non-loyal environmentally-concerned (NLEC) voters.
At the 2016 election, 22% of NLEC voters voted for the Liberal party; 33% for Labor, 2% for the National Party, 23% for the Greens and 19% for other parties or independents.
The NLEC 2016 Liberal voters self-identify as centrists in the AES data. When asked to locate the parties on the same left to right spectrum, these voters self-identify as sitting between the Liberal party and the Labor party, well to the right of the Greens.
The Wilderness Society’s federal policy director Tim Beshara said the AES data showed Australians across the political spectrum were concerned about both climate change and the natural environment. But there are cohorts of swinging voters who were environmentally concerned and up for grabs.
“There are some voters who self-identify as left-leaning and environmentally-concerned, and yet there are also another cohort who self-identify as centrist and environmentally concerned,” Beshara said.
“The former cohort is up for grabs over environment issues between Labor and the Greens, but the latter cohort is largely a competition between Labor and the Liberal party.
“So, given the shift to the right by the government, this cohort has found themselves more ideologically distant from them and potentially up for grabs over environmental issues. The problem for Labor though is that, rightly or wrongly, most of these voters don’t rate Labor highly on this issue, in the same way that say, they’d rate them on Medicare.”
Huntley said the AES data analysis by the Wilderness Society reflects the same messages that come up in her focus groups.
She said one of the issues that was raised by voters in 2018 was the concern over relying on China to take recycling waste and relying on Tesla founder Elon Musk to solve the power storage problem in South Australia.
“There is a weirdly patriotic vein to the views i.e. why are we relying on China?” Huntley said.
“There is a satellite of concerns around the environment that tap into a broad level of concerns for everything, which means there is an up-for-grabs voter. A Labor voter might go Green or it may push a conservative to say screw it, I’ll go for an independent.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/09/next-election-test-of-leadership-on-climate-and-the-environment

The 414 global investors - which represent US$31 trillion of assets-under-management - say they are deeply concerned about the “ambition gap” that exists between governments’ commitments and what is needed to limit the global temperature increase to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels.
They say that gap is increasing the physical risks from climate change and hampering investors’ ability to properly allocate trillions of dollars needed to support the much-needed transition to a low carbon economy.
They have signed a “Global Investor Statement” to be handed to world leaders this week at the COP24 - the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Poland.
The signatories include some of the world’s largest pension funds, asset managers and insurance companies, including Australian investors BT Financial Group, Australian Super, Cbus, HESTA, IFM Investors, Local Government Super, and VicSuper.
It is the single largest intervention from investors on climate change, surpassing even the one issued in Paris.
The investor statement includes recommendations for governments on the specific steps the investors believe are needed to support a low carbon transition.
Among specific policies, they request governments “phase out thermal coal power”, “put a meaningful price on carbon” and “phase out fossil fuel subsidies.”
The three major areas for government action are:
Achieve the Paris Agreement’s goals – update nationally-determined contributions to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, to complete the process no later than 2020
Accelerate private sector investment into the low carbon transition – put a meaningful price on carbon, phase out fossil fuel subsidies by set deadlines, and phase out thermal coal power worldwide by set deadline.
Commit to improve climate-related financial reporting
The intervention comes as findings of a recent UN report show that nations must triple their efforts to meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement.
Chris Newton, the executive director of responsible investment, IFM Investors, which has $81bn in assets under management, says the long-term nature of the problem of climate change has met with a “zombie-like response” from policymakers.
“This is a recipe for disaster as the impacts of climate change can be sudden, severe and catastrophic,” he said.
“We need our infrastructure assets to continue to provide essential services to communities and economies around the world. We have a duty to our investors to act for the long term when others are clearly sidestepping the challenge”.
The global investment manager Schroders, a signatory to the statement, warned recently that current global policies implied long-run temperature rises of around 4°C, with $23 trillion of associated global economic losses over the next 80 years – representing permanent economic damage three or four times the scale of the impacts of the 2008 global financial crisis.
The investors are also calling for the phase out of coal power worldwide.
They have welcomed growing support for the global “Powering Past Coal Alliance,” which was launched by the UK and Canada, and which now has 28 national government signatories, alongside other sub-national and corporate supporters.
Australia is not a signatory to the alliance, but the Australian Capital Territory government is.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/10/largest-ever-group-of-global-investors-call-for-more-action-to-meet-paris-targets

I should confront the dying of my light, not with rage, but with gratitude to a generous planet and remorse for my profligacy.
BQEND
How elegantly stated that is. I feel exactly the same way, and am very remorseful about my profligacy. I can say 'I didn't know' when I was a child, but then I had little control over what I consumed. That was not true as I became an adult. I knew that the petrol I burned, the pesticides and herbicides I used were harmful. I didn't know that the plastics I embraced and the carbon from that petrol, were to doom us so quickly, if at all.
I know better now. There is a great outcry for 'them', 'the government', and some 'others' to do what needs to be done, but I can only think of my personal responsibility now. We can't wait for 'them' for this, or for much else either.
For some reason I have been thinking a lot about the landscape of my childhood. The trees, grass, water and animals. I can see that it has changed a great deal, and that my grandchildren will never see what I saw.

Goodwill is a wonderful way to describe what I have thought of as 'mellowing'. I am less judgemental, less critical, and I hope, much kinder than I used to be.

I fully agree. I think that the best way to achieve this in the current threatening circumstances is not through voluntary work, although I have been a voluntary social artist for almost 40 years. It must be the job of millions of us. If we can be profitably employed to love each other in all sorts of practical ways, we will no longer be condemned to find work in the destructive throw-away consumer society. 
I would love to see, for example, lots of social artists profitably connecting us directly in public places, amongst other things; the basis of the ""green economy"" I outlined in an earlier posting is that our greatest asset is ourselves. We all have a lot we could give each other and we all have a lot we would love to receive from each other. So, our basic material needs covered, let´s evolve an economy that is centred on us and not on what we possess....
....and judging by the content of news programmes, the exponential growth of online gambling, the plague of entertainingly violent TV programmes, films and video games, our global surrender to the conquest of the screen industries, etc, we human being animals are dearly in need of a lot of skillful loving attention.

The question of obsession with growth is not confined to recent comfort-seeking consumer generations. The Catholic Church has urged its followers to multiply for centuries - to have more future contributors to its coffers, no doubt!
About growth itself, the problem is with the type of growth we are obsessed with. The Industrial Revolution shifted power away from monarchs and their territorial conquests to increase revenues and towards manufacturers and manufactured profits. It has been they who have pushed materialism and because it was and still is profitable to them.
Now they face losing future profits because of contaminating over - production today. It would be in their interest to develop non-material, non-destructive ways of making profits. And there is a way to do this. 
Through a humanised money supply. When I give informal talks on this I often give the example of an Electorate who greatly value people coming to the end of their lives in the best possible way, as dying is common to us all.
What if this Electorate decide that those who care for dependent people generate both their salary and a profit? This salary plus added-on profit is the new money supply, which could kick start a ""green economy"". The investment of this profit could permit this safe economy to grow and take over a greater share of the overall economy, thereby reducing the dangerous non-green one.
Talking about this idea of setting up a ""green economy"" in the community cafe could soften the remorse for a life-time of material indulgence through, at last, learning the lesson and being active in not only effectively combating climate change but also humanising the economy with work that turns on the quality of ""us"" rather than the quality, and quantity, of the things we possess.
Think about it.

I want it to be my legacy | Stewart Dakers",article,http://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/11/goodwill-christmas-human-race,0,"My crumbly crew are having coffee at the community centre after its annual carol concert and Charlie hits his usual glass-half-empty note. Trouble is, he’s right. Goodwill seems pretty thin on the ground nowadays, wherever you look. Wars and rumours of wars, famine, drought, fires, floods, plagues among the people, pestilence among the beasts, it’s all beginning to sound a tad apocalyptic. An end time has begun, or so it seems.
End time is something on which we elders have authority: reminders of its imminence fill our days. As a life with any future purpose evaporates, dissatisfaction with the present becomes my lingua franca as I acknowledge my redundancy. I become, like Charlie, querulous and fault-finding as I lose touch with the world, its language, its mores, and its business.
However, if I am honest, I am faced with a most inconvenient truth. If social literacy has morphed into narcissism, if civic ethics have been exchanged for consumer loyalty cards, that’s my doing, because today’s world is yesterday’s creation and I am yesterday’s man. I am responsible. But these are minor issues, a form of displacement activity to shield me from acknowledging my contribution to a darker crisis, for which my generation is largely responsible: the human obsession with growth, comfort and convenience that has poisoned the air, contaminated the seas, intoxicated the soil and barbarised its creatures.
Nowhere is our hubris better illustrated than by our describing the crisis as a planetary issue. It isn’t the planet that’s in crisis, simply its top predator. Our fellow inhabitants of Earth are praying for the end of the Anthropocene era – which is surely better described as the androcene, in recognition of its primary authority.
We have been here before. Our species spent 200,000 childhood years refining the social contract as subordinate residents. Then, around 17,000 years ago, we experienced our first episode of global warming when the thaw ended the ice age. It produced the same degree of societal and elemental chaos that will occur this time. We emerged to dominate the globe as tooled-up owner-occupiers. The next stage of our evolution will hopefully empower us as adults to be custodial tenants of our exuberant planet.
This is an evolutionary moment and how we address this prospect will be our legacy and that’s where the crumbly perspective may be of use, because I am experiencing on a personal level what our species is facing on a global dimension. When my end comes, my legacy for those who survive me will depend on the manner in which I departed, either as curmudgeonly life-denier or gracious celebrant. I should confront the dying of my light, not with rage, but with gratitude to a generous planet and remorse for my profligacy.
Goodwill should be my legacy: like a dog, goodwill is for life, not just for Christmas, and I should bow out benevolently. This will not avert the end time but it may inform the mindset of the next epoch of our remarkable species and earn it the right finally to be called sapiens.

Speaking as City Hall outlined its new climate change plan, Khan said he was implementing measures to protect people from floods, fires and the political upheaval caused by climate change. He accused central government of “dragging its feet” on dealing with these issues.
“We are in the midst of a climate emergency which poses a threat to our health, our planet and our children and grandchildren’s future,” Khan told the Guardian. “City Hall is doing everything in our power to mitigate the risk in London but the stark reality is that we need urgent government action and funding.”
The acknowledgement of the scale and nature of the ecological crisis by the leader of one of the world’s major cities comes amid growing concern about the impact of climate change. A succession of scientific reports have laid bare the scale of the unfolding disaster, including one from the UN that said there were only 12 years left to avert the most extreme consequences of climate breakdown.
On Sunday 100 academics, philosophers and authors wrote to the Guardian to back a new civil disobedience group – Extinction Rebellion – and called for people around the world to rise up and organise against the “paralysis” of political leaders.
Khan’s intervention follows that of civic leaders in the UK and around the world. Last month Bristol declared a climate emergency and set a goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2030, while Manchester said it would become “carbon zero” by 2038. Both are more ambitious than the UK’s national target of an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050. It follows similar moves by several US cities.
London’s existing plan, unveiled by Khan in May, was for the city to be carbon neutral by 2050. But last week the London Assembly passed a motion saying that target should be brought forward to 2030 and called on Khan to draw up “a specific emergency plan”.
Caroline Russell from the Green party, who proposed the motion, said it was crucial Khan backed a more radical target and called on the government to give him the appropriate powers and funding.
“Catastrophic climate breakdown might be as little as 12 years away,” she said. “This would have profound impacts on every aspect of our lives in London from flooding and overheating in summers, disruption in our food supply chains as well as in the wider natural world.
“The mayor needs to be at the forefront of this challenge, declaring a climate emergency and an urgent updating of his carbon reduction targets to make London carbon neutral by 2030, decades ahead of his current plans, setting a precedent for other major and world cities.”
Khan said he had already introduced a series of measures to tackle climate breakdown – from investing £500m in low carbon technologies to divesting pension funds from fossil fuels.
But he said a City Hall analysis due to be published on Wednesday showed London would need a huge programme of investment as well as new powers to bring forward its zero-carbon target to 2030. The cash would be used to:
• Retrofit hundreds of thousands of homes and offices to make them more energy efficient.
• Decarbonise the national grid.
• Install low-carbon heating systems, such as heat pumps.
• Move private and public transport away from diesel and petrol, and towards electric.
Khan said: “My message to ministers is clear – stop dragging your feet and gambling with our future and give London and cities across the UK the real powers and funding needed to protect our future generations.”
The Green party welcomed Khan’s move and backed his call for more help from central government. But Russell said there was more that could be done now. “Sadiq should start this mission by cancelling the Silvertown road tunnel and fighting harder against things that will make the climate crisis worse.
“He should call right now for a halt to climate-wrecking aviation expansion, including at Gatwick, and ask his C40 [global green city network] counterparts to join him.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/11/london-mayor-sadiq-khan-city-climate-emergency

""It is hard to imagine a business more custom-made for money laundering, with million-dollar sales conducted in secrecy and with virtually no oversight.

That's not the problem, in fact it's a rather belligerent and ignorant statement. Money laundering etc in the private market is the problem.

There are legitimate parallels here. Climate change will most hurt those yet to be born. Our failure to make the dramatic changes needed to our economy and society means we are behaving as if we own the lives of future generations and have a right to steal their lives from them.
Art plays a key role in recording contemporary life, but because it is exploratory and imaginative it also invites us to challenge the assumptions we live by. In Katowice there is a counter-exhibition on coal by art students, drawing attention to the “dark side of coal”. Meanwhile the campaign movement Art Not Oil, which has been pushing for an end to oil sponsorship of the arts, ran a parallel protest exhibition alongside the British Museum’s I Object show in opposition to financial backing from BP – a company that proudly boasts it is one of the most significant corporate investors in UK arts and culture. Performers acted as “rebel curators”, presenting objects to the public that represent BP’s complicity in climate breakdown. Just as in Bristol, where the Green lord mayor, Cleo Lake, has banished paintings related to the slave trade from her office, so galleries should shun BP funding.
Musicians are also challenging corporate sponsorship. Neil Young is due to play a large concert in Hyde Park next summer. Recently he criticised the event’s sponsor, Barclays, declaring the bank a “fossil-fuel-funding entity”. Young said such sponsorship was incompatible with his beliefs about the climate, and that he was seeking to rectify the situation. Yesterday he claimed victory, saying the concert was now proceeding without Barclays as a sponsor.
Others need to follow his lead. And perhaps Young and other musicians concerned about climate change will also need to think carefully about the carbon footprint of performing concerts around the globe.
There’s also a strong case against continued fossil fuel sponsorship from an economic perspective. The financial sector is rapidly divesting from fossil fuels, realising the smart money is in renewables and the green economy. Since the Paris agreement was adopted in November 2015, the sustainable finance agenda has moved rapidly.
In the European parliament I’ve worked on legislation that requires all financial market players to give full information about how customers’ money is invested. Since the EU has committed to phasing out fossil fuels by 2050, any pensions for people aged under 40 that contain assets based on fossil fuels could be claimed to have been mis-sold. So decisions not to throw money at fossil fuels are increasingly looking hard-headed and rational rather than purely moral.
There’s also a growing divestment movement, and universities and colleges have been at the forefront. Almost half of UK universities have made divestment commitments. Students and academics of the arts can play a vital role in pushing this agenda, again using their talents to do this in creative ways.
No matter how much they are struggling for cash, galleries and arts promoters should be made to feel too ashamed to take money from the industries that are leading us to climate breakdown. In the same way we now look back on the slave trade, those who took the filthy fossil fuel lucre will be condemned by future historians.
But the arts sector must go further than simply seeking clean sources of funding. Artistic creation invites us to imagine alternative worlds and to subvert the power of the old. Envisioning a future where fossil fuels have no place in our economy or society could provide a rich creative vein for artists and musicians, allowing them to play a vital role in generating ideas about how we are to live in the post-fossil fuel era.

Along comes a carbon tax. It wasn’t a carbon tax, as you know. It was many other things in nomenclature terms but we made it a carbon tax. We made it a fight about the hip pocket and not about the environment. That was brutal retail politics and it took Abbott about six months to cut through and when he cut through, Gillard was gone.

Butler expressed reluctance about using accounting tricks as part of Labor’s climate policy arsenal, but told the ABC he would not make a decision about whether carryover credits were in or out until after the Paris rule book was established.
The use of carryover credits is one of dozens of technical elements being negotiated at the UN climate talks in Katowice, Poland, where 193 countries have gathered to negotiate the “rule book” for each meeting the emissions reductions targets made three years ago in Paris.
The practice of carryover credits allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030.
Preliminary documentation from inside the talks, seen by Guardian Australia, suggest that using carryover credits is not going to be prohibited under the rule book for the Paris agreement, meaning countries will be able – and some likely – to do it.
“I well understand the objections to this idea of carryover and my bias is to steer clear of cop-outs and accounting tricks,” Butler told the ABC on Thursday.
“But we want to look at the final rule book and, in government, get proper advice, not just from government agencies, but talk to climate groups, talk to other stakeholders in the area and make the best decision in the national interest,” he said.
Butler said Labor’s commitment, point to point, was reducing carbon emissions by 45% by 2030.
This week New Zealand’s climate change minister, James Shaw, said the practice of claiming credits was not in the spirit of the Paris agreement, and “we would discourage any country from using [it]”. He has previously described the practice as “dodgy accounting” and like “trying to have two meals for the price of one”.
The Marshall Islands has also raised objections to the use of carryover credits in informal negotiations, but with little support.
The Australian Greens are pressuring Labor to take a definitive position. “Labor needs to immediately rule out using any carryover from Kyoto to meet Australia’s international obligations,” said the Greens climate change spokesman, Adam Bandt.
“If they refuse, they’ll be profiting from climate denialism and making it harder to stop global warming.”
Australia’s environment minister, Melissa Price, who is in Katowice, declined to answer a question from Guardian Australia about whether the government would use carryover credits to meet the Paris targets.
“The government is committed to the Paris agreement,” Price said. “Our priority at COP24 is to secure agreement on a comprehensive rule book to guide the implementation of the agreement.”
She said the government was confident of meeting the emissions reduction target of 26-28% below 2005 levels “based on our track record of meeting and beating our first and second Kyoto protocol targets”.
The Morrison government has dumped an emissions reduction target for electricity, and thus far has not spelled out how it intends to deal with the trend of rising emissions that has been in evidence since the repeal of the carbon price.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/13/labor-wont-rule-out-using-accounting-tricks-to-meet-emissions-reduction-targets

Australia now imports over 1 million cars at a cost of US $29.4 b as well as $4.4b in spare parts which could have been made locally. Much the same applies for white goods, furniture, timber, tiles, electrical and electronic components required for the 220,000 houses we build every year. We are also importing far more food and a report from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) included the fact that our food imports have increased from $4 billion to $14 billion while food exports only increased from $21 billion to $37 billion over the period from 1990 to 2016. Imports of all types are growing along with population growth and increased consumerism but food imports are growing much faster than exports because of free trade agreements and government failure to protect farmers from cheap imports. There is also a marked decrease in our capacity to grow food particularly the fruit and vegetables that used to be grown on cities fringes but which have now been swallowed by urban sprawl. This suggest that not only are we at heading towards a loss of food self sufficiency but we are at risk from lower quality or contaminated foods as has occurred with berries, honey, olive oil, and orange juice.>> But herein lies the rub. To match these imports we must have equal or higher exports. In December 2017 there was a trade deficit which became a surplus of $0.98b in April this year and then $1.7b in June. But; Minerals and fuels now account for 45.5% of our exports. Food (grains, meat & primary products) are only 13.9% with manufacturing down to 11.8% (and shedding 122,400 jobs in a decade). The service sector contributed 21.9% most of which is education related and reliant on O/S students. Australia has thus been deliberately diverted into an economy with a high demand for imported goods with limited employment opportunities and sources of exports based mainly on resources, in other words, a quarry for the world. We have very few options, food production is unlikely to be expanded and may well shrink due to climate changes, manufacturing has been run down too far to rescue in the short term and the service industries face a problem as our education qualifications are declining. No politician could ever win an election with a promise of reinstalling tariffs, cutting back on consumerism or abandoning growth economics. Instead we will plod on because of the economists obsession with GDP growth - one will require not only continue with these practices but to increase them every year. The Adani mine will be allowed to proceed and this will be followed by more from mining magnate Genia Rinehart and Clive Palmer right until rising temperatures make mere survival more important than economic issues.>>', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1544936453000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'free trade agreements and government failure to protect farmers from cheap imports', u'effect': u'are growing much faster than exports'}, {u'cause': u'climate changes', u'effect': u'may well shrink'}, {u'cause': u'the economists obsession with gdp growth', u'effect': u'instead we will plod on require'}], u'author_id': u'16007883', u'id': u'123794428', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Loanwolf1', u'text': u'The facts of life are Tories and Labour over 200 MPs each Green Party 1 MP.Its only the fanatics in the Green Party who are obsessed by Climate change,Global warning or Global heating.The bottom line is it’s too expensive to do anything significant-nobody but the Green Party fanatics would ever give up the driving a car to ‘save the plant’MPs just regard climate change as an opportunity to virtue signal.In any event if we end up with a climate like Spain so what we will be Ok.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1544915672000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'17732359', u'in_reply_to': u'123762738', u'id': u'123789164', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Loanwolf1', u'text': u'Do you drive a car.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1544914911000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'17732359', u'in_reply_to': u'123779837', u'id': u'123788841', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'matt0931', u'text': u'No more ‘proof’ is required.

No one says the climate has never changed before.
No one says the Earth has only one climate that can support life to some degree.
However, farming requires fairly stable conditions.
Changes in CO2 concentrations have been a factor in many climate warming events in the past, and the consequences have been interesting to say the least.
The end-Permian mass extinction is associated with lots of CO2 being formed by burning fossil fuel.
It was volcanic action that burned coal then, in Siberia.

Climate science is based on evidence.
The geological principle called uniformitarianism tells us that Earth processes work the same way throughout time.
It's often summarised as ""The present is the key to the past"" but it works in all temporal directions.
The past is also the key to the future.
We can look at how earth systems have responded to climate forcings in the geological past, and from that make projections about the future.
For example, there's been an increase in CO2 concentration from 280ppm to 410ppm since the Industrial Revolution.
That's a big change in a geological instant, and CO2 was last over 400 ppm in the Pliocene.
Global average temperatures then eventually reached 3 or 4 degrees C (5.4-7.2 degrees F) higher than today’s and as much as 10 degrees C (18 degrees F) warmer at the poles.
Sea level ranged between five and 40 metres (16 to 131 feet) higher than today.
Earth systems take time to respond to forcings.
Sea level can't suddenly rise on that scale, because it takes time for enough heat to be accumulated to melt enough ice.
Going back further .....
The end-Permian mass extinction is associated with lots of CO2 being formed by burning fossil fuel.
It was volcanic action that burned coal then, in Siberia.

We have to solar-up where its viable and only buy renewable electricity - we need EV's renewably powered, decarbonised public transport and to stop deforestation, demand reafforestation of every scrap of non-food producing viable land and we need to minimise our meat consumption, cutting out beef and pork completely and promote carbon drawdown and water retentive farming. Corportions and governments NEED to be held to be held to account by shareholders and in the courts. Even if governments won't legislate a carbon price, we have to get corporations and state governments perhaps to make this happen (as British Columbia did in Canada). We need to stay angry and protesting and engage in Extinction Rebellion levels of NVDA untill all governments are dragged into a trajectory for a survivable future.

He said ""I can only applaud people who make changes in their individual lives but unless we wrestle control of our institutions from the corporate coup engineered by fossil fuel companies via the radical right, then practically speaking you may as well"" have ""spent all year maxing out your carbon footprint"".
I must admit that I have worked for fossil fuel companies and am a member of a right wing faction of a major political party - but am hardly radical.
In my state two elections ago fossil fuel corporations directed their funding to one political party which contains a extreme radical right wing faction who advocate on behalf of the corporations. So great was their largesse that that particular party then in government had ten times the campaign funds of the opposition, who nevertheless won the election. Such corporate electoral funding is tempting for a mainstream political party even when it flies in the face of what the people want. 
So the extreme right of that party have seized control over the last decade resulting in policies which favour their corporate sponsors - lack of regulation of extraction, offers to build railway lines for coal companies rather than commuters and attempts to solve traffic congestion by government financed toll road tunnels rather than public transport. However just yesterday their faction lost control of the state party at the organisational level.

Prof Richard Betts, who leads the climate research arm of Britain’s meteorological monitoring organisation, made the comments amid growing evidence that rising temperatures have passed the comfort zone and are now bringing increased threats to humanity.
“Global heating is technically more correct because we are talking about changes in the energy balance of the planet,” the scientist said at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland. “We should be talking about risk rather than uncertainty.”
Earlier this month, the Met Office produced a new report that showed the searing heatwave that hit the UK this summer – along with other parts of the northern hemisphere – was made 30 times more likely by human-caused climate change.
Betts said the shifting climate was pushing some natural processes – such as the blossoming of trees and laying of eggs – out of sync. “That’s already happening. We are also seeing higher temperatures of heatwaves. The kind of thing we saw this year will happen more often.
“The risks are compounding all the time. It stands to reason that the sooner we can take action, the quicker we can rein them in.”
His views were echoed by Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, a professor of theoretical physics and founder of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. He said his recent Hothouse Earth report , which was one of the most widely quoted and downloaded studies of this year, had helped to change the language used to describe the climate crisis.
“Global warming doesn’t capture the scale of destruction. Speaking of hothouse Earth is legitimate,” he said.
The scientists expressed frustration at the slow pace of action by political leaders. In signing the 2015 Paris agreement, governments around the world aimed to keep global warming to within 1.5C to 2C above pre-industrial levels. But current commitments are far off track.
The Met Office upgraded its forecasts this week to show the planet is on track to warm by between 2.5C and 4.5C. “We have broadened out the range of possibilities,” said Betts, who is conducting a risk assessment based on the new projections. In the UK, he said the trend was towards wetter winters with more floods, hotter summers with more droughts interspersed with increasingly intense rain.
At 3C of change, Schellnhuber said southern Spain would become part of the Sahara. Even 2C, he said, could not be guaranteed as safe.
The Paris pact was a firewall, he said. “It’s not helping us to keep the world as it is now. We’ve lost this opportunity already. It’s a firewall against climate chaos.”
Johan Rockström, executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, said “cracks” were starting to appear in the climate system that were pushing nature from being a friend that absorbs carbon dioxide to an enemy that releases carbon dioxide. These concerns are fuelled by the growing intensity of forest fires, the effect of melting ice-sheets on the jet stream, and the rising risk of permafrost thaw, which would release trapped methane.
Although he stressed it might not yet have passed a tipping point, he said the warnings were getting louder. “This shift from friend to foe is no doubt a scientific nightmare. That is the biggest worry that we have,” he said. “It does terrify me. The only reason we sit here without being completely depressed is that we see we have policy measures and technology to move in the right direction.
“We need to have a diagnosis just like a patient who comes to a doctor and gets a really bad diagnosis. But if the science is right, the technology is right, and the policy is right you can cure that very dire situation. There is no scientific suggestion that the door is shut.”
This week’s climate talks have crept forward with only small progress towards a new global rulebook, but emissions continue to rise and the planet continues to heat.
“Things are obviously proceeding very slowly,” said Betts. “As a scientist, it’s frustrating to see we’re still at the point when temperatures are going up and emissions are going up. I’ve been in this for 25 years. I hoped we’d be beyond here by now.”
Schellnhuber concurred. “I’ve worked on this for 30 years and I’ve never been as worried as I am today.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/13/global-heating-more-accurate-to-describe-risks-to-planet-says-key-scientist

The conference centre is near the mineshaft of the colliery museum in Katowice, the heartland of Silesia’s vast coal industry. The sponsors include JSW, the EU’s largest coking coal producer, and PGE, which runs the world’s second-largest fossil-fuel power plant.
If that were not enough, the summit host, President Andrzej Duda, opened the summit with a boast that his country was sitting on 200 years’ worth of coal supplies and “it will be hard not to use them”. To underscore that intention, PGG, the state-owned thermal coal producer, announced plans during the summit for a new $400m (£320m) shaft at Imielin, 12 miles from Katowice.
Yet for all of this, the single clearest fact that has emerged from this conference is that the world must break from this dirtiest of carbon fuels if we are to have any chance of avoiding dangerous levels of climate disruption.
“We are seeing a coal renaissance. This is disastrous,” said Ottmar Edenhofer, the deputy director at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “We are really at risk. It is not enough to pray. We have to do something.”
It is not just Poland. Coal is on the rise in Japan, Indonesia, India, Vietnam and Russia. In China, the world’s biggest producer, output has increased after several years of declines.
Planned new coal investments in the world would add 330 gigatonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere, Edenhofer said. Added to existing infrastructure, this would use up all of the world’s remaining carbon budget under the Paris agreement. “If we continue with these investments we close the door to 2C,” he said, referring to the world’s least ambitious climate target.
But there are signs of change. Campaigners are accelerating efforts to halt expansion plans – which lock in consumption for decades – and gradually replace existing collieries with alternative green energies, such as wind and solar.
This is even happening in the host country. This week, 17 Polish cities joined a zero-carbon coalition. A proposal to phase out coal by 2030 has the support of 69% of Poles, according to a survey last month by Greenpeace.
There is also increasing awareness about the true costs of coal, which have long been off the books. Thirty-six of the 50 most polluted cities in the EU are in Poland, mostly in the Silesian region, where visitors can smell the sulphur in the air as they arrive at the airport. Numerous studies have shown the dire health impacts, including an estimated 47,500 premature deaths. This has promoted a growing anti-smog movement.
Climate impacts are also becoming more apparent. Poland suffered heatwaves and droughts this year that reduced harvests and impeded the country’s ability to feed itself.
With the cost of coal likely to rise, Poland is investing heavily in renewables. Wind power, in particular, has risen sharply in the past two decades. The old jobs are now less attractive.
“In the socialist era, the coalminer was a working-class hero, but young people don’t want to work in the mines. The pay is not so good compared with jobs in other EU countries,” said Irma Allen, an anthropologist writing a PhD on coal communities at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. “Life with coal is now radically different than it was 20 to 30 years ago The costs now outweigh the benefits.”
Easing the pain of transition is a vital political task, say campaigners. Many pits were closed in the 1990s, destroying communities and leaving some laid-off miners’ families so poor they have to scavenge for coal to heat their homes. Pessimism is rife. Miners are not intrinsically anti-environment, says Allen, but their futures are insecure.
“If people were offered an alternative vision of what the region could be, they might be more hopeful,” she said. “But they saw what happened with Thatcher in Britain in the 1980s and fear the same will happen here.”
Katowice has partly filled the gap by reinventing itself as a cultural centre, conference hub and university city, but the pushback has been fierce from the left and right of the old economy. The Solidarity union, which represents tens of thousands of Polish miners, has joined with the rightwing US lobby group, the Heartland Institute to dispute the science of climate change.
The conservative Duda claims coal is Poland’s gift from God and made keeping pits open a question of national sovereignty.
“This plays to the ultra-nationalist discourse in Poland and elsewhere, but it’s hypocritical,” said Ido Liven, of the CEE Bankwatch Network, one of the biggest environmental groups in eastern Europe. “The Polish president talks about coal as a national treasure yet imports are increasing. Close to 60% of imported coal is from Russia.”
Politicians who have tried to introduce changes are struggling, says Mateusz Klinowski, the former mayor of Wadowice, the birthplace of Pope John Paul II. He lost office in an election this year after trying to cut pollution and wean the city off coal.
“I thought it was enough to build support from the bottom up; to show the facts on health, to talk about pollution, about the morality of change, but it didn’t work. It’s because people are told on TV that coal is a treasure,” said Klinowski.
“But even if I tell them the planet is dying and I will give them 50% of the the cost of a new heating system, they think it’s just green bullshit and not necessary. We need to change the state government and do it at the top level.”
The economics are moving in a different direction from the politics. The World Bank and other large international finance institutions are withdrawing from coal investments. Insurance companies are also pulling out.
Poland’s neighbours – Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – have taken strides to cut coal subsidies and bring forward a phase-out date. Elsewhere in the world, there are strong signs the coal renaissance is winding down.
The UK has rapidly switched from coal to renewables with the help of a carbon tax on power supplies. Despite Donald Trump’s rhetoric, coal is plunging in the US. Germany, the biggest coal user in Europe, will conduct a review of its dependency next year that is expected to prompt a radical shift in policy. India is also building so much solar that some believe it may never need to commission another coal plant.
These moves prove the renaissance of coal can be stifled, say academics, businessmen and campaigners, but it needs to be done more quickly – and the main obstacle is at the top.
Adair Turner, of the Just Transition Partnership, said it was possible to build a zero-carbon economy by 2060 at a cost of just half a percent of GDP. “With the technology and the economy I am more confident than I was three years ago, but I’m now less confident about the politics,” he said. “If we don’t get there, it will be because of special interests.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/14/poland-wean-coal-climate

In the uplands of south-west Shropshire, Christmas trees are grown on increasingly shrinking moorland habitat, home to threatened and severely declining species like curlew, snipe, kestrel and barn owl. Your photograph showed a Christmas tree plantation on heather moorland, which proves my point. Heathland, one of the UKs priority habitats and home to many iconic species, has declined by as much as 90% over the last 200 years.
The insecticides sprayed on most Christmas trees against leaf-damaging aphids are washed into watercourses, where they not only contaminate potential drinking water but poison invertebrates in streams and rivers. Residues of these chemicals will later pollute the internal environment of the home, along with the antifreeze sprayed on the trees so they retain their leaves.
Many of the trees grown in Shropshire and surrounding counties are transported to London for sale so that a large carbon footprint is added to the already burgeoning environmental cost.
Due to these pollution and habitat issues we have in Shropshire and elsewhere, I welcomed the news that this is the year of the artificial Christmas tree. Plastic trees are not really the answer, though. The suggestion for growing your own tree in a pot is by far the best choice and, failing that, decoration of a collection of branches from any tree can be a stunning alternative.Fiona GomersallEcologist, Shropshire
• The uncomfortable truth about the climate talks taking place in Poland is what isn’t being discussed (‘We’re running out of time’: UN chief’s dash to climate summit, 13 December). A new report about paying our fair share of the climate change debt compares the amount of money and effort going into combating the problem to the quantity of greenhouse gas pollution each country emits now and historically, and the ability of countries and people to respond. Something important is being side-lined, though: richer nations must cough up more.
Asking poorer countries to pay for problems that they didn’t cause – and that they are now bearing the brunt of – means climate breakdown is disproportionately affecting those who are the least responsible. After all, the poorest half of the world receives less than one tenth of the total global income, and generates virtually no emissions.
Until countries pay their fair share, we will fail to contain global temperature rises. We still have time – just – to reverse the worst effects of climate chaos. Now that we know that the cost of ignoring the problem is literally species-ending, isn’t it time to pay up, and do it fairly?Rachel KennerleyClimate campaigner, Friends of the Earth
• The 100 academics and others who signed the letter (10 December) about the all too real danger of an “environmental catastrophe” are undoubtedly erudite. But, apparently, they cannot see the significance of human numbers in the crisis. Thus their letter completely ignores population growth. This year, the human impact on the planet will be further aggravated by the addition of some 83 million to the rightly named human race. Sir David Attenborough has been much criticised in some circles for his “softly softly” approach. But at least he had the insight and courage to state unequivocally that “all our environmental problems become easier to solve with fewer people, and harder – and ultimately impossible – to solve with ever more people.” Some 42% of all births are estimated to be unwanted: that would be a good place to start. It would not only reduce unsustainable pressure on environmental systems but also create better lives for many women.Sandy IrvineNewcastle Green party
• At the end of his opinion piece (Our era lacks gravitas. That’s why we cannot deal with crisis, 8 December), Ian Jack identified our problem as being obsessed with money when it should be temperature or some other parameter of global warming. We can make a start on this in a painless and cost-free manner. We simply have to replace VAT with CAT, carbon-added tax. Activities are taxed according to the incremental amount of carbon they add to the atmosphere. Since most of this will come from the use of fossil fuels, it will actually be relatively easy to keep track of. Support this idea here. The rate of CAT can be sent so that the money take for the government is equal to that of VAT but it will reward those who purchase goods and engage in activities with a low carbon footprint.John HobsonDevizes, Wiltshire
• Ian Jack is right to be asking for the media to provide information about climate change, but wrong to say that comparisons with 20 years before would be necessary. In the case of parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere, the safe level is said to be around 350 parts per million (ppm) and the current measure is 400ppm. The weather forecasts in print should simply place the seasonally adjusted measure of ppm of carbon next to the required level. On television, viewers could watch the carbon counter from the monitoring station at Mauna Loa moving in the wrong direction in real time.Daniel ScharfAbingdon, Oxfordshire
• I read with interest Professor Henrietta Moore’s article (In the face of climate change, ranking states by prosperity invites disaster,theguardian.com, 5 December). We welcome her observations that “there’s much to be commended in assessing the impact of healthcare, education, the rule of law and personal and media freedom”, and that the places at the top of rankings “are better than most at providing foundations for a good life for the majority of fortunate inhabitants”. Professor Moore is also correct in observing that “when it comes to building sustainable prosperity from which everyone can benefit in the future, we are all ‘developing countries’”.
However, we do not share the belief that ranking nations by prosperity invites disaster. The high correlation between GDP and aspects of governance, freedom, social capital, education, health and the quality of the natural environment can hardly be regarded as “uncomfortable”. It is the very quality of these that enables wealth generation. How resource-intensive such economic activity can and should be is a very important question, but should not be presumed to come at the expense of either institutional quality or social wellbeing.
It is important to celebrate that wellbeing has increased around the world. More children are educated than ever before, more people have a choice about their future, fewer people are impoverished. These are huge gains, which we need to recognise and understand how to sustain. Given the purpose of sustainability is to enhance the lived experience of future generations, we should not reject measuring that very experience for the current generation.Dr Stephen BrienDirector of policy, The Legatum Institute

To outsiders, UN climate talks may seem like a positive step. Unfortunately, this is COP24.
For 24 years, world leaders have annually talked at each other instead of to one another in hopes of reaching an agreement on how to mitigate the climate crisis. In all that time, they have barely scratched the surface of an issue that the world’s top climate scientists say we now have 12 years to stop – and that is an optimistic estimate.
There’s an urgency in my heart being here in Katowice, knowing that this negotiation process is supposed to protect my generation and ones thereafter. I am afraid of the lack of accountability in the space, knowing that the people with power will be patted on the back for simply coming together without making meaningful policy commitments.
When the news stories come out about successful negotiations, we forget about when leaders pushed to leave “human rights” out of policy wording, or stood on the floor advocating for fossil fuels as a solution (hint: they’re not), all to placate to their own interest in power and maintaining it. They are voluntarily blind to the suffering their decisions cause. Homes will be lost, families will be torn apart by displacement and at borders, and the sea will encroach upon whole societies, exterminating cultures and livelihoods. Developed countries like the US, corrupted by fossil fuel interests, are to blame.
UN negotiators have been trying to solve the climate crisis since before I was born. When will global leaders admit that this is a broken and dysfunctional charade instead of burying the reality under false solutions and jargon? What will be the catalyst for people in power to do what is right? Do millions of people have to be displaced? Do we have to be stealing a livable planet from people not even born yet? How many millions of people will have to die from climate damage such as drought, famine, superstorms and wildfires before world leaders commit to implementing real solutions to defeat this crisis?
I’ve been doing this work for five years and have given up a lot to do the things I know are right. I’ve given up personal finances, friendships, a normal adolescence and more to get up on the global stage. I’ve taken breaks from school, failed a few classes.
Youth activists everywhere make personal sacrifices every day in order to protect the world we’ll inherit and our governments can’t do the same for us. The institutions meant to protect me don’t seem to care as much as I do and it’s a burden I carry everyday.
I watch my government and governments around the world trade my future for profit. A future my mother fought hard to secure through sacrifice, when she made the journey to immigrate to the United States. There’s a lot of anger and depression inside of me because of this, but I found happiness and reward in seeing the solutions, power and love in the climate movement.
Though political institutions have fallen short, being on the ground here does offer hope: it proves the strength of people power. Politicians will never be the core of this movement. We need to highlight and uplift genuine grassroots movements that properly address the lived experiences of the people they protect. We need to turn our attention and our energy into communities that are helping themselves in the best ways that they can.
The marginalized communities on the frontlines know what it actually means to sacrifice in order to uphold future generations and young people. They understand giving up their own comforts to protect lives.
We have called on our political leaders to demonstrate a similar understanding. But resilience can’t be taught, and it doesn’t come from a president, minister or monarch: it comes from the adversity you have faced. This is why, to fight the powers that hand away pieces of our environment for profit, we must enlist the people who have lived on the margins of society. People power will always be stronger than the people in power.

Countries thrashed out the complex details of how to account for and record their greenhouse gas emissions, which will form the basis of a “rulebook” on putting the Paris goals into action. But difficult questions such as how to scale up existing commitments on cutting emissions, in line with stark scientific advice, and how to provide finance for poor countries to do the same, were put off for future years.
In the final hours, agreement was held up by a debate over the market in carbon credits, awarded to countries for their emissions-cutting efforts and for their carbon sinks, such as forests, which absorb carbon dioxide.
Brazil wanted an amendment that would benefit the country for its large rainforest cover, but this was opposed by others as it could allow the double-counting of carbon credits, undermining the integrity of the system.
This question has now been pushed back to next year’s annual conference. Brazil’s stance, however, under incoming president Jair Bolsonaro, who also rescinded the country’s offer to host next year’s talks, presages troubles to come.
Brazil has been a reliable supporter of the annual talks in the past, and has worked to broker deals between the developed and developing world. Without that support in future, the talks are only likely to grow more fractious.
Even when Brazil’s carbon-credits issue was postponed, a further obstacle was opened up by Turkey, which wants to be counted as a developing country rather than a developed one. Weary delegates finally filed into the closing session at nearly 10pm to hail the compromise agreement.
Despite these hitches, the two-week conference – the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP24 – finally ended in clarity, at least on some of the key building blocks for putting the Paris agreement into action.
David Waskow, of the World Resources Institute, said the final deal was “a good foundation for countries to go about implementing the Paris agreement”. He added: “It sets the direction of travel and will spur countries to take action. Now countries need to go home and do their homework, by increasing their commitments [on emissions].”
But the key question of whether countries are doing enough to cut their emissions, in the light of the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report that predicted dire consequences if temperatures were allowed to rise more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, was left out.
The IPCC’s report in October showed that the world must change course drastically in the next decade to avoid the consequences of a 1.5C rise, including the die-off of coral reefs, droughts and floods, and a decline in agricultural productivity over many areas.
This year has seen extreme weather across many parts of the globe, and the fourth highest global average temperatures on record, while the IPCC warning is the starkest yet to come from scientists.
António Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, praised countries for coming to an agreement, but demanded more. “The approval of the Paris agreement work programme is the basis for a transformative process which will require strengthened ambition from the international community,” he said.
“Science has clearly shown that we need enhanced ambition to defeat climate change. From now on, my five priorities will be: ambition, ambition, ambition, ambition and ambition.” He cited the need for countries to toughen their emissions-cutting targets and to adapt their infrastructure to cope with the effects of climate change.
Jennifer Morgan of Greenpeace said: “A year of climate disasters and a dire warning from the world’s top scientists should have led to so much more. Instead, governments let people down again as they ignored the science and the plight of the vulnerable.
“Without immediate action, even the strongest rules will not get us anywhere. People expected action, and that is what governments did not deliver. This is morally unacceptable.”
Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate change at WWF-UK, said: “[There has been] some positive progress, but we have not yet done enough. The world is in a state of climate emergency and yet some of our leaders prefer to stay in a state of denial.

This includes how governments will measure, report on and verify their emissions-cutting efforts, a key element because it ensures all countries are held to proper standards and will find it harder to wriggle out of their commitments.
There was a row over carbon credits, which are awarded to countries for their emissions-cutting efforts and their carbon sinks, such as forests, which absorb carbon. These credits count towards countries’ emissions-cutting targets. Brazil, which hopes to benefit from its large rainforest cover, insisted on a new form of wording that critics said would allow double counting of credits, undermining the integrity of the system. This issue has been put off until next year.
Largely absent from these talks, which had a technical focus, was the key question of how countries will step up their targets on cutting emissions. On current targets, the world is set for 3C of warming from pre-industrial levels, which scientists say would be disastrous, resulting in droughts, floods, sea level rises and the decline of agricultural productivity.
The key deadline is 2020, when countries must show they have met targets set a decade ago for cutting their emissions, and when they must affirm new, much tougher targets.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global body of the world’s leading climate scientists, warned two months ago that allowing warming to reach 1.5C above pre-industrial levels would have grave consequences, including the die-off of coral reefs and devastation of many species.
If we extrapolate from the IPCC’s findings, the world has little more than a decade to bring emissions under control and halve them, which would help to stabilise the climate.
After years in which the world’s carbon emissions appeared to be stabilising, they are on the rise again. Coal use continues and oil is still the engine of much of the world’s economy. Clean energy is coming on-stream at a faster rate than many predicted, and the costs of it have come down rapidly, but its adoption needs to be speeded up.
Infrastructure, such as energy generation plants, transport networks and buildings, is a central issue: infrastructure built now to rely on high-carbon energy effectively locks in high emissions for decades to come. Some people are also saying we need to invest in projects to remove carbon from the atmosphere, and a new focus of the talks is helping countries to adapt to the effects of climate change.
The US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait joined forces to prevent the conference fully embracing the IPCC’s findings, watering down a statement to a weak commendation of the timing of the scientists’ report. Australia joined with the US in a celebration of coal, and Brazil signalled its climate scepticism under Jair Bolsonaro by withdrawing its offer to host next year’s talks.
But the EU, a handful of other developed countries and scores of developing nations including the poorest and most vulnerable affirmed that they would strive to meet the IPCC’s advice on limiting warming to no more than 1.5C.
The UN will meet again next year in Chile to thrash out the final elements of the Paris rulebook and begin work on future emissions targets. But the crunch conference will come in 2020, when countries must meet the deadline for their current emissions commitments and produce new targets for 2030 and beyond that go further towards meeting scientific advice.
That conference may be held in the UK or Italy, both of which have bid to be hosts. The UK’s intention in offering to host is to signal it will retain its role on the world stage after Brexit. The event may also provide a welcome change from wranglings over Brexit and intractable trade deals. But whoever hosts will have a diplomatic mountain to climb, if the fractious nature of this year’s talks is anything to go by.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/16/what-was-agreed-at-cop24-in-poland-and-why-did-it-take-so-long

Like many other fruit and woody plants, blackcurrants need a period of chilling before they start to grow in spring. This reduces the risk of frost damage to new buds and makes sure they burst rapidly in the spring and flower together when there are plenty of pollinators such as bees around.
But researchers at the James Hutton Institute said warmer winters can cause the plants to flower later in the year, produce fewer fruit and, over a number of years, reduce the lifespan of the plant.
And they warned that although blackcurrants were particularly sensitive to changes, other fruit such as blueberries, cherries, apples and plums would be at risk as temperatures rose.
Katharine Preedy from Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland said: “Blackcurrants are like the canary in the mine. If we can understand what they need in a changing climate, we can apply our knowledge to similar crops like blueberries, cherries, apples and plums.”
Presenting preliminary findings at the British Ecological Society’s annual meeting in Birmingham, the researchers said understanding how different varieties of the fruit responded to temperatures was key.
The study found that a third of the UK blackcurrant crop, worth about £10m a year to the UK economy, requires 1,800 hours of chilling below 7C (45F), while others need far lower temperatures and some can tolerate warmer temperatures as long as the chilling period lasts longer.
Researchers found each blackcurrant variety preferred different levels of chilling, and that some were able to compensate for warmer winter temperatures if the period of cooling they experienced was longer, while others were not.
Preedy said understanding the genetics would help farmers select the best varieties to suit the local climate and conditions.
“In the future, we hope to identify genetic markers associated with the ability to withstand variable winters, so we can rapidly breed new varieties of blackcurrants,” she added.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/dec/17/blackcurrant-crops-hit-by-milder-winters-study-shows

This was not just because exhausted delegates were glad to go home after negotiations that dragged on 30 hours beyond the deadline. It also reflected the harder miles and tougher battles to come over the next two years if the planet is to remain habitable.
Scientist after scientist told the conference that the decisions made by 2020 will determine whether global heating can be kept to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, after which the already apparent dangers of climate instability become far worse.
The toughest decisions, however, were pushed into the future, to a special climate summit next September called by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the next two COP conferences – in Chile in December 2019, and then to the country chosen to host in 2020.
Katowice showed that the multilateral system of global decision-making is still alive, but under growing threat from fossil fuel interests and the nationalist politicians they fund.
Decision-making at the UN is painstakingly difficult at the best of times, because it requires a consensus among 195 nations. In Poland, 14,000 delegates took two weeks to debate the latest science and proposed policy instruments as they whittled down more than 2,800 areas of disagreement.
The result was a new global rulebook on emissions that requires nations to report every two years on their progress towardParis agreement commitments to keep temperature rises to between 1.5C and 2C.
Several past obstacles were overcome. China accepted standards on transparency, and richer nations – particularly Germany and Norway – put their hands deeper into their pockets to provide more than $100bn (£80bn) to help poorer nations adapt. A renewed division between the developed and developing world did not materialise as feared.
But more fundamental obstructions also came more sharply into focus. The malign role of fossil fuel interests has often been hidden in bureaucratic language or lost in the distractions of diplomatic spats, but in Katowice there were several moments of blinding clarity. Chief among them was the alignment of the world’s top three oil-producing nations – the US, Russia and Saudi Arabia – to downplay scientific warnings about temperature rises beyond 1.5C. Soon after, an ambassador from Australia – a major coal exporter – joined Trump administration officials in a panel that promoted carbon fuels. Brazil was also accused of holding up talks with a highly contested carbon-accounting proposal that could have reshaped how emissions from the Amazon are calculated. The country’s diplomats denied this but the issue has been kicked forward and it is unlikely the incoming nationalist president Jair Bolsonaro will make life easier for the negotiations.
There was also more clarity as a result of the recent protests in France, which prompted policymakers to think twice about the social implications of higher fuel prices. The leading energy economists Nicholas Stern and Ottmar Edenhofer said carbon taxes were still an important instrument to nudge economies away from fossil fuels, but that the transition has to be fair as well as fast, which means using the extra tax revenue for green infrastructure or redistributing it among poorer members of society who are often hardest hit by fuel tax rises.
Tensions will grow along with the stakes, as will frustration at the widening gap between the science and politics. More protests and lawsuits can be expected from climate litigation groups, financial divestment activists and a growing number of direct action campaigners, including 350.org, Extinction Rebellion and striking students such as Greta Thunberg. They, along with many scientists, say it is not enough to agree on rulebooks. After delaying action for so long, they argue the world now needs leaps rather than steps.
All of which suggests the next two years will be among the most fraught and crucial in the history of humanity. Investment decisions on power stations and infrastructure taken during this period will determine whether carbon emissions can be cut by the 45% needed by 2030 to give the 1.5C target a chance.
It would be fitting if the UK won the right to host the crucial climate summit in 2020. Done well, it would showcase how the world’s first industrialised nation is shifting away from carbon faster than almost any other. Done badly, the UK – by then probably outside the EU – will highlight the folly of shifting away away from multilateralism just when when the world needs to pull together.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/17/un-climate-talks-set-stage-for-humanitys-two-most-crucial-years

I've got an atlas from 1989 which includes climate maps for the UK.
For the 30-year period 1951-1980, it shows central England with an average of 10 to 20 mornings with snow cover per year (""climate"" is conventionally an average over 3 decades)
NOW in central England, we don't get an average of 10 to 20 mornings with snow cover per year any more, because central England is warmer on average.
However, in the particular winter of 2017-2018 we had a lot of snow mornings, above the current average.

And remember - when a normalized average UK winter over a decade has no regions with snow-days - it is not the lack of snow that will bother you (and the rest of the world). Because by then low frequent AGW has reached a level where no part of the UK has the high amplitude weather-conditions that makes it white for a few days - at all. 
White Christmas in the UK was always a a risky bet - go here and check out number of days of snow during December 2006, for an example. Then check out 2010. 
Thing is - the UK December weather is critical on a whole suit of systems. The North Atlantic Oscillation. The East Atlantic (ridge) pattern. The Arctic Oscillation. The position of the polar front. The speed of the circum-polar jet-stream. This list goes on. 
While these internal variable patterns certainly are affected by AGW - kids in UK will experience the odd thing when nature suddenly goes all white as a rare but not abnormal thing for decades and generations to come. 
Snow is a weird thing. Because when the ground temperature falls below ca +2 degrees, the normal drizzle suddenly change character - like a lot. 
A much bigger worry for the UK and other temperate regions is that the vegetation is fooled into thinking spring has arrived at the very wrong calendar data. Temperate vegetation has this built in frost-protection that most vegetation on the planet does not bother with. Most vegetation does not bother with the frost protection because it takes a lot of energy. 
So biologists notice that plants get themselves into problems - because when they experience a small (and random) period of 10-15 degrees during mid winter they act like ""phew - time to open up those pores and start to pump some water into my cells and consider releasing the most energy-hungry process there is - to make them seeds ready for departure""
When the cold returns a week later - the poor plants have shut off all their frost-defence mechanisms - and filled themselves up with water again (and as many an Everest climber has learn - when fluids of cells freeze it is very very very destructive to cells). In addition - the seeds, so precious, are released at the wrong time - so that during the true spring they do not only manage to make a lower count of pollen. 
And this is a problem for insects. And a very big problem for birds - that hang out in the tropics during winter and does not know that the whole pollen thing is off up north - and that their food source - the insects are also off by a lot. Because the birds seems to run off the sun as timer. So when they come back up north and fall in love again and the eggs start to hatch - the pollen and insects have already left the peak-party time. So they try to raise a bird in austerity. 
(This is especially problematic for birds that live for a long time - as they have less evolutionary pressure). 
Weather anomalies is a ""cloud"" around the average. To have the below zero weather anomalies is not a problem for our life-forms. It is the increasing number of winter hotness that is scary. 
So start to count the days when your plants wrongly assume spring has arrived and start to sprout buds wrongly. Because that is a bad sign. 
Snow is just humidity that is allowed to freeze due to favorable conditions.

Not just any old tune: having completed the lyric, the composer told his secretary he “just wrote the best song that anybody’s ever written”.
Though not everyone would agree with his boast, White Christmas went on to become a commercial and cultural success. Made famous by Bing Crosby, who sang it in the film Holiday Inn, it is thought to be the bestselling single of all time, shifting at least 150m copies worldwide.
White Christmas was not a hit initially. But in 1942, two years after it was written, the song topped the US charts, thanks in part to its popularity with American soldiers stationed overseas during the second world war. It was a hit in Britain, too, perhaps helped by the fact that, unlike swathes of the southern US, we actually experience white Christmases – or at least we used to.
The last “proper” white Christmas – at least in southern Britain – with snow settling on the ground, was in 2010, though in the Highlands snow falls every winter. However, as global warming takes hold, soon the only link with white Christmases may be the famous song.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/17/global-warming-melting-uk-dreams-white-christmas

The report, published every two years, measures the long-term variability and trends observed in Australia’s climate.
The 2018 report shows that Australia’s long-term warming trend is continuing, with the climate warming by just over 1C since 1910 when records began.
That warming is contributing to a long-term increase in the frequency of extreme heat events, fire weather and drought.
“Australia is already experiencing climate change now and there are impacts being experienced or felt across many communities and across many sectors,” said Helen Cleugh, the director of the CSIRO’s climate science centre.
The report’s key findings include:
Australia’s fire seasons have lengthened and become more severe. In some parts of the country, the season has been extended by months.
The number of extreme heat days continues to trend upward.
There has been a shift to drier conditions in south-eastern and south-western Australia in the months from April to October.
Rainfall across northern Australia has increased since the 1970s, particularly during the tropical wet season in north-western Australia.
Oceans around Australia have warmed by about 1C since 1910, which is leading to longer and more frequent marine heatwaves that affect marine life such as corals.
Sea levels around Australia have risen by more than 20cm since records began and the rate of sea level rise is accelerating.
There has been a 30% increase in the acidity of Australian oceans since the 1800s and the current rate of change “is ten times faster than at any time in the past 300 million years”.
Karl Braganza, the bureau of meteorology’s manager of climate monitoring, said the increase in average temperature was having an impact on the frequency or amount of extremes Australia experienced in any given year.
“In general there’s been around a five-fold increase in extreme heat and that is consistent whether you look at monthly temperatures, day time temperatures or night time temperatures,” he said.
He said there had been a reduction in rainfall of 20% in south-western Australia and in some places that was as high as 26%. In south-eastern Australia, April to October rainfall had fallen by 11%.
The report also highlights an increase in the number of extreme fire danger days in many parts of Australia, particularly in southern and eastern Australia.
Braganza said there was a “clear shift” towards a lengthened fire season, more fire weather during that season and an increase in its severity.
“Often the worst fire weather occurs when you’ve had long-term drought, long-term above-average temperatures, maybe a short-term heatwave and then the meteorology that’s consistent with severe fire weather and the ability for fire to spread,” he said.
“It’s those types of compound events that are going to be most challenging going forward in terms of adapting to climate change in Australia.”
David Cazzulino, the Great Barrier Reef campaigner for the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the report confirmed what many Australians already knew about the rising risks of climate change.
“The big line around oceans warming one degree since 1910 is a huge wake-up call,” he said.
“It’s undeniable that warming oceans lead to more marine heatwaves, coral bleaching and coral mortality.”
He said the impact of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef, and climate change policy generally, would be a key campaign issue ahead of the 2019 federal election.
“We are running out of time to keep warming to a safe degree for the reef to have a future,” Cazzulino said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/20/australia-experiencing-more-heat-longer-fire-seasons-and-rising-oceans

No country has been particularly good when it comes to climate change. It would appear that reducing polutants by hitting peoples pockets isn't popular and tends to be rejected.

""In fact, there is a challenge to free-market capitalism and it is coming from environmentalism. On the one hand, there is an ideology that prioritises growth; on the other a belief system that sees the obsession with growth as an existential threat to the planet.""
Excellent point. Permanent growth cannot work when there are limited ressources. In fact, the more growth accelerates, the sooner the ressources are used up and the sooner things collapse. That's simple math.
This fact also cannot be made to go away by extensive PR exercises. Unfortunately climate change is a time-sensitive issue - the longer we wait, the worse it becomes. That is all this PR nonsense can and does achieve (and of course more profits for the industries doing it). We cannot afford to wait. This constant lying and denying has to stop and the people and organizations who do it need to pay for it and face accountability.
""Governments are aware of the risk posed by climate change. They know that they need to change the way their economies are run in order to hit targets for capping carbon emissions. ""
Is Trump aware of this or does he care or believe it? I doubt it. How about Bolsonaro? Does he care for the environment? Even some of those who are preaching environmental protection, like Germany, are doing far too little against climate change, so that they can protect their industry. The car industry in Germany is regarded like some holy animal - although hopefully that will change after the recent scandals. 
""For today’s appeasers, the moment of truth is nigh.""
That would be nice. Is it true though? What's to prevent them from going on as before? As long as people like Trump are able to win public office in big economies, why should they change?

Mass unemployment, totalitarianism, war: a repeat of these horrors is to be avoided at all costs. Eighty years after Neville Chamberlain agreed to Hitler’s demands over the Sudetenland, there is still no greater insult than to dub a politician an “appeaser”.
The determination in policy circles to avoid a return to the 30s helps explain why up until now it has never happened. Central banks slashed interest rates and turned on the electronic printing presses a decade ago because they feared a second Great Depression. Welfare states are more generous than they were when John Steinbeck was writing The Grapes of Wrath. Decades of growth have made societies wealthier; advances in medical science have made them healthier.
That said, the world is currently closer to a return to the 30s than it has ever been. The echoes are loud and getting louder.
Let’s start with the obvious. As it did in the period between the two world wars, something has gone seriously wrong with the global economy. The story of the past 20 years has been that of an unsustainable boom followed by a deep recession and the weakest recovery in history.
Central banks have applauded themselves for preventing Great Depression 2.0, but what they never admit is that they did so by creating asset bubbles. A prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing – the bond-buying process that boosts the supply of money – led to a speculative frenzy for commodities, shares and property. Those bubbles are now starting to pop. Oil prices are crashing, house prices are flat, shares on Wall Street are on course to have their worst December since 1931.
In the 1920s and early 30s, there was a reluctance to give up on a conservative model of political economy: the gold standard, balanced budgets, a limited role for government and a belief that markets would deliver the best of all possible outcomes if left unhindered. Eventually, stark evidence of failure forced a rethink. Starting with Britain, countries came off the gold standard. Franklin Roosevelt introduced the New Deal. John Maynard Keynes explained why it was possible for unemployment to remain high. The economic problems of the 20s had prevented the full flowering of the technologies that appeared in the first few decades of the 20th century. It required a paradigm shift to full employment, capital controls and a fairer division of the spoils for that to happen.
No such reassessment has taken place since the global economy’s near-death experience of a decade ago. Governments are supposed to balance their budgets, money is free to go where it will, the banking system remains largely untouched, and the imbalance of power between capital and labour remains unaddressed. Growth has only been possible because of a buildup of debt. This proved unsustainable in the past and will do so again.
To make matters worse, the distribution of income and wealth has mirrored that of the period between the wars. Real wages – adjusted for inflation – have barely risen for those on low and middle incomes; such growth as there has been has been snaffled by the better off. If you own a home or own shares, the past decade has been good for you. If you are in a low-wage job with only modest savings, life has not been nearly so comfortable.
All these factors – economic underperformance, the return to business as usual and the sense that we are not all in this together – have given rise to a different sort of politics: nationalistic, populist and angry. People in the 30s were susceptible to the cult of the strongman leader because parties of the centre-left and centre-right seemed impotent in the face of a financial crisis, triggered by the Wall Street crash. Now that cult – Putin in Russia; Modi in India; Erdoğan in Turkey; Trump in the US; Bolsonaro in Brazil – is back and for the same reason. Voters are no longer convinced that mainstream politics can deliver.
Protectionism is back, and, although Trump’s trade war with China is so far more of a trade skirmish, the direction of travel is clear. “America first” is the modern-day equivalent of US isolationism in the 20s and 30s. Governments that pledge to look after their own – through tariffs or immigration controls – have tapped into a genuine sense of unease about how the fruits of globalisation have been divvied up.
The 40s and 50s saw the creation of a network of multilateral organisations designed to prevent a return to the beggar-thy-neighbour world of the 30s and to embed the new social democratic order. These institutions – the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization (conceived in the 1940s but created decades later) and the European Union – have all to a greater or lesser extent been captured by neoliberal ideology and by big business interests. Faith in international cooperation has frayed.
One seeming difference between the 2010s and the 1930s is the absence of an ideological clash. During the Great Depression, there were plenty of people in the west who saw Stalin’s five-year plans as a credible alternative to free-market capitalism. That struggle ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the spread of the market to parts of the world where it had previously been off limits.
In fact, there is a challenge to free-market capitalism and it is coming from environmentalism. On the one hand, there is an ideology that prioritises growth; on the other a belief system that sees the obsession with growth as an existential threat to the planet.
Britain’s fixation with Brexit means it is easy to portray Theresa May as Chamberlain and to see the prime minister’s recent abortive trip to the EU summit as her Munich. This, though, misses the bigger picture. Brexit is not the most important issue facing the world; it is not even the most important issue facing Britain.
Governments are aware of the risk posed by climate change. They know that they need to change the way their economies are run in order to hit targets for capping carbon emissions. They understand that time is not on their side. Yet at the UN summit in Poland they came up with an agreement they knew was inadequate to meet the challenge.
Katowice was the real Munich and the feeble UN accord the equivalent of the piece of paper Chamberlain brought back home with him from his meeting with Hitler. Appeasement doesn’t work and merely delays necessary policy action. That was true in the late 30s and it is true again today. Ultimately, policymakers have a choice. They can put their economies on an environmental war footing or they can continue to bottle it. In the 30s, they acted in time, but only just. For today’s appeasers, the moment of truth is nigh.

The government published its 2018 emissions projections report on Friday, just before Christmas, in its now customary style of releasing greenhouse data just before a public holiday.
The report details how Australia is tracking towards its 2020 and 2030 emissions reduction obligations under the Paris and Kyoto agreements.
It projects total emissions in 2030 will be 563 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is an emissions reduction of 7% on 2005 levels.
Australia’s targets under the Paris agreement are for a 26% to 28% emissions reduction on 2005 levels.
The report says emissions in 2030 are projected to climb 4% above 2020 levels driven by higher levels of liquefied natural gas production, growth in agriculture, increased transport activity and a drop in the amount of carbon reduction from activities such as reforestation in the land use sector.
The report projects emissions from all sectors, except for electricity, waste and land use, will grow by 2030.
It forecasts electricity emissions will fall to 2023 before starting to increase again.
The government’s emissions calculations for 2030 also appear to suggest it intends to used carryover from overachievement of previous Kyoto targets to try to meet its Paris obligations, unless this is opposed through UN negotiations.
Climate scientist and the chief executive of Climate Analytics, Bill Hare, said use of carryover would effectively mean the target Australia was aiming for was “more like 12% to 14%” on 2005 levels by 2030.
“They’re as far away as ever from meeting the 2030 target,” he said. “The underlying projections show a substantial deterioration because the key sectors including direct combustion of fuel, transport and industry have larger increases than last year and the power sector begins increasing again from 2023 significantly.”
The report says Australia will beat its 2020 emissions reduction target of 5% on 2005 levels.
It says Australia will “overachieve” on the target by 367 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, if carryover from beating the first Kyoto target in 2012 – which allowed Australia to increase its emissions from 1990 levels – is included.
If carryover is not included, Australia would beat the target by 240 million tonnes.
In a statement released with the report on Friday, the environment minister, Melissa Price, focused on Australia’s progress towards the 2020 target, describing it as “a great result for the environment”.
She said “we have also made significant progress to our 2030 target”.
“We have overachieved on our 2020 target and are well on our way to meeting our commitment to the Paris agreement 2030 target, all while maintaining a strong economy,” she said.
Scientists and environment groups said it was clearly not the case that Australia was making progress towards 2030.
The Australian Conservation Foundation said the government had no policy to address Australia’s climate pollution problem.
“Prime Minister Scott Morrison has repeatedly said Australia will meet its Paris agreement targets in a canter, but the government’s own emissions projections tell a very different story,” the ACF’s economics program manager, Matt Rose, said.
“The prime minister is not the only one having trouble accepting that Australia isn’t on track to meet our Paris target.
“Energy minister Angus Taylor released a misleading statement this week titled, ‘National Electricity Market emissions to hit Paris target eight years early’, and on Radio National Breakfast tried to pretend Australia’s Paris target would be met by reductions in the electricity sector alone.”
Emma Herd, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said Australia “remains off track to achieve our currently inadequate 2030 target and, critically, achieving net zero emissions by 2050”.
She said the longer the country delayed taking credible action, the harder the economic adjustment would be and Australia risked losing the benefits of investment in clean energy and other low carbon opportunities.
Herd said the suggestion in the report Australia might try to use carryover was concerning and “undermines the investment needed to transform the economy to net zero emissions”.
“Australia’s targets should be strengthened, not weakened, by 2020,” she said. “To secure the long-term prosperity of Australia, targets need to be in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement – limiting warming to 1.5C and well below 2C.”
The Greens’ climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, said the government was resorting to “accounting tricks” to try to meet its Paris target.
“So far the government’s only plan to meet Paris appears to be using dodgy accounting to cook the books and count dodgy ‘carryover’ credits from Kyoto towards Paris,” he said. “Other major countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany voluntarily cancelled their Kyoto carryover credits.”
Morrison disputed in a statement issued on Friday that the government was not on track to beat the 2030 target.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/21/australia-to-miss-2030-emissions-targets-by-vast-margin-coalitions-projections-reveal

My experience has been that most of them would like to do what you and I would consider to be the “right” thing, but they are constrained because their primary objective (the reason they have a job) is to maximise return for shareholders. Yes, shareholders include rich and greedy investors, but also our savings and pension plans, so investors are not the bogey man you seek.
The key is the regulatory framework within which companies have to operate. Their job is to maximise long-term profit, so by manipulating regulatory system, you can close off activities which are detrimental and encourage those which benefit society. And it is government which is in the driving seat i.e. politicians. The system is by no means perfect (it is distorted by lobbying and campaign donations by companies (i.e. company directors) seeking to maintain shareholder value in, for instance, coal reserves) but there is at least the possibility of democratic control over the way in which companies behave.
It is convenient for politicians to pretend that it is evil companies which do all this damage, but the responsibility lies squarely in their court. That means that, because they are elected, we the people actually hold the power to effect change, if we can be arsed to use it. When they do use their power, they will sometimes get it wrong, but if they are moving in the right direction, it is easier to get them to adjust their course than it is to make them do the initial U-turn, so you’re already half way there.
So rather than just complaining, take action! On your own, you may not be able to do much (although it is easy to underestimate your own power to effect change - think Malala or Nelson Mandela) but together with others you can overcome any obstacle. So consider joining a political party to undermine them from the inside, support Avaaz and 39 degrees, and find a green action group such as Greenpeace to support - and get involved!

Vaccination works because it reduces the ability of a disease to spread through the population. Once there aren't enough susceptible (unvaccinated) hosts for a germ to ""jump"" from one person to another, thus spreading, cases of the disease drop markedly.
But they drop for both those who did the right thing by society and accepted the extremely small risk of side effects as well as those who freeloaded on the majority and didn't get vaccinated.But the prevalence of both stupidity and selfishness are not limited to people of one political leaning or another. So to look for a political cause to this effect will mislead.

“Policymakers have severely underestimated the risks of ecological tipping points, according to a study that shows 45% of all potential environmental collapses are interrelated and could amplify one another.

… Among the latter pairings were Arctic ice sheets and boreal forests. When the former melt, there is less ice to reflect the sun’s heat so the temperature of the planet rises. This increases the risks of forest fires, which discharge carbon into the air that adds to the greenhouse effect, which melts more ice. Although geographically distant, each amplifies the other.“
Not always geographically distant. 2 summers ago satellites spotted unusually large fires on Greenland just 40 miles from the ice sheet, dumping black carbon on 7.3m sea level rise equivalent of ice. This darkens it increasing heat retention and melt rate.

Dive into the emerald water. It’s 13 minutes and 70 metres down to lunch. Are you dead yet? Not if you are one of the Bajau “sea nomads” of south-east Asia, who have been free-diving like this for more than 1,000 years, relying on their remarkable physiology, and, as we learned in April, their genes. Humans left Africa 50 millennia ago, encountering new environments that required adaptation to survive. Adaptation is mostly cultural – building shelters, using fire, deciding what to eat, and transmitting instructions from generation to generation. But alongside this are advantageous genetic mutations grasped by natural selection.
Finding genetic changes that drive adaptations has become much easier now genomes can be sequenced cheaply, and a study this year of the Bajau people provided a beautiful example. Ultrasound scans revealed enlarged spleens – reflex contraction of this neglected organ helps during diving by pumping oxygenated red blood cells into the circulation. Sequencing Bajau genomes and comparing them with those of their non-diving neighbours revealed genes showing signatures of natural selection, one of which is specifically associated with spleen size. Understanding the dive response could have medical applications in acute hypoxia, a common killer in A&amp;E.Mark Jobling, professor of genetics, University of Leicester
Among the tsunami of bad news about plastic waste this year, there was a small piece of good news. This was an agreement in April by those responsible for more than 80% of the plastic packaging in the UK to make all plastic packing 100% recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025. This pledge, called the UK Plastics Pact, is significant because it has emerged not from government but from a consortium of companies and organisations including supermarkets, coffee chains, brands, manufacturers, waste disposal companies and local authorities. Thee organisationsy have clubbed together to solve this problem largely because they are under massive public pressure. They propose to create a circular economy of plastics, a seismic shift in the way companies engineer and use them. It is a big win for the environment of the UK, but it will also have a global impact, because many of the companies involved – such as Coca-Cola, Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble – are multinational corporations that sell products all over the world. Once the UK creates a non-polluting circular economy of plastic packaging, the likelihood of it being rolled out by these companies in the rest of the world is high. There is an enormous amount of work to do, but I hope when our children look back at the environmental catastrophe of the 20th century, they will see 2018 as the year plastic pollution started its decline.Mark Miodownik, professor of materials and society at University College London
Most people don’t think much about the high seas. Far beyond the horizon, they begin where national control ends, 200 nautical miles from the coast, and cover 61% of the ocean and 43% of the Earth’s surface. Few laws restrain fishing here; countries can opt out of those that exist, and much activity is in any case hidden by remoteness. But 2018 may signal the beginning of the end of freedom to plunder fish and slaughter wildlife caught alongside them. This year Global Fishing Watch lifted the veil on the high seas, exposing fishing vessels and companies to scrutiny for the first time. Their tool tracks ship movements based on satellite transmissions from vessels, and uses machine learning to determine what a vessel is doing from its behaviour. We learned this year that high seas fishing contributes only 4.2% of wild fish catches, that 64% of the spoils go to just five rich countries, and that much of this fishing would not be profitable without public subsidies. In September, the UN began negotiations for a new treaty to protect high seas wildlife, paving the way for marine protected areas that Global Fishing Watch can help to police.Callum Roberts, professor of marine conservation at the University of York
While it is always nice to round off the year with good-news science stories, I feel that the publication of the new UN IPCC (the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report in October was so important and with such huge ramifications that all else pales into insignificance.
The report shook the world when it was published on 8 October, suggesting that the time for talking was over and that the window available for us to really act against the worst effects of climate change was closing fast. It stated that “limiting global warming to 1.5C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”.
Written by 91 scientists and review editors from 40 countries, with over 6,000 scientific references and contributions from thousands of experts worldwide, it explained that we are already seeing the consequences of 1C of global warming: more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice. It also highlighted how much worse things could get if we do not act immediately.
The report examined what it would take to avert disaster and what the consequences could be. But the omens are not good. Global CO2 emissions are on the rise again, as is the popularity of climate change-denying, populist world leaders, which makes everything more difficult. Jim Al-Khalili, professor of theoretical physics at the University of Surrey
Europe’s hegemony on humankind’s story loosened when the record for the oldest known figurative cave art by Homo sapiens shifted from Germany to south-east Asia. The painting of a local wild cow, a banteng, in a remote cave in Borneo was dated in November as being a minimum of 40,000 years old, just nudging ahead of the Lion Man carving of Hohlenstein Stadel in Germany. In September, a flake of stone with hashed patterns made with an ochre crayon from the Blombos Cave in South Africa was dated at 73,000 years old, though these markings fall short of being identifiable as art. All these artefacts show the emergence of minds like our own, so-called behavioural modernity, all around the world. But it wasn’t limited to Homo sapiens. An abstract image of parts of a cow and some other mysterious figures adorns a cave wall on the Spanish Cantabrian coast, and in February was found to be a whopping 65,000 years old, though this date has been contested. The only people in northern Spain at that time were Homo neanderthalensis, and the continued rehabilitation of our cousins continues: Neanderthals were simply people too.Dr Adam Rutherford, presenter of Inside Science, Radio 4
When my son was younger, he had a duvet cover with animals from around the world. He slept wrapped in colourful images of tigers, elephants, and kangaroos. However, if this duvet represented mammals in terms of their weight, all the world’s wild mammals would cover only a corner of the pillowcase. This shocking fact was the main message I took from a detailed analysis of the biomass of life on Earth published earlier this year. People and our livestock (mostly cattle and pigs) now make up 96% of mammalian biomass on the planet. Similarly, the weight of domestic poultry (mostly chickens) is three times higher than all species of wild birds combined.
These stark statistics help us understand the extent to which we humans now dominate ecosystems. While wildlife documentaries still wow us with images of wonderful wildlife in wild places, these places are shrinking. Almost everywhere, the large mammal you are most likely to encounter is a human or a cow. I hope that being reminded of this will help society take actions to ensure that my son’s children don’t live in a world where wild species are only known from images on soft furnishings.Julia Jones, professor of conservation science, Bangor University
Gene-editing is a breakthrough in biotechnology, not least in crop improvement. Scientists’ favourite method, Crispr/Cas9, makes precise changes to individual genes, even changing a single “letter” of the genetic code. It’s quick, easy and amazingly versatile. A headline story in 2018 was the European court of justice’s ruling that gene-edited crops must be subject to the same cumbersome regulation as older methods of genetic engineering, even though Crispr mutations are no different to those found throughout the natural world. Plant breeders are pressing for this decision to be overturned so farmers and consumers can benefit from improvements in fruit, vegetables and field crops.
Meanwhile, they are seizing the opportunities offered by Crispr to transform food production. In 2018, teams of scientists in India and Australia announced that they had successfully edited the genome of bananas. This could rescue the world’s most popular fruit from the threat of disease. Banana improvement faces two great challenges. One is monoculture: the Cavendish is the supermarkets’ favourite banana, but plantations worldwide are susceptible to the destructive tropical race 4 strain of the Fusarium fungus. In other crops, cross-breeding could produce disease-resistant varieties, but the second challenge is that banana flowers are sterile. Gene-editing offers the exciting prospect that scientists will at last be able to make a disease-resistant banana.James Brown, head of crop genetics at the John Innes Centre, Norwich
Any woman who has suffered a miscarriage is likely to worry about what she has done “wrong”; a woman at the end of her pregnancy who is afflicted with the serious condition pre-eclampsia will wonder why it afflicted her in particular. Both situations, common as they are and with all their accompanying distress, are likely to arise from problems with the placenta. But it is difficult to determine this, since the human placenta is hardly available off the shelf for easy study.
A team of scientists at the University of Cambridge have made a breakthrough permitting them to create a 3D (that’s important in order to simulate reality) “organoid”, clusters of cells derived from the placentas of aborted foetuses. These have been shown to grow and produce proteins, sufficiently mimicking the real thing that a pregnancy test gives a positive result. This mini-placenta, only a millimetre or less across, offers the promise that the origin of the developmental abnormalities that lead to the embryo not correctly implanting in the womb can finally be understood. For many women, this insight could prove transformative. Clearly, there is a long way to go from creating the first mini-placentas to answering the fundamental questions, but this study appears to provide a critical step forward.Athene Donald, professor of experimental physics at the University of Cambridge
As much as I love seeing otherworldly pictures beamed back from the surface of Mars, it was a different sort of space landing that grabbed my attention this year. In June, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (Jaxa) Hayabusa2 probe rendezvoused with a near-Earth asteroid called Ryugu, some 280m km away. The first pictures beamed back revealed a strange and beautiful diamond-shaped rock ploughing its way through space. Fascinating in and of itself, but the real treat would come in September, when the probe landed two rovers on Ryugu’s surface. The picture above is one of the first ever transmitted from the surface of an asteroid, and I could stare at it for hours. It’s a reminder that while there’s still so much to learn about the universe, the baby steps we’re already taking reveal an awe-inspiring beauty in the most unexpected of places. Hayabusa2 will also be collecting rock samples that might shed light on the potential origins of water and organic compounds (and maybe even life) on Earth, but the journey will be a long and risky one – it’s not scheduled back until December 2020.Dr Pete Etchells, reader in psychology and science communication at Bath Spa University
This year has seen some sobering science stories, not least the increase in cases, sometimes fatal, of preventable diseases such as measles due to vaccine hesitancy and the growing politicisation of the anti-vaccine agenda. My older brother suffered with measles as child and was dangerously ill. He used to describe his fever dreams as the most terrifying experiences of his life. As late as the 1960s, many people still witnessed the potentially catastrophic effects of measles, rubella and whooping cough and there was a huge demand for the development of vaccines to prevent them. The introduction of vaccines dramatically reduced the incidence of infections and fewer people experienced the impact of disease. Now we are seeing a resurgence in preventable diseases such as measles due to vaccine hesitancy. Although there is not one clearly defined anti-vaccine group, six themes emerge:
1. Control: the idea that we can take back control of our own bodies through alternative means.
2. Parenting style: philosophies that shun mainstream medicine, opting for “natural” remedies.
3. The past: previous bad healthcare experiences or a bad experience around vaccination shapes perceptions.
4. Risk: misunderstandings about the risks of vaccination versus the risks of disease.
5. Fear of chemicals: the fear that the vaccine will introduce toxic chemicals.
6. Distrust of government agencies and corporations.
By listening to people, it is possible to start to understand what may lie behind their hesitancy. The re-emergence of preventable diseases is a stark reminder of how mistrust, confusion and bad information can spread, and emphasises the importance of experts in the field talking with and listening to the public to enable meaningful dialogue, help reduce propaganda and effect change.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has continued to make great strides in 2018. Although the AI of Blade Runner and Ex Machina remains as distant as ever, the power of so-called “deep neural networks” and “reinforcement learning” to solve complex problems has developed rapidly. Two milestones stand out this year: AlphaZero and AlphaFold, both from the London-based AI firm DeepMind. AlphaZero is the latest iteration of AlphaGo, which catapulted DeepMind to public prominence in 2016 when it beat Go champion Lee Sedol in a series of high-profile matches.
AlphaGo worked by training a deep neural network to predict the value of board positions, using millions of past games as training data. This was later improved upon by AlphaGo Zero, which learned purely by playing itself, and now AlphaZero takes things further by training a single network, again entirely through self-play and without any game-specific knowledge, to deliver world-beating performances in three different games: Go, chess, and the Japanese game shogi.
This remarkable achievement has also provided glimpses into new “machine-like” ways of thinking: as grandmaster Matthew Sadler put it, “it’s like discovering the secret notebooks of a great player from the past”. AlphaFold takes the same approach beyond the rarefied regime of board games to address a practical problem of real importance: predicting the 3D structure of proteins solely from genetic sequences. Here, the DeepMind software has again achieved world-leading results, bringing important implications for biology and medicine, and showcasing how AI can be used for scientific discovery itself.Anil Seth, professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience, University of Sussex
Atoms emit and absorb light when electrons inside them jump around. This light comes at frequencies characteristic of the type of atom – sort of a unique barcode. Reading these barcodes tells us what elements are present in the stars, galaxies and the sparse gas between them.
One thing we don’t know though is why there is not more antimatter around. Antimatter is created in radioactive decays and particle collisions; it is routinely used in medical diagnosis. But equal amounts of antimatter and matter are always created or destroyed together. So if the matter around us was created in the Big Bang, there should presumably be an equal amount of antimatter. So where is it?
The ALPHA experiment at CERN this year collected and controlled anti-electrons and anti-protons to make and store enough anti-hydrogen to could start reading its barcode. They read one of the key identifiers used to track intergalactic hydrogen for the first time – the so-called “Lyman alpha” line. The line is in the same place as that for hydrogen, as predicted.

Psychedelic mushrooms may still be in bloom on New Year’s Day, as the subzero temperatures that would normally have appeared by this time of year are yet to arrive.
Owing to the warming climate, the first autumn frost arrives up to a fortnight later across the south-west of England and south Wales than it did 50 years ago, considerably extending the mushroom season – but 2018’s cycle could be unprecedented.
“Climate change has had a dramatic effect on the fruiting season,” says Prof Lynne Boddy, a fungal ecologist. “Every year the start and end of the season is dependent on the weather, and we can see that up until the late 1970s it was largely consistent.
“However, on average, the first fruiting date now comes much earlier in the year than previously, while the last fruiting comes later.”
She says there used to be about 33 days of autumn fruiting, but now there are more than 70, giving the thousands of people who hunt for magic mushrooms and other fungi across the UK every autumn more time to forage.
With this year’s first sustained frost unseasonably late, psychedelic fungi is still being picked from Dartmoor, across the Brecon Beacons and into Yorkshire by amazed mycology enthusiasts.
“Magic mushrooms usually begin to sprout in September, but it was so warm this year that they didn’t get going until October,” says an experienced forager. “The first heavy frost spells the season’s end, which usually happens in late November, but this year in Devon the way the forecast looks I’ll still be picking on New Year’s Day.”
Dr Patrick Harding, author of the Collins Gem guide Mushrooms, says 2018 has been a very unusual year for fungi thanks to the long dry summer. “Forty years ago, when I first came to Sheffield, snow and frost curtailed the season before the end of November and the happy local band of magic mushroom gatherers would have started hibernating before advent,” he says.
“I’ll wait to see if we can still find any to help with the new year celebrations – the long range forecast even for Sheffield has very little talk of frost or snow before 2019.”
At different temperatures, fungi grow at different paces. Liberty caps, one of the most prevalent species containing the psychoactive ingredient psilocybin, produce their mushrooms at below 15C in the day and 10C at night – often next to manure – with the first freezing temperatures heralding the end of the season.
Magic mushroom use was popularised during the 70s when it emerged as a legal alternative to LSD, but they were banned in 2005. However, more than 200,000 people in the UK used them in 2017-18, an increase of a third on the previous year. According to the 2017 Global Drug Survey, they are the safest “recreational” drug.
Recent studies have suggested magic mushrooms have therapeutic benefits and can help treat depression. Despite this, it is a class A drug and picking psychedelic mushrooms is an offence punishable with up to seven years’ imprisonment. Nonetheless, it is not an offence to have them growing on your land.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/28/late-frost-gives-uk-magic-mushroom-hunters-an-extra-high

The climate panel is similar to one that Pelosi created when Democrats last controlled the House, from 2007 to 2011. It was eliminated when Republicans took the majority.
Pelosi, the likely House speaker, said Castor brings experience, energy and “urgency to the existential threat of the climate crisis” facing the US and the world. Castor is set to begin her seventh term representing the Tampa Bay area and serves on the energy and commerce committee.
“Congresswoman Castor is a proven champion for public health and green infrastructure, who deeply understands the scope and seriousness of this threat. Her decades of experience in this fight, both in Florida and in the Congress, will be vital,” Pelosi said.
Castor said in a statement that she was honored to lead the panel and pledged to “act with urgency to reduce carbon pollution” and “unleash” American ingenuity to create clean-energy jobs.
“The costs of the changing climate and extreme weather events pose greater risks every day to American families, businesses and our way of life,” Castor said. She added that the new panel “will tackle the crisis head on. Failure is not an option.”
The membership and exact scope of the panel remain to be determined, but Pelosi said it would play a key role in shaping how Congress responds to the threat of global warming while creating good-paying, “green” jobs.
The Maryland representative Steny Hoyer, the incoming House majority leader, said last week the climate committee would probably not have legal authority to demand documents under subpoena. But he added that he did not think the panel would need subpoena authority, since experts will be “dying to come before them”.
Climate scientists and other experts “are going to want to testify”, Hoyer said. “I think they’ll want to give the best information as it relates to the crisis.”
The Democratic representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and other progressives, have pushed for a “Green New Deal” that includes thousands of jobs in renewable energy such as wind and solar power. She and other leaders say the climate panel is a key platform to advance the green agenda.

Trump officials are minimizing warnings from scientists by arguing they are exaggerated and based on the worst-case scenario. They say the National Climate Assessment (NCA) – an expansive federal government report on the dangers of climate change in the US – considers only the highest possible levels of greenhouse gas emissions.
“If you take the extreme case, you’re right, it’s dire,” Trump’s interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, said on Fox News. “If you take the best case, it’s not much.”
Zinke, who has encouraged fossil fuel production on public lands, compared climate risks to the chance of nuclear war.
“If you look at nuclear war, today we’re going to go home to a bunker and wear a hazardous suit,” he said. “That’s not the case.”
Acting Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator Andrew Wheeler used some of the same phrasing, saying he “wouldn’t be surprised if the Obama administration told the report’s authors to take a look at the worst-case scenario for this report”. The Trump administration, he said, would need to “take a look at the modeling” for the next assessment, which is required by law.
Trump said he did not believe climate change would have economic consequences for the US.
Of Zinke’s comments, Pennsylvania University climate scientist Michael Mann said “there is no truth to [them] whatsoever”. He added: “The report looked at an extremely wide range of scenarios.
“At nearly every juncture, we have actually underestimated the impacts that climate change is having. Sea levels are rising faster, ice is disappearing sooner and the incidence of extreme weather events is increasing faster than our projections from just a few years ago suggested.”
Katharine Hayhoe, a Texas Tech University climate scientist and lead author of the scenarios chapter of an earlier part of the assessment, said the authors considered the range of possibilities outlined by United Nations experts, “from one where carbon emissions continue to grow through the end of the century to one where emissions are already declining and fall below zero before the end of the century.”
Rutgers University climate scientist Robert Kopp, also a lead author on an earlier volume of the report, called the administration’s framing “misguided”.
“In good risk assessment, you want to consider a range of scenarios from the high to the low,” Kopp said.
Awaiting Senate confirmation, Trump nominees have largely acknowledged that climate change is happening but downplayed its impacts, suggesting it is not possible to say how much of it is because of human activities like burning coal and driving cars.
In office, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt considered a military-style “red team, blue team” debate, questioning climate science. An EPA official speaking to conservative state lawmakers in Washington on Friday said those plans were no longer on the table.
Mandy Gunasekara, a high-ranking official in the EPA air office, said the agency’s “understanding of CO2 and greenhouse gases continues to evolve”. After the meeting she said the EPA was still having a “preliminary interim discussion” about climate change science policies.
The NCA, which the administration quietly published the day after the Thanksgiving holiday, looks at how the extent of heat waves, extreme weather and swelling seas will depend on how much greenhouse gas pollution continues to rise.
Even if greenhouse gases stopped rising now, the world would heat up by another 1.1F (0.6C), according to the earlier portion of the report authored by Hayhoe and others. Over the next two decades, temperatures could increase between 0.5F and 1.3F (0.3C and 0.7C).
Global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations appear to be the highest they have been in 3m years, and continued carbon growth is likely lead to carbon levels not seen in tens of millions of years.
If humans greatly reduce the greenhouse gases spewing into the atmosphere, continuing warming will still pose wide-ranging dangers.
The Trump cabinet has however sought to advance oil and gas operations, subsidize coal plants and rescind climate protections drafted by Barack Obama’s agencies. Trump also plans to exit the international Paris agreement that aims to cut greenhouse gases.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/01/trump-officials-argue-climate-change-warnings-based-on-worst-case-scenario

Oh! how I wish more voters would understand this endless dynamic - LNP white-ant our assets and infrastructure, etc destabilising our society and economy, claim it is 'fiscally responsible'. Then ALP has to try and crisis manage the extraordinary damage, and get abused and misrepresented for their efforts.
Destroying/ selling off assets and white-anting non-super wealthy citizens (who are the majority of economic participants) via punitive, ideological policy is the complete opposite of fiscal sense. Eroding the fiscal bedrock of a nation in the name of 'reducing expenditure' is counterproductive lunacy.

Yeah there are a heap of peer reviewed studies on what liberal voters think about climate change. Just google it.
Turnbull came up with the NEG, which reasonable people on both sides seemed to acknowledge was a good solution. Nonetheless, his polling remained terrible, and he was eventually overthrown by his own party. Not exactly a ringing endorsement for action on climate change.

One of the main reasons Turnbull was so popular is because he promised to never lead a government that is less passionate about tackling climate change than he was. Stupidly, he sold his soul to the devil and reniged on this promise. It was his hypocricy that lost him votes on climate change, not his support of addressing it.
Even I , a Greens member was willing to suport the LNP when Turnbull deposed Abbott - but then the neanderthals in the LNP took control and held Turnbull over a barrel. Now Turnbull, is by giving in to their disgusting agendas, as bad as the rest of the rabble - the privileged white males who think that being far-right, rich, stupid, selfish, narcissistic, racist, homopohobic, sexist, misogynists will win them the next federal election.

According to tallyroom.com.au, “Nepean is a reasonably safe Liberal seat.” Nepean is now unexpectedly held by the ALP with a swing of 8.6%. I never thought this could happen in my lifetime. I’m very glad it has. Looking at the booth votes, at the 2014 election the ALP only won 2 out of 20 booths. This time the Liberal Party won only 4 out of 20 booths. 
In the nearby electorates of Mornington and Hastings, parts of which are in Flinders as well, the ALP in the 2014 election won only one booth in each electorate. This time they won 9 out of 13 in Mornington and 9 out of 17 in Hastings. The swings were 7.6% in Mornington and 6.5% in Hastings. The votes from booths in the parts of these electorates that are inside Flinders broke evenly with a slight tilt to the ALP. 
The vote in this area went straight from Liberal to ALP. The Greens vote increased only slightly by 0.23%.
Greg Hunt is on a margin of only 7% after the redistribution and is most likely toast at the next election. Especially since many liberal voters have said that although they voted liberal at the state level, they couldn’t stomach doing the same at the federal level. 
The next federal election will have many variable outcomes. It’s not only the marginals that will need to be watched but safe seats as well. It will make pork barrelling extremely hard for the Liberals especially since the community’s rejection of the party is largely based on ‘social’ issues that the current Liberal leadership consider to be matters of ‘principle’ and the rest of the community see as matters of survival and a decent life for all such as reducing emissions, reducing gender and religious discrimination and the many other issues where the Liberal party remains in the past and out of touch.

The Liberal party won’t reform, so it is time to stop fighting, split and take the opportunity to compete for the support of the public. The Liberal party is now broken, brand-damaged and unable to attract new members that would enable it to represent a “broad church”.
The failure of the existing Liberal party to address climate change or to support an integrity commission is unacceptable.
Nowhere is this failure more obvious than in its continued support for the Adani coalmine and new coal-fired power stations.
I expected more from Scott Morrison after the Victorian walloping. Instead we get the very same. Slippery answers to everything. Coal, coal, coal and soaring greenhouse gas emissions.
Refusing to reduce emissions as cheaply as possible is irrational, immoral and economically reckless. Achieving emission reductions of just 2% a year as proposed by the Labor party in the electricity sector costs very little and won’t risk system stability or security.
We should be aiming for a 2% reduction in emissions every year to ensure Australia does its fair share to tackle climate change. Instead, emissions are increasing and are at a seven year high.
Something must lie behind the failure of the Liberal party to accept policies that are economically rational and environmentally sound, so some sunlight from an integrity commission should be welcomed by all Australians.Wherever you look, something is wrong.
We desperately need an integrity commission to investigate potential conflicts of interest
The pursuit by ministers of baseload coal power when we need dispatchable renewable energy and storage.
Claims by ministers that we need more fossil fuels and that they are cheaper than renewables or that clean coal is the answer.
Claims by ministers that as Australia only emits 1.3% of global pollution we have no role to play, ignoring the fact that we are only 0.3% of the population and that we will be heavily damaged by the impacts of climate change.
And the final insult – allowing the Adani coalmine to proceed when it lacks a social licence, is completely inconsistent with the need to tackle climate change and frankly smells with donations, overseas trips and wedding parties.
We desperately need an integrity commission to investigate potential conflicts of interest that see a revolving door between the coal industry and minister’s offices. It is hard to believe donors don’t have influence on the selection of ministers to some degree.
Members of parliament that are selected to be ministers stand to receive additional pay of more than $150,000, boosting their remuneration towards $500,000. It seems obvious that such ministers would be more likely to promote the views of the large donors that influenced their appointment in the first place.
We need a parliament that accepts science.
We need a parliament that respects our geography and rationally accepts that our neighbours and their views have special relevance and their concerns deserve special attention, just as my neighbours on my street deserve my special consideration.
We need a root and branch review of the political remuneration system that ensures that it provides the right incentives for all politicians to work for the benefit of our country rather than fight against each other to secure the “spoils of government”.
As a Liberal, I have had enough and, as evidenced by the swing in safe Liberal seats in Victoria, I am not alone.
We must provide alternatives for Liberals to vote for at the next federal election, and I hope to see independent Liberals provide electors in safe Liberal seats with that choice. We need to return to the day where politicians know that their job is not to retain their job but rather to represent their electorate, who, if they are lucky, reward them with their job.
The Liberal party brand has been so damaged and trust so completely destroyed that no amount of “shuffling the deck chairs” will change the outcome of the next federal election.
It is simply impossible for many Liberal voters to vote for a party that:
works to prevent any action on climate change
has the potential to be controlled by the mining industry or whichever new industry is willing to pay for favours (clubs, internet gambling, pokies, firearms and many more)
rejects the establishment of an integrity commission
rejects donation reform and transparency and promotes members for their fundraising skills rather than policy and communication skills
backs the Adani coalmine, which has no social licence and is inconsistent with our need to tackle climate change; and
regardless of the election result seems to be heading towards installing Tony Abbott or Peter Dutton as the next party leader
Liberal voters will align with independent Liberals who have real world experience, who will put the interests of their electorates first and who support: 
tight fiscal responsibility so the country operates within its means
strong border controls, backed by a compassionate approach to the treatment of refugees
free enterprise and small business, balanced with appropriate regulation to ensure competition is fair
transparency, integrity and trust; and
real action on climate change that is consistent with what the science is demanding
While I am sure many “shock jocks” who are doing daily damage to the Liberal party will yet again venture to their usual corner of scare tactics about the arrival of independent Liberals, there is no justification for that.
Independent Liberals will move with transparency and integrity, and will clearly state their principals and beliefs so electors know what they are voting for. Just imagine how refreshing that would be in the current world of dark party politics where trading principles for position and power is considered a positive skill.
Once the Liberal party reforms and rebalances, Liberal independents might elect to join again.

Surrounded by a hellish inferno of burning trees and cars, McLarty reasoned the flames would engulf her long before the smoke could choke her to death.
Trapped in nearby vehicles, some of McLarty’s colleagues made similarly macabre calculations. Two nurses, stuck in the back of a stalled police car, contemplated shooting each other. Another nurse rolled down her window and gulped in the smoke. McLarty edged her car away from a burning wreckage, fired off some final messages to her sister and called her daughter, who said she could hear the roar of the blaze over the phone.
“Once you feel heat, you know that your car can’t last very long,” said McLarty, a slight, deliberate woman who, little over an hour previously, was in a hospital conducting a gallbladder operation when she was told to evacuate.
“You can hear other people’s cars blow up. I grew up thinking that when people died in fires, they died from the smoke and so they didn’t really suffer. But I’m thinking ‘this is coming fast enough … I don’t think that I’m gonna die from smoke.’”
As McLarty arrived at this grim conclusion, a bulldozer emerged from the sun-blotting pall of smoke and shoved an abandoned car off the road, opening an escape path for McLarty and a few others to dart to safety in a nearby field. “This poor man. I mean, he’s just driving to his death, and they cleared a path,” McLarty said. “It was apocalyptic.”
The bulldozer driver, she later found out, survived, as did others given just minutes to flee the incinerated town of Paradise, California, on 8 November. Heather Roebuck delivered her daughter by cesarian section at McLarty’s hospital and had to be dragged on a stretcher through thick smoke to safety. Brad Weldon somehow stopped flames devouring his home, aided by buckets, a hose and his blind and immobile 90-year-old mother. More than a dozen terrified people waded into a frigid reservoir, nearly succumbing to the cold while their neighbours were perishing in the heat.
Still, the Camp fire is comfortably the deadliest in California history, with 85 confirmed deaths and a few dozen people unaccounted for. More than 50,000 others were scattered into refugee tent encampments, hotels, relatives’ couches. “We are a town in exile,” said Michael Orr, a Paradise resident now living on an air mattress at his in-laws’ house in Chico.
Of the 10 most destructive fires in California’s history, five have occurred since October last year
Nine in 10 homes in Paradise have been reduced to clumps of ash, mixed with twisted metal, as if the settlement has been carpet-bombed by a brutal invader. Chimneys, like tombstones for a lost town, are the only things left standing. The birds fled along with the humans leaving Paradise an eerily quiet place with a lingering smell of charcoal.
The visceral trauma of having a town wiped off the map is the nadir in an astonishing burst of recent wildfires – of the 10 most destructive fires in California’s recorded history, five have occurred since October last year.
“The landscape is changing into the appropriate climate zone that we are moving towards,” said LeRoy Westerling, a climate change and fire expert at the University of California, Merced, who attempts to work out how wildfires will spread as temperatures continue to rise. “The fires seem to be outpacing our predictions. The Camp fire shocked me by how fast it was.”
California is in the grip of what its governor, Jerry Brown, calls the “new abnormal”. The past five years have been the hottest on record in the state, which is in stuttering recovery from its worst drought in a millennium. The state has received just a fifth of its normal rainfall so far in 2018, with a record 1.6m acres of grassland, forest and urban area, an area larger than Delaware, burning this year.
Of the multifarious consequences of climate change, scientists consider increasingly ferocious wildfires to be one of the most starkly apparent. Rising atmospheric heat – average minimum temperatures in California are 2.3F warmer than a century ago – is drying out trees and shrubs, drawing moisture away from the soil and shrinking the snowpack. Dampening rains are becoming erratic, or, like this year, not materializing at all.
This creates a tinderbox for wildfires, which can ignite from actions as simple as sparks flying from a trailer dragging on the road or a faulty power line. There’s also evidence that climate change will help southern California’s autumn winds, known as Santa Anas or Diablos, fan wildfires. A 2016 study found climate change has doubled the total area burned in the western US since the 1980s.
Something on the scale of the Camp fire, where a funnel of flame seared through a town in a few hours, could’ve conceivably occurred 50 years ago but it would’ve involved a “very unlikely sequence of climate events you wouldn’t see again”, Westerling said.
“Now we are seeing it happen again and again, year after year,” he added. “The climate will continue to warm and will continue to surprise us. No one alive today will ever see a stable climate system again. This is going to be changing for the rest of our lives.”
Firefighters now face a grueling workload that lasts all year, rather than tapering off in time for Thanksgiving. Last October, the Tubbs fire razed chunks of Santa Rosa, causing 22 deaths. It was swiftly followed by the Thomas fire, which burned a vast swath of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties and primed the landscape for mudslides that killed more than 20 people.
Then, during the Carr fire in July, the public was introduced to the terrifying concept of a fire tornado, or firenado, when a monstrous seven-mile high flaming column killed a firefighter, Jeremy Stoke, who was attempting to evacuate people on the edge of Redding.
“A whole bunch of fires have piled on to the top of each other and haven’t stopped,” said Scott McLean, deputy chief of Cal Fire, who oversaw crews working 24-hour shifts during the fight to save Paradise. “I grew up in this state and you’d never really get fires like this in November or December. We’re now fighting fire all year round. There’s no fire season any more. People are tired. It’s a constant battle.”
I grew up in this state and you’d never really get fires like this in November or December
The situation is set to become worse. An exhaustive climate change assessment by the US government predicts the area of the western US consumed by wildfire annually is set to double, or even increase sixfold, within 30 years as the planet continues to warm.
Confronted by the findings of his government’s scientists, Donald Trump bluntly stated, “I don’t believe it.” The president has, instead, blamed the “gross mismanagement of forests” in California, a state where the majority of woodland is overseen by the federal government. To add to the confusion, Trump, whose recent ecological pronouncements include “oceans are very small”, suggested “cleaning and raking” forests to prevent future conflagrations.
Others in the administration argued the issue more conventionally. Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary and former Navy Seal, recently visited Paradise and likened it to Falluja, the Iraqi city flattened during the second Gulf war. Zinke has blamed “radical environmentalists” for preventing proper management of the forests and has vowed to loosen rules to allow more intervention.
Decades of fire suppression by firefighters has interrupted the natural cycle of forest regeneration, allowing fuel to build up and ignite in huge blazes. During the Ronald Reagan administration, the government spent a few hundred thousand dollars on firefighting – this year it could top $4bn.
The idea of “thinning” the forest to reduce this fuel, however, is viewed suspiciously by many ecologists who see it as a euphemism for logging that can make wildfires more rampant. “It may make donors some money but it won’t do anything to help communities facing the dangers of wildfires,” said Westerling.
There’s agreement, at least, that rustic settlements need to adapt – better building materials to resist flying embers, moats of cleared vegetation around houses, widened roads to act as firebreaks. One in three Americans now live among forested areas, with many of them drawn to scenes similar to Paradise – an affordable enclave nestled in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, a bucolic patchwork of almond farms and vineyards.
The more complicated question is what to do when things start to go awry, when fires and floods spurred by climate change force growing numbers of Americans to flee their homes. Rebuilding is under way in Santa Rosa following the fires last year, but “for every building going up you see about 10 lots empty and another 10 for sale,” admitted Shirlee Zane, supervisor of Sonoma county. “Climate change is here and affecting us in catastrophic ways.”
Jody Jones, Paradise’s mayor, has vowed the town will “rise from the ashes”, but when you stand in the muddy surrounds of Walmart in Chico, where 75 bedraggled tents full of Paradise evacuees continue to stand, it’s clear that the phenomenon of climate refugees won’t be restricted to places such as Bangladesh and far-flung Pacific islands.
“A lot of people are desperate,” said Naomi Larae, who had nowhere else to turn to other than the encampment, known in a sardonic nod to Hollywood as “Wallywood”, and has suffered the indignity of having her tent stolen.
Back in Paradise, the town twice mistakenly called “Pleasure” by Trump, Ruth McLarty sifted through the remnants of her home. Her daughter rescued her laptop, as well as the dog and parakeet, but the clarinet and piano are just cinders now, the sofa merely springs. McLarty picked up one of the few surviving items, a mug with “Hawaii” emblazoned on it, only for the handle to split off in her hand.
“It’s just surreal, you don’t really know what to think, how to process it,” she said, plucking a blackened bowl from the ashy detritus that was once her kitchen.
“Do I even bother to try to stay? So much is lost and it will take so long to repopulate. I really don’t know. I just can’t see the future right now.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/10/the-new-abnormal-why-fires-like-paradise-will-happen-again-and-again

The storm has begun a track towards the coast, where more than 100 bushfires are still burning after week-long heatwaves and “unprecedented” conditions. Tropical cyclone Owen will bring some relief from the stinking heat; lower temperatures and rainfall that should help firefighters control the most threatening fires by midweek.
Queensland’s exhausted emergency services will not welcome Owen’s track towards the shore with any sense of respite; to them the blended ends of disaster seasons represent a horror scenario, but one many have seen coming.
Paul Gray, a representative of the Queensland Firefighters’ Union, says the nature of bushfires has noticeably changed in recent years. The fires, he says, have become more intense and longer-lasting. Last week conditions in parts of Queensland were classified “catastrophic” for the first time. The rating has only existed since 2009, but no bushfire in the state since 1966, when warnings were first introduced, would have been considered so dangerous.
“They’re always intense, but now you’re getting punished for days and days. Instead of a heatwave lasting one day, heatwaves are lasting four days or longer,” Gray says.
“It makes it more difficult for fire crews to stand down, we lose the ability to rotate. Firefighters are working longer hours on protracted incidents for days at a time. There is an increasing need for out-of-state and overseas assistance, because it’s getting harder to relieve our own crews.”

Australia’s devastating bushfires typically occur far to the south of the tropical Queensland rainforest.
But Gray says the fire season in the north now lasts longer. That means a diminishing timeframe to allow emergency services to change tack from firefighting to battling cyclones and floodwaters, which historically have caused many more deaths and wider destruction in Queensland.
“We have to turn around very quickly and go from a fire mindset to a floodwater mindset. We have to repurpose vehicles for a different kind of response. It used to be that you could predict when your storm or flood season would be, you’d predict when your fire season would be.
“Climate change is having an impact on firefighting. There’s scientific data to back it up, but I like to think that because we are on the coal face that people are a little bit more aware of just how things have actually changed.”
“Climate change is about unprecedented conditions becoming more probable,” says the climate scientist Lesley Hughes. “What was normal on average 20 years ago is not normal or average now. If you’re getting unprecedented conditions, that’s what climate scientists have been warning about.”
The word unprecedented has been used repeatedly to describe Queensland’s weather this past week. Centuries-old heat records were broken in north Queensland, most remarkably in Cairns, where the hottest November temperature had been a 37.2C day in 1900. On Monday last week, Cairns was recorded at 42.6C. The following four days were all hotter than the previous record.
“The strongest relationship between climate change and bushfires is the weather on the day,” Hughes says. “As climate change continues on, we continue to get increased average temperatures, that’s increasing the probability that we will get dangerous fire weather on any particular day.”
In 2014 the Climate Council made six key findings about Australia’s fire season. That risk had increased; the fire season was becoming longer; fires were being fuelled by record conditions; the number of high-risk days would increase; communities should prepare for increasingly severe fires and “this is the critical decade”.
“This is the new reality that people have to live and plan for,” Hughes says.
Longer bushfire seasons in Australia and the US have already threatened to disrupt longstanding cooperation between the two countries, including sharing personnel, equipment and expertise. Changes to fire seasons have this week created a conflict between the lingering bushfire emergency in Queensland and the forecast of extreme conditions in Victoria. Crews from Victoria were sent north to assist, but the last will return south so their home state can be properly prepared.
“Where once we might have shared personnel during bushfire periods ... that’s becoming less and less feasible because countries and states are needing those things at the same time,” Hughes says.
“This does point to the need for more resources, as well as increasingly looking at planning regulations, looking at what people can build, having roads to get people out. It’s an example of how the change in risk due to climate change is affecting everything about our daily lives.”
There is a kind of bushfire no one can survive; the sort we could barely conceive until a decade ago.
Before the catastrophic Black Saturday fires in Victoria, which killed 173 people in February 2009, residents were advised they could choose to remain in their homes and defend their property. The mantra was leave early, or stay, in part to avoid the dangers of having people panic and flee with a fire front approaching.
In Queensland last week, emergency services used modelling developed in Victoria after Black Saturday to launch several widespread evacuations. The largest was in the town of Gracemere, near Rockhampton, where about 8,000 people were told to go.
Beau Dabron, the administration manager at the Gracemere Hotel, stayed in town. He and others watched traffic bank up in town and remain stationary for more than an hour, as people piled into cars and attempted the short drive to Rockhampton.
“Once night time fell we had a good view from the pub towards Kabra ... there’s none of that glow, there was no flame. In our minds we felt we were fine. We slept with one eye open just to be safe,” he says.
Was he worried that this fire could be different?
“Most people have been through them before, so generally speaking people have something to expect. The fear set in when people said, ‘the whole town is going’.”
The Tropic of Capricorn runs through Gracemere. Conditions turned when the tropical humidity suddenly dropped – combined with record high temperatures and fierce winds, the ingredients to fuel the most dangerous fires.
Rachel Nolan, a fire ecologist from the University of Western Sydney, says climate change means conditions are drier, as well as warmer.
“The two things are really tied together,” Nolan says. “When it’s warmer, that means the fuels are going to be drier.
“There’s a couple of things that contribute to the risk of fire – the fuel load, the amount of material that can burn, and how dry that fuel is.”
Richard Thornton, the chief executive of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards cooperative research centre, says there has been a “long-term moisture deficit” on the Australian east coast that adds to the fire risk.
“The whole of the east coast ... is pretty dry at the moment. The underlying condition is dry. What that means is that if you get a day that’s hot, that’s windy. ... it will burn with a ferocity.”
Thornton says the Queensland fires are “another example of some of the extremes that are possible”.
“It’s incredibly unusual, if not unknown, for these sorts of temperatures in this location. It’s pretty clear that something is changing in terms of fire season.
“I think that what we’re seeing in Queensland is tragic for those who are there. For the rest of the country, who are coming into the beginning of summer, this is a real wake-up call saying, ‘Now is the time to prepare’.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/04/bushfires-tropics-queensland-terrifying-new-reality-cyclones-flooding

They approved resolutions supporting stripping tax benefits from electric vehicles and endorsing Donald Trump’s pro-fossil fuel energy agenda. And they voted down a proposal to limit monopoly control of the power industry, which backers said would give consumers more choice and help grow renewable electricity faster and more cheaply.
The group, a taskforce of the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), did so behind closed doors. They barred press from the rooms where they called roll. When voice votes were close and a tally was required, the business representatives weighing in on what kinds of policies state legislatures should pursue voted in secret. They cast ballots on paper, in a change that four sources said organizers announced was meant to keep the process confidential from reporters.
An Alec spokeswoman, Anna Tarnawski, said taskforce meetings and votes are closed to the press because “legislators are testing ideas and debating, and often are taking contrary positions for the purpose of debate and informing the conversation. They don’t want to be held to a policy declaration in the meeting because it might not necessarily be what they believe or where they’re going.”
The deliberations of a private group such as Alec, where elected officials meet out of public view with big business, highlight the divides the Republican party is struggling with as it courts both rightwing social conservatives and free-market Republicans.
Alec has lost prominent members, including ExxonMobil and Verizon. Advocates who deny the science behind manmade climate change are regular attendees. Verizon ended its support after an anti-Muslim activist spoke at an annual Alec meeting.
But corporate influence over statehouses is strong and was on display in the lobbying fight over the future of the power industry. A trade group for investor-owned power companies opposed the idea of subjecting them to more competition.
Representatives of the group, the Edison Electric Institute, refused to answer questions from the Guardian following the Friday meeting. Kristine Telford and Jennifer Jura, both in external affairs, had a conference organizer escort them out of a back exit and wouldn’t acknowledge reporters when addressed by name.
Competition supporters said the fight shows how much power utilities have over state governments and the people who are forced to buy their product.
Michigan state representative Gary Glenn, the Alec resolution sponsor and head of the house energy committee who lost a primary race for the Michigan senate, said lawmakers are controlled by power companies “in fear of political retaliation”.
Glenn claimed the industry donated $1m against him in his primary election.
“I think it is because of the political power of the companies. It was the case in Lansing before this year’s election that a lot of legislators walked around afraid of their own shadows when it came to energy,” Glenn said.
A spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, the utility trade group, declined to comment on why representatives ignored reporters but argued the competition proposal wouldn’t help consumers.
But competition supporters say it is obvious that competition drives down costs and offered Texas, which has competition over power generation, as an example. Texas has low power costs and more wind energy than any other state.
“Competition leads to better-quality service, better-quality product at a lower price. Those simple free market principles apply to the provision of electricity just as they do every other commodity in service,” Glenn said. “This is one of those issues where inevitably 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, we are going to look at this as a quaint and amusing debate because technology means competition is eventually going to win out.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/04/alec-taskforce-vote-approve-anti-environment-measures

His administration had tried to hide the report, publishing it on Black Friday when many Americans were either recovering from a Thanksgiving food coma or stampeding department store sales.
The administration’s plan backfired badly – the latest alarming climate science report became front-page news. Numerous Republican politicians were asked about it on TV news and politics shows, and their answers demonstrated that Trump’s climate science denial continues to pervade the GOP.
Republican party leaders’ answers ranged from platitudes – such as “our climate always changes” and “innovation” is all that is needed to solve the problem – to accusations that “a lot of these scientists are driven by the money”.
Addressing the latter point,one of the report’s lead authors, Prof Katharine Hayhoe, noted that many of its contributors were “paid zero dollars” and estimated that in the time she devoted to the assessment, she could have written eight of her own papers. Conversely, GOP politicians and operatives are paid millions of dollars annually by the fossil fuel industry. Some people are clearly driven by the money, and it’s not climate scientists.
Trump’s comments did not stop at disbelief – he also appeared to shift blame to other countries and tout the US’s clean air and water.
“You’re going to have to have China, and Japan, and all of Asia, and all of these other countries – you know, [the report] addresses our country. Right now, we’re at the cleanest we’ve ever been, and that’s very important to me. But if we’re clean but every other place on Earth is dirty, that’s not so good. So, I want clean air, I want clean water – very important,” the president said.
BREAKING: ""I don't believe it.""President Trump passively rejects the findings of the major new US government multi-agency report that says climate change will wallop the US economy in years to come. https://t.co/ImcZSeAowf pic.twitter.com/hcUnY8Jdui
These comments confuse climate change with air pollution, but the two are connected. The national climate assessment report pointed out that climate change was exacerbating wildfires, which in turn create air pollution. The Camp fire in November produced so much smoke that California had the worst air quality in the world at the time.
A key figure showed that climate change had approximately doubled the area burned by wildfires in the western US, and the report noted that – contrary to the administration’s frequent claims – this increase was “more closely related to climate factors than to fire suppression, local fire management, or other non-climate factors”.
Trump’s claim that US air is “the cleanest it’s ever been” is also not strictly true. Despite a long-term downward trend, owing in large part to the replacement of coal power plants that the Trump administration is desperately trying to save, particulate matter levels were up slightly from 2016 to 2017.
The administration’s efforts to weaken and repeal every possible environmental regulation certainly do not merit credit for the long-term improvement in air and water quality in the US.
Trump’s efforts to shift blame to other countries is also at odds with the fact that every other nation in the world has signed up to the Paris climate accords and only one government has announced its intent to withdraw from them.
The Republican party has become Trump’s as well. The few party leaders who were willing to acknowledge the threats detailed in the report claimed that all the climate policies proposed thus far would be harmful to the economy, and that we should instead focus on innovation.
While individual climate policies may or may not slow the economy, the scientific research is clear that climate change will curb economic growth – particularly in the US. The assessment report makes clear that if we’re worried about the economy, we must slow global warming. And while research into potential carbon-cutting technology innovations is needed, hoping that somebody will invent a way out of this mess is too big a risk. It is accepted that solving global warming won’t be cheap or easy but failing to do so will come at a much higher cost and not just in terms of money.
Those were the least irrational of the Republican party’s reactions to the report, as most of the five stages of climate denial were on display. One conservative panelist went as far as to claim: “We had two of the coldest years, biggest drop in global temperatures that we have had since the 1980s, the biggest in the last 100 years.”
In reality, at the end of this year, 2014–2018 will be the five hottest years ever recorded. And virtually everything Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said about the report was wrong, including that it was “not based on facts … not data-driven”.
As the US astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has said: “The good thing about science is that it’s true whether or not you believe in it.”

The gas is CO2 in a fire extinguisher at 800 psi being reduced b y a conventional spring biased valve to 100 psi which is then reduced (mediated into a metered flow) by my piston valve-manifold or PVM to 10 psi by balancing the unequal pressures until upset on demand ( aerosol sprayed etc or coca-cola poured) when flow occurs until use stops and balance is restored.

Nothing that we are now doing is other than part of the problem on a planet in which ""no amount of emission reduction alone can avoid disaster"" Prof W Broecker (Columbia University NY etc and the GOM of climate change). 
Fortunately there is such invention - I know it because I am the unfortunate into whose mind it fell. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9URyJBuNM Shows a single moving part 'valve' called a PVM which differs from all others because instead of using springs in valves to regulate flow it holds in balance unequal pressures until balance is disturbed by flow when it seeks to re-establish balance. 
In the video a conventional spring reduction valve reduces source pressure from the cylinder from 800 psi to 100 psi. But the PVM then mediates the 100 psi flow into a 10 psi on demand supply. It will enable us to use fluids at very high pressures for power - far above anything any spring system can mediate. So in case in point nitrogen taken from the air by a domestic fractional distillation unit powered by PV on the roof, the nitrogen is distilled out as a cold liquid. If 'bottled' and the 'bottle' is topped by the PVM (which also functions as a stopper) the whole can be set aside to warm up t ambient temperature at which point the cold liquid will have warmed from -196°C to 20°C and in doing so have passed through its phase states into being am immensely energetic supercritical fluid. Internal pressure c44.000 psi. The PV can mediate that to - for example - replace the ignition of fuel in car cylinders to produce thrust to the crowns of pistons of 700 psi, and run the small generator to heat and light and run the house, train, bus, hospital office ship, et al needed by us.

It ended it in 2011 as 'unachievable' explaining in 'What would it really take to reverse climate change?"", published in IEEE Spectrum, 'Only yet to be invented disruptive technology. 
You say ""Globally the roll out of solar and wind and its competitiveness along with the rise of the EV is transforming chemical storage year on year. This is the disruptive technology"". With respect, none of this is disruptive technology but bringing back into use very old stuff. It is better now and doing that is what we do well - it is 'incremental innovation'.
Much rarer is what creates entirely unknown hitherto industries. That is disruptive technology - and is only ever done of funded by the State - the Hovercraft in the UK in 1956 and GPS etc in the USA - who still fund this. We don't the EU doesn't hence decline since all new forms of employment, new markets and new revenues come from such technology. 
That is what is needed now. It is needed not just to replace oil, coal and gas but EV and Turbines, Centralised power generation and ever growing grid systems all of which have direct and indirect carbon footprints that must go - they are as inimical to man as any other carbon emission which not only has to be replaced but we also need to reduce the carbon level in the atmosphere back from where it will go - so worse is to come before it can get better - back to below 300 ppm. Or we don't survive. 
The FT did an excellent EV and ICE comparison - and that did not, I think, include the new infrastructure needed. But it made plain that EV and none of the post Kyoto alternatives are apposite 'disruptive technology'. We are still very bad at counting up the real carbon cost of these things. But when done they give a stark picture of at best displacing the problem elsewhere - and that doesn't cure global warming. 
What may is my invention. It is as simple asa safety pin but is the key to using nitrogen not as cold cryogenic fluid but at its immense pressure when held under control of the PVM which on demand can precisely meter a flow for whatever use is specified from runnig your car (converted) to run clean to taking you house off grid, your train hospital and air-conditioning and everything else. If you google <pat2pdf> and punch in 8556133 that brings up the US patent. jmcbruce@btinternet.com.
What it des is replace the spring now used in valves to contain pressure and on over-pressure or demand allow flow. Springs can manage maybe 5,000 psi. The PVM is single moving part which balances pressures so can flow and control any pressure, far above current capacity. So, in deployment we can power whatever we wish to from what in time will be a back pack unit to power our lives including the latest phone.

With respect the evidence is otherwise. The Met Office putting 5.4°C at 2070 is the global anomaly bt it will be much higher by then for the HNA. It might help to look at 'wet bulb' (Wikipedia) above a wet bulb temperature of 35°C our cooling system fails and we die. So first it was 2°C anomaly that was 'dangerous' now lowered to 1.5°C above pre-industrial. The GA for July 2016 was 2.24°C and in 2017 2.23°C (Note NASA Gistemp MERAA2). What faces us is exponential mortality should we fail to reverse the trend. 
You talk of a well mixed GHG. In fact (not the excellent NASA global graphics on 1880 - 2017 change) the accretion of carbon in the Northern hemisphere. As a matter of Occam's Razor - given that the anomaly accelerated as we levelled our emissions (2012 - 2017) - that something other than our emissions is now the main driver. CH4 is 84 times the GHG on emission than CO2 (and breaks down in the troposphere to CO2 and H20 - both long term GHGs). It os now ear 200 ppb as against highest peaks over the previous 800,000 years of 780ppb. We have, I fear, let the gene out f the bottle in the Arctic. 
But you miss point. You are right on storage which is why, as Google concluded, the only hope we have is in new disruptive tech. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9URyJBuNM . What you can see here is a 2013 video showing a single moving part management and metered flow device enabling us to use undreamt of pressures. 
It is a device (<pat2pdf > US8556133 is a copy of one of its global patents) which in replacing the spring used in current flow valves by balancing pressures enables us to use nitrogen not as cold cryogenic fluid but warm as a supercritical fluid in which highly energetic state a contained amount will be at some 44,000 psi. That can be flowed in a controlled in a precisely metered way by the PVM (piston valve-manifold) to run your car (on conversion) and your home, train, hospital and air conditioning dehumidifiers et al - clean. And off grid - live on a mountain top or in a desert.

Tight oil production has been the surprise blip in global production but it appears to be just a blip and not a global thing.Of course there is still plenty of coal and it is working out when coal is no longer economic. Most developing nations do not have huge coal reserves- and once coal become an import commodity solar and wind and even nuclear have an economic advantage. In Indochina hydro resources in some case offer 400% electrical energy.
EVs offer a real advantage of ICE - the fuel is much cheaper and will always be cheap, electric motors are much better [hence the reason most rail is powered by electric, even those diesel powered ones] and they are cheaper- battery tech is the game changer- and the rate of development is encouraging.
And another note- if you think electrical distribution is patchy try looking for a filling station in some parts of Africa, and consider the cost of building a filling station vs a charging station.
Come 2025 at the latest it will be a straight contest between ICE and EV, and big auto makers like VW have cited 2025 will be the end of engine development- after that its 10 years of manufacture. And cars last about 13 years.For the ICE owner the oil price is dependent on political stability, new finds and peak oil price- the value of oil will be capped. For a period it was $100 barrel, and now it struggles to get above $70. This severely restricts opening up new fields.For the EV owner the price is stable- and if they want they can buy solar.

your drone battery - now stupidly cheap [I know because I buy them] has no BMS, and you tend to run it below 20% charge and always fill it up 100%- big battery storage has control systems, it is why EVs can go 200,000 miles with very little battery degradation.
The EV market is so huge [China has over million on the road, plus more EV bikes] the development it at a phenomenal pace. Back in 2010 a kWh would cost you $1000, now it is sub $200 and $100 far earlier than anticipated. Density has increased- both the KIA and Hyundai EVs which are sub £30,000 cars have 300 mile ranges now.
£billions are being invested in both manufacturing and research- and it is attracting interest from physicists looking at the atomic structure of the chemistry and increasing longevity, reducing weight and charge times.
And human invention and engineering are curious- the beginning of the Industrial Revolution saw inefficient steam engines- heavy and demanding a lot of coal, and therefore only useful for coal mines. One of the other inventions at the time for a totally different problem made steam small and compact: it was the cannon lathe. Prior to its invention casting cannon meant that their first use was tricky, they could actually blow up in your face with imperfections- the lathe fixed the problem and would also make better steam engines.

You are telling me that there is some objective truth to nation on this planet. The concept of nation in modern academics is younger than Briton at peak bigness. This is not just an academic question. It is important for Israel (a nation made after ww2) vs the idea that Palestine was a nation before ww2 - like in the bible. The idea of what a nation is is a very human fluctuating thing. America is now a nation for example. And it is great because of a hat. It was not great before the hat - and it was clearly not a nation in year 1300 AD. Though Iceland was. See?
Social science is stupid. 
There is nothing given by any science that say that ""nationality"" is any form of stable entity. 
We have the same problem with the human made construction of economics. 
Check me out on the reason why economics (that borrowed numbers from math) can defend that a ""nation"" require ""economical growth""- It is total bollocks if you think about it. It has zero support in any reality. 
If one think that healthy economical growth comes from principles of an expanding universe one does bad. Since the universe expand by stretching space. Even Newton got this right - energy is constant. 
The invention of economy is however exponential. In economy one can gain something from nothing.

It means emissions are heading in the opposite direction to the deep cuts urgently needed, say scientists, to fight climate change.
The rise is due to the growing number of cars on the roads and a renaissance of coal use and means the world remains on the track to catastrophic global warming. However, the report’s authors said the emissions trend can still be turned around by 2020, if cuts are made in transport, industry and farming emissions.
The research by the Global Carbon Project was launched at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, where almost 200 nations are working to turn the vision of tackling climate change agreed in Paris in 2015 into action. The report estimates CO2 emissions will rise by 2.7% in 2018, sharply up on the plateau from 2014-16 and 1.6% rise in 2017.
Almost all countries are contributing to the rise, with emissions in China up 4.7%, in the US by 2.5% and in India by 6.3% in 2018. The EU’s emissions are near flat, but this follows a decade of strong falls.
“The global rise in carbon emissions is worrying, because to deal with climate change they have to turn around and go to zero eventually,” said Prof Corinne Le Quéré, at the University of East Anglia,who led the research published in the journal Nature. “We are not seeing action in the way we really need to. This needs to change quickly.”
The current Paris agreement pledges from nations will only limit global warming to 3C, while even a rise of 1.5C will be disastrous for many people, according to the world’s scientists. 
Le Quéré said: “I hope that by 2020, when [governments] have to come back with stronger commitments, we will then see a turning point.”
The International Energy Agency’s data also shows rising emissions in 2018. Its executive director, Fatih Birol, said: “This turnaround should be another warning to governments as they meet in Katowice this week.”
“Every year of rising emissions puts economies and the homes, lives and livelihoods of billions of people at risk,” said Christiana Figueres, at the Mission 2020 campaign, who was the UN climate diplomat overseeing the Paris agreement. “We are in the age of exponentials,” she said, with renewable energy and electric cars expanding rapidly, but with the extreme weather impacts of climate change doing the same. “We have to ensure it is the solutions exponential curve that is going to win the race.”
Prof David Reay, at the University of Edinburgh, UK, said: “This annual balance sheet for global carbon is comprehensive and scientifically robust. Its message is more brutal than ever: we are deep in the red and heading still deeper. For all our sakes, world leaders must now do what is required.”
Harjeet Singh, at ActionAid International, said news of the emissions’ rise should galvanise those at the climate summit: “There’s way too much complacency in the air at these talks.”
The “dark news” of rising emissions is merging with two other alarming trends, according to Prof David Victor, at the University of California, San Diego, in an article with colleagues also published in Nature on Wednesday.
Falling air pollution is enabling more of the sun’s warmth to reach the Earth’s surface, as aerosol pollutants reflect sunlight, while a long-term natural climate cycle in the Pacific is entering a warm phase. Victor said: “Global warming is accelerating. [These] three trends will combine over the next 20 years to make climate change faster and more furious than anticipated.”
The Global Carbon Budget, produced by 76 scientists from 57 research institutions in 15 countries, found the major drivers of the 2018 increase were more coal-burning in China and India as their economies grew, and more oil used in more transport. Industry also used more gas. Renewable energy grew rapidly, but not enough to offset the increased use of fossil fuel.
“There was hope China was rapidly moving away from coal power, but the last two years have shown it will not be so easy to say farewell quickly,” said Jan Ivar Korsbakken, at the Centre for International Climate Research in Norway.
In the three years since the Paris agreement was signed, financial institutions have invested more than $478bn in the world’s top 120 coal plant developers, according to a report by the NGOs Urgewald, BankTrack and partners. Chinese banks led the underwriting of coal investments, while Japanese banks led the loans, the NGOs found.
In the US, emissions rose as an unusually cold winter and hot summer boosted demand for both heating and cooling in homes. But it is expected that emissions will start to decline again in 2019, as cheap gas, wind and solar continue to displace coal – coal use has dropped 40% since 2005 and it is now at its lowest level since 1979.
The global rise in emissions, even in rich, developed nations, is very concerning, said Antonio Marcondes, Brazil’s chief negotiator at the UN summit: “Emission reductions are like credit-card debt: the longer they are put off, the more expensive and painful they become.”
Brazil reached its 2020 emissions targets early, but fears of a rise in deforestation under the new president, Jair Bolsonaro, could reverse this. But Le Quéré is optimistic that the rapid global rises seen in recent decades will not return: “This is very unlikely.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/05/brutal-news-global-carbon-emissions-jump-to-all-time-high-in-2018

To have no mention anywhere of the 12 years we (at best) have to make any difference is a shocking omission. Climate change is the greatest issue the world is facing and readers can’t have the message highlighted enough.
Can I also ask that you don’t print any letters suggesting that all we need to do is turn our thermostat down and consume more responsibly? As Naomi Klein illustrates in This Changes Everything, the idea that climate change can be solved by personal responsibility alone is a fallacy (and one of the reasons why we are in this mess).
This issue requires policymakers everywhere to act now but they won’t do it if they don’t think people care, which is why it is the responsibility of the press to report the danger we are in.Rebecca FrickerLoughton, Essex
• The collapse of civilisation is on the horizon, David Attenborough told the UN’s annual climate conference in Poland. We are privileged that the first people’s seat at the conference was filled by one of our greatest national treasures. A few words from him in Blue Planet 2 led to the start of a transformation of our relationship with plastic.
But, this is the thin end of the wedge compared with the changes required to enable our children to live out their lives peacefully. We need to radically change our relationship with what we eat, how we heat our houses, where our power comes from and how we transport ourselves. Four years ago the economist Lord Stern said we need an effort that surpasses the combined efforts of the first and second world wars to tackle the approaching existential threat.
To meet the changes we need strong political leadership, nationally and locally to steer through this unprecedented time. I look around the local political landscape and see very few people from any party willing to meet the challenge.
Since this year’s IPCC report, both Bristol and Manchester have voted unanimously to declare a climate emergency. Our national government is focusing on Brexit, which is merely a distraction in the face of what is the greatest threat our species has ever faced.
We need a new generation of political leaders to emerge and put our collapsing climate at the heart of all their policies.Caspar HughesExeter, Devon
• Your editorial’s revelation (6 December) that the 2014-16 carbon reductions were the result of an economic slowdown that helped fuel the rise of populism appears daunting for future climate-change initiatives. However, rising carbon emissions and extreme rightwing electoral advances can be reversed. This will require a massive increase in economic activity arising from environmental policies that are clearly seen to improve prospects for the majority through an emphasis on green jobs in every community.
The obvious starting point is to make every home, commercial and industrial building energy efficient worldwide. In the US this is one of the central demands of the youngest of the new members of Congress, Alexandria Ocasio–Cortez, with her call for a select committee for a green new deal, an initiative supported by Bernie Sanders and other elected progressives. Also key will be the rapid transition to renewables and low-carbon local transport systems.
To reduce political opposition to such a shift will require cash to help communities initially threatened by such measures, from scrappage schemes for polluting cars, subsidies for a rapid growth in electric public and private transport, through to job conversion schemes for Polish coal miners threatened by the latest climate talks.
The massive amount of money required should come from higher but fairer taxes, while hammering tax dodgers, with increased public expenditure and incentives for affluent savers to invest in such schemes. If this proves inadequate then green quantitative easing should also be introduced. The world really has no other choice.Colin HinesEast Twickenham, Middlesex
• We are hurtling towards a climate apocalypse (no hyperbole), and yet the one thing everyone can do is given surprisingly little publicity: change your energy supplier to one which only uses renewable energy.
We recently changed our supplier to one of several companies offering 100% renewable energy. The change-over was easy, and we now keep our house snuggly warm, comfortable in the knowledge that we are helping to save the planet. Please, everyone, change to a green supplier. Together we can save the world.Daniel Emlyn-JonesOxford
• Before claiming that the wheel, agriculture and gene-edited girls are “Monolith moments” (Letters, 5 December), remember that the monoliths in 2001: A Space Odyssey were of alien origin. While the monolith in the Dawn of Man sequence may or may not have triggered the use of weapons, the discovery of the second monolith, buried on the moon, served only to send a signal, possibly a warning, to the alien intelligence of mankind’s first steps into space. This led to the encounter with a monolith in Jupiter space, the star gate and astronaut Bowman’s journey “beyond the infinite” and his return to Earth as the star child. Alas, there is no sign today of any alien coming to help us avoid the collapse of civilisation predicted by David Attenborough at the UN climate change summit. We have to do that by ourselves.Graeme CottamPetersfield, Hampshire
• Rather than being “most worrying”, the UN report suggesting “that the relatively good performance of the years 2014-16 in reducing carbon emissions was the result of the economic slowdown” (Editorial, 6 December) indicates that we urgently need more economic slowdowns.David MurrayWallington, Surrey

Wow. Just , wow ! Do you really think that people are so gullible, that advertising will get them onto public transport ? Nearly anyone who actually has a time-wise and cost-wise actual choice between driving somewhere and going by public transport, has probably already tried both, and made their choice accordinging.
The fact is, for most people, the choice is a no-brainer. The use of public transport for trips directly to downtown, in most places, is dictated for most workers by the cost of parking, more than the cost of public transport. And for people who don't work directly downtown, it is usually dictated by excessively time-consuming journey times on indirect routes.
There might be a small number of people, who do have a viable choice in terms of time and money, who might be persuaded to change to public transport because of advertising that the trains are cleaner, or more secure, or better air-conditioned than they thought. Whether that would be worth the advertising budget, is doubtful.
Advertising works mainly to persuade people to buy something they don't really need. Most people really need to travel to work. It's not a discretionary choice, for most people. The other reason for advertising, is to convince people to buy brand X instead of brand Y. For transport other than airlines, there is no Brand X or Brand Y choice to be made.

The company, which was first registered in April 1906, started running a service of electrobuses between London's Victoria Station and Liverpool Street on 15 July 1907. The clean and quiet electrobuses were popular with the travelling public. The company introduced a number of innovations and it was the first double-decker bus operator to experiment with a roof on the upper deck. At the peak of its success in late 1908 the company had 20 or so buses in operation and it started to run a second bus route from Victoria to Kilburn. 
However, the London Electrobus Company was beset by financial chicanery throughout its short existence. By 3 January 1910 the electrobus service had ceased and the company went into liquidation amid accusations of fraud.

BQENDCorrect, up to a point. The 'free' transport is paid for out of taxes, which are also (wholly) at the cost of land values. What it does is to shift the land values around. There are winners and losers.
These interventions need a proper analysis, which they do almost never get. The 'free' ferries to the Swedish islands have stoked up land values there, at the expense of land values everywhere else, though values are heavily distorted by widespread letting in Sweden at sub-market rentals.

This, surely, is just the kind of radical action the world needs if we are ever to escape the tyranny of the motor vehicle and make our cities green, pleasant and quieter.
Just imagine being able to hop on and off buses, trams or trains at will, without scrabbling around for coins or tickets. Picture the reduction of traffic that would surely result from shifting the incentives so dramatically: the buses whizzing down uncongested streets, the less stinky air and less stress-inducing crossings, without the queues of cars pressing to squeeze through before the light turns red, their impatient drivers huffing and honking and swearing.
The proposal from the tiny (600,000 people) European country’s newly elected government, a coalition including Greens and led by the Democratic party’s Xavier Bettel, is not so much the habit-altering “nudge” popularised by behavioural economics as a giant shove. Stop driving!
And in Luxembourg this makes sense. Its capital suffers some of the worst traffic congestion in the world. People under 20 already travel for nothing. Of course, the city’s buses and trains will still cost money to run (salaries of drivers and managers; fuel; vehicle purchase and maintenance). But rather than people paying for this with tickets, the system will be funded via some form of taxation. Tallinn in Estonia already operates a similar scheme.
Aside from the health and local environmental benefits of such a policy, which could include an economic dividend if Luxembourg becomes a more desirable place to live and work, policies that discourage driving also reduce carbon emissions. With around a quarter of European emissions due to transport, 70% of which are from road traffic, it is tempting to jump up down and demand that Europe’s bigger capital cities should follow suit.
If there is a catch – and I think there is – it concerns walking and cycling. Pedestrians sit atop any road user hierarchy that is focused around sustainability and safety (such as that employed by the London Plan, until former mayor Boris Johnson changed it). This is because walking is the greenest form of transport there is, and pedestrians are vulnerable travellers. Cycling comes next, followed by public transport. It follows that a green transport policy must encourage walking and cycling, by altering road layouts, signposting routes and providing cycle storage facilities, as well as discouraging unnecessary car journeys and terrifyingly vast heavy goods vehicles. The risk with offering free public transport to a population already overly habituated to sitting down is that, rather than stroll, people take the bus.
Still, it’s great to see Luxembourg adopting what, in a small and trafficky country (2,500 square km, around the same size as Dorset), sounds like a rational scheme. Transport planning may sound dry, technical, dull. In a more sensible, evidence-driven world perhaps it would be. But the reality is that it is a ferociously contested area, with the different constituencies (principally motorists and cyclists) pitted against each other in a national conversation that has turned transport into a branch of identity politics.
Carbon emissions and more localised forms of air pollution aren’t the only reasons for this. Nor are road crash statistics that show outcomes for drivers improving while other groups lag behind. The awkward fact, for those of us who would like to see their use drastically curtailed, is that cars and motorcycles are experienced by many people as uniquely useful and liberating. Cotten Seiler, in his book Republic of Drivers, shows how they are hardwired into 20th-century capitalist, liberal individualism. Affordable fuel is widely seen as a right and a necessity. The gilets jaunes protests in France are a striking example. Champions of affordable public transport, by contrast, are often on the left – though rarely are their demands as rousing as in Brazil, where fare rises have sparked mass demonstrations.
Earlier this week my daughter was excited to see the green Lamborghini that has taken up residence in our unassuming neighbourhood backing into its regular space. We agreed to sidle past and attempt to meet the driver, both hoping (we admitted later) to be offered a ride. The ploy failed as he didn’t get out.
I mention it by way of an illustration that there is something about cars that people find attractive – especially, if you are nine, brightly coloured luxury ones. Good luck to the Luxembourgers trying to persuade people to take the bus or tram instead.

Boughs would be bent under the weight of black and orange clusters, as hundreds of thousands of the magical invertebrates nestled into the leaves, waiting out the frost on the California coast before returning north.
Now, on a sunny December afternoon the boardwalk that weaves through the monarch preserve, at Natural Bridges State Beach, is filled with school children craning necks and straining eyes to catch a glimpse.
The monarchs are there – but they are harder to spot.
Just two years ago, 8,000 overwintered here, but these days, just more than a thousand are fluttering amidst the Santa Cruz trees. It’s part of a troubling trend: over the last two decades monarch numbers in the West have declined by roughly 97%.
“It is a sad reality of climate change,” said Anthony Gutierrez, a volunteer guide at the park and biology student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, as he takes a break from guiding school children through a tour. “For every little thing that changes there’s not just one consequence – it’s a whole chain reaction.”
According to the Xerces Society, a conservation organization, in the 1980s between 10 million and 4.5 million monarchs spent the winter in California. The last count, conducted annually by volunteers each November, showed that in 2018 there may be as few as 30,000 across the state – a number that’s 87% lower than just the year before.
“We had a lot of reason to suspect that it was going to be a bad year, but we were shocked at just how bad,” said Xerces Society Conservation biologist Emma Pelton. She said that year-to-year fluctuations can be expected, but this kind of continuous drop-off is cause for concern. “It is in the context that the population has already declined 97%. So, it’s OK if you have millions of butterflies and they drop down a little bit – that’s not a huge deal. But if you have 200,000 butterflies to begin with and you have a bad year? Now we only have 30,000 left.”
While researchers can’t pinpoint the direct cause for each annual decline, there are several factors cited for the overall loss in numbers. For years, western monarchs have faced habitat loss in both the places they breed and where they spend their winters and increased use of pesticides has also taken a toll. Climate change, of course, has also played a role. Both drought and severe weather are deadly stressors for the butterflies, that are already under siege.
Monarchs aren’t alone. As the New York Times noted in a recent article on the “insect apocalypse,” researchers in Germany found flying insect populations there had decreased by up to 82% over the last three decades. A collection of separate studies showed that the populations of most of the insect species included, had been nearly cut in half. The indirect effects of this massive disappearance – considered as part of the sixth extinction – are still unknown, as is the scale of just how massive this die-off might be. Most insect populations aren’t closely watched.
“That is a disturbing thing,” biologist Emma Pelton said.
She added: “They are definitely not the ones people are even the most worried about, which says something”
Anurag Agrawal, an ecology and evolutionary biology professor at Cornell University, suggests that the butterflies are like the canary in the coal mine. In a blog about his work, he said that because they travel across North America every year, monarch migration can be helpful in determining the “health of our entire continent”. But saving them could require big changes. “We have to take a step back and ask ourselves the harder questions that none of us want to deal with.”He said monarchs are “are exhibiting multi-decadal declines that point to very big systemic problems. We shouldn’t fool ourselves”.
Samantha Marcum, a Coastal Program Regional coordinator for the US Fish and Wildlife Service agrees. “Monarch declines give us a clue to the health of ecosystems across North America and declines are being detected across many other pollinator species as well,” she said. But, she added, her agency has been teaming up with researchers and organizations to find solutions and strengthen protections.
Along with restoration of monarch habitat – which she said also provides benefits to threatened bumblebees, honeybees, and grassland birds – the department has implemented management plans to plant trees that protect the delicate invertebrates from harsh weather. It has also planted native nectar plants, and has worked with the agricultural industry and communities to eliminate or reduce the use of pesticides.
“Everyone can help to reverse the decline of monarch butterflies,” she said. “The public can participate in citizen science projects to monitor breeding monarchs or to estimate overwintering monarch numbers in the western US. People can plant native nectar plants and milkweed, where appropriate, that are not treated with pesticides.”
For now, researchers will be looking to next year’s numbers to see if the efforts can help turn the decline around. It is still possible for the butterflies to bounce back.
Glen Cornett, a retired math teacher who now volunteers at the Natural Bridges grove, said he’s hopeful, as he guides children to a scope pointed at a cluster of monarchs.
“[Volunteering] is a chance to … raise awareness about what it’s going to take to bring the migration and the monarch population back up again.”
“If I wasn’t a volunteer I would like to be paid by each ‘wow!’ from the kids.” Before packing up his scope he looks up at the butterflies fluttering through the speckled afternoon sunlight. “It’s just perfection.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/07/its-a-sad-reality-a-troubling-trend-sees-a-97-decline-in-monarch-butterflies

The most efficient new aircraft models, such as the Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A350-900 and A320neo, can achieve substantial carbon savings over older models, but no airlines have invested sufficiently in the new types to reach the top levels of energy efficiency, according to a ranking by Atmosfair, a German NGO.
In the annual Atmosfair Airline Index for 2018, published on Saturday, no airlines received an A for efficiency, and only two airlines were ranked in efficiency class B.
TUI Airways, the British holiday airline, came top of the rankings for the second year running, reaching just under 80% of the possible optimum level of carbon emissions. TUI Fly, the company’s German counterpart, came in fourth.
Atmosfair also found that only one in 10 airlines worldwide were succeeding in keeping their greenhouse gas emissions constant while achieving economic growth. Among these were Thai Airways, Finnair, American Airlines and All Nippon Airlines.
Dietrich Brockhagen, executive director of Atmosfair, said: “Our results show that the efficiency improvements of the vast majority of airlines worldwide is not sufficient [to keep within the] 2C or 1.5C target [of the Paris agreement]. We need new, synthetic and CO2-neutral fuels and other more radical measures to curb CO2 emissions in the sector.”
British Airways was placed at 74th, with an efficiency rating of D, behind companies such as Aeroflot and Aeromexico. It fell behind many of Europe’s other flag carriers, including Alitalia, Lufthansa, Air France, KLM and Iberia.
British Airways said: “We are committed to reducing our carbon emissions and have improved efficiency by more than 10% since 2008. We are well on course to deliver a 25% improvement in carbon emissions reduction by 2025. British Airways is the first airline in Europe to invest in building a plant to generate renewable jet fuel from household waste, and last week we kicked off a research project with some of the UK’s leading universities to find a way to power a long-haul aircraft with 300 customers on board with zero emissions.”
The company also pointed to a commitment by its parent group IAG to invest $400m (£313.6m) on alternative sustainable fuel development over the next 20 years.
Virgin Atlantic Airways ranks 83rd in the world, behind many airlines from developing countries such as Indonesia’s Garuda, Royal Air Maroc, Air India, and Taiwan’s Eva Air. This showing comes despite the much-publicised activities of Sir Richard Branson, Virgin’s chairman, in highlighting the risks of climate change.
Branson co-founded the Carbon War Room, which since 2009 has operated as a non-profit organisation aimed at speeding up the adoption of cleaner, low-emissions technology by businesses.
Virgin took issue with the report methodology, saying it misrepresented the airline. A spokeswoman added: “We have undertaken a massive renewal programme to replace our entire fleet over a 10 year period, switching from four-engine aircraft to much more efficient two-engine aircraft. As a result we have reduced our aircraft carbon emissions by 23.7% since 2007. Our carbon emissions will continue to reduce as we take delivery of more new aircraft over the next three years.”
Carbon emissions from airlines grew by about 5% last year, while the number of kilometres flown increased by 6%, according to Atmosfair, showing that much more needs to be done to ensure aviation does not take up an unsustainable amount of the world’s remaining “carbon budget”. Biofuels are being given trials as an alternative to fossil fuels for aviation, but these carry their own difficulties, not least the threat of deforestation. Virgin recently used recycled waste to fuel a flight, a potentially more environmentally sound alternative.
“You cannot beat physics, therefore long-haul flights will not be feasible with heavy batteries and electric engines,” said Brockhagen. “But you can produce carbon neutral kerosene synthetically, using carbon extracted from the air, water and green electricity. This is ready technologically, but 10 times more expensive per gallon than fossil kerosene. Who will invest the billions to scale this technology up? If airlines grouped together they could do it, but this would require an international spirit of cooperation over competition, so far rarely seen in the industry.”
There are also ways for airlines to reduce their emissions without resorting to new fuels and planes, through adjusting their pilots’ flying practices and small tweaks to planes. Some airlines look to offset their emissions through carbon reductions elsewhere.
A spokesman for Airlines UK, which represents the industry, said: “UK airlines are making enormous efforts to reduce their carbon emissions, and are committed to a global target to cut CO2 emissions from all flights by 50% of their 2005 levels by 2050, through technology, operational efficiency improvements and the use of sustainable biofuels. On top of this, in 2016 the International Civil Aviation Organization adopted the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation to address CO2 emissions from international aviation – a global first for any sector.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/08/airlines-ignoring-efficient-planes-carbon-targets-tui-airways-atmosfair-index-virgin-atlantic

Your rejection of CO2 as a greenhouse gas during a slowdown in atmospheric temperatures is entirely consistent with your rejection of the long-term trend in extreme precipitation events, and the science of event attribution which concludes that extreme rainfall in Harvey was made several times more likely by climate change.

Here you are downplaying the basic physics of a warming world leading to an overactive hydrological cycle which has been expressed in events such as Harvey and in the longterm trend of extreme precipitation events.
In all cases you are pushing FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), expressed clearly in the slapstick calling-of-attention to the fact that, shock-horror, the natural sciences couch conclusions in non-definitive statements as they have for centuries.

Thus, while there are clearly some noteworthy trends in area burned for specific recent periods and regions, the general perception of increasing fire around the world is not supported by the data available to date. This does not withstand the observation of increasing fire season length in some areas [50], which is an important contributor to the increase in area burned during this century in the northwestern USA [43,46], boreal Canada and Alaska [51,52]. A future lengthening of the fire season is also anticipated for many other regions of the globe, with a potential associated increase of fire activity [19,53–56]. It is, however, important to recognize that in addition to direct climatic factors, other factors such as fuel availability and human influence will also strongly affect future fire activity [57,58]. 
Thus the widespread use of limited datasets or excessive extrapolation of short-term regional trends may go some way in explaining the widely held view of generally increasing fire around the world. The wider impacts of fire on society examined in §3b–d, however, may be even more relevant in driving the overall perceptions of fire trends.

Churchill referred to the years between his first warming about the rise of Nazism to action finally being taken as ""the years the locusts hath eaten"". The locusts have again been out in force eating the 30 years since the IPCC was created, when action could and should have been taken. If we had initiated action in 1988 when the IPCC was created it would have cost us virtually nothing. We simply needed to replace old technology with large carbon footprints to new, cleaner green technology. We would not have needed to spend much if anything on adaptation as the changes would have been limited. 
Now we need to replace old technology much faster meaning some old technology will need to be replaced before the end of their normal useful lives. We also now need to spend very significant sums on adaptation, so the cost now is far higher than it would have been without the irresponsible behaviour of fossil fuel companies.

“One ad described climate change as “unsettled science” 
It is unsettled science. 
BQEND
The article is referring to the fact that the climate is changing and that man is largely responsible, which is settled science and science which Exxon publicly disputed.
In any natural science spanning several disciplines there will be, as a feature of the problem space, unsettled areas. So-called skeptics like to argue that action should be tempered on climate change by pointing to this domain feature of this problem space, one that will always exist.
BQSTART
For example, to say more downpours in 50 years will cause disproportionate death and destruction is nothing more than a guess.
BQEND
Since you cannot qualify scientifically what you mean by ""guess"" this is a nothing point. I am skeptical you could even point towards the specific prediction from the literature. Evidence-based projections are not guesses, not scientifically speaking and not even in common parlance.
Besides, there has already been a statistically significant increase in extreme downpours already, and these have been attributed to man by the IPCC:
""Changes in many extreme weather and climate events have been observed since about 1950. Some of these changes have been linked to human influences, including... an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events in a number of regions.""
Thanks to recent advances in the literature around single-event attribution, we know that climate change tripled the chances of Hurricane Harvey's extreme rainfall event:
BQSTART
""In the deluge’s aftermath, climate scientists noted that storms like Harvey are rare—but cautioned that unusually warm waters, made likelier by human activity, may have supercharged the hurricane’s extreme rainfall. Now, two separate teams of scientists have found humans’ fingerprints all over the storm.""
BQEND
""Death and destruction"" is a non-scientific term, but I will leave it upto readers to conclude as to what effect climate change is already having on extreme rainfall, and how much of a ""guess"" the impacts we have already seen are.
Anyway, this is just another tired, oft-debunked example of ""We don't know everything, therefore we know nothing"". Remember, one of the key characteristics of science denial is impossible expectations. 
For example, kent31 is a poster who argued a few years ago that a short-term slowdown in atmospheric temperatures from 1998-2013 meant that ""CO2 may not have a direct relationship with warming"", while the rest of us patiently explained to him that this kind of super-imposed natural variation was common-or-garden.

You are on a rooftop frantically waving at every passing boat or helicopter for rescue...then even if you are rescued, you are a refugee...even in your own country...left to live in trailers (if 'lucky') that off gas chemicals the government refuses to label toxic...chemicals that are banned for use even in China, exposing your family to cancer and God knows what else...all while realizing you lived in a flood plain that was man-made...and you have no insurance due to one form of poverty or another (not blaming those who experienced Katrina in ANY way...am using this as a metaphor to what happens when people are not informed of the realities regarding the world around them/impacts on the environments, or they ignore them)...And this will all be on a global scale. You may not even get those crappy off gassing trailers...you may just be left to survive as best you can...like so many on small islands are having to do with sea level rise even now. When's the last time any of you checked in on the Katrina survivors? Who will save you when it's your turn?Democrats, in general, are not going to save us...as much as it pains me to say it.

In reality, it looks like it will be done by 2025.
This was how leaded petrol was dealt with - a date was set, after which new vehicles requiring leaded petrol could not be registered.
In a number of countries, dates are being set after which new cars cannot have fossil-fuel engines.
In the UK, this is currently 2040, but an influential Parliamentary committee is recommending it be changed to 2032.
I think the best approach is to set cut-off dates for each use of fossil fuel, starting with the easier ones.

The big populist protest movements of recent years have either been caused by fuel tax increases, been in favour of bringing back coal, or have been funded by fossil fuel companies.

Congressional committees vested with the authority to hold hearings, conduct investigations and serve subpoenas are likely to look into Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, Donald Trump’s tax returns, the bungled hurricane response in Puerto Rico, the firing of former FBI director James Comey and resignation of attorney general Jeff Sessions, and much more.
“We are coming to do something that is very important for our country: a more open Congress with accountability to the public,” California representative Nancy Pelosi, the once and probably future speaker of the House, said on Face the Nation. “We are not doing any investigation for a political purpose, but to seek the truth.”
If Pelosi and House Democrats are sincere about restoring integrity to Congress, uncovering threats to democracy and seeking the truth, they should also investigate a corporation that has done long-term and probably irrevocable damage to our politics and planet: ExxonMobil.
Our era is defined by interlocking crises of truth, democracy and ecology. ExxonMobil is a major actor at that intersection.
Internal and external documents compiled by InsideClimate News, the Los Angeles Times and researchers at Harvard University reveal that ExxonMobil, the world’s largest fossil fuel corporation, knew as early as 1977 – and potentially as early as the 1950s – that its business activities could wreak havoc on the climate.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the company outfitted the largest supertanker in its fleet with instruments to monitor the oceanic absorption of carbon dioxide and hired scientists and mathematicians to study global warming. They developed in-house climate change models and published their findings in peer-reviewed journals.
In a 1978 memo, one Exxon Research manager wrote: “This may be the kind of opportunity that we are looking for to have Exxon technology, management and leadership resources put into the context of a project aimed at benefiting mankind.”
But by the late 1980s, the oil giant had changed its stance. In 1988, an Exxon public affairs manager wrote that the company should “emphasize the uncertainty” of climate science. This became the “Exxon position” – and so began one of the greatest conspiracies of our time.
Borrowing from big tobacco’s playbook, Exxon and other oil corporations launched public relations campaigns to sow doubt about the science behind climate change. Exxon took out full-page ads in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post, among others. One ad described climate change as “unsettled science”. Another, titled Reset the Alarm, made a claim the company knew to be false: “We still don’t know what role man-made greenhouse gases might play in warming the planet.”
ExxonMobil and other fossil fuel corporations have spewed emissions into the atmosphere while bearing little or no cost for the damage
A peer-reviewed study of the corporation’s public and private communications by Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes of Harvard University demonstrates that ExxonMobil actively misled the public about climate science and its implications. Exxon also hid the implications of climate science and policy from its shareholders, inflating the value of the fossil fuel assets that it would have had to abandon  to meet international climate targets.
But Exxon’s deceits run even deeper. Over the years, the company channeled about $30m to researchers and activist groups promoting disinformation about global warming. Documents from the Bush administration reveal the company played a key role in dissuading the former president from signing the Kyoto protocol. In league with other fossil fuel corporations – most notably Koch Industries and the American Petroleum Institute – Exxon transformed the Republican party into the enemy of scientific fact. 
All the while, ExxonMobil and other fossil fuel corporations have spewed emissions into the atmosphere while bearing little or no cost for the damage – and driving us headlong into a climate crisis. The latest report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, informed by thousands of leading studies, makes it plain: to avoid catastrophic warming of more than 1.5C (, humanity must transition from dirty to clean energy by 2030.
Last month, New York state sued ExxonMobil for conducting a “longstanding fraudulent scheme” to deceive investors, analysts and insurers “concerning the company’s management of the risks posed to its business by climate change regulation”. Dozens of jurisdictions and entities across the country, including the state of Rhode Island, Boulder county in Colorado, and multiple municipalities across California have filed suits against Exxon and other oil companies. Last week, crab fishermen in California sued 30 fossil fuel corporations for damaging their fisheries. 
ExxonMobil and the other fossil fuel corporations most responsible for climate change should pay their fair share to address this crisis. But if their continuing lobbying efforts are any indication, they will not. Oil and gas interests spent over $100m to stop climate action at the ballot box in the midterm elections – doling out over $41m in Colorado and $31m in Washington to defeat state-level ballot initiatives that would have restricted fracking operations to a safe distance from homes and schools and made carbon polluters pay for their waste.
Recently, Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined youth climate activists in a sit-in at the Capitol Hill office of Pelosi, demanding House Democrats pursue a Green New Deal. In response, Pelosi has reaffirmed that she will revive the select committee on climate change disbanded by Republicans. For the sake of all of us, House Democrats have a duty to use the authority of that and other committees to investigate Exxon.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/09/exxonmobil-house-democrats-must-investigate

Without these, the world faces a financial crash several times worse than the 2008 crisis, they said.
The investors include some of the world’s biggest pension funds, insurers and asset managers and marks the largest such intervention to date. They say fossil fuel subsidies must end and substantial taxes on carbon be introduced.
Ministers arrive at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, on Monday for its crucial second week, when the negotiations on turning the vision of the Paris agreement into reality reach a critical point, with finance for fighting global warming a key area of dispute.
“The long-term nature of the challenge has, in our view, met a zombie-like response by many,” said Chris Newton, of IFM Investors which manages $80bn and is one of the 415 groups that has signed the Global Investor Statement. “This is a recipe for disaster as the impacts of climate change can be sudden, severe and catastrophic.”
Investment firm Schroders said there could be $23tn of global economic losses a year in the long term without rapid action. This permanent economic damage would be almost four times the scale of the impact of the 2008 global financial crisis. Standard and Poor’s rating agency also warned leaders: “Climate change has already started to alter the functioning of our world.”
Thomas DiNapoli, of the $207bn New York State Common Retirement Fund, another signatory, said taking action on global warming not only avoided damage but could boost jobs and growth. “The low-carbon economy presents numerous opportunities and investors who ignore the changing world do so at their own peril.”
Lord Nicholas Stern, of the London School of Economics said: “The low-carbon economy is the growth story of the 21st century and it is inclusive growth. Without that story, we would not have got the 2015 Paris agreement, but the story has grown stronger and stronger and is really compelling now.”
The US Trump administration will hold its only event at the UN summit on Monday and is expected to promote “clean coal”. But Stern said Trump’s suggestion that action on climate change was a jobs killer was “dead wrong”. Stern said: “You don’t create jobs for the 21st century by trying to whistle up jobs from the 19th century.”
A key demand of the Global Investor Statement is to phase out coal-fired power stations across the world. Peter Damgaard Jensen, the CEO of Danish pension fund PKA, said: “Investors, including PKA, are moving out of coal in their droves given its devastating effects on the climate and public health, compounded by its poor financial performance.”
Dozens of nations will affirm their commitment to end their coal burning on Thursday. However, the UN summit has seen US, Chinese and Japanese financial institutions cited as leaders in providing nearly $500bn in backing for new coal plants since the Paris agreement was signed.
Another investor demand on governments is to introduce “economically meaningful” taxes on carbon. Most are below $10 per tonne, but needed to rise to up to $100 in the next decade or two, the investors said. The French president Emmanuel Macron’s botched attempt to increase fuel taxes and the gilets jaunes protests that followed were a model of how not to do it, said observers in Poland.
“It failed to take people along with them, accompanying the policy with social measures to allow citizens to embrace the opportunities of the transition and ride out the challenges,” said Camilla Born, of advisers E3G. The host government of the climate summit, Poland, is heavily reliant on coal and is stressing the need for a “just transition” for workers in the fossil fuel industry.
The investors include some of the globe’s largest pension funds, such as Calsters and ABP, and insurers, including Aviva, AXA and Zurich. They also want an end to subsidies for coal, oil and gas, which the IMF rates at $5tn a year and which the G20 has been promising to tackle for a decade. This measure alone could cut global CO2 emissions by 10% by 2030, according a UN report released in time for the Poland summit.
The investors said current national pledges to cut carbon would lead to a catastrophic 3C of global warming and that plans must be dramatically increased by 2020. For developing countries, ”finance is the critical enabler of increasing ambition,” said Niranjali Amerasinghe, of the World Resources Institute.
UN climate summits are frequently dogged by disputes over the $100bn a year that rich nations have promised to poorer ones by 2020 to tackle climate change. Direct government funding and private company finance were needed, Amerasinghe said: “It is really great when private sector is out there saying we are going to invest in climate-friendly activities.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/10/tackle-climate-or-face-financial-crash-say-worlds-biggest-investors

The UN climate talks – known as COP24 and the most important since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015 – aim to set a new rulebook for governments to reduce greenhouse gases and to raise ambitions, after warnings of dire consequences if global warming rises more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.
The climate crisis is already here and the risks are growing, said Hoesung Lee, chair of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, who led a study by thousands of scientists on ways to avoid 1.5C of warming via accelerated transition from fossil fuels.
“The IPCC made a tremendous collective effort to bring you the best scientific knowledge on the subject. We tell you limiting warming to 1.5C is possible but the window is narrowing,” Lee told a plenary on Tuesday. “The scientific community has delivered, now it is up to governments to take action.”
There has been fierce debate about what to do with the study. All but four of the world’s governments want to formally welcome the 1.5C report to spur a more ambitious shift towards renewable energy. However, four oil producing nations – the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait – said the study should merely be “noted”.
This issue has overshadowed the past few days of the talks in Poland. Saudi Arabia has claimed there are “gaps and uncertainties” in the study. The US held a long-planned event promoting coal, gas, oil and nuclear power.
In a thinly veiled criticism of such tactics, Laurent Fabius, a former prime minister of France and president of the 2015 Paris climate talks, told the plenary that political leaders would play a negative role if they were “not only somnambulists but spoilers”.
He noted that global emissions rose by 2% this year, when they need to decline if warming is to be kept to a less dangerous level.
“Let us be clear, the real world is not on track. We need to do more and to do it faster,” Fabius said. “The IPCC 1.5C report shows the tremendous importance of every half degree and the disastrous consequences of missing that boundary.”
But many delegates said more attention should be focused on the social challenges of rapid change, as workers in old industries, such as coal, lose their jobs and the price of fossil fuels is pushed higher to stimulate the transition to alternative energies.
Without greater consideration of how the costs and benefits could be equally shared there could be a violent backlash, as France has experienced with the gilets jaunes protests that were initially about a planned rise in an eco-tax on petrol.
Jonathan Pershing, a former US climate envoy, said technology and the markets would drive change, and it was already cheaper to build a new renewable power plant than a new coal or gas plant.
“But you have to think about how to manage it. What happens to people who no longer have jobs from the old economy in the new economy? How do you think about new opportunities and the training you give young people? If you close down old facilities, how do you do it in a manner that keeps the communities alive and helps maintain the traditions and cultural structures?” Pershing said. “We don’t do it very often so we don’t have much experience. No report tells us how to manage the political difficulties. We need to manage the transitions. They’re hard.”
This was echoed by Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, who said it was important for governments to separate raising tax revenue from addressing climate change.
“The yellow vest implications are huge and show the danger if we take wrong moves,” he said. “We haven’t paid enough attention on the short-term impacts [of putting a price on carbon]. The environment movement needs to look at itself in the mirror.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/11/the-window-is-narrowing-scientists-urge-action-at-un-climate-talks

His warning came as Pacific and Indian ocean states warned they faced annihilation if a global climate “rule book” could not brokered.
In a bruising speech before ministers and heads of state, Vanuatu’s foreign minister, Ralph Regenvanu, singled out the US as he excoriated major CO2-emitting developed countries for deliberately hindering negotiations.
“It pains me deeply to have watched the people of the United States and other developed countries across the globe suffering the devastating impacts of climate-induced tragedies, while their professional negotiators are here at COP24 putting red lines through any mention of loss and damage in the Paris guidelines and square brackets around any possibility for truthfully and accurately reporting progress against humanity’s most existential threat,” he said.
Regenvanu said the countries most responsible for climate change were now frustrating efforts to counter it.
The UN’s climate change talks in Poland have been distracted by a semantic debate over whether the conference should “welcome” or “note” the IPCC’s special report warning of dire consequences if global warming rises more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, with a bloc of four oil-producing countries – the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Kuwait – insisting the report be only “noted”.
Documents from the conference presidency, seen by the Guardian, indicate the issue of how to acknowledge the report will be returned to later in the week and is likely to further slow progress on negotiating a final outcome. Negotiators said they are growing increasingly pessimistic that talks can be concluded by their deadline on Friday.
“Whether you welcome, or note, or shamefully ignore the science altogether,” Regenvanu said, “the fact remains that this is catastrophic for humanity, and party negotiators blocking meaningful progress should have much on their conscience.”
He said climate change represented an existential threat to humanity, but “we have overcome greater human-induced wrongs before like colonialism, like slavery”.
As 193 countries at the climate talks seek to establish a “rule book” on how to implement the commitments made in the Paris agreement three years ago, Regenvanu condemned a two-tier system that exempted high-emissions countries from reductions obligations, saying the world needed “one common rule book, in which rules apply to all”.
The US state department declined to comment on his remarks.
Regenvanu was part of a cohort of small island states in the Pacific and Indian oceans that urged greater global action on limiting global warming to 1.5C; leaders from Kiribati, Samoa, Tuvalu, the Cook Islands and the Maldives argued their countries faced an impending existential threat from climate change.
Speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island Developing States, the Maldives’ environment minister, Hussain Rasheed Hassan, said the world needed to question “why we are continuing failing?”.
He said: “After a quarter of a century of UNFCCC negotiations and three years since the historic Paris agreement, we are further from approaching our goal of stabilising emissions than ever, and … rapidly approaching the point of no return.
The prime minister of Kiribati, Taneti Maamau, said the countries that had contributed least to climate change were feeling its impacts first – and most acutely: “Truly, but sadly, the prosperity enjoyed by a few developed countries, has become the tragedy and misery of the mess of developing countries and particularly those most vulnerable to climate change.”
Henry Puna, the prime minister of the Cook Islands, said while the Paris agreement represented a moment of global solidarity, inaction and infighting since then had paralysed efforts to reduce emissions. “I am scared for my children’s future, and for the future of generations to come,” he said. “Parties have called for action, but it is evident our current efforts are not enough.”
He said climate change denialism jeopardised the future of Pacific countries: “Some are not willing to accept the stark realities.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/11/us-accused-of-obstructing-talks-at-un-climate-change-summit

New Zealand has already ruled out using the carryover credits, saying it would discourage other countries from the practice.
Australia’s environment minister, Melissa Price, said Australia would meet its Paris commitment of a 26% to 28% carbon emissions reduction – “equivalent to a halving of emissions per person” – but would not comment on whether the government would use carryover credits from Kyoto to reach that target.
New Zealand’s climate change minister, James Shaw, said this week the practice of claiming credits was not in the spirit of the Paris agreement, and “we would discourage any country from using [it]”. He has previously described the practice as “dodgy accounting” and like “trying to have two meals for the price of one”.
The use of carryover credits is one of dozens of technical elements being negotiated at the UN climate talks in Katowice, Poland where 193 countries have gathered to negotiate the “rulebook” for each meeting the emissions reductions targets made three years ago in Paris.
The practice of carryover credits allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030.
Australia’s environment department projects its surplus at 294m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, but independent climate analysts suggest that figure could be as high as 333m tonnes, or up to 400m tonnes if tree-planting and other land use changes are counted in Australia’s favour.
Most of these additional carbon credits have been won through Australia’s unique deal under Kyoto to count land-clearing changes towards emissions reductions.
Having those credits already “banked” against Australia’s emissions reduction target would make meeting its 2030 Paris goal of a 26% to 28% emissions reduction significantly easier: closer to 15% in actual reductions, Climate Analytics has said.
Government figures show the Australia’s carbon emissions continue to rise. Emissions from fossil fuels and industry have been increasing by about 2% a year since 2014.
At the UN climate change talks in Poland this week, the Marshall Islands has raised objections to the use of carryover credits in informal negotiations, but with little support.
Preliminary documentation from inside the talks, seen by Guardian Australia, suggest that using carryover credits is not going to be prohibited under the “rulebook” for the Paris agreement, meaning countries will be able – and some likely – to do it.
The chief executive of Climate Analytics and a lead author on former IPCC assessment reports Bill Hare said it appeared almost inevitable Australia would be allowed to – and would – use carryover credits. A change of government would not change the policy, he said.
“Every indication is that both the government, and the Labor party, have every intention of trying to carry over surplus credits from the Kyoto protocol into Paris.
“The [Australian government] delegation has made statements at negotiations over a period of time that are consistent with that.”
Hare said Australia, based on its current climate policies, could not meet its Paris agreement target without using surplus credits. He described the use of carryover credits as “fake climate action”.
“About half of the cumulative abatement task from 2021 to 2030 could be met by the projected Kyoto second commitment period surplus … in other words, the overall mitigation effort to reach the already inadequate target would be halved.”
Along with New Zealand refusing to use its credits, other countries have previously declined to use theirs. In 2015, Denmark, Germany, the UK, Sweden, and the Netherlands cancelled 635m tonnes of carbon credits.
In Katowice, Price told Guardian Australia that the government was committed to the Paris Agreement and its targets.
“Our priority at COP 24 is to secure agreement on a comprehensive rulebook to guide the implementation of the agreement.
“Our 2030 target is to reduce emissions by 26 to 28% below 2005 levels, which is equivalent to a halving of emissions per person. The government is confident of meeting this target, based on our track record of meeting and beating our first and second Kyoto protocol targets.”
Australia, however, has consistently won specific exemptions to the calculation of its carbon reductions targets over decades of climate negotiations.
During negotiations over the Kyoto protocol, the Howard government negotiated a special deal, allowing it to actually increase emissions by 8% between 2008 and 2012.
An additional article negotiated in the dying hours of the conference – known as the “Australia clause” and condemned at the time by a European environment spokesman as “wrong and immoral... a disgrace” – allowed Australia to include land use changes in its emissions calculations which meant the target could be reached with only minor changes to land-clearing laws.
When Australia met – and exceeded – its first Kyoto target, it was able to bank those extra carbon credits, carrying them over to meet its second target for 2020.

The analogy between fossil fuels and fissile nuclear materials is imperfect, but it should not be overlooked that the nuclear NPT promotes cooperation in and equal access to “peaceful use” of nuclear technology. “Peaceful use” of fossil fuels could mean their continued but decreasing extraction, within enforceable limits constrained by the Paris agreement goals, and an offsetting role for carbon capture and geo-sequestration (funded by fossil fuel producers). Safeguards and oversight could be provided by a new United Nations monitoring agency, akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which could also administer a global fossil carbon budget.
Fossil fuel companies extract their products where relevant governments permit. The number of nations permitting extractions on scales that threaten all of us is greater than the number of nuclear weapons states, but it is nevertheless small. This could make rapid negotiation of a fossil fuel “NPT” relatively tractable. It would not even have to include all producer nations at first to be effective.Hugh RichardsStroud, Gloucestershire

Ndevr replicates the federal government’s national greenhouse gas inventory (NGGI) quarterly reports but releases them months ahead of the official data.
Data it has produced for the year up to September 2018 shows Australia is still on track to miss its Paris target of a 26%-28% cut to emissions on 2005 levels by 2030.
Matt Drum, the managing director of Ndevr, said if emissions continued at their current rate, Australia would miss the target by a cumulative 1.1bn tonnes.
When excluding unreliable land use data, Australia’s emissions for the year to September reached 558.3m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, an all-time high. 
Land use data refers to emissions from activities such as land clearing and forest management, as well as removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through activities such as reforestation.
Ndevr excludes land use data because the methodology the government uses to calculate these figures is opaque and there have been questions about whether the scale of land-clearing in Queensland is being accurately represented.
“There’s still no policy in place to ratchet them down which is why they’re increasing,” Drum said.
Electricity sector emissions were stable, but fugitive emissions, and emissions from stationary energy and transport are all still trending sharply upwards.
Release of the report comes as the environment minister, Melissa Price, addressed global COP24 climate change talks in Katowice, Poland.
Both the Coalition government and Labor have not ruled out using controversial carryover credits from the Kyoto protocol to help meet Australia’s obligations under the Paris agreement.
Labor has promised that if it wins the election it will increase Australia’s target to 45% on 2005 levels, in line with recommendations from the independent Climate Change Authority.
Ndevr’s analysis said this would require a reduction of 197.1m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent based on current emissions levels, which would be equal to taking 75m cars off the road for a year.
In comparison, the Coalition’s emission reduction target would require an 80.8m tonne reduction.
Breaking up Labor’s target across sectors, Ndever suggests a range of reductions will be necessary in several industries, including 61.2m tonnes from the electricity sector, 33.4m tonnes from the stationary energy sector, 23.7m tonnes from agriculture and 34.2m tonnes from transport.
“If Labor come into government we can’t afford a policy vacuum,” Drum said. “It’s looking grim. We need policy levers and we need them quickly.”
Drum said the need for action was so urgent there would be no time for a full redesign of policy if there was a change of government.
Instead, he said existing policies, such as the safeguard mechanism, should be amended.
“They need to utilise existing policy like the safeguard mechanism and tweak it so it achieves what it is intended to achieve, which is reduce emissions,” he said.
On Thursday, the Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, said Australia was using “creative emissions accounting” to try to meet its Paris targets.
“Counting Kyoto credit towards Paris cheats our environment and the rest of the world,” she said.
“Our emissions are going up, yet our environment minister is telling the world we are doing our bit to meet our Paris targets.”

The trenchant intervention by Xie Zhenhua, the minister who leads the Chinese delegation and a veteran of the UN climate negotiations, came as China faced increasing pressure to shift its stance on some of the key rules required to implement the 2015 Paris agreement.
He told a small group of journalists: “Developing countries are not comfortable or happy. [We need to] see if developed countries have honoured their commitments. Still some countries have not started their mitigation efforts, or provided financial support [to poor nations]. We strongly urge them to pay up on their debts.”
By contrast, he said, developing countries had been “very flexible and constructive” at the talks. One of the key sticking points at the UN negotiations in Poland is over how countries should account for their greenhouse gas emissions, and how their progress in meeting their commitments on curbing carbon should be measured and verified.
Developed countries prefer strict standards but developing countries have historically been allowed some leeway, in recognition that their governance structures and capabilities may lag behind.
But the EU and other developed countries are concerned that large rapidly developing economies such as China are not agreeing to adequate transparency in accounting for their emissions.
Xie said the talks were “deadlocked”, but maintained that China should continue to be treated as a developing country, and that developing countries should have flexibility over transparency rules.
“We need flexibility,” he said. “Developing countries have very varied capabilities. If more [financial and technological] support is given to developing countries, they will have more capabilities and stronger actions [on emissions].”
Claire Perry, the UK’s climate minister, who arrived on Thursday after the Tory party’s dramatic vote of confidence in Theresa May on Wednesday night, said she was making transparency a key focus of her efforts at the talks.
If no compromise can be reached, the talks may end this weekend without finalising the rulebook for implementing the Paris agreement, which was the key aim of these two weeks of negotiations.
Developed countries also came under heavy fire in other parts of the conference. A coalition representing scores of the poorest and most vulnerable nations called on them to raise their emissions-cutting targets, and separately the Pacific island states – acutely vulnerable to climate change – called for the world to abandon coal power generation.
“We call on all OECD countries to quickly phase out their use of coal by 2030 and for all other countries to phase out their use of coal by 2040,” Fijian prime minister Frank Bainimarama, the president of COP23, said. “There must be no expansion of existing coal mines or the creation of new mines.”
Pacific Rim powers Australia and the US have both this week said publicly they have no plans to begin phasing out coal-generated power. By contrast, Perry said the UK would have no unabated coal-fired power stations by 2025.
“The United States has an abundance of natural resources and is not going to keep them in the ground,” President Donald Trump’s international energy and climate adviser, Wells Griffith, told a US government-run panel discussion on fossil fuels.
Australia’s ambassador for the environment, Patrick Suckling, added: “Fossil fuels are projected to be a major source of energy for a significant time to come.”
Cook Islands prime minister Henry Puna told the Guardian the phase-out of coal was critical to the survival of Pacific island states. “We have made that call, it is not directed at any one country, but it applies to all. We know that coal power plants are a significant cause of the climate change we see affecting the whole world.”
The Pacific island states also called for the establishment of an international protection regime to protect people displaced by climate change.
Mohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives and now leading the country’s negotiating delegation, said “four countries” – referring to the US, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia, the bloc resisting welcoming the IPCC’s 1.5C special report – were deliberately frustrating negotiations.
“Nothing’s happening. Absolutely nothing is happening,” he said. “You have this whole dictionary of words that has been brought into these climate conferences, then they talk about brackets, and we go round and round and round, and we don’t go anywhere.”
While at the political level, oil-producing and large emitting nations have resisted increasingly strident calls from several country blocs to announce new targets for deeper emissions cuts, inside the negotiating rooms, officials from countries such as the US and Australia are reported to be working constructively to progress discussions on a Paris agreement rulebook.
“Countries are negotiating in good faith, some in better faith than others, but there is progress,” Costa Rica’s minister for the environment and energy, Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/13/china-demands-developed-countries-pay-their-debts-on-climate-change

Over more than 30 years in west Africa, Tony Rinaudo has regenerated more than 6m hectares – an area nearly as large as Tasmania. His farmer-managed natural regeneration technique is responsible for 240m trees regrowing across that parched continent.
But it very nearly never happened.
Having grown up in Myrtleford, in country Victoria, Rinaudo moved to Niger, one of the world’s poorest countries, in 1981, inspired by his Christian faith and a desire “somewhere, somehow to make a difference”. But after two years of intense tree-planting and trying to coax some life from the arid landscape regularly devastated by severe drought, he despaired.
Nature would heal itself, you just needed to stop hammering it
“I was in charge of a reforestation project that was failing miserably, it wasn’t that I was particularly dumb, it was the same story all over west Africa. And I remember the frustration that just hit me: north, south, east, west, was a barren landscape, and I knew perfectly well that 80 or 90% of the trees I was carrying [in my car] for planting would die.”
But this day, crouching in the sand to reduce his tyres’ air pressure, he looked more closely at the few low desert bushes scattered around the landscape, the only thing that would grow there.
Rinaudo knew they were not small bushes, but trees that had been hacked down. Looking more closely, he realised that, if pruned and allowed to grow, they stood a chance of flourishing.
“In that moment, everything changed. We didn’t need to plant trees, it wasn’t a question of having a multi-million dollar budget and years to do it, everything you needed was in the ground.”
The root system of the chopped down trees remained alive under the ground – Rinaudo describes it as an “underground forest” – it just needed to be pruned and allowed to grow.
“Nature would heal itself, you just needed to stop hammering it.”
Thirty years on, his technique – he describes it as akin to pruning a grape vine back to just one or two stems each season – has a name, farmer-managed natural regeneration (FMNR). It is, Rinaudo says, an “embarrassingly simple solution” to what appeared to be an intractable problem. But it involved overturning generations of accepted wisdom, and a resistance to giving some land back to nature.
“When you’ve got people who are on the edge of starvation every year, not just in famine years, you’ve got this perception that you need every square inch of farmland to grow food crops. And here’s this nut telling people they should sacrifice some of their land for trees.”
Rinaudo – known then as “the crazy white farmer” – managed to convince 10 farmers in as many villages to back his plan, to allow trees to regrow across the land they’d been intensively farming for decades. A drought was the catalyst for a work-for-food program, which brought reluctant farmers into the fold, but when the farming yields were, at first, no worse, then better, then dramatically so, the new technique took off.
Thirty years on, 6m hectares of land have been regenerated under FMNR, totalling 240m trees. The reforestation of the landscape can be seen on satellite images from space.
At the UN’s global climate talks in Katowice, Poland, this week – as thousands of delegates from all over the world debated the minutiae of a complex worldwide rulebook for climate change – Rinaudo quietly took his farming message from meeting room to meeting room, delegation to delegation.
The trees, Rinaudo says, improve farming yields, reduce ground temperatures and hold water in the soil. They provide firewood and make farming, in places where the temperature regularly reaches 40C, more comfortable. But the trees also act, Rinaudo says, as a powerful carbon sink, and with the potential to draw in billions more tonnes of carbon.
For his work on regeneration, Rinaudo was recognised this year in the Right Livelihood Awards, often described as the alternative Nobel, and focused on fields such as environmental protection, human rights, sustainability and peace.
Working with World Vision, Rinaudo has taken his technique across the world, from arid Somaliland to tropical East Timor.
There are 2bn hectares of degraded land in the world, he argues, and much of that land can be restored to help pull carbon from the atmosphere. Regeneration is not the silver bullet for climate change – no such thing exists – but it could be a powerful tool to assist.
“We can do this very cheaply, we can do this very quickly, and we can do this at scale.”

I think the reason that the proponents of a pending climate emergency ignore evidence.. . The problem with that theory is that there's profuse evidence for rapid climate change when there's little change in CO2 and no evidence of significant vulcanism.

Arctic air temperatures have increased in recent decades, along with documented reductions in sea ice, glacier size, and snow cover. However, the extent to which recent Arctic warming has been anomalous with respect to long‐term natural climate variability remains uncertain. Here we use 145 radiocarbon dates on rooted tundra plants revealed by receding cold‐based ice caps in the eastern Canadian Arctic to show that 5000 years of regional summertime cooling has been reversed, with average summer temperatures of the last ~100 years now higher than during any century in more than 44,000 years, including the peak warmth of the early Holocene when high‐latitude summer insolation was 9% greater than present. Reconstructed changes in snowline elevation suggest that summers cooled ~2.7°C over the past 5000 years, approximately twice the response predicted by Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate models.  Our results indicate that anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases have led to unprecedented regional warmth.

You are clutching at straws anyway. The global temperature increase due to our greenhouse gas emissions is likely to take the earth to much higher temperatures than any time during which humans existed. Why you would seek to diminish the significance of that is anyones guess.

The first paper claims the Arctic Ocean was ice free during the summer in the Holocene, so all I would had to do to my original post is add one word ""Ocean"" and it would have been correct no?
Anyway if the Arctic Ocean was ice-free then likely pretty much every other nook and cranny in the Arctic was either ice free too, or had a lot less sea ice in the summer than it does now. Looking at the current maps of summer ice minimum it looks like the Arctic Ocean part is 90% of the sea ice with maybe 10% in the passages between the islands in the Axel Heiberg to Prince Patrick chain.

Here's another paper then to support my claim that the Arctic was ice-free during summers during the Holocene.
My point is despite all the claims that the modern warming is unprecedented, the peer-reviewed research shows otherwise. The Arctic presently has ice shelves in front of driftwood dated as short as less than 3,000 years ago. It presently has sea-ice year round and evidence from both modelling and proxy data shows this was not true throughout the Holocene.

Incorrect.You are quite delusional - the AGW theory is based on basic physics and chemistry more than a century old. The same science that allows IR heat seeking missiles to work (among a plethora of other real world applications).
As I pointed out it is not just government funded scientists who have reached this conclusion.
Exxon, Shell, BP and other independently funded organisations had scientists reaching the same conclusion decades ago.
Arrhenius predicted many changes back in 1896 that have come to pass. Diurnal heating and Arctic amplification for example. All predicted, all observed via direct empirical Evidence(TM) as monitored by multiple agencies under a wide range of political regimes. All the Evidence(TM) is in the public domain.
AGW theory enjoys the three C's- Coherncy, in explaining the changes we observe- Consilience, multiple branches of science all coming to the same conclusion based on Evidence(TM)- Consensus, across those multiple scientific disciplines.

When Exxon got its own scientists to investigate climate change in the 1970s, those scientists found that CO2 from burning fossil fuels was causing global temperatures to rise.

Real independently sceptical scientists have been investigating the global temperature records.
They set up a project called Berkeley Earth in 2010.
They found independent funding, including from sceptics in the business community.
Many so-called climate sceptics said this was exactly what they wanted, and they would accept what BE reported.
The first phase of the project took about 2 years; they went right back to all the raw data from all the data sets, and reassessed all the adjustments made for the distribution and location of stations, and for things like Urban Heat Island.
When BE then reported that their research agreed with other researchers that:
- the Earth is warming;
- has been since the 19th century;
- and that greenhouse gases produced by human activity are the cause....
- suddenly the so-called climate sceptic websites rejected BE, and never mention it.
The sceptical scientists, of course, now accepted that their check on other scientists' work had confirmed that the science published on this matter is good science - because those sceptical scientists were real sceptics.

Not really. The scenario presented is so wildly hypothetical my conclusion is it was meant not to be a realistic, but to scare the less informed. We're never going to emit a cumulative 10,000 GtC. To date the cumulative is about 350 GtC, we're adding at a rate of 10 GtC per year, and proven reserves meaning both what we know is in the ground and what we can extract economically is 746 GtC.

One is - what is the damage; who will be affected? And the other is - is it possible to do anything; and what cost does this represent if steps are considered necessary.
The first part I think can be summed up thus: we will see agriculture start to die off by the end of the century if we do nothing meaningful to slow emissions. Also, sea levels will rise by about 1-2 meters by 2100. This will start to build losses, and the global economy will experience something like 2008-9, but on a semi-permanent basis. Western economies may not cope at all, and we could start seeing much lower standards of living, greater inequality, unchecked crime and the rich retreating to gated communities etc.
The second part is: yes it is possible. However, many people are selfish and it will take much greater effort on the part of those who are used to dealing in minutiae, to start considering the broader implications of a steadily heating planet. There will no longer be time to mull over trivia endlessly, and pontificate about the finer points of one or others political leaning; we will need to fully accept what is happening to us all rather than allow the rich to look after themselves before truly catastrophic events start to effect any kind of normalcy continuing.
And this is where with a solid understanding of both the science and the technology required to avert calamity, hope exists.
There are people very much involved with implementing the changes necessary. This basically relates to 
a) decarbonising electricity via renewables, and not reading idiotic IEA 'Primary Energy' statistics - it will be achieved before 2100.b) decarbonising gas; both via CCS and via power-to-gas; which will become the de facto standard of storing and distributing super-cheap solar, exporting it etc. This will require converting some parts of the gas distribution network to hydrogen - not complicated or expensivec) expediting and enforcing a total ban on fossil fuels in transport. Again; this is already happening in moany countries around the world; although this is obviously a large industry and will take some time to reach critical mass. As an example, California, Japan, Korea, China, Europe and other regions are already firmly committed to this goal with plans and funding in place. Transport will be cheaper, it will be more ad-hoc in terms of renting vs buying with automatic drive, etc.
So we should know both what the dangers are and also be aware of the work being done while we speak to convert the systems we use to zero-carbon fuel.
It goes without saying that hydrogen represents the only realistic way of doing this at scale; in a homogeneous way that can be transferred to other countries once methodologies worked through. Reducing imports via self-generation and lower transport costs throughout the system should translate as a fairly minimal economic burden, indeed most things will be cheaper.

""A human-induced hothouse climate?"" - Kidder & Worsley, 2011
Here's a key quote from the Conclusions:
""The likely cool greenhouse in which about half of Antarctica is still ice-covered means devastation from the tens of meters sea level is likely to rise (e.g., Ward, 2010), and poleward shifting of warm climate belts.""
So the appropriate term for what's likely to happen is a 'cool greenhouse', which sounds harmless, but is not.
How quickly?
Another quote:
""a cool greenhouse seems imminent within perhaps a century or two.""
However, although those conditions could set in within that time, the process of melting half of the ice on Antarctica would take around 1000 years.
Meanwhile the
""poleward shifting of warm climate belts.""
means that the equatorial regions will become increasingly inhospitable - but over time, not in a couple of years.

The line brings me back to a sunny midsummer morning in Teller, Alaska.
I’m standing with Mayor Blanche Obanoke-Garnie, just above Teller’s shoreline. I had traveled 4,000 miles north as a National Geographic explorer to listen and learn how Americans were responding to the dynamic and dangerous shifts along our coastlines as sea levels rise.
As we looked out into sea’s wide expanse, Blanche explained that ice, and the protection it brings, had always been a given for Teller.
Teller sits on the most north-western edge of the North American continent. A remote town of around 230 Iñupiat residents, the community is built on a gravel spit that juts out into the Bering Strait. Sea ice is critical to the survival of the village, which is surrounded on three sides by water.
In normal years, ice begins to form around coastlines of the Bering Sea in early fall. It serves as an extension of the shoreline, providing a thick buffer to protect coastal villages like Teller from strong seasonal storms.
But climate change has introduced a new, dangerous normal.
Alaska is warming at twice the rate of the global average. And as air and sea temperatures warm at record-breaking speeds, sea ice forms much more thinly and much later into the year. According to the Arctic Report Card, during the winter of 2017 and 2018 when ice historically accumulates, the Bering Sea lost a section of ice the size of Idaho.
With no ice, Teller has no natural defense from increasingly intense storm surges that annually flood the town’s streets and sewage system. The US Army Corps of Engineers has identified Teller as one of the most imminently threatened villages in Alaska from this flooding. It is one of 12 communities currently exploring relocation away from the coastline further inland to higher, drier ground.
For Blanche, the loss of sea ice is more than a scientific indicator of persistent Arctic warming. It represents the daily danger of losing the places, histories and traditions that define Teller as a centuries-strong Native community.
But while the fate of Teller is intimately connected to the fate of sea ice, it is not the only community facing the consequences of the Arctic’s unprecedented melt. The extent of sea ice in the Arctic affects the safety of Americans in Alabama and Arizona just as much as it does in Alaska.
Sea ice in the polar regions helps to moderate global climate by reflecting solar radiation back into space. But as more ice is lost each season, more heat is absorbed by the ocean, compromising the Arctic’s ability to keep earth cool. And with more global warming, come more extreme storms across our shared world.
Today, 96% of Americans live in counties that have been hit by major weather disasters in the last five years alone.
Arctic ice loss is changing our shared planet at an extraordinary and life-threatening rate
No matter what corner of this country you call home, whether it be the coast, the mountains, the Great Lakes or the Great Plains, climate change is already causing billions of dollars in damages and irreplaceable cultural loss.
The severe warming and 95% loss of the Arctic’s oldest ice documented in the Arctic Report Card is not only pushing the region into uncharted territory. It is pushing our entire world into the most “unprecedented transition in human history”. Arctic ice loss is changing our shared planet at an extraordinary and life-threatening rate.
For me, the Bering Sea ice loss noted in the Arctic Report Card represents the danger of losing the places, histories and traditions that define communities across America – not just in Alaska.
In October, the world’s leading scientists warned that we have just 12 years to contain a climate change catastrophe in a landmark UN report. We cannot afford to wait to act ambitiously on climate change. The Arctic is already facing a climate change catastrophe in 2018.
And what happens in the Arctic, doesn’t stay in the Arctic. It affects us all.

The conference was meant to approve a rulebook which would govern how nations put into action the goals set in the landmark Paris agreement of 2015, when the world resolved to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration to limit temperature rises to no more than 1.5C.
On Friday night, sticking points still remained over how countries should report on and account for their greenhouse gas emissions, and there was little progress on persuading countries to make firm commitments to cut their emissions further than they have already promised. Part of the success of the Paris talks was based on the idea that countries would have taken further steps on emissions by now.
Finance for developing countries to help them cut emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change has also been largely overlooked at this year’s conference, though the World Bank pledged $200bn (£159bn) over five years as its contribution.
Observers at the two-week summit in Poland were frustrated by the slow progress, which came in sharp contrast to the warnings of scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that even 1.5C (34.7F) of warming would cause devastation, with the die-off of coral reefs and the decline of agriculture over swathes of the planet.
Gareth Redmond-King, the head of climate change at WWF UK, said: “These talks are critical to ensuring we get to 2020 on track to meet the Paris targets and avoid runaway climate change. The time to step up is now. We need all countries to signal they will increase their climate ambition by 2020.”
The US, which is withdrawing from the Paris agreement, led a small group of countries – Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait – to oppose a resolution that would have welcomed the IPCC report spelling out the dangers of breaching 1.5C. 
By the texts still circulating on Friday, they had succeeded in watering down the wording to a mere “noting” of the report. The difference may seem small, but the stronger wording would have allowed eager countries to force debates and possibly future resolutions on how to incorporate those stark scientific warnings into action.
The EU, the UK, New Zealand, Canada and more than 50 developing countries were in opposition, resolving to focus on a 1.5C limit for their own ambitions on cutting emissions.
But veterans of the annual conferences, held since 1992 in the hope of formulating a global response to climate change adequate to the challenge it represents, maintained that more could be forthcoming as the meetings stretched beyond their 6pm official closing time and looked likely to overrun into Saturday and perhaps Sunday. “It all happens at the end,” one national representative said. “We are not giving up yet.”
Next year’s meeting will be held in Chile – it should have been Brazil, but the incoming president, Jair Bolsonaro, who is hostile to the Paris agreement, withdrew the offer. Costa Rica will also play a role, with some of the anticipatory meetings to be held there.
The UK and Italy have submitted bids to hold the 2020 conference, which will be the biggest since Paris in 2015, as governments will be facing a crunch deadline over their efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions and their commitments to cut them further by 2030.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/14/cutting-emissions-proves-a-sticking-point-at-poland-climate-conference

Attached to the rope she has climbed to reach her perch, she squats among mosses, orchids and other plants that grow thickly on the bark, giving the canopy the impression of a hanging garden.
Known as epiphytes – plants that grow on other plants – they are Nadkarni’s special field of scientific research, omnipresent in the unique ecosystem of Costa Rica’s montane cloud forest. They thrive between 1,500 and 1,800 metres and depend on their ability to take water and nutrients directly from the swirling mists that should cloak these slopes.
But the continued existence of the cloud forest in Monteverde, familiar to the millions of tourists who have visited it, is under threat from global warming.
Only occurring in a narrow altitude band whose upper limit is defined by where the mountain tops run out and by the altitude at which the trees can grow, it is being squeezed in a vice from below by warmer and drier weather patterns eradicating the enfolding cloud.
Amphibians that once lived here have died back, to the point of species extinction in some cases.
The breeding patterns of the area’s emblematic resplendent quetzals – the colourful birds that have long drawn tourists to the area – are being disrupted. Lowland species of bats and birds, including toucans, have begun moving into the cloud forest.
One of the Costa Rica cloud forest’s most persistent and high-profile champions, Nadkarni has become increasingly concerned about the forest’s future.
A 64-year-old American scientist who has spent almost 40 years climbing ropes to study the forest canopy, she has seen profound changes in the decades she has spent studying the Monteverde forest.
“The tropical cloud forest is a very particular type,” Nadkarni says, reflecting on the fact that only about 1% of the planet’s woodlands are cloud forest.
“Its most important aspect is the fact that it gets a lot of mist and cloud during most of the year. What’s fabulous about it is that it really nurtures this incredibly diverse and abundant group of plants that live in the canopy, which obtain their water and their nutrients from this mist and cloud.
“When I climb into the forest, when I get away from the dark, damp, windless forest floor – well, you really enter kind of a different world.”
Nadkarni identifies the montane cloud forest as one of the world’s three most sensitive along with the threatened coral reefs and ice caps.
“It is one of the canaries in the coal mine, more sensitive to climate change than others. All are indicative of a world that is experiencing climate change and that’s happening now.”
Nadkarni is not wrong. Once inside, the forest is a dark and dripping place at ground level, its perspectives shifting spookily with the passage of the mists across the rise of the continental divide.
Punctuating the green curtain are flashes of colour.
Subtle mauve bells of drymonia compete with the spiky balls of yellow justicia and the blades of vibrant red that attract butterflies and other insects.
There are sloths and monkeys in the branches, while coatis and agoutis scamper in the undergrowth.
But it is the trees that are most striking, not least the towering strangler figs with trunks like church buttresses.
The sheer scale of the diversity is explained by another facet of this ecosystem: the compression of multiple “life zones” into the narrow band of the cloud forest supports huge numbers of species, many still to be identified.
Following Nadkarni and her colleague Cameron Williams 30m up a free hanging rope into the branches, it is hard to credit that her passion for the forest tops almost killed her three years ago. Then, climbing in a forest in the American Pacific north-west, a rope severed, precipitating a 15-metre ground fall.
“You know I’ve climbed for 39 years and never had a problem. I always felt that if we take care with our equipment – with our process or protocols – that trees actually are one of the safest places to be.
“But three years ago, in the temperate rainforest of the Olympic Peninsula, my rope failed. My graduate students said that I didn’t utter a scream. I just fell like a silent sack of sand. I was knocked out for 10 minutes and I was on the forest floor for about six hours before the helicopter came.”
The injuries would have stopped most people of 61.
Five thoracic vertebrae were “exploded”. She lost her spleen as well, and her pelvis was broken in three places; she suffered nine broken ribs, lacerated lungs and a broken fibula. “I was in bad shape.”
And Nadkarni sees her accident as a metaphor for the threat to the cloud forest.
“I think that fall from a tree made me realise how fragile the human body is. By extension it relates to what I’m trying to do in understanding and communicating the importance of forests.
“You can walk into a forest that seems so robust and so healthy and so diverse and so connected and so strong and so useful and so beautiful. Just like I was – I was robust, I was vibrant, I could climb to the top of any tree.”
Because one of the paradoxes of the cloud forest, even under threat, is that it still looks vibrant even as new species move in, undermining its uniqueness.
In the research centre at the Monteverde cloud forest reserve, Nadkarni’s fellow scientist Alan Pounds, one of the first people to warn of the threat to the cloud forest from the lifting cloud base in the 1990s, explains that it is not simply a question of the cloud rising.
Instead the weather appears to be in the midst of a complex, wholesale change that has seen dry days in the forest quadruple in the last four decades. That has also been accompanied by more extreme rainfall, including flash-flooding.
“While it’s hard to quantify exactly, judging from some of the shifts in cloud forest organisms, I would say [the cloud has] shifted upward, so maybe a couple hundred metres over these last 40 years or so. What you can see looking over the years is an increasing number of dry days, in fact quadrupled since the 70s. It’s averaged over 100 days [a year] since 2011.
“What we’re teasing out in our analysis is the fact that it’s getting wetter and drier at the same time,” he says, explaining how the persistent mist has given way to drier periods, punctuated by heavy episodes of rain.
“Actually it’s becoming more like a rainforest. We just have more contrast between wet and dry periods.”
Among species challenged by these changes, Pounds – like many the Guardian talks to – mentions the resplendent quetzal which comes to breed in the cloud forest, feeding on a kind of small avocado.
Male resplendent quetzal, which breeds in the cloud forest
“It’s a good example of what we are talking about when we say it is getting squeezed because there’s no place for it to go upslope.
Pounds mentions a nearby area of woods. “I used to hear them singing every day during breeding season and now they’ve moved out of that area and they’ve become more restricted, moving higher up the mountain here.”
What is doubly ironic, given the threat, is that the community in Monteverde has long been ahead of the curve in terms of conservation efforts, in part the result of a historical coincidence.
One key element was the arrival in the 1950s of US Quakers – pacifists – who emigrated to the area fleeing the draft for the Korean war.
Daily life in Santa Elena, which borders the Monteverde cloud forest
While these new residents cleared forest for pastures for dairy farming, they protected parts of the forest to conserve the watershed. In the 1970s, as recognition of the uniqueness of the infrastructure grew, Quakers, incoming scientists and local Costa Ricans formed an informal coalition that has continued to this day as ecotourism emerged as an economic mainstay.
But if there is a catch, it is that on an isthmus bounded by warming oceans on two sides – the Atlantic on the Caribbean side and the Pacific on the other – it has been impossible to insulate the cloud forest from what is a worldwide phenomenon.
And the impact of global warming has been noticed not only in the forest but in the coffee plantations at its edges.
On his plantation, Guillermo Vargas, who doubles as the head of the local tourism council, has seen the mountains transform in his 58 years.
“It’s been over the last 30 that we have noticed the change in the precipitation,” he says.
“It used to rain – like drizzle – for many months. It used to be very cloudy most of the year. It used to be very windy with a lot of drizzle and now – like today [in November, at the end of the rainy season], it’s almost like the dry season.
“Now it is raining differently. It rains very hard so it impacts the soil, causing more erosion.
“Also, the fact that the wet and dry seasons are now not very well defined means that the coffee blooms in January through June. In the past the bloom was concentrated in a period of maybe four or five weeks in the beginning of May, June.”
That, says Vargas, has caused economic issues both for farmers and the pickers, including those who come from Nicaragua, who need to come for longer but with fewer coffee beans per day to pick, as the period of the harvest has become much more spread out.
Another issue, he adds, is that pests once just seen in Costa Rica’s lowlands have begun appearing at ever higher elevations.
It is not only the impact on coffee he is worried about but ultimately on the ecotourism that sustains many of the jobs in the local community.
“I know that for more than 40 years we have said we are the most famous cloud forest in the world. That this is unique in Costa Rica.
“We have been selling Monteverde as a cloud forest and it won’t be a cloud forest in a few decades. It will be like a rainforest. So what visitors can see here, in 2040 they will be able to see [elsewhere].”
All of which means, says Vargas, that the ecotourism industry – which the community has built from a base of 15,000 visitors a year to almost 200,000 – will also have to adapt to climate change.
“The fact that the cloud forest is changing means we have to adapt in terms of the story we tell, to be able to understand the process, and then explain to visitors about the process and still be able to demonstrate that Monteverde is a unique destination not just because of the cloud forest but because of our capacity to teach about climate change.
Down from the tops of the swaying strangler figs and on solid ground again, Nalini Nadkarni reflects on how the threat of climate change to the place where she has worked for four decades has transformed her in recent years from a scientific researcher into something more activist.
“[Climate change] is actually happening faster than we thought it was even 10 years ago. And there are certain points that might turn what’s going on in Monteverde right now to change even faster.
“You know when I first came here in 1979 as a graduate student and I looked up into the canopy of this Monteverde cloud forest and I saw these plants and animals high above the forest floor, I was just curious about what is going on. I wanted to find out about what’s going on with these canopy plants.
“But just 15 years ago I was up in a tree and I heard the sound of a chainsaw just outside the boundary of the Monteverde cloud forest, and I realised in an almost metaphorical way that in fact deforestation, human activities and their negative effects were literally right outside the border of this beautiful little reserve.”
It is an issue, she concedes, that has become even more pressing in the Trump era, where climate change denial has been embraced by the White House.
“As an American and as a scientist I am horrified. I am ashamed. I actually feel like going into denial about my own country in terms of its response to global climate change.
“All of us scientists, not just in America but around the world, know that climate change is being exacerbated. Being caused by human activities, by overconsumption, by use of fossil fuels. And for our leadership to take exactly the wrong turn, to remove ourselves from the Paris treaty, to encourage coal mining …
“What I feel I need to do is to bring my science, bring my understanding of what’s going on in the tropical cloud forest and other ecosystems to the people, to policymakers.
“I think that scientists are becoming more political. We have become less afraid to speak out against the political regimes that are making these wrong decisions. In the past, even ten years ago, my fellow scientists would not be making these statements.”
Nadkarni reflects on the change. “You know each species that moves or disappears has repercussions in terms of the ecosystem as a whole. Now the plants are a little bit harder to see. But I know when I climb in the forest, that compared with when I started here 39 years ago, the canopy dwelling plants – the mosses, the filmy ferns – they were much more abundant, much more plush, much more … just wet, than they are now.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/dec/16/head-in-the-clouds-climate-change-nalini-nadkarni-costa-rica-monteverde

Leading figures in climate science and economics said much more must be done, and quickly, to stave off the prospect of dangerous levels of global warming.
Nicholas Stern, the former World Bank chief economist and author of a seminal review of the economics of climate change, said: “It is clear that the progress we are making is inadequate, given the scale and urgency of the risks we face. The latest figures show carbon dioxide emissions are still rising. A much more attractive, clean and efficient path for economic development and poverty reduction is in our hands.”
Johan Rockstrom, director designate at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said: “My biggest concern is that the UN talks failed to align ambitions with science. We continue to follow a path that will take us to a very dangerous 3-4C warmer world within this century. Extreme weather events hit people across the planet already, at only 1C of warming.”
The two-week-long UN talks in Poland ended with clarity over the “rulebook” that will govern how the Paris agreement of 2015 is put into action, but the crucial question of how to lift governments’ targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was left unanswered.
Countries will meet again next year. The annual climate talks have been going on since 1992 when the UN framework convention on climate change was signed, binding governments to avoid dangerous levels of climate change. That agreement followed years of scientific predictions on global warming, culminating in a landmark report in 1988 that warned of the dangers.
Since then, the warnings have grown clearer and scientists have eliminated the possibility that the global warming observed in recent decades has been due to natural forces. It is a manmade problem arising from the use of fossil fuels, which has poured the heat-trapping gas carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
On current national emissions-cutting targets, the world would reach more than 3C of warming, scientists say. Two months ago the world’s leading body of climate scientists, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, found that even 1.5C of warming would cause sea level rises, coral reef die-off, extinction of species and droughts, floods, storms and heatwaves that would threaten the world’s stability.
Levels of warming greater than that would devastate parts of the globe, wiping out agricultural productivity, melting the Arctic ice cap and rendering many areas uninhabitable.
Some businesses called on governments to act. Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, which represents investors with more than $21tn (£16.7tn) in funds, said: “It is vital that the world’s governments recognise the serious challenge posed by climate change and urgently scale up their efforts, both at a national level and globally. It is only through signals such as these that investors will have the confidence necessary to allocate the required capital to the low-carbon and climate-resilient transition.”
Next year’s negotiations, in Chile, are likely to focus on narrow technical issues. But the 2020 conference, which may be held in the UK or Italy, will be the biggest since the landmark Paris agreement of 2015. There, countries will have to come up with plans for cutting emissions drastically in order to avert a climate crisis that scientists say will cause greater economic, social and natural disruption than anything in humanity’s history.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/16/un-climate-accord-inadequate-and-lacks-urgency-experts-warn

The summit agreed rules for implementing the 2015 Paris agreement, which aims to keep global warming as close to 1.5C (2.7F) as possible, but it made little progress in increasing governments’ commitments to cut emissions. The world remains on track for 3C of warming, which scientists says will bring catastrophic extreme weather.
Many NGOs said national leaders at the summit had failed to address the urgency of climate change, which is already making heatwaves and storms more frequent and intense, harming millions of people.
May Boeve, the executive director of the 350.org climate change campaign group, said: “Hope now rests on the shoulders of the many people who are rising to take action: the inspiring children who started an unprecedented wave of strikes in schools to support a fossil-free future; the 1,000-plus institutions that committed to pull their money out of coal, oil, and gas, and the many communities worldwide who keep resisting fossil fuel development.”
The school strikes began in August as a solo protest by 15-year-old Greta Thunberg in Sweden. Addressing the summit in Poland, she said: “If children can get headlines all over the world just by not going to school, then imagine what we could all do together if we really wanted to.
“You say you love your children above all else, and yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes. We have run out of excuses and we are running out of time. We have come here to let you know that change is coming, whether you like it or not. The real power belongs to the people.”
Members of the Extinction Rebellion (XR) movement said there was a rising tide of protest. “We pay tribute to activists, students, civil society and the leaders of vulnerable countries who are rising up all over the world demanding more,” said Farhana Yamin, from XR UK. “We need now to work together to build an emergency coalition focused squarely on tackling climate devastation.”
XR branches have been set up in 35 countries, organisers said. US protesters aim to organise a day of action on 26 January 2019, and international activists are planning a global week of action from 15 April 2019. XR protests took place in more than a dozen towns across the UK over the weekend, from chalk-spraying a government building in Bristol to holding a “die-in” demonstration in Cambridge and handing out trees in Glasgow.
Patti Lynn, the executive director of the Corporate Accountability campaign group, said: “We will continue to build our movements at home and we will escalate global campaigns to hold big polluters accountable for their role in the climate crisis. The movement to demand climate justice has never been more united, organised or determined. Our day is coming and we will win.”
Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International, said: “People are fed up, outraged and are taking action to defend their homes and children and pushing their leaders to act These people are the hope of our generation and governments must finally stand with them and give us all reasons for hope.”
In the US, Michael Brune, the head of the Sierra Club environmental campaign group, said: “The American people are joined by the rest of the world in signalling that they will not tolerate any more of Trump’s shameful blustering and inaction, and they have taken up the mantle of climate action while Trump abdicates any semblance of global leadership.” He said more than 100 US cities had committed to 100% clean energy, covering 15% of the US population.
Stephan Singer, a chief adviser at Climate Action Network, an umbrella group for 1,300 NGOs in more than 120 countries, pointed to the wide range of people taking action and demanding more, including youth and faith groups, indigenous peoples, health authorities, farmers, trade unions, city authorities and some financial institutions. “All these actions and many more have to magnify and multiply in the next years,” he said.

EU countries will aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from new cars by 37.5% by 2030 compared with 2021, while emissions from new vans will have to be 31% lower. There was also an interim target of a 15% cut for cars and vans by 2025.
Europe’s car industry reacted with fury, saying the commitment was driven purely by political motives and “totally unrealistic”.
Erik Jonnaert, the secretary general of the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), which represents companies such as Renault and BMW, said the targets “will be extremely demanding on Europe’s auto industry”, with a “seismic impact” on jobs.
The agreement on Monday night, which aims to spur the move towards electric vehicles and other alternatives to diesel and petrol, was described by European policymakers as a compromise between environmental concerns and representatives of countries with large car industries that had pushed for a much smaller cut, including Germany.
Maroš Šefčovič, the European commission’s vice-president for energy union, described the move as “another credible step in the implementation of the Paris agreement but also another decisive step in support of the long-term competitiveness of European industry”.
Europe is aiming for the transport industry to be climate neutral in the second half of the century, while countries including France and the UK have announced plans to ban sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2040. Carbon emissions from the EU’s transport sector increased by 28.3% between 1990 and 2016, according to the European Environment Agency.
However, the take-up of electric vehicles in Europe has been relatively slow, with political pressure to keep the cost of motoring low spilling into widespread protests in France. Electrically chargeable vehicles made up 1.5% of all cars sold in the EU last year, according to ACEA.
Transport and Environment, a Brussels-based thinktank, said the reduction in emissions would not be enough to limit climate change. Under the Paris agreement countries including the EU member states have committed to limit global warming to well below 2C (35.6F) and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C.
Greg Archer, T&amp;E’s clean vehicles director, said: “Europe is shifting up a gear in the race to produce zero-emission cars. The new law means by 2030 around a third of new cars will be electric- or hydrogen-powered. That’s progress but it’s not fast enough to hit our climate goals.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/18/carmakers-criticise-unrealistic-eu-plan-slash-vehicle-emissions

The employer body’s chief executive, Innes Willox, told Guardian Australia an emissions reduction obligation in national policy was “vastly superior” to separate state schemes and also pushed for policies to reduce emissions outside the energy sector.
AiG was one of a number of business groups – including the Business Council of Australia, Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and National Farmers Federation – which supported the Coalition’s national energy guarantee (Neg) before the emissions reduction component was dumped by Malcolm Turnbull in August.
After months of lobbying from the Labor states, on Wednesday the NSW energy minister, Don Harwin, joined calls to restore that component with a plan to ask the Energy Security Board to draw up a new emissions reduction trajectory. The issue was deferred at the energy council meeting in Adelaide after intervention by the federal energy minister, Angus Taylor.
On Thursday Willox said that “adding emissions reductions to the objectives of reliability and affordability, as the Neg proposed, was a way to facilitate investment in generation by giving investors greater certainty”.
“We would support minister Harwin’s call for an end to the ‘climate wars’ and a resumption of an approach to energy that reinserts the objective of emissions reduction,” he said. “We also agree that a national approach would be vastly superior to having a myriad of state and territory approaches.”
NSW plans to ask the ESB for options to achieve zero net emissions in the electricity sector by 2050, the state government’s preferred target.
Willox said that approach “wouldn’t hurt but we need to bear in mind that the energy sector accounts for about 40% of Australia’s emissions”.
“In any national target we need to have contributions from other sectors and we need clarity about the policies that will govern how we meet those targets,” he said. “Energy is a big part of the equation but far from the only one.”
On Thursday Harwin told Radio National the Neg “has wide support among the stakeholders and was the right policy in terms of securing Australia’s energy supply into the future with new investment”.
“We’ve got one half of [the Neg], the reliability obligation … my point yesterday is we need the other half of it as well,” he said.
The South Australian energy minister, Dan van Holst Pellekaan, told Guardian Australia it had also reiterated its “ongoing support for the emissions reduction obligation” in the Neg but the “earliest opportunity” to consider it is an out of session meeting in February.
Harwin denied that the Berejiklian government was spooked into action by the impending March state election, arguing it had “been advocating for a policy for a lower emissions future for some time”.
He said it had “consistently supported” the work of the former federal energy minister Josh Frydenberg and the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull to achieve the Neg.
Echoing a favoured dictum of Turnbull, Harwin said he supported emissions reduction targets “backed by economics and engineering”, agreeing with Taylor that “Labor’s target is too much too fast and would cause substantial upward pressure on prices and cause a reliability problem”.
Federal Labor’s shadow cabinet and national conference have endorsed a target of 45% reduction in the electricity sector by 2030.
Harwin said Labor’s targets were “as much of a risk as the fact we don’t have a Neg at all”.
Since the emissions reduction obligation was ditched in August, the Morrison government has failed to release new climate policy to drive emissions in the electricity or other sectors.
On Thursday Taylor defended the government’s claim Australia will meet its Paris target to reduce emissions by 26% by 2030, telling Radio National that “departmental numbers” show in the electricity sector a 28% reduction will be achieved by 2023.
Taylor conceded the figure applied only to the energy sector and dismissed the latest data showing Australia’s emissions are climbing by claiming “from year to year you see ups and downs”.
By 2020 Australia will beat its Kyoto target by 300 million tonnes and the Coalition is “very confident” it will then meet the 2030 Paris target, Taylor said, against the advice of climate scientists and economists.
At the latest round of UN climate talks Australia lobbied to exploit a controversial climate loophole, using carryover carbon credits from the Kyoto protocol to meet its Paris targets.
The Climate Council’s acting chief executive, Martin Rice, accused Taylor of “misleading the public” by citing electricity sector figures when Australia’s commitment is for economy-wide reductions.
“His government’s own published data clearly indicates Australia is not on track to meet its Paris commitments,” he said. “The energy minister is using very slippery language. The fact is Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions have risen for four years in a row.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/20/industry-backs-nsw-call-for-morrison-government-to-require-emissions-cut

The BBC is journalistically objective when reporting global warming. If a scientist or activist talks on air about the human causes of climate change then someone else, often from one of the denial groups funded by the fossil fuel lobby, is usually invited to provide a “counterargument” (for example, that recent warming is caused by “natural” factors). This leaves many viewers with the erroneous impression that a genuine scientific is debate taking place and weakens social support for strong measures to address climate change, which is precisely what the organised denial lobby wants.
It is time for the BBC to abandon this illusion of impartiality. Global warming demands a new ethos of public service broadcasting. Scientific evidence has made it unambiguously clear that contemporary climate change is caused by human greenhouse gas emissions. There is no scientific equivalence, and certainly no moral equivalence, between what climate scientists have concluded and what the deniers assert. The only scientific debate left is on the scale and pace of change. How bad will it be; and how soon? And how should we respond?
The BBC should commit itself to upscaling its coverage of global warming and working with other media to ensure that the public is accurately and fully informed on the most pressing public welfare challenge of this century.David HumphreysProfessor of environmental policy, The Open University

City officials have reported an increasing number of calls from residents complaining about rats, and have warned that milder winters are helping them feed and mate longer into the year. And as winters warm up, more frequent outdoor activity by humans is adding to the litter rats thrive upon.
Rat-related complaints have been on the rise over the past four years, with 19,152 calls made to the city last year, an increase of about 10% on 2016. There are no reliable figures on the number of rats in New York – estimates range from 250,000 to tens of millions – but the surge in rat activity has been replicated in other cities. Houston, Washington, Boston and Philadelphia have experienced large increases in calls to pest control.
Veteran anti-rat strategists have, in part, blamed climate change. “It’s a complex issue but we are seeing rat population increases around the world now,” said Bobby Corrigan, a sought-after rat-catching consultant who once spent a week living in a rat-infested barn in Indiana as part of his PhD research.
“Requests for my services are through the roof, I can’t keep up with them,” he said. “You speak to any health commissioner from Boston to DC and the trend is upwards.
“In winter rats slow down their reproduction because it’s so cold, but they are probably having one more litter a year now because it’s getting warmer. A litter is around 10 babies and that’s making a difference.”
Mike Deutsch, a veteran rat-catcher at the New York-based Arrow Exterminating Company, said warming temperatures are having a “natural consequence. As the earth warms you’ll have more activity, more rats about. They won’t be able to keep growing if there’s not enough food or shelter for them but you’ll see populations rise.”
Deutsch – whose recent research found that, contrary to popular belief, cats aren’t very good at catching rats – also pointed to other factors such as urban construction that has disturbed rat families, making them more visible.
The increase in rat sightings has spawned viral videos of rats eating pizza and navigating escalators – but has also raised health concerns. 
A death was recorded in the Bronx last year due to leptospirosis, a rare disease transmitted via rat urine. New York rats trapped and tested by Columbia University researchers were found to be reservoirs of E coli and salmonella, with some even carrying Seoul hantavirus, which can cause kidney failure.
The city’s response has been muscular. Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled a $32m plan last year to launch a mass slaughter of rats in infested areas such as Chinatown and the East Village. New York City makes about 100,000 inspections for rat activity each year, and exterminators gas rats to death in their burrows rather than poison them, because of fears over the impact on other wildlife.
De Blasio noted darkly that he’s seen “many a rat” in the city. “I see them in the parks, and in the subway. We’re kind to rats. We just want them to go away.”
However, New York is likely to remain a haven for rats because of its large human population, sprawl of hole-ridden buildings and its copious waste. A warming climate will only exacerbate these rat-friendly conditions.
There is mountains of garbage in the city and the rats are saying, ‘Thanks, we'll bite through that and eat at will'
“We are at war but we don’t have weapons to fight the war,” Corrigan said. “We could get the rat numbers down to tolerable levels but we need to rethink our whole system of doing things.
“There are litter baskets all over New York City and every night you see rats in there gorging themselves because it’s easy. There are mountains of bags of garbage in the city and the rats are saying, ‘Thanks, we will bite through that and eat at will.’ The rats are taking advantage of our weaknesses.”
Rats have become so ingrained in the fabric of New York life that researchers have discovered genetically distinct “uptown” and “downtown” rats.
Even those tasked with killing rats recognize they will never be eliminated from the New York experience. An anonymous advertising copywriter, who calls herself the “Elena Ferrante of rats”, offers an unusual online gifting service where she will exterminate rats for a fee, providing a certificate to mark the kill.
“I don’t have it out for rats. I think they’re pretty impressive,” she told the Guardian. “There’s just too many of them.”
Deutsch, who has caught rats in places as diverse as Arizona and on cruise ships meandering around Europe, said he has developed “a relationship with rats.”
“They are an incredible animal, I admire their ability to adapt to different situations,” he said. “I look at them as a tremendous success.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/21/new-york-rat-crisis-climate-change

I felt we were up against it and it was becoming real. Seeing British lawns the colour of dry hay for weeks, getting a heatstroke when vising Kew Gardens, and lastly the extent and ferocity of the wildfires in California truly scared me. I’ve joined Greenpeace. Catherine Laz, 56, London
The moment that did it for me was reading the IPCC report that said we have 12 years to reduce carbon emissions to keep global warming to a limit of 1.5 degrees, and that 2 degrees is the tipping point. Knowing that we are warming at an average of 0.2 degrees per decade is scary, and the projections of reaching 4 degrees by 2050 if business as usual is continued shocked me. I’ve been reading more about climate change and the hot summer of 2018 has definitely been an eye opener in demonstrating its huge impact. We have been fed the lies by governments and businesses that we can significantly reduce climate change by taking personal responsibility – such as recycling more and turning off lights – when really we need to be demanding government to tax carbon, divest from fossil fuel and invest in renewables. Amina Jahan Ali, 26, London
I’ve always thought I was reasonably aware of climate change so this summer I had a fairly uneasy feeling about the heatwave we were experiencing. In August I read the hot house earth article in the Guardian and had what can only be described as a mental breakdown. I had a week where I barely ate, drank or slept. It was like I was suddenly thrust into a different world. The thought of having brought children into a dying world was hugely distressing. I hid from the news for a week or two but then decided that this was making things worse so plunged into articles on the true state of the planet, and am doing what I can including going vegan and becoming a member of the Extinction Rebellion. Jennie Gibson, 34, Manchester
What really made me take notice was the UN report this year and an article in the New York magazine, which said we basically now have the permission to freak out. I don’t think people realize how climate change is going to affect us – we’ve seen it in 2018 with extreme heatwaves in countries such as India. It makes me so mad to know that the really rich people in the world will probably escape death from this and the ordinary people are the ones who will suffer. It’s very frightening and unjust. I heard children in Australia were striking in schools for more action to be taken and hope this tactic is adopted by more people to demand appropriate action if it’s not being done. Margaret Lynch, 31, Ireland
Climate change has made me fearful before, but in 2018 I am thinking about it every day, and I am terrified that the lives my children might be living in a few years will be ones of desolation and suffering.
It was really brought home by the launch of Extinction Rebellion, which I discovered via George Monbiot. I still feel unsure about what I can actually do, beyond the micro-scale – avoiding plastic, driving and flying as little as possible, etc. In this country I’m not prepared to get myself arrested – but what, other than civil disobedience, will change the minds of the policymakers? Shari Daya, 40, Cape Town
Fires in Northern California, where I live, were one of the main factors for me. Two years in a row, in addition to many lives lost and homes destroyed, we have had several days of choking, toxic smoke affecting millions and millions of people, including me and my loved ones. Last year the smoke lasted about 5 days; this year it was 12. Next year, will the smoke last for 20 days? A month? How much clean air will we have in Northern CA as the years go on? When my daughter becomes an adult, will she say “well, in my day at least we still did outside sports.”
Of course I had heard about climate change before, but I think I really thought it was mostly about sea-level rise, and I thought, “well, as long as I live more than a few feet above sea level, I’ll be okay.” But in this piece, a professor says “the odds of human civilization reaching the 22nd century are often estimated at no better than 50/50.” This statistic walloped me, shocked me, and in fact frightened me beyond belief. Among other things I have joined 350.org and attended the Climate March in San Francisco in 2018. Isobel White, 50, San Francisco Bay
Having endured ex Hurricane Ophelia last year and the Beast from the East this year, the message did become more relevant than ever. My concern is that some remedies put forward raise legitimate concerns too. For example, the French riots show us that there is little democratic appetite in developed countries to implement the IPCC’s solution, which is to rapidly decarbonise our economies using carbon taxes as tools to ration fossil fuel consumption, while the coverage of the activities of Extinction Rebellion in the UK towards the end of the year shows that extreme measures are currently only being undertaken by relatively few. David, 50, Ireland
I think I’d recognised it before and seen the effects, but this year it really seemed to hit home in the developed countries. People, the media and politics are starting to take notice – now we need to act. Aid agencies have been complicit in past downplaying of the threat – choosing not to emphasise climate as a clear diver and direct cause of emergencies for fear of alienating donors and supporters. This must change: we have to galvanise all elements of society and international politics and ensure we act. Much of the work I do as an aid worker is in response to climate change or the effects of climate change on politics and people – this isn’t just serious, it’s an existential threat that drives crises across the globe. People in the worst affected regions won’t stay where they are and we are woefully underprepared to deal with the consequences. David Wightwick
I have been concerned about climate change for some time, but was prompted to be more actively involved this year due to the changing political landscape. No longer can we count on our governments alone to address the threat in a meaningful and comprehensive way. Democracy and societal good needs loud citizen voices now. Aside from supporting political parties that have policies to address climate change I have joined a local group working for a more locally sustainable society.

And Elliott is right to say that the official declaration that came out of Katowice was not nearly enough.
But that wasn’t the only thing that came from the climate talks. There was a newly prominent place for civil society, from teenager Greta Thunberg to nonagenarian David Attenborough, and some companies, and many state and city governments, stepping up to the plate.
We’ve been trashing the planet over recent decades while creating a miserable, insecure society.
The 12 years that the IPCC gave us is an agonisingly short period to transform the world economy. But both Facebook and Twitter were infants 12 years ago; rapid change is a normal part of the human condition.
History is not pre-written, or destined to repeat itself. Offering the hope that with political, economic, social, educational and environmental transformation we can build a society that works for the common good, within the physical limits of this one fragile planet, is politically essential. The politics of the far right is built on fear and we must not feed that.
Business as usual isn’t an option. But then that is one thing that certainly is not going to happen. That’s good news, for our planet and its people.Natalie BennettFormer leader, Green party of England and Wales
• The graphics accompanying Larry Elliott’s article hark back not to the 1930s but to the framing of ecological problems from the second half of the 20th century. People are now realising that climate change is not just about polar bears but about all life on earth, and that it relates to people’s everyday lives. Rather than carrying banners with the now rather cliched “Save our Planet”, parents, grandparents and all people concerned for the future of life are now more likely to be holding a banner proclaiming “Extinction Rebellion”, or featuring its memorable hour-glass logo.Siân CharnleyBristol

The scandal-plagued Pruitt had long pushed for a public “red team, blue team” debate between mainstream scientists and the small minority of scientists who disagree with them about climate change and its causes. In late 2017, White House officials urged him to abandon the idea.
Yet according to emails obtained by the Guardian through a Freedom of Information Act request, as recently as mid-May 2018 aides were considering an alternative: the agency could ask for public comments on a 2009 legal finding that requires the US government to regulate greenhouse gases.
If by that process the EPA could successfully rescind the conclusion that greenhouse gases endanger public health, the federal government would no longer have to regulate major sources of carbon pollution, including power plants.
According to a former senior administration official speaking on the condition of anonymity, the plan to ask for comments rather than hold a public debate was a compromise struck between the White House and the EPA. In July, however, Pruitt resigned, following dozens of stories about his ethical troubles.
The emails obtained by the Guardian offer a glimpse of how the Trump administration has struggled to settle on a position on climate change.
Trump himself has repeatedly doubted overwhelming research that shows humans burning fossil fuels are emitting greenhouse gases that raise global temperatures and cause catastrophic environmental changes. A number of top officials have expressed similar feelings or questioned how bad climate change will be, and federal agencies are reversing climate change mitigation efforts for power plants and cars.
However, many Republicans and large energy companies urging Trump to rescind regulations do not want the EPA to debate the 2009 climate change finding, fearing a losing battle.
The Midwest power provider American Electric Power, for example, opposes reconsidering the finding. It has long relied on coal but is shifting its electricity mix.
“I don’t think the business community wants this at all,” said Paul Bledsoe, who was a climate change adviser to Bill Clinton. “They all came out against leaving [the Paris climate agreement]. They all have statements on their websites that they believe in climate science. The last thing they want is to get thrust into the middle of this.”
Pruitt’s most conservative supporters pushed him to re-examine the finding anyway, a move which would require a full scientific review and prompt massive legal battles.
It is not clear how serious the EPA considerations were or whether Pruitt’s staff intended to eventually propose a rollback. Attachments shared in emails between senior staff members included an “Endangerment ANPRM draft”, referring to an “advance notice of proposed rulemaking”, an early step in the regulatory process. Another email contained a version of talking points for a “Notice of Opportunity to Comment”.
Conservative groups, including the Competitive Enterprise Institute, had petitioned the EPA to re-evaluate the endangerment finding. The EPA could have posted those petitions and asked for public comments. Or it could have solicited input as part of another climate-related rollback.
The documents referred to in the emails were not released, because the Freedom of Information Act does not require the government to release records that were part of ongoing deliberations. One subject line referenced an afternoon meeting.
The staffers exchanging the drafts, air official Mandy Gunasekara and the policy chief, Brittany Bolen, stayed at the EPA when Pruitt left. In a brief interview this month, Gunasekara said the agency’s “understanding of CO2 and greenhouse gases continues to evolve”. She declined to comment on the released emails. Spokespeople for the EPA and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.
Emails released to the Guardian also showed the EPA air chief, Bill Wehrum, planning in December to make an announcement about the “RTBT”, the notional “red team, blue team” debate.
This month, in a draft rule to ease standards for new coal plants, the EPA said it would accept comments on whether the agency had correctly interpreted the endangerment finding.
Climate advocates say the EPA should be transparent about its plans now.
“Americans deserve to know whether acting EPA head, Andrew Wheeler, nominated to be EPA administrator, disputes that carbon pollution endangers human health and the environment,” said John Walke, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
According to a peer-reviewed paper published last week in the journal Science, scientific evidence showing that greenhouse gases are dangerous to public health is even stronger than it was when the endangerment finding was established in 2009.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/21/scott-pruitt-epa-climate-change-science-red-team-blue-team-debate

I know you’ve got your own plight, and there are only so many plights that you can consider at any one time, and that the plight of the satirist might even seem to you to be one of the easier plights. A satirist, you imagine, is having a pretty heavy week if they do more than pop up on The News Quiz to say that every MP in the DUP looks like a committee member of a bowling club who’s just seen a visitor enter the bar wearing jeans. And now that you put it like that, yes, you’re right, it’s not much of a plight at all, really.
The plight of the satirist, such as it is, is a compulsion to look at the grimmest, most important thing they can think of, and then for reasons that probably wouldn’t survive a really good therapist, try to make it funny. To try to address the iniquities of their society, the satirist must manufacture some hope that what they’re doing might make a difference, then type it all up and send it off somewhere before they remember that it never does. Looking back over the events of this year is a bit like holding a doll for a therapist and pointing to where the bad man hurt you. Among the lowlights were:
1 Theresa May dancing on stage at the Conservative Party conference (choreographer Ray Harryhausen), looking like an uncloaked Dementor on a hen weekend.
2 A group of deranged kippers burning a cardboard effigy of Grenfell tower. They were later quizzed by police, and Kensington and Chelsea council, who asked them to quote for some public housing projects. 
3 A senate grilling of Mark Zuckerberg, who gave the general impression of a Batman villain whose backstory is being given puberty-delaying drugs by a paedophile, and who seemed visibly relieved to be questioned on privacy concerns rather than Facebook’s monopoly power.
4 The continuing media fascination with Jacob Rees-Mogg, a man who has all the authenticity of a character at a murder-mystery weekend.
5 Philip Hammond delivering a budget speech so dry it was sponsored by Vagisil, making watching for 75 minutes feel like a gateway drug for necrophilia.
6 The hilarious emergence of the phrase “rules-based international order”, which I like to imagine pronounced with the jaded, lisping irony of Gore Vidal, drunk on his deathbed.
7 The Palestinian right-of-return marches that demonstrated the old Israeli proverb, you can’t make an omelette without shooting protesters. Trump said the US was “fully committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement”. The lasting peace that will come about once Israel has shot all the Palestinians.
Beyond that, the year broke down into four seemingly unending and increasingly apocalyptic chapters.
The Brexit endgame
Domestically, the year was dominated by the Conservative party successfully externalising its bitter divisions on trade. They have never, in their whole history, not been fighting about trade: trade laws are to the Tory party what ownership of the Queen Vic is to EastEnders.
Theresa May was always only a placeholder prime minister, something that would appear to make about as much sense as using a slice of Victoria sponge as a bookmark. At the time of going to press, she had survived a vote of no confidence from Tory MPs, and there was the general impression that European leaders had agreed to end freedom of movement just to stop her from visiting them. Throughout the year, Boris Johnson has maintained that dishevelled, confused look of the people at the end of a disaster movie being ferried to the ambulances. He resigned as foreign secretary in July, barking “Chequers is dead” as if he were in an Agatha Christie novel and had just discovered the body of the butler at the bottom of the stairs. Johnson has promised a bonfire of EU regulations, a teetering one, without fencing and namby-pamby safety glasses, so that we can wipe the drifting cinders from our newly liberated eyes screaming, “Fuck you, Brussels! Maybe I want to be blind!” I look forward to a UK without EU red tape, and vegans weeping in supermarkets that resemble a cross between a botanical freak show and a fruit-and-veg hospice.
I say, let’s forget the worries of Brexit for a week or two, and just enjoy our last Christmas with running water. Brexit has many downsides, but I think it will be nice for the Irish to watch a British famine. Personally I look forward to a new age where the London Christmas lights won’t be turned on by vacuous celebrities, but by someone found guilty of “talking foreign” and sentenced to complete the circuit. A time where we no longer guess the fluctuations of the market, but our high priests stare into polished heads, newly bald from radiation sickness, and interpret the patterns cast by the light of flickering sewer-fat candles.
Paradoxically, I think Brexit will actually lead to less nationalism: economic collapse meaning that borders lose all their current toxicity, as they’re constantly redrawn in a never-ending struggle between regional warlords, antibiotic-resistant microbes and organ-harvesting cyborgs. Our children will have less inclination to dwell on skin colour as they’ll be preoccupied with appeasing the whims of some pitiless, scab-encrusted Cyclops waving a horse’s hoof nailed to a broomstick, roaring for fresh meat as he plays his three-note national anthem on a ribcage xylophone.
It is at times like those that we will remember the work of Dominic Raab, who resigned in November, having decided that he could not endorse a deal that he himself had negotiated. Raab didn’t want to be Brexit secretary, but he didn’t have the negotiating skills to decline the job. When Raab took over, I was heartened by the thought that negotiations were being handled by someone with the air of an embattled leisure centre manager, who could be outmanoeuvred by a statue of Stephen Hawking. Surely better withdrawal terms have been negotiated during prison sex. Much of the Brexit discourse has revolved around people who seem inbred telling us that diversity is bad, but there don’t seem to be any easy solutions. In a way, I envy the touching optimism of people who feel that another referendum might clear up all this bad feeling once and for all.
The Labour party somehow managed to achieve a Brexit position more incoherent than a government of opportunists at war with itself. There is definitely something odd about Labour supporting free movement for goods and not, well, labour. Meanwhile, May tried to attack Jeremy Corbyn’s handling of antisemitism while in the middle of the Windrush scandal, which was like Pol Pot complaining about gender balance in the films of Martin Scorsese. Corbyn has mastered a lot of things, but strangely not saying shit just to get elected. Mate, say some shit just to get elected: it’s really your only job right now. This needs to go to the top of your to-do list, not somewhere down below “fix the spare room door”.
And yet, he has undoubtedly been travestied by a press who must somehow contrive to terrify Middle England with a man who looks as if he celebrates New Year’s Eve by edging the lawn. Corbyn was attacked in August after the Daily Mail printed pictures of him laying a wreath for some Palestinian martyrs. Corbyn argued that, just because he was near the graves of terrorists, didn’t mean he was honouring terrorists. Personally, I’m surprised our politicians find the time to lay so many wreaths when not one of them has poured liquor on the ground for Tupac.
Perhaps some idea of how Britain intends to deal with the post-Brexit world is encapsulated in the Dickensian figure of the secretary of state for international trade, Dr Liam Fox, a man for whom Another Day, Another Dollar means the proposed minimum wage in our trade agreement with the US. You might wonder how a former doctor can cheerfully promote arms sales. Luckily, Liam’s brain has plenty of experience hosting seemingly irreconcilable contradictions: such as believing we should all stand on our own two feet, while claiming expenses of three pence for a 100-metre car journey in 2012. Liam Fox manages to be a grotesque moral nihilist and yet, somehow, not even the worst Dr Fox. Like me, he was raised on an Irish Catholic council estate in Scotland. It’s these sliding-doors moments where I have to thank alcoholism for denying me the focus to become a genocidal sociopath.
Yet perhaps the clearest signpost to post-Brexit Britain this year lay in Boris Johnson, and later Prince Andrew, advocating the procurement of a new Royal Yacht. Andrew said that, for British exports, it would be a tool in the bag – despite having never used a tool, or carried a bag. There is no doubt that having Prince Andrew on such a boat could boost Britain’s reputation, provided it never docks.
Of course it’s hardly the first ship the royals have had: that burned up entering the atmosphere after their journey here from their home planet, Azeroth 9. But how do you respond to the monarchy asking for a £100m boat? The history of European royalty suggests they’re going to be well ahead of any suggestion to “go fuck themselves”. On balance, I say stick with the royal train: we can always add an international dimension just by extending the tracks into the sea.
A Saudi Arabian horror show
The murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi Arabia is another very difficult subject to find the lighter side of, unless someone in the Ecuadorean embassy has clipped the story out and stuck it to the fridge. The 15 Saudi suspects have been banned from entering the UK, which is a shame as the people this hurts the most are the box office staff at Salisbury Cathedral. Turkey wants the murderers tried there, possibly because sticking journalist killers into a Turkish jail will really tidy up the lifers’ wing.
You can imagine that this is all quite surreal for the Saudis; they behead people in public, and starve the children of Yemen. The idea that they would be lambasted for killing a fully grown man in private with no witnesses must seem ridiculous; it would be as if I had got into trouble for saying someone looked like a spoon.
The murder was such a calamitous fuck-up from start to finish, I like to think that it’s got David Davis’s fingerprints all over it. Considering the version of events that the Saudis were willing to push, I’d love to see the ones they rejected. “We regret to inform you that Mr Khashoggi perished while attempting to rape an outboard motor.” They killed Khashoggi with a bone saw. No wonder they need to buy arms: their own weaponry seems to be sourced from the Whoops! shelf at Homebase.
We apparently “share values” with the Saudis. After they behead someone (48 in the first four months of the year), they sometimes crucify the body in the public square for three days. Watching a horror movie in Saudi Arabia must have all the adrenaline buzz of a local council meeting. I’m guessing the most horrifying film you could screen there would be a remake of The Dukes of Hazzard where Daisy Duke drives her own car.
Our government was angry about Khashoggi and sent the Saudis a strongly worded arms invoice. Perhaps it’s unfair to expect Britain to criticise the Saudis. Can we be expected to take the moral high ground when it comes to royal families sanctioning murder? Sadly, the only long-term consequences of Khashoggi being killed will be that, in future, when a Saudi diplomat orders a pizza, the Deliveroo rider will kick it the last few feet to the front door. Despite the long-running, disgraceful and illegal war in Yemen, there is no sign from Britain of a moratorium on weapons sales. So Britain, an international arms dealer, censuring someone for using its products would be as hypocritical as that bit when Willy Wonka rolls his eyes at Augustus Gloop.
Saudi’s war in Yemen struggles to get much coverage here, despite the significant role Britain plays; sometimes it seems that only journalists getting killed will engage the British press. In the US, the worst person you can kill would be a cop; in China, a government official; and in the UK, woe betide you if you touch anyone who’s mastered Pitman shorthand.
Perhaps the saddest part of this whole business is knowing that there are so few British journalists committed enough to get murdered: you could silence most just by breaking the fingers they use to do select all, copy, paste. Nobody’s going to flay you to death just for barking offers of money through the letterboxes of recently bereaved parents, or trawling for offensive tweets with your free hand. Of course, there are a lot of good journalists. Perhaps journalist is now just too broad a term, in much the way the word actor encompasses everyone from Meryl Streep to Sooty.
There’s no point asking how UK arms dealers sleep at night after watching footage from Yemen, as they’ll reply, “Very well: in fact my erection even stops me rolling out of bed.” Yet shouldn’t we, as a society, demand better? If we can set aside the moral element here (and I don’t know that we can, but just as an exercise in trying to recognise the sheer breadth of our current futility, it might prove useful), Britain sees its interests as almost synonymous with an industry that isn’t labour intensive, or environmentally sustainable, and that seems to be riddled with corruption, because it reminds us of what it was like to be powerful.
Trump trumps himself
Of course Donald Trump trundled out in front of the cameras like a corpse on a Segway and announced: “We are with Saudi Arabia, we are staying with Saudi Arabia.” I honestly think that the Republican establishment is just coming to terms with how useful Trump is – realising that this troll-doll King Lear, who looks like something you’d pick off a baking tray after cooking pizza above it, can say the things that they themselves would like, or find useful to say, but can’t because of some vestigial attachment to decency. The Republicans’ current attitude to Trump is of turning a blind eye to your racist builder because you just need to get the conservatory finished.
Trump has not refashioned the GOP in his own image. He has achieved something more significant: he has managed to maintain a semantic distance from the Republican party despite cheerfully delivering its agenda. Meanwhile, the Democratic establishment has chosen to mirror his attachment to nepotism, entitlement and conspiracy theory – not that the conspiracy theory is necessarily invalid. Trump might, I suppose, be a Russian spy: it would certainly explain why he can’t speak English. It’s not that he’s normalising his own behaviour; it’s that, by comparison, he’s normalising that of dreadful people everywhere. Jared Kushner, a bloodless, lipless demon, a dependent clause of the Anti-Life Equation who could be thrown into any Edgar Allan Poe adaptation and trusted to improvise, looks merely emo in comparison.
The racial animus that Trump has cynically aggravated saw his supporters protesting Nike’s Colin Kaepernick advert in September. The Nike swoosh is now the sound their products make when they go on fire. One patriot filmed himself destroying his Nike clothing by cutting off the top couple of inches from his socks. Instead of destroying the clothing, he’s created an additional, free set of Nike sweatbands.
What does it say about our times that we’re expected to look for moral guidance to corporations like Nike, whose brand message of “Just do it” started out as a looped PA announcement in their Vietnamese trainer factory. I’ve always been wary of Nike – I think because their single tick logo is so reminiscent of the one used in my youth for Bob a Job: just a glimpse of a trainer and I’m back in short trousers, fibre-glassing that pensioner’s loft for a shiny 50 pence piece. (If you’re interested it was 10p for the insulating, 40p for wearing the shorts.)
Despite Trump’s rage, the taking-a-knee protests have continued. It’s odd, in most cultures going down on a knee is considered respectful: personally, I expect either a proposal or a medley of hits from Oklahoma. You have to hand it to the president; it shows a certain ambition to try to undermine the idea of protest in a country that was founded by, well, Protestants. Trump has tried to make this about respect for a flag I very much doubt he could draw from memory, and for military service that he studiously avoided.
Of course the NFL players are not actually protesting the flag. That would be as pointless as arguing with a sock, screaming at a table cloth, or a whole bunch of other stuff Trump probably does on a daily basis. The protest was originally about racial justice, and black people being shot dead by the police. You have to ask yourself how abusive a relationship has to be if even kneeling in silence is too provocative, how you are valued in a country where even the statement that your life matters ignites furious dissent.
There is an obvious misogyny to the Trump administration, and the president no doubt has many supporters whose idea of foreplay consists of dropping a rope ladder down a well. This was highlighted by the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court, despite a confirmation hearing where he unspooled like a Columbo villain, bellowing endlessly about his love of beer. Trump ordered an FBI probe during the hearing, an investigation that was concluded with the speed of an airplane edit of CSI Miami. An investigation that ranged from the FBI agent looking at himself in the mirror and noting that Judge Kavanaugh wasn’t at that moment raping him, all the way through to noting that he hadn’t raped anyone during his time on television being questioned by senators.
With Kavanaugh now on the bench, the irony for American women is that huge amounts of beer will soon become their only means of abortion. Should he be any kind of judge? There’s an argument that the very last thing you want to hand to any man accused of sex crimes is a hammer, but then again maybe we need his hands where we can see them. Still, it certainly is a very scary time for young men in America. Especially the ones aged 10 that Trump has put in cages.
A climate of fear
At least Trump, looking like a cross between Dr Frankenstein’s first attempt and a tiebreak dinner for the contestants on I’m A Celebrity, came up with the solution to politicians only ever making short-term policies: he made sure there will only be a short term. This year he appointed a former energy lobbyist as head of the environmental protection agency, and announced his intention to change regulations that prohibited new coal burning plants. My guess is that the only concession Republicans plan to make to global warming will be to change the lyrics of America The Beautiful to “…from sea to boiling sea”.
Climate catastrophe is imminent. Climate change could decimate pollinating species, leading to a world starved of fruit and vegetables. The best way to alert the world to that danger is to hold the next climate conference in Coatbridge, a town so short of fibre many residents can only shit successfully with the aid of a corkscrew. Perhaps we should try to look on the bright side. The colossal internet servers that provide the architecture for the modern world’s de-socialisation are based above the Arctic Circle. Should they burn out through lack of natural cooling, maybe people will look up from their phones and withered genitalia to once more make eye contact.
The death of the planet seems almost too big to take in, doesn’t it? The real tragedy is not that we can’t prevent it. The real tragedy, I think, lies in the fact that we can. There are a lot of things we can change through political action, some small, some large, that would add up to saving the Earth.
Consider again the plight of the children starving in Yemen. It’s a hard thing to consider. It’s OK to admit that, I think – that it’s hard to empathise: you don’t know much about it, you have your own plight, and it’s a difficult thing to think about. To consider that, in a world that has pub lunches, wristwatches, golden retrievers, the novels of Donna Tartt, the music of Kendrick Lamar, flumes and The Amazing Spider-Man, there is still a plight where you starve to death, as a child, for no reason.
I mean, there is a reason, that I suppose has somehow made itself too obvious to mention. The reason is that some people are addicted to money and power, many of them pathologically so, and we let them do what they like. In our name, and with our taxes, we let them kill who they like in the service of their bored, baroque perversity, because we don’t care enough to stop them. We cannot seem to rouse ourselves, even as they move to turn the world into a consuming flame. We are running out of time to save the children of Yemen, and ourselves – and yet we could still, in theory, be redeemed. Consider the plight of the satirist.

Every year, as autumn turns to winter and ocean temperatures off Massachusetts drop below 10C (50F), dead, dying and stricken sea turtles wash up on the shores of Cape Cod as those shelled reptiles that have failed to migrate south start to die in the chilly waters.
In the 1980s, the number of sea turtles stranded on the shores of Cape Cod every year averaged in the dozens. That average went up through the 1990s and 2000s, but over the past decade it has risen dramatically: 2014 saw more than 1,200 turtles make landfall. This year, more than 790 sea turtles have washed up on Cape Cod so far. Some 720 of those are Kemp’s ridley sea turtles, a critically endangered species that nests on the shores of the much warmer Gulf of Mexico.
It is an event unmatched in magnitude anywhere else in the world.
Those who study sea turtles say part of the reason that annual strandings are up in Massachusetts is that efforts to conserve and boost Kemp’s ridley populations have been successful. But the other part is that the Gulf of Maine is rapidly warming in the face of climate change and proving to be a more hospitable environment for turtles than it used to be, drawing them in larger numbers and resulting in them staying longer into the year.
“It’s warm water now,” said Bob Prescott, the director of the Massachusetts Audubon Society’s Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary on Cape Cod.
The Mass Audubon tracks turtle strandings and is on the frontline of turtle rescue. “What we don’t think they understand is the change in the seasons. These are tropical and sub-tropical turtles and I don’t think they understand the change in season, cold fronts and the water getting colder and colder,” Prescott said.
The Gulf of Maine, which the Cape Cod peninsula juts into like a flexing arm, is warming faster than 99% of the world’s waters. This year marked the gulf’s third-warmest year on record. The warming is responsible for a boom in the lobster industry in Maine and has invited new fish species, such as the black sea bass, to the area. But for turtles, it has proved dangerous.
“It’s actually a good foraging habitat for them, really,” said Kate Sampson, the sea turtle stranding and disentanglement coordinator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office in Gloucester, Massachusetts. “It’s just unfortunate that it brings them right into this area that has a trap.”
That trap is Cape Cod, which many sea turtles counterintuitively have to swim north and then east to get around in order to flee to warmer waters when winter approaches.
“Cape Cod Bay we often call a deadly bucket,” said Tony LaCasse, the New England Aquarium’s spokesperson. As turtles swim north, they run into colder water “and their instinct tells them something is wrong … their instinct tells them to retreat back into the shallow warmer water of the bay and wait it out. But the problem is it’s the end of the season and there’s no way to get out”.
Kemp’s ridley turtles begin their lives on beaches on the Gulf of Mexico. The few that survive the mad dash from their eggs to the water and the predators of the shallows settle down for the first few years of their lives in sargassum, floating forests of seaweed that offer safety to the tiny adolescent turtles. The Gulf Stream carries sargassum north and it is believed that the turtles washing up on Massachusetts’ coast – which are largely between two and four years old according to Sampson – are exploring a coastal habitat for the first time.
Kara Dodge, a research scientist who focuses on sea turtles at Boston’s New England Aquarium, said beyond the Gulf of Maine’s warming, changes to ocean circulation patterns due to climate change could also affect the magnitude of stranding events by bringing more young sea turtles up from the Gulf of Mexico into the western Atlantic.
If climate change continues as expected, she said, “the prediction is that we will continue to see these high-stranding events, hundreds of animals, for the foreseeable future”.
Cold-stunning events sometimes affect sea turtles elsewhere, such as along the Gulf coast off Florida and Texas, but they are generally short-lived, the result of a sudden cold snap. The challenge in Massachusetts, researchers say, is that turtles washing up on shore have largely been exposed to long-term hypothermia.
The large-scale turtle stranding events that Massachusetts has seen in recent years have resulted in the rise of a large, complex network of rescuers working to save as many turtles as possible.
Employees of the Massachusetts Audubon Society and an army of volunteers patrol Cape Cod’s northern beaches in November and December looking for stranded turtles. Cold-stunned turtles recovered on Cape Cod are then driven to the New England Aquarium’s sea turtle hospital in Quincy, near Boston, where hypothermic, emaciated and often sick turtles are rewarmed, treated and rehabilitated. The process usually takes months.
The sea turtle hospital in Quincy has treated more than 400 turtles so far this year. However, it has struggled to keep up with the sharp rise in strandings and moves stabilised turtles to treatment facilities elsewhere in the country when it reaches capacity.
Edward Filangeri is a volunteer pilot who helps the organisation Turtles Fly Too to move turtles from Massachusetts to other facilities. Every year since 2014, Filangeri has flown his single-engine aircraft up from New York’s Long Island, where he lives, to Massachusetts to pick up turtles packed in banana boxes and ferry them south. By flying during November and December he has to contend with winter weather while also working to keep the temperature in his small aircraft turtle-friendly.
“When we get the temperature just right they want to start swimming and I know we’re doing a good job when I hear a lot of cardboard rubbing in the back of the plane,” he said. 
Those working to save the turtles say every bit of help they can give is worth it.
“Personally I spend a lot of my time doing this and the network spends a lot of their time doing this because we all believe that this does make a difference,” said Sampson, the Noaa turtle stranding and disentanglement coordinator. “These are an endangered species, we have to do all we can to help recover their population.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/26/climate-change-sea-turtles-massachusetts

Write a year in review, and what first springs to mind is American nihilism in the form of Donald Trump, mass shootings and the opioid epidemic. In Britain it’s the Brexit quagmire and rolling political crises, and in Australia it’s the palpable disgust at the political class as they roll prime ministers, lock children up in brutal offshore detention camps, impregnate staffers, and treat their female colleagues with disdain. 
Even if on a personal level things are going well, it is now pretty much accepted that we live in the worst of times.
If 2017 was about fear (this Trump guy, what could he do?), 2018 was about learning to live in that fear. The edges of 2017’s anxiety were blunted. We were no longer surprised at the increasingly bizarre and dangerous tone of global politics. Instead, anxiety gave way to jadedness, with a side of depression. The year had vibes of a bad hangover.
If we were unsure about it at the start of the decade, we knew it now: the planet is on fire and there are no adults in the room who want to put it out. Even the drugs of this era – benzos and opiates – speak of futility and surrender. In 2018 it seems easier to see the darkness than the light.
But there was light. Good things happened in this year. And maybe part of the resistance, part of the thing that could rouse us from this jadedness, is naming and celebrating those good things.
The two areas where a sense of futility had crept in – gun control in the US, and the climate debate – where suddenly given a new jolt of life by teenagers.
The kids of Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school who survived a gun massacre at their school in February, reignited the gun control debate with a sense of urgency and anger that had been missing.
These kids are 100% gutsy. In the midst of their own personal trauma, they demanded a national rethink to America’s gun addiction knowing that they would be labelled crisis actors, have to come up against the powerful National Rifle Association and have their own personal safety imperilled by conspiracy theorists and gun nuts.
Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school student Emma González gave the best political speech of the year – calling BS on previous limp efforts to pass gun control legislation.
In 2018 if the penny hadn’t dropped already, then it was obvious to young people everywhere that older generations had failed them royally on so many fronts. Instead of apathy, the kids got angry and organised.
In Australia in November, there was a massive school walkout over climate change inaction, in a protest organised and lead by teenagers. And young people in Britain are demanding a second referendum over a Brexit vote that will limit their future opportunities.
The revelations published in the Observer about data breaches at Facebook on an industrial scale (the profiles of more than 50 million individuals were harvested) led millions of users – particularly in Europe – to delete their profiles. 
2018 was Facebook’s annus horribilis. After appearing at a congressional hearing in Washington to answer questions about Russian meddling in US elections, Facebook’s chief, Mark Zuckerberg, admitted: “One of my greatest regrets in running the company is that we were slow in identifying the Russian information operations in 2016. We have kicked off an investigation … I imagine we’ll find some things.” 
But the reputational damage and erosion of public trust in Facebook may never be healed.
How is that good news? With more (non-fake news) information about what goes on at Facebook and how our personal information is used, we’re more empowered to make a decision about whether or not to ditch the site.
Prince Harry’s story could have been a tragic one: bereft by the early loss of his mother, the lost years of drinking, partying in Vegas and dressing up as a Nazi … But somehow things righted themselves. After a military career Prince Harry set up the Invictus Games for members of the armed forces with injury and illness, started speaking openly about mental health issues, and fell in love with a black American divorcee, a couple of years older than him.
It was a lovely wedding, and a sign that although the monarchy is built on tradition, it is more open to change than we once thought.
This was a well thought-out, well planned and clearly worded referendum that resulted in an overwhelming majority in Ireland deciding to overturn one of the most restrictive reproductive laws in the western world.
There was a large voter turnout, with only one county (Donegal) voting no to change.
Ireland’s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said after the vote: “Today is a historic day for Ireland. A quiet revolution has taken place, and today is a great act of democracy.
“A hundred years since women gained the right to vote, today we as a people have spoken. 
“And we say that we trust women and respect women to make their own decisions and their own choices.” 
This, of course, is not good news for everyone – particularly investors. But for the increasing number of young Australians locked out of the housing market because of insane price rises, a drop in prices in the capitals of Melbourne and Sydney was welcome news.
Supermarkets across Australia banned single use plastic bags, while parts of the US, Taiwan, Canada, Scotland and Britain banned single use plastic straws.
Some of this is led by government, but mostly the initiative is through private companies responding to cues from consumers.
Due to popular shows such as David Attenborough’s Blue Planet we can no longer close our eyes and pretend that plastic just vaporises after we use it. It clogs our oceans and kills marine life.
While parts of the planet, such as California, which was devastated by wildfires, have had their hottest summer on record, the move against single-use plastic may seem like trying to stop a tsunami with a surfboard. But the change in collective consciousness is heartening. 
The feel-good story of the year united all if us in hope, then joy at the rescue of 12 young soccer players and their coach.
It also came at a time of unrelenting bleakness in the news cycle. Seeing global efforts to rescue the boys made me think “maybe we’re not totally doomed as a species”.
A few honourable mentions for game-changers in pop culture are:
The most successful comedian of 2018 inspired thousands of think pieces and global acclaim after her show Nanette was screened on Netflix.
In an era where misogyny is rising to the surface like scum forming on boiled milk, we needed Gadsby – someone smart, funny and deadly serious – to explain the structural problems in art and life that lead to the #MeToo movement. Watching her in full flight felt bracing and absolutely necessary.
The clip for This is America with its guns and casual violence (a gospel choir gunned down mid song) was, like Nanette, the shock we needed to properly see where we are right now. The place ain’t pretty, even if the music is good. 
There is a pretty binary narrative to break-up songs: you’re either saying sorry or “fuck you” to an ex.
Ariana instead this year said thank you to her exes and paid tribute to what they taught her.

At the same time, retiring California governor Jerry Brown likened the fight against climate change to the fight against Nazism during the second world war, saying: “We have an enemy … perhaps very much devastating in a similar way.”
Both men appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press. The billionaire former New York mayor said: “It would be a lot more helpful if we had a climate champion rather than a climate denier in the White House.
“You know, I’ve always thought Trump has a right to his opinions. But he doesn’t have a right to his own facts.”
A vocal critic of the coal industry, Bloomberg, whose fortune is estimated at $40bn and who spent $100m on his last mayoral race, has said he plans to make climate change a leading issue in the 2020 race, whether or not he runs.
“Any candidate for federal office better darn well have a plan to deal with the problem that the Trump science advisers say could, basically, end this world,” he said. “I can tell you one thing, I don’t know whether I’m going to run or not, but I will be out there demanding that anybody that’s running has a plan.”
Bloomberg paid his latest visit to Iowa, site of the first voting in the presidential election cycle, earlier this month. Joining him in a call on Sunday to make climate change a national priority was Brown, a presidential hopeful in the past now standing down after 16 years at the head of the Golden state. He said wildfires in California should serve as a wake-up call.
“We see it in the fear in people’s eyes, as they fled, many elderly who died,” Brown told NBC. “This is real, it’s dangerous. And we’ve got to wake up the country, wake up the world.”
Brown, one of the few governors to have implemented climate policy, compared the challenge of galvanizing public opinion to that faced by Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1941.
“It took Roosevelt many, many years to get America willing to go into world war two and fight the Nazis,” he said. “Well, we have an enemy, though different, but perhaps very much devastating in a similar way.”
Brown echoed Bloomberg’s criticism of the president.
“He is very convinced of his position,” Brown said of Trump. “And his position is that there’s nothing abnormal about the fires in California or the rising sea level or all the other incidents of climate change.”
Brown contended that US economic wellbeing, conventionally trumpeted by the Trump administration, was the key issue on which Americans should vote.
“We’ve got to get off this idea, ‘It’s the economy, stupid,” he said. “No, it’s the environment.”
Seventy per cent of Americans believe “global warming” is happening, according to polling cited by NBC, but only 57% believe climate change is caused by humans.
A rejection of the human role in climate change is a central plank for political leaders who refuse to back environmental regulations and other policies to confront the problem.
“The world is getting hotter,” Bloomberg said. “There are bigger storms than ever before; there are droughts where we used to have floods and vice-versa; our water is getting less; and we’ve got to do something about it.
“The challenge is what we do about it. And the opportunity is the value of what we do.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/30/michael-bloomberg-slams-trump-climate-change

But, as I discovered on a recent visit, there’s a new attraction in town: the cannabis shops peppered through its downtown since Washington state legalised recreational marijuana.
They couldn’t be further from the smoke-filled coffeeshops of Amsterdam: this is very much America does weed. Show your passport at the door and you’re waved into a cheery space filled with brightly lit glass cabinets displaying their wares. Yes, there’s row after row of the little packets of greenish stuff you’d expect, with enticing names such as “Pink Lemonade” and “Chocolope”. But lots of other cannabis-infused goodies too: vape pens, pre-rolled joints and “edibles”, from brownies to jelly sweets to drinks.
Budtenders are on hand to “talk flower” with discerning pot veterans, and chat with canna-curious tourists about the basics, such as the difference between the psychoactive THC, which produces a “mind high”, and the non-psychoactive CBD, which results in a healing “body high”. (Me: “But what’s the difference between a mind and a body high?” Patient budtender: “One makes your mind feel high, the other your body.”)
If the goal of cannabis prohibition was to reduce social harm, it’s been an unalloyed failure
It was fascinating talking to Washingtonians about what they’ve got right and wrong in regulating an industry from scratch. And as I tucked into my first vegan mockburger on the plane home – nicely pink inside, my tastebuds honestly couldn’t distinguish it from the real thing – it left me thinking, why are we so willing to wield the nanny state when it comes to cannabis but not something like meat, which does real social harm?
If the goal of cannabis prohibition was to reduce social harm, it’s been an unalloyed failure. As even President Obama admitted, it’s safer than alcohol: it’s much less addictive than smoking or drinking. And while overdosing can be a deeply unpleasant, frightening experience, as the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd found when she consumed a whole chocolate bar that would have been better cut into 16, a fatal overdose is impossible. (There has been a handful of cases in the US where people have attributed extreme violence to ingesting cannabis, but the link between cannabis-induced psychosis and violence remains unproved – and, unlike alcohol, studies suggest smoking cannabis may be associated with lower levels of domestic violence).
Where there are established risks – heavy cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of psychotic disorders – they should be set out so that, as with alcohol, people can make their own decision about whether they’re worth taking.
Banning cannabis doesn’t stop people using – the industry in the US is thought to be worth $40bn a year, much of it black market, and in the UK, 2.2 million people are estimated to have taken cannabis. But a failure to legalise and regulate it makes it less safe than it need be – users have no idea of the psychoactive strength of what they’re buying on the black market, in stark contrast to the Seattle shops, which list the THC levels of every product. Prohibition also results in millions in lost tax revenue: California, the largest state to legalise recreational cannabis, collected more than $60m in cannabis taxes in the first quarter of 2018.
Prohibition has had hugely unjust consequences. It disproportionately snares people of colour into the criminal justice system: in the UK, black people are around half as likely to report using drugs last year, but nine times more likely to be stopped and searched for drug possession and almost 12 times more likely to be convicted for cannabis possession.
The reason we have prohibition is nothing to do with preventing social harm
This should inform the way cannabis is legalised. In some places in the US, legalisation has been accompanied by expunging of historic marijuana misdemeanours, which can make it difficult to get a job or housing, from criminal records. Oakland in California has even reserved a proportion of its cannabis permits for those with a cannabis conviction in an attempt to combat the capture of the burgeoning weed industry by white, cash-rich businessmen. (Because cannabis remains federally illegal, it’s almost impossible for cannabis producers to secure bank loans.)
But the reason we have prohibition is nothing to do with preventing social harm. It’s about the queasiness politicians feel about legalising something that they perceive still has a huge social stigma attached, even though the public is now firmly in favour of legalisation.
Which brings me to the vegan burger. Take a step back and it seems bonkers that our political leaders hold firm on outlawing weed but seem loth to invoke the nanny state where it’s most needed: in avoiding catastrophic climate change. We won’t succeed in this unless we persuade people to fly less and eat less meat and dairy.
That’s a gargantuan task, made harder by the demotivating knowledge that your own efforts are only likely to matter if others match them. Yet the most politicians do is half-heartedly conjure up a few green taxes in the hope they’ll nudge people in the sort of right direction. But they’re not effective enough, and also hit the poorest most.
Time for the nanny state to get more radical. We should start by banning altogether things that have literally no function, such as bottled water in a country where it’s actually safer to drink tap water. And take a leaf out of wartime Britain – climate change is no less existential a threat – and ration activities such as flying and eating meat. If you’re not that bothered about a rare steak, you can sell your coupons to someone who can’t live without a good ribeye and feel smug as you tuck into your environmentally friendly, fake-meat alternatives.
It’s perhaps not surprising that prohibition is based on social prissiness rather than rationality. But, my goodness, we’re missing a trick. We should follow Canada, which just became the second country to legalise recreational cannabis. And go after – if not banning, then rationing – the stuff that does society real, undeniable harm.

Almost 200 nations were set to meet in Poland for two weeks, aiming to hammer out a vital agreement to turn the carbon-cutting vision set in Paris in 2015 into reality. Moves to rapidly ramp up action would be another key goal, with current pledges leaving the world on track for a disastrous 3C of warming.
The negotiations will take place against a background of ominous news: the past four years have been the hottest on record and global emissions were rising again, when they need to fall by half by 2030. Climate action must be increased fivefold to limit warming to the 1.5C scientists advise, according to the UN.
The political backdrop contains challenges as well, with climate change denial from the US president, Donald Trump, and attacks on the UN process from Brazil’s incoming Bolsonaro administration. The hosting of the summit by a coal-friendly Polish government further worries some observers. But the EU’s new intention to become climate neutral and the plummeting cost of renewable energy have been positives, while a year of extreme weather was anticipated to focus minds.
“We are clearly the last generation that can change the course of climate change, but we are also the first generation with its consequences,” said Kristalina Georgieva, the CEO of the World Bank. The bank announced on Monday that its record $100bn (£78bn) of climate funding from 2021-2025 would for the first time be split equally between projects to cut emissions and those protecting people from the floods, storms and droughts that global warming is making worse.
In recent years, just 5% of global funding has gone on protection, but 2018 has seen climate impacts hit hard, with heatwaves and wildfires in Europe and California and huge floods in India, Japan and east Africa. “We are already seeing the devastating impact of climate change,” Georgieva told the Guardian. “We strongly believe that action ought to go both on mitigation and on adaptation.”
“Climate extremes are the new normal,” said Prof Patrick Verkooijen, the CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, in the Netherlands. “The climate debate can no longer only be about the causes – it also needs to focus on how billions of people at risk can rapidly adapt.
Rich nations have promised $100bn a year by 2020 to help poorer countries adapt to climate change and develop clean energy. Negotiators in Poland would have to bring the two blocs together with firm agreement on how the promise would be fulfilled.
Gebru Jember Endalew, the chair of the 47-strong Least Developed Countries Group, said: “We represent almost one billion people, the people who are least responsible for climate change but among those most vulnerable to its effects. The longer poor countries have to wait [for funding], the larger the cost will become.”
The negotiators in Poland must also produce a rulebook governing how action pledged under the Paris agreement was tracked and reported to ensure all nations play their part.
“Fair and effective rules for accounting must be established, with special responsibilities for the big emitters such as the US and Europe but also China and India,” said Prof Johan Rockström, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “While defining a rulebook sounds boring, it is in fact essential.”
The role of the Polish hosts will be crucial and the deputy energy minister Michał Kurtyka has said it would focus on using forests to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, electric vehicles and ensuring workers in fossil fuel industries were helped into new jobs.
Poland generates 80% of its electricity from coal and the UN summit will take place in a coal mining town, Katowice. The Polish government has also allowed two coal companies to sponsor the summit.
“Having major coal companies as climate summit sponsors sends the worst possible signal at the worst possible time,” said Robert Cyglicki, Greenpeace’s director in Central and Eastern Europe. “It would be like Philip Morris sponsoring a health summit where a cigarette ban is supposed to be agreed. We will know this was a successful summit if coal companies regret sponsoring it.”
Many nations remain firmly committed to climate action, particularly France and China. But the UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned last week that the rise of populism was undermining the political will of some countries to work with others. “We have more and more nationalist approaches being popular and winning elections,” he said. “This has led in my opinion to a lack of political will.”
“Every day, we witness the effects of the changing climate on poor and vulnerable people around the world,” said Adriana Opromolla, at NGO Caritas Internationalis. “Transformation is possible, but political will is needed to make it happen.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/03/we-are-last-generation-that-can-stop-climate-change-un-summit

When Shell’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, laid out an ambitious long-term carbon target last year, he acknowledged the role played by a resolution on carbon targets submitted by Dutch activist shareholders Follow This.
Follow This is hoping to use investor power to push other major oil and gas firms into setting similar goals. 
The organisation has bought shares in several major fossil fuel groups and has submitted two resolutions to the European firms BP and Shell. It will file identical resolutions with the US companies Chevron and ExxonMobil later this week if other parties do not submit a similar demand.
Investors at the firms’ annual general meetings next year will be asked to vote in favour of them publishing climate change targets in alignment with the international goal of keeping the rise in global temperatures well below 2C.
Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, said: “Targets should be on the agenda of every oil company, given that the oil industry can make or break the Paris climate agreement.”
The group has little chance of winning by persuading a majority of the four companies’ shareholders to back the resolution but it believes the tactic can put public and investor pressure on firms.
Although backed by the Church of England and major pension funds, the resolution filed for Shell’s AGM on carbon targets failed in 2017, with 94% of shareholders voting against and 5% abstaining.
When Van Beurden set the firm’s carbon goals last year, however, he said the firm had seen a kernel of truth in the proposal.
Van Baal said: “We expect that the investors who supported the Shell resolution will also support the resolution with the other companies and that more investors will start to participate.”
The resolutions will ask firms to set goals that account for their biggest contribution to global warming – the emissions produced when consumers burn the oil, which are known as scope 3 emissions. That is considered an important step beyond oil companies just cutting emissions from their own operations.
For BP that would mark a significant step up from the carbon curbs its chief executive, Bob Dudley, announced earlier this year, which explicitly ruled out counting emissions from the burning of its products.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/10/bp-faces-shareholder-challenge-over-carbon-targets

Engrained in the scientific method is the process of testing hypotheses with repeatable, falsifiable, and parameter-controlled experiments. Unfortunately for the field of economics, there are certain non-trivial barriers to experimentally tanking the Czechoslovakian economy over and over while controlling for interest rate levels.

These people that are still thinking on the lines of how can we maintain our current living and consumption standards but reduce our pollution are in serious denial
BQEND
Most people on the planet are thinking along the lines of how to improve their living standards - especially in the developing world. The population of the OECD countries is only about 20% of the global population and shrinking as a percentage of the global population. The notion that reducing living standards in the developed world will compensate for improved living standards in the developing world is little other than preposterous.
If you do not recognise this, it is you who is in denial. All this ""green"" austerity nonsense is a blight on actually getting anything on the issue of climate. All is does is generate hostility and it is not hard to see why. It's scientific basis is questionable to say the least and major environmental organisations simply do not subscribe to it.

“Actions speak loudly,” he said, “and as we’ve been hearing, the United States has been a powerhouse … in different approaches to energy security while seeking emissions reductions.
“Australia has a technology-neutral approach to emissions reduction. It’s important that we do so, we need to pull every lever to reduce emissions. We need to be open to innovation and new technologies providing multiple pathways for energy security and emissions reductions.”

A study in Nature Climate Change from 2015 states, “There is no NET [Negative Emissions Technology] (or combination of NETs) currently available that could be implemented to meet the <2°C target without significant impact on either land, energy, water, nutrient, albedo or cost, and so ‘plan A’ must be to immediately and aggressively reduce GHG emissions.” In another study from 2016, researchers Kevin Anderson and Glen Peters concluded “Negative-emission technologies are not an insurance policy, but rather an unjust and high-stakes gamble.

The mass extinction, known as the “great dying”, occurred around 252m years ago and marked the end of the Permian geologic period. The study of sediments and fossilized creatures show the event was the single greatest calamity ever to befall life on Earth, eclipsing even the extinction of the dinosaurs 65m years ago.
Up to 96% of all marine species perished while more than two-thirds of terrestrial species disappeared. The cataclysm was so severe it wiped out most of the planet’s trees, insects, plants, lizards and even microbes.
Scientists have theorized causes for the extinction, such as a giant asteroid impact. But US researchers now say they have pinpointed the demise of marine life to a spike in Earth’s temperatures, warning that present-day global warming will also have severe ramifications for life on the planet.
“It was a huge event. In the last half a billion years of life on the planet, it was the worst extinction,” said Curtis Deutsch, an oceanography expert who co-authored the research, published on Thursday, with his University of Washington colleague Justin Penn along with Stanford University scientists Jonathan Payne and Erik Sperling.
The researchers used paleoceanographic records and built a model to analyse changes in animal metabolism, ocean and climate conditions. When they used the model to mimic conditions at the end of the Permian period, they found it matched the extinction records.
According to the study, this suggests that marine animals essentially suffocated as warming waters lacked the oxygen required for survival. “For the first time, we’ve got a whole lot of confidence that this is what happened,” said Deutsch. “It’s a very strong argument that rising temperatures and oxygen depletion were to blame.”
The great dying event, which occurred over an uncertain timeframe of possibly hundreds of years, saw Earth’s temperatures increase by around 10C (18F). Oceans lost around 80% of their oxygen, with parts of the seafloor becoming completely oxygen-free. Scientists believe this warming was caused by a huge spike in greenhouse gas emissions, potentially caused by volcanic activity.
The new research, published in Science, found that the drop in oxygen levels was particularly deadly for marine animals living closer to the poles. Experiments that varied oxygen and temperature levels for modern marine species, including shellfish, corals and sharks, helped “bridge the gap” to what the model found, Payne said.
“This really would be a terrible, terrible time to be around on the planet,” he added. “It shows us that when the climate and ocean chemistry changes quickly, you can reach a point where species don’t survive. It took millions of years to recover from the Permian event, which is essentially permanent from the perspective of human timescales.”
Over the past century, the modern world has warmed by around 1C due to the release of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, rather than from volcanic eruptions.
This warming is already causing punishing heatwaves, flooding and wildfires around the world, with scientists warning that the temperature rise could reach 3C or more by the end of the century unless there are immediate, radical reductions in emissions.
At the same time, Earth’s species are undergoing what some experts have termed the “sixth great extinction” due to habitat loss, poaching, pollution and climate change.
“It does terrify me to think we are on a trajectory similar to the Permian because we really don’t want to be on that trajectory,” Payne said. “It doesn’t look like we will warm by around 10C and we haven’t lost that amount of biodiversity yet. But even getting halfway there would be something to be very concerned about. The magnitude of change we are currently experiencing is fairly large.”
Deutsch said: “We are about a 10th of the way to the Permian. Once you get to 3-4C of warming, that’s a significant fraction and life in the ocean is in big trouble, to put it bluntly. There are big implications for humans’ domination of the Earth and its ecosystems.”
Deutsch added that the only way to avoid a mass aquatic die-off in the oceans was to reduce carbon emissions, given there is no viable way to ameliorate the impact of climate change in the oceans using other measures.
The research group “provide convincing evidence that warmer temperatures and associated lower oxygen levels in the ocean are sufficient to explain the observed extinctions we see in the fossil record”, said Pamela Grothe, a paleoclimate scientist at the University of Mary Washington.
“The past holds the key to the future,” she added. “Our current rates of carbon dioxide emissions is instantaneous geologically speaking and we are already seeing warming ocean temperatures and lower oxygen in many regions, currently affecting marine ecosystems.
“If we continue in the trajectory we are on with current emission rates, this study highlights the potential that we may see similar rates of extinction in marine species as in the end of the Permian.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/06/global-warming-extinction-report-the-great-dying

After the most violent protests in Paris for half a century, the French president has been forced to postpone a planned eco-tax rise on fuel, showing how ecological measures can have explosive consequences if there is any suggestion they are being used to “greenwash” austerity.
Other leaders will need better timing and a far defter political touch before they introduce similar measures to reduce carbon emissions.
Dozens of countries and cities have introduced or drawn up plans for carbon taxes to speed the transition from fossil fuels that are warming the planet to increasingly dangerous levels. They are rarely easy to implement. There have also been protests and political backwards steps in Belgium, Tunisia, Algeria and Canada.
Macron has positioned himself as one of the pioneers. He has championed the Paris climate agreement and promised to make France an example of how economies can grow as they cut carbon emissions. In contrast to the me-first-ism of Donald Trump, the French leader’s slogan has been “Make our planet great again”.
According to government officials, this goal was behind the plan to increase petrol prices by four euro cents a litre from January. This, they said, was one of several steps towards France’s commitment to cut carbon emissions by 40% by 2030 and to ban sales of petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040.
The economic and environmental logic is sound. Raising the price of carbon is an essential tool if global warming is to be kept below the dangerous level of 1.5C, according to the recent report by the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change. This year’s Nobel laureate for economics, William Nordhaus, was one of the first advocates of a global carbon tax as the best way to put a true cost on the use of coal, oil and gas. 
It is a matter of justice. Without a carbon tax, the health and pollution costs of cars and trucks are unfairly passed on to society in the form of respiratory problems, congested, dirty streets and an increasingly unstable climate. Fuel taxes are also an incentive for change. As the former Nasa scientist James Hansen has noted: “As long as fossil fuels seem the cheapest energy to the public, they’ll keep using them.”
But while policy wonks across the world agree on the principle of “polluter pays”, Macron has clearly found it hard to convince the French public on two key questions: what they are supposed to be paying for and whether the burden is being fairly shared.
The majority of the hundreds of thousands of gilets jaunes protesters are from low- or middle-income families who are hardest hit by the fuel price rises because they spend a disproportionate share of their incomes on fuel and transport.
They may have found the eco-tax rise easier to stomach if the revenues were then redistributed among the public, a model already used in British Colombia that Justin Trudeau plans to expand throughout Canada.
There would also be less hostility if the revenues were ringfenced for renewable energy, environmental homes or a better healthcare system to deal with the costs of air pollution and rising temperatures. Instead, protesters have been able to argue the tax will be used mainly to cut France’s budget deficit by paying off wealthy creditors, in effect worsening inequality.
Macron has also demonstrated poor timing by announcing a rise in diesel and petrol taxes after a year in which oil prices rose by 23% largely because of Opec limits on production.
“Maybe he should have taken that into account and waited until the price goes down. Or perhaps he should have returned some revenue,” said Bob Ward of the Grantham Institute. Instead of a tax, he said governments could also consider alternatives such as raising standards on vehicles, which has been the approach taken by California. “You have to find the right mechanism.”
It also helps to secure public approval. The city of Boulder in Colorado introduced a carbon tax after a majority of voters cast ballots in favour of the move. Seven US states are also considering similar steps following midterm elections in which many Democrats campaigned on promises of climate action.
In the UK, a carbon tax in the power sector has helped to phase out coal, but the prime minister, Theresa May, appears too politically weak to consider action on fuel. In the most recent budget, the chancellor once again left fuel taxes unchanged, where they have remained since 1999.

Students from Scott Morrison’s southern Sydney electorate of Cook – as well as Townsville, Melbourne and Brisbane – arrived at Parliament House on Wednesday morning to meet with him.
Morrison said he would sit down with the school students.
“I’m always happy to listen. I respect everybody’s views,” he told reporters on Wednesday morning.
“We don’t always have to agree on everything, you know, but we do have to respect each other and we do have to take each other’s views seriously.
“Whether that’s talking about climate, or whether that’s talking about energy, or whether that’s talking about the other difficult issues we’re dealing with in the parliament this week, you’ve got to respect everybody’s views, you can’t run their views down because they have them.”
But one group of 11 students gathered out the back of Parliament House in the hope of speaking to Morrison had not yet had any luck.
Fourteen-year-old Tully Bowtell-Young travelled solo from Townsville for the chance to share her concerns with the prime minister – using her own pocket money to help cover costs.
“I think it’s worthwhile because nothing I have now is going to mean anything if I don’t have a future in this world,” she said.

The striking students want federal policymakers to stop the Adani coalmine and move Australia from fossil fuels to 100% renewable energy.
They also want the government to respond to their 20,000-strong protests that were held across the country last week, says 16-year-old Aisheeya Huq.
“We have been trying so much for the possibility of meeting with [Scott Morrison] but if we don’t get that opportunity after coming so far and going through so much to be here I think we will be a bit disheartened,” she said.
The group of students tried numerous times to call the prime minister’s office but were told they needed to have a prearranged meeting organised – in some instances they were hung up on.

Labor’s John Kennedy had little chance of winning Hawthorn in the inner east ahead of the Andrews’ government’s thumping election victory on 24 November.
Now, the Victorian Electoral Commission has declared the seat for Labor after a large swing against Pesutto.
“Short of a miracle, I can’t see how I could win from here,” Pesutto told ABC Melbourne on Wednesday.
Pesutto admitted “a lot of things” went wrong, that the federal leadership crisis “didn’t help” and conceded many voters were turned off by the party’s social and other policies.
He pointed to his 17-year-old daughter who backed her father’s party, but took part in last week’s climate change protest calling for federal Coalition government action.
“Even in my own family, I can see the challenges we’ve got [as a party],” he said.
The former shadow attorney general was one of two men eyeing the Liberal leadership after Matthew Guy stepped down following the party’s disastrous election result.
The shadow treasurer, Michael O’Brien, is now expected to be the leading candidate when the party meets to elects its new leader on Thursday.
The Greens made history in the seat of Brunswick, with Tim Read claiming victory with a narrow lead of 514 votes on Saturday. The Greens also held the seats of Prahran and Melbourne, but lost Northcote to Labor.

The global population is forecast to reach 9.9 billion by 2050 – a 29% increase – with most of that growth in Africa, where the population is expected to double to 2.6 billion.
Gilbert Houngbo, the president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, said that with 60% of Africa’s young people living in rural areas, global leaders need to prioritise investment in their futures to curb forced migration, feed a growing population and help smallholder farmers – who are facing the added burden of climate change – become not only self-sufficient but profitable.
In an interview with the Guardian, he said: “If today Europe is struggling with economic migration [driven by poverty], can you imagine the extent of migration 10 years down the road with the African population set to double?”
He acknowledged that while 80% of African migration occurs within the continent, migration from Africa to Europe is increasing.
“It’s very simple,” said Houngbo. “If we do not take decisive action now, expect migration levels to double both within Africa and to Europe. That projection makes me very concerned and European nations and UN member states should be thinking about investing in rural transformation.”
The former prime minister of Togo added: “For three years in a row, the state of food security and nutrition report shows that the level of food insecurity and malnutrition has been going up after decades of decreasing.
“If those investments are not there at a time when climate change is also a pressure and when the population is growing then it is very clear that parts of the world will be left facing risk of famine.”
Houngbo – in the UK to give a keynote speech at Chatham House – said a holistic approach is vital to prevent Africa’s young people being forced to migrate to urban areas or other countries because they are economically disadvantaged.
“Investment in sustainable farming is essential for the livelihoods of those in rural communities and for food security but it is not enough to engage the younger generations,” he said.
“That is why we need to look at the bigger picture – the priorities are decent schools, potable water and basic healthcare. I also consider access to WhatsApp to be a basic service. Young people need access to modern technology.”
He said developing renewable energy would also be a consideration as some local grids are not up to the job. “If you cannot charge your cellphone or laptop, it’s difficult to do business.”
Smallholder farms produce 50% of all food calories on 30% of the world’s agricultural land. In sub-Saharan Africa, 80% of all farms are small-scale. Their productivity varies but they are generally characterised by growing subsistence crops and one or two cash crops on a small plot and relying almost exclusively on family labour, with women playing a vital role.
With the right approach, smallholder farms can be turned into profitable businesses that supply local and national markets, generate surpluses and offer communities a pathway out of poverty and hunger, according to Ifad, the UN’s financial institution dedicated to rural areas.
Action is needed by national governments, the development community and private sector partners to create the right conditions to make this possible, said Houngbo. His organisation is due to announce plans for an investment fund for young people in rural areas, available globally, but targeting young people in Africa.
He said the sums would be in the region of $10,000 (£7,835) to $20,000, up to $1m – greater than the sums offered by microfinance institutions, but amounts that young people would find difficult to borrow from a bank.
Ifad also wants to encourage rural startups and smallholder farms to develop resistance to climate change. The number of hungry people globally has risen for the third year in a row because of climate variability.
It is currently field-testing a pilot called Cachet, which operates a hedging mechanism to protects smallholders against price volatility. It is already assisting small-scale producers of cocoa in Nigeria and maize in Senegal and aims to scale up to reach more beneficiaries in low- and middle-income countries.
The scheme protects farmers against selling at a loss. Next year it will expand to use finance schemes to transfer climate-related risks.
Investment in training and empowering women in rural areas is also vital to the transformation of rural economies. Research has shown that if women were to have the same access to agricultural resources as men, about 150 million fewer people would go hungry.
Half of Ifad’s beneficiaries are women who struggle to access finance and land, and face challenges around inheritance and entitlement.
“It’s not just about training the women, it’s about their ability to have a voice in rural life … it is essential they’re part of decision making,” said Houngbo.
“It’s about changing policies and family law so women can attain equal rights. Also, it is one thing to change laws but enforcing them in rural areas can be very tricky if society has not bought into it.”
Irene Nantale, 30, a local entrepreneur from Mashiaga village in Uganda’s eastern Mayuge District, was part of Ifad’s Project for Financial Inclusion in Rural Areas initiative and is testament to what women can achieve with small loans.
Houngbo said her family had been struggling before she joined a savings and credit cooperative in 2013 and used her first loan to buy 50 chickens and a cow.
When Houngbo visited Nantale in May she had 350 chickens, four cows, 12 goats and two employees on her farm. She had also invested some capital in opening a pharmacy in the village, filling a vital gap in local services. She plans to use her savings to send her three children to university.
“We are looking beyond being food secure – we also want to generate income and profits,” explained Houngbo.
The 57-year-old is no stranger to life in a poor farming community. Growing up in rural Togo, he became accustomed to missing meals and combining education with hard labour. Aged 11 he left his village because his father wanted to give him a better education in the capital.
“I lived 240km away but every weekend and in the holidays I would go back to work on the farm. Vacation to us meant farming, it wasn’t a holiday,” said Houngbo.
“I know what it’s like to live on one meal a day. But it is shocking to think that 50 years on that still exists in parts of the world. To me that is unacceptable and every day I have to ask myself if I’m doing as much as I can to help avoid that.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/dec/05/invest-africa-youth-now-before-migration-to-europe-doubles-un-gilbert-houngbo

Cutting fossil fuel burning not only slows global warming but slashes air pollution, which causes millions of early deaths a year, the WHO says. In a report requested by UN climate summit leaders, the WHO says the economic benefits of improved health are more than double the costs of cutting emissions, and even higher in India and China, which are plagued by toxic air.
“The global public health community is getting very impatient,” said María Neira, WHO director of public and environmental health. “If you don’t think you need to take action for the sake of climate change, make sure when you think about the planet you incorporate a couple of lungs, a brain and a heart. It is not just about saving the planet in the future, it is about protecting the health of the people right now.”
The damage caused by coal, oil and gas pollution is “outrageous”, she said. “There are words not included in the documents at [the climate summit]: asthma, lung cancer, stroke, heart disease – they need to be incorporated in all the decision-making processes.”
“Morally, delaying the [clean energy] transition is being responsible for millions of deaths every year,” Neira said. “[Leaders] need to ask themselves how many deaths are [they] willing to accept. When health is taken into account, climate action is an opportunity, not a cost.”
Air pollution is the best known impact of fossil fuel use, and climate change damages health through heatwaves, storms, floods and droughts, increased spread of infectious disease and the destruction of health facilities. Global warming is also damaging crops and reducing their nutritional value, with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization now reporting a rise in the number of hungry people going up after decades of decline.
“We now have scientific evidence that people are suffering and dying from climate change,” said Prof Kristie Ebi, at the University of Washington and lead author on the recent intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) report, that warned that the global temperature rise must be kept to 1.5C to protect hundreds of millions of people from harm. Another major recent report concluded that climate change is already a health emergency.
Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum, at the World Health Organization and also an IPCC report author, said doctors needed to press hard for climate action: “The health profession is the single most trusted profession in the world.” Just 0.5% of multilateral climate finance is currently going to healthcare, he said. Organizations representing more than five million doctors, nurses and public health professionals from 120 countries have issued a call to action to the climate summit in Poland.
“We should no longer be talking about the cost of [cutting emissions], we should talk about the benefits to people’s health of investing in what needs to be done,” Campbell-Lendrum said.
“At the moment we pretend that polluting [fossil] fuels are cheap fuels, only because we don’t include the cost of them to our health and economy.” The IMF estimates these subsidies to the fossil fuel industry to be $5tn a year, more than all governments currently spend on healthcare.
Almost 200 nations are meeting in Katowice, Poland, for two weeks, aiming to turn the carbon-cutting vision set in Paris in 2015 into a reality, as well as increasing the ambition and speed of action and the funding needed.

Scientists said the research showed global warming was already harming people’s lives and was not only a future threat.
Without rapid cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, such heatwaves would happen every other year by mid-century, the Met Office said. Its analysis showed the average UK temperature during June, July and August was more than 2C above pre-industrial levels.
Hundreds more early deaths than usual occurred at the height of the heatwave, while farmers struggled for water and hay and thousands of houses suffered subsidence.
The research was launched at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, and the Met Office’s Prof Peter Stott, who led the work, said: “World leaders should be listening not just to scientists but also to the people who are being affected by extreme weather events right now. They are seeing it with their own eyes and suffering from it. Humanity just won’t be able to cope with the world we are heading for.”
Stott said scientists were making links across the world between extreme weather events and climate change, from heatwaves in Japan to wildfires in California: “We’re seeing it happen again and again across the world. This whole sequence of events would not have happened without climate change.”
Prof Mark Maslin, at University College London, said: “The analysis clearly shows climate change has already changed our weather patterns and is having adverse effects on people’s lives. It is beholden on all governments to take heed of these warnings and start cutting carbon emissions as quick as possible.”
John Sauven, an executive director at Greenpeace UK, said: “The link between climate change and extreme weather used to be a fingerprint, it now looks more like a smoking gun. The science is leaving world leaders nowhere to hide. They are the first generation of political leaders with a clear view of the precipice we’re heading towards and may be the last to be able to swerve away from it.”
The heatwave showed the vulnerability of farming and food security to global warming, said Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers Union. “Our industry is on the forefront of climate change impacts. The summer heatwave was hugely challenging and should be a wake-up call for us all.” She said long-term drought policies were needed, such as making it easier to get planning permission for new reservoirs.
The Met Office analysis used sophisticated computer models to estimate the probability of such a hot summer in the UK in a world with manmade global warming and in a world without it. If humanity’s fossil fuel burning had not more than doubled the CO2 in the atmosphere, there would have been a less than one in 200 chance of the 2018 heat. But in today’s warming world, the probability was one in eight.
The 30-fold increased risk surprised Stott: “It is a large number, but we checked it very carefully.” The methodology used has been peer-reviewed and the new analysis would be, too, but the Met Office said it was important to make the information public as early as possible.
Stott’s team also looked at the Central England temperature record which stretches back to 1659. They found just one summer, 1826, as hot as 2018 in the two centuries up until 1850, when CO2 emissions began to rise fast. In contrast, there have been two other summers just as hot as 2018 in the last two decades, in 2003 and 2006.
An earlier analysis of the summer heat in Europe also found that climate change had increased its risk, though it looked at the hottest three-day periods, not the whole season. Scores of extreme weather events around the world, including droughts and severe rainfalls, have been linked to global warming, including the Storm Desmond downpour that caused extensive severe flooding in the UK.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/06/climate-change-made-uk-heatwave-30-times-more-likely-met-office

Also from the paper (the end of the ""Summary"", in fact) :
BQSTART
The sea state is sensitive to the NAO, and the winter wind climate of the region is also closely linked to the behavior of the NAO. Any changes in the seasonality or frequency of deep cyclones have implications for transport infrastructure and other marine and coastal activities. 
With a disproportionately large increase in the risk of rough seas associated with an increase in mean wave height, ferry services could face increased levels of disruption. A deterioration of the wave climate through either natural variability or anthropogenic climate change could adversely affect the future economic development of the region.
BQEND
So the scientists supposedly ""backing"" CalMac's assertions are actually saying that if the (global) climate forcings change, for whatever reason, then local weather patterns ""could"" be altered ...
As the locals in the Western Isles might put it, ""No shit, Sherlock !"".
Again, look at the way the ATL article phrased how the local weather patterns ""could"" be changed :

last few days, I’m seeing reports of methane emissions spiking in the Arctic region, based on MetOp1, MetOp2 and CAMS satellite readings. Are we in early stage runaway? Could these readings be seen as warning shots from the so called clathrate gun?
BQEND
A few days-worth of data tells you nothing. Here is the long-term trend (which is also affected by the seasonal cycle and weather):
https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends_ch4/
“We certainly will not see the catastrophic climate effect or runaway climate change from disintegrating gas hydrates that some have claimed,” said Ruppel. Rather, a more likely consequence would be a small increase in ocean acidity.
https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/MethaneMatters
A runaway greenhouse effect involving methane release (such as invoked here) is conceptually possible, but to get a spike of methane concentration in the air it would have to released more quickly than the 10-year lifetime of methane in the atmosphere. Otherwise what you’re talking about is elevated methane concentrations, reflecting the increased source, plus the radiative forcing of that accumulating CO2. It wouldn’t be a methane runaway greenhouse effect, it would be more akin to any other carbon release as CO2 to the atmosphere. This sounds like semantics, but it puts the methane system into the context of the CO2 system, where it belongs and where we can scale it.

The Minch has always been dangerous, and it has always been crossed. I'd worry more about the UK gov continuing to leave freight shipping through the Minches without full cover from tugs, and continuing to allow freight to take the inner route as the weather becomes more dangerous.

The population is currently very small, largely because the indigenous population was 'cleared' in the early nineteenth century.
But Rùm's strategic geographic location could provide a regional answer for the problems posed by changes in climate patterns caused by harmful human / mechanical interference in the weather.
A five km tunnel between Mallaig on the Scottish mainland to Armadale on Skye, together with a 22 km tunnel between Armadale and Kinloch on Rùm would reduce the other Hebridean islands' dependence on Oban for Caledonian MacBrayne ferries. 
Rùm could be developed as a storm-proof inter-island hub for Inner Hebridean ferry services.
Additionally, if the tunnels were built with the capacity to carry road, rail, bicycles, pedestrians, power cables, internet cables, gas, oil and hydrogen, then they might serve as part of a resilient national/global communications / transport / energy grid. 
The technology for building tunnels has been around for millennia, and as coal mining becomes less fashionable, it could be that some of the miners' tunnelling equipment could be usefully reassigned for the common good in building national infrastructure tunnels.
While this could be a little overwhelming for Rùm's current tiny population, it would be less overwhelming than the 'clearance' endured two centuries ago.
If global temperatures rise, as some have predicted, the Hebrides could become the New Caribbean.

Hang on, you've found a (peer reviewed) scientific paper with ""regional downsizing"" at ""The Western Isles"" level ?!?
[ Clickety, clickety ... Download PDF ... Pause, take a deep breath ... OK, here we go ... ]
Coll et al, ""Sensitivity of Ferry Services to the Western Isles of Scotland to Changes in Wave and Wind Climate"", 2012 ... errrrrr, twenty-twelve ?
Sure you've not got anything more recent ?
From the Abstract :
BQSTART
Satellite altimetry and gale-frequency data are used to analyze the contemporary response of wave and wind climate to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The sensitivity of wave climate to the NAO extends to ferry routes that are only partially sheltered and are exposed to ocean waves; thus, the reliability of ferry services is sensitive to NAO. Any deterioration of the wave climate will result in a disproportionately large increase in ferry-service disruption. The impacts associated with an unusually large storm event that affected the region in January 2005 are briefly explored to provide an insight into vulnerability to future storm events.
BQEND
Hate to break it to you, guys, but the NAO is one of those ""natural variability / teleconnections"" thingies (with a 60 or 70 year cycle time), NOT ""(anthropogenic) climate change"" ...
... however, let's be charitable and assume you mean how those evil CO2 emissions will modulate the NAO in a ""bad"" way in the future, affecting the Western Isles ferry services ""catastrophically"" no doubt.
[ Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling, keep that mouse wheel scrolling ... ]
13 (of 16) pages into the paper :
BQSTART
Considerable uncertainties remain in relation to the nature and magnitude of regional climate change, and the future behavior of the NAO and storm tracking remains unclear. Doubts also remain as to whether changes in large-scale atmospheric phenomenon such as the NAO constitute the best proxy indicator for regional-scale patterns of variability. Trends in severe weather are difficult to detect because of the spatial and temporal variability of these events (Houghton et al. 2001), and extreme events also have short detection lifetimes (Weisse et al. 2005). Nonetheless, the empirical evidence suggests a correlation between NAO and storms.

It's really, really, difficult to maintain an ironic / cynical / ""taking the piss"" approach when you compare the headline (and contents) of the article to the above extract from THE SCIENTIFIC PAPER CHOSEN TO SUPPORT IT !
The claim above is that in the future ""climate change makes winter storms increasingly violent, and more sweep in from the north-east and the south"", and that this extremely specific claim is ""backed by scientists"".

On a clear still day in summer there can be no better way (for the price of a ferry ticket) to view the beauty of the mountains and islands set against clear blue water. But winter brings a different face to the Sea of the Hebrides, which can be amongst the roughest in the world. Despite this, CalMac as the service is known, keeps going because there is no other way of supplying the islands and carrying back fish and other exports essential to the islands’ economy.
These crossings are frequently not for the faint hearted, but of the 79,203 ferry crossings between January and the end of July this year fewer than 2,000 were cancelled because of the weather. The major problem for these ferries in rough seas is safe docking at the island harbours, often on exposed slipways, which is why most terminals are built in the lee of the islands, away from the full force of westerly gales. CalMac, backed by scientists , is saying cancellations are more likely in future as climate change makes winter storms increasingly violent, and more sweep in from the north-east and the south, making safe docking impossible.

Or rather two problems. The first is a matter of definition: who or what is a human being, entitled to the rights spelled out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights? The second is the old mind-body split: what if these two components have different wills?
I illustrate by means of the Ohio Republicans, who have recently moved to declare motherhood mandatory, and also to define any fertilised egg – whether in a woman’s body or in a Petri dish – a person under the law. Causing a non-living condition in such an entity would be murder, incurring the death penalty. Even if by miscarriage, it could be manslaughter: a woman might spend years in prison for falling off a horse, like Scarlett O’Hara in Gone with the Wind. (These same Republicans have plans to declare an acorn an oak tree: anyone destroying an acorn would incur the full wrath of the environmental tree-protection forces.)
But the Libertarians too must be satisfied: the rights of the individual must be respected! This could be solved by reverting to the 19th century and declaring women to be adults in respect to responsibilities, but children in respect to rights. Though that might not wash today, considering all the new rights children have been granted.
However, a more sophisticated plan is being mulled over, helped by another Republican who declared that pregnant women cannot have been raped, since a woman’s body “shut(s) that whole thing down”. According to this theory, the body is a sort of automaton.
Thus one proposal might be to declare women persons from the neck up, but things from the neck down. The things could then be requisitioned by the state, like parcels of land. In fairness, compensation would have to be paid to the head, at full market value. The head would be, legally, a she; the body would be an it.
This will annoy some of the female heads, and squawking will ensue; but anti-squawking legislation should take care of that! (Not applicable to chickens.)
However, with advances in transplant surgery a solution satisfactory to all could be legislated: a mandatory Head Exchange! Those heads that don’t want their bodies to have children would be made to switch with those heads who’d like to have children, but whose bodies refuse to comply. Joy all round! (These lawmakers would surely pass a sub-clause changing the words of “I’m So Pretty”, from West Side Story, to “I’m So Itty”. This would reinforce the message to women that their bodies are things, and have no human rights.)
A Republican declared that pregnant women cannot have been raped, since a woman’s body 'shut(s) that whole thing down'
People, I don’t recommend any of this. It would go pear-shaped very fast (no innuendo intended). Instead of happiness there would be strife. Imagine the arguments that would take place over the allocations of heads and bodies! Bribery and political influence would play their part – and picture the lawsuits concerning bodies that malfunction. Some heads – I hesitate to say – might declare a wish to get pregnant simply in order to obtain a body more to their liking. What uproar!
To forestall this sad state of affairs, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should add a clause concerning the Right to Refuse Ittiness. In view of the new findings that the intestinal tract constitutes a second brain, this clause would reject the mind-body split and declare the neck a protected area, much like the Korean demilitarised zone. Problem solved!
Not that such a clause will do much good in Ohio, where they don’t seem so keen on the universal declaration in any case.
 
It makes sense that the original Declaration of Human Rights ignores the Earth – the Earth was the backdrop to the human story. Against that backdrop, for thousands of years, the great dramas had been carried out: tyrannies risen and fallen, wars won and lost, ordinary people oppressed and rebelling. The idea of the “environment” would barely have made sense at the time – obviously the physical systems of the planet were necessary to grow crops, obviously the Earth’s resources could be hoarded or shared. But it was the scenery, not the play. As we got better at storing food and fighting germs, and as world wars terrified us with their uncontrollable violence, the physical world seemed to be receding ever further. We needed instead to focus on what humans could do to each other, for better and for worse.
And now that has shifted, decisively. Though all the concerns of the universal declaration – intolerance, poverty, ill health, the lack of education, suffrage, work – remain as acute as ever, they have been joined by an overriding if often unspoken dread. We have begun (slowly, perhaps too late) to understand what we can do to the Earth, and what in turn that damaged Earth can do to us.
It was a recognition that began to dawn in the years just after 1948 – by the early 1960s Rachel Carson had begun the vital task (in Silent Spring) of knocking the shine off “progress”. It’s given rise to one of the greatest movements the world has ever seen, this thing awkwardly called “environmentalism” that has united people across continents and faiths and races. But it still exerts a tenuous claim on power: no one “denies” war or hunger or unemployment, but many of the world’s paramount leaders continue to pretend we cannot damage the planet.
That pretence, of course, is rooted in the wealth and power of precisely those humans who do the most damage. The oil industry, for instance, long the richest single force on this globe, and one that has spent a generation insisting that climate change isn’t real, even as the Arctic melted and the sea began to rise. Or agribusiness, or the chemical industry, or many others – all of whom insist that they are merely meeting the human needs enshrined in the declaration, for housing and energy and dinner.
Securing the physical Earth is the first order of business now, not an add-on
And so it is necessary to postulate a new right: that humans must be protected against those forces that would damage the Earth’s systems. Indeed, none of the other rights can be guaranteed on an unstable planet: a heating planet endangers everything from food supplies to political freedom. In some sense, securing the physical Earth is the first order of business now, not an add-on.
But it is a complicated right, one that comes with a corresponding responsibility not to do that damage ourselves. Or not any more than we absolutely must. And it is complicated further by the fact that we must think not only about the humans of the moment, but the humans of the future as well: the Peloponnesian war is not still claiming human lives because it ended 2,500 years ago, but our current destruction of the climate will be impoverishing people for 10 times that long.
It is complicated further still by the fact that it’s not just humans who are laid waste, but the rest of creation. We have apparently wiped out more than 60% of the animals that shared the world with us when the declaration was written – it is possible that the moment has come to expand our vision of who deserves protection.
This “right” is not an aspiration but a requirement. If we mistreat each other for another 70 years that will be hideous, but humans of 2088 will still be able to change. If we mistreat the Earth for another seven decades, implacable physics and chemistry and biology will write the next chapter in our history.
The right to live free from blame for the fact that someone or something has made a man feel small or unimportant, for example if they are not King of the Entire World, if they have not won the medal, or made the money, if they have not beaten the opposition in the last 24 hours, even if the opposition is in their own head. The right to live radiantly free of a man’s feelings about all this, even if you are the person who makes their dinner, or the person who does not make their dinner but probably should because they really need something from you, they are feeling so undervalued, and maybe sex will do.
The right to freedom from blame if you are a woman who sleeps with a man or does not sleep with a man, who flatters or fails to flatter a man who is feeling the grip of shame or mortality because he is not the poshest, or the strongest, or the most eloquent, or in some way the most important person in the world, or at least in the room.
The right not to get hit for all the above.
The right not to get raped ditto.
The right not to make anyone’s dinner but your own.
The right not to be compared with a man’s mother, if she was lovely, or confused with a man’s mother if she was not – this especially if she made him feel small or unimportant or mortal at the age when every child deserves to feel like the King of the Entire World. We are sorry you missed all this, or that this phase ended abruptly or badly for you, it is not our fault. We were not there. Yes we have breasts and no, despite the fact that these are actual breasts and therefore very confusing for you, we were not there.
The right to bodily autonomy, of course.
The right to live free from a man’s need to use you as a way to bond with other men, by turning you into an object of shame or derision.
The right to call out the difference between wanting and possessing, between liking and taking, looking and touching. The right to your own ideas, even if a man at the meeting likes them and therefore thinks that they are his. The right to your own body, even if a man at a meeting likes it and therefore thinks it is his. The right to both these things even if everyone else at the meeting agrees with him for reasons that are completely hidden from their conscious minds and also inexplicable and strange.
The right to call it out when a man takes something and holds you responsible for the theft – of your work, your talent, your body, your sweetness or sexuality, your good thing. The right to tell this to the world without being accused of masochism or greed or of wearing the wrong underwear, of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, or of wanting a job, of wanting to be hurt, of wanting it, whatever it is, sex, or power, or humiliation, because when a woman wants a little she gets everything and then some. She gets the blame. The right to hand back the blame.
The right to love a good man, and to love the goodness in men, when they are authoritative and gentle and know who they are.
The right to desire, because your mind is always free.
We live in strange times, and we’re actively making them stranger. Volkswagen has been forced to pay out more than €28bn for designing cars that could cheat emissions tests. Political operatives use the unstated fashion choices of voters to microselect for campaign ads. YouTube’s recommendation algorithms are implicated in the radicalisation of flat earthers and ultranationalists. Artificially intelligent machines beat us at games with novel strategies we do not, and cannot, understand. The future is only going to be more confusing. Six years before the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was proclaimed, the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov proposed his famous Three Laws of Robotics: that a robot must not harm or, through inaction, allow harm to come to any human being; that it must obey orders given to it by human beings where they do not contradict the first law; and that it must protect its own existence to the extent that doing so would not conflict with the first two laws. They’re good laws, but the robots that Asimov imagined were discrete beings, aloof and accountable – and very different from the entangled, ever-present, overwhelmingly sophisticated yet often obscure technologies we actually find ourselves living among today.
Instead of visibly dangerous robots, we have hidden programs inside car engines that poison the atmosphere, prejudiced automation systems for sentencing and job selection, covert data-gathering regimes that sell us out to corporations and political enemies, and proprietary attention-seeking algorithms which distract our attention, and amplify division and conspiracy. If it were robots that were doing all that, a contemporary update to Asimov’s laws might require them to explain themselves to humans, so that we might not be harmed by the fact that most of the time, we have no idea what they’re doing. But really, the onus is on us, not on them.
What then would this requirement look like if framed as a right? The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was primarily concerned with interpersonal relationships and mutual understanding; it speaks of “a common understanding of these rights and freedoms” as well as the promotion of “understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups”. But when so many of those relationships are mediated by inscrutable technologies, the understanding required is that of systems, not of one another.
Today we hear a lot about the benefits new technologies such as artificial intelligence and mass automation will bring to our lives, but even those tasked with constructing them have little understanding of the effects they will have on our societies. Lack of understanding – the feeling of being lost and powerless in the world – leads to fear, apathy and rage. It’s hardly surprising then that in these times of technological acceleration and complexity, those are the dominant emotions felt across the globe.
The right to understand, then, would be a useful addition to what is expected for us today. A demand both for better education – not just in technology, but in all forms of critical thinking – allied with the requirement that those deploying complex and life-affecting technologies must consult with those subject to them, engineer them for transparency, and actively work to make them comprehensible and accountable. Only through mass understanding, and thus mass engagement and mass participation, might we hope to get a firmer grip on an increasingly strange and inscrutable world.
Everyone has the right to fulfil their potential, free from discrimination.
It’s time to recognise drastic racial disparities in our institutions for what they are – a threat to human potential. Discrimination places an insidious stranglehold on what a person can be, and how far they can go. It limits individual lives, marginalises talent, and hinders society.
No child should ever have to be warned that in the worlds of school and employment, they’ll have to work twice as hard for half the reward. That this lesson must be instilled in a child of colour before they strike out on their own is an indication that we still live with drastic inequality.
That same child should never have to look at leadership and decide that it isn’t for them, because leaders don’t look like them, or come from where they come from.
Not everyone aspires to achieve great things. Each of our understandings of “great” is different. A fair society doesn’t demand that you should be a leader, but it certainly doesn’t try to hold you back if you want to be. It won’t tell you that you’re too poor, or too female, or too black to be where you want to be, or do what you’d like to do.
Outside of aspiration, every person deserves fair treatment inside each institution that we have to interact with to survive – employment, education, housing and healthcare. You deserve to live your life without being blown off course by the distraction of racism.
No burden should be placed on the shoulders of marginalised people to live a double consciousness, in which we know the reality of discrimination, but never speak of it in order to keep the peace. Your safety and stability should never be reliant on an expectation that you’ll be silent about subtle injustice.
You should never have to make the case to be seen as a full human being. Immigrants and refugees should have the freedom to live a banal and mediocre life in their country of asylum without the threat of being sent back to danger. You shouldn’t have to climb up the side of a building and rescue a toddler to be granted citizenship, because being exceptional is not a passport to being an agreeable refugee.
If you’re a British citizen who is not white, your “not whiteness” should never be provided as an explanation as to why you did a bad thing. The fact that you are not white does not indicate a tendency to doing bad things. Black is not shorthand for bad.
You deserve to live in a society where the life-limiting aspects of discrimination are eliminated. Where your race, gender or class has a nominal effect on your life’s trajectory. Where no one is held back by structural bias.
Thanks to article 23 of the declaration, we can all claim the right to work. Article 23 also gives us the right to do the work we choose under decent conditions, protected from all the adverse consequences of losing both wages and a sense of human purpose. Oh, and a just living wage, social insurance and the individual and collective safeguarding of workers’ interests.
These precious provisions around the right to work are followed immediately by a recognition of the right to limits on work, or in the words of article 24, “the right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay”.
The adjacency of the articles implies their inextricability; the right to work is meaningless in the absence of a right to a life beyond work. Yet survey the landscape of work today, and we find the latter everywhere under assault. For the sweatshop workers of China and Bangladesh, the precarious workforce of our expanding gig economy, even for the chronically enervated workaholic bankers and lawyers of Wall Street and the City, the right to a non-working life has been annulled by the sovereignty of work.
How have we allowed the right to non-work to be so thoroughly undermined? The first point to make is that this is as a predicament of psychology and culture as much as politics and economics. It is rooted in a deeply entrenched conception of the human being as a creature whose substance and meaning lie in work above all. The declaration, in defining the right to non-work in terms of “rest and leisure”, implies that its purpose is to serve the imperatives of work; we rest in order to restore ourselves for work; leisure is the term used for play outside working hours.
While the declaration, in other words, clearly recognises the essential place of work in human self-definition, it recognises non-work only in the negative – as an interval in or limit on the state of work. What if non-work could gain a new, positive and substantive place in the declaration? If we human beings could be established by it as creatures who paint, sing, speculate idly or stare out of the window not because it restores our working batteries, but because the state of idleness is its own value?
The British psychoanalyst DW Winnicott saw us as composed of two fundamental elements: “doing” and “being”. His point was that as we grow more distant from the daily reveries of infancy and childhood, we define ourselves increasingly in terms of doing at the expense of being. But neglecting the dimension of being, he argued, can make us psychically and physically ill. “After being,” he writes in a typically terse formulation, “doing … but first, being.”
Could the declaration find a place among the fundamental human rights for the right to be? This is to be distinguished from the right to life, which secures the bare fact of existence. The right to be is the right to a space freed from the imperative of doing, from aim, purpose, productivity. It is at least as essential as action to what the declaration calls “the free development of personality”.
The right to be has as much bearing on political and economic justice as it does on human health and inner security. If non-productive, aimless time and space is protected as a basic human right, it becomes that bit more difficult for, say, Chinese corporate masters to insist that two five-minute toilet breaks in a 16-hour shift constitute a sufficiently “reasonable” limit on working hours.
“There is nothing,” wrote the great American writer Henry David Thoreau, “not even crime, more opposed to poetry, to philosophy, ay to life itself, than this incessant business.” Let us declare freedom from this incessant business; call it a right to non-work, a right to be, a right to poetry and philosophy; or indeed, a right to life itself.
In 1910, the German doctor and sexual reformer Magnus Hirschfeld calculated that there were 43m possible combinations of gender and sexuality. His thinking came out of extensive clinical experience. Over the years he had interviewed thousands of people, whose diversity of genitalia, physical appearance and sexual desires astounded him. “The number of actual and imaginable sexual varieties is almost unending,” he wrote. “In each person there is a different mixture of manly and womanly substances, and as we cannot find two leaves alike on a tree, then it is highly unlikely that we will find two humans whose manly and womanly characteristics exactly match in kind and number.”
Hirschfeld’s words are radical even now, though versions of them were repeated right through the 20th century. You can, for example, find very similar statements in Virginia Woolf, who thought of herself as not quite one thing or another, who loved both men and women and who was perennially at sea between the fixed poles of gender. Excited by a newspaper story about a pretty young woman who became a man, in 1928 she channelled her feelings into Orlando, her ebullient masterpiece, a novel bent on unsettling binary notions of gender and identity. “Different though the sexes are, they intermix,” it reports. “In every human being a vacillation from one sex to the other takes place, and often it is only the clothes that keep the male or female likeness, while underneath the sex is the very opposite of what it is above.”
Sexual desire and gender identity are the base notes of bodily experience and yet the wish to organise them into categories of right and wrong, permissible and illicit remains overwhelming. The 1948 Declaration of Human Rights safeguards the right to a nation and the right to be safe from imprisonment, but not the right to express one’s own personal experience of gender; nor to choose, within the absolute limits of consent, with whom and how one wishes to conduct a sexual life. A body can be a prison too. You can exile or incarcerate someone simply by defining them against their own living sense of who they are, by forbidding them love or erotic range. And then, of course, you can make their life a misery, regulate their clothes, their use of lavatories and changing rooms, stop them being able to work or marry.
Anyone who’s read the annual Transgender Day of Remembrance list of deaths will know the stakes are high. In August 2013, to take a single story, Islan Nettles, a 21-year-old transgender woman, was beaten to death in Harlem. Her assailant was a young man who had been flirting with her when his friends told him Islan had been born a boy. “I just didn’t want to be fooled,” he told the police.
'In every human being a vacillation from one sex to the other takes place'
What rights would have helped Islan? Not so much a right to self-define, which can be made to sound arbitrary and whimsical, as a right not to be forcibly defined by the state, to have a gender identity imposed from outside, to be told that what you aren’t is natural, and what you are is deviant, wrong, illicit, fake. The right to have the stays of gender unloosed, the right to breathe. The right to transition, to shift, to exceed or refuse the expectations and constraints that have attached to the categories of man and woman. The right to dress in whatever clothes one chooses. The right to love whoever one chooses. The right to be different. The right to be neither. The right to be both.
The framers of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights couldn’t foresee that in the 21st century, we would need two sets of rights – one for our lives in the physical world, and one for our lives online. But the beautiful thing is that we don’t, actually, need to rewrite the UDHR for the digital world. We might need an amendment or two, but to begin with, we only need to recognise that the same rights we expect in the physical world should be afforded in the online world, too.
Article 12 of the declaration states: “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, no attacks upon his honour or reputation.” Online, countless social media platforms, websites and apps may violate users’ privacy, tracking our movements online, studying and manipulating our digital behaviour, and intercepting and monetising our correspondence. 
Article 26 of the declaration states that “Everyone has a right to education” and that “Education shall be free”. Increasingly in elementary and secondary schools, students are required to access, complete and submit their homework using digital tools. Given a laptop can cost at least $1,000, and having wifi at home requires monthly payments to private providers, education in such a situation is no longer free.
Later in article 26, the UDHR asserts that “Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.” Given the vast wealth of research that proves that increased screen time for children and teenagers leads to higher rates of depression and even suicide, schools that push their pupils into more screen usage are doing three counterproductive things simultaneously: they’re forcing young people on to the screens that have been proved unequivocally to be addictive and harmful; they’re making learning more difficult; and they’re creating a two-tiered system, whereby those wealthy enough for computers and phones and wifi at home have an easier time accessing their education, while lower income students are left to scramble and to feel inferior.
Article 27 asserts that “Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.” The original sin of the digital world was the well-intentioned belief that everything online needed to be free. This led to the hollowing out of the creative middle class, as musicians, journalists, photographers and countless other creators no longer controlled their work, and consumers no longer expected to pay for it. Thus we have now had two generations that can’t conceive of the notion of paying .99 cents to own a song. Because their music is given away for free — or next to free — online, musicians have to tour incessantly to make a living, or else be forced to sell their work for use in car commercials.
Articles 28 and 29 are probably the most poignant here. They state that “Everyone is entitled to a social and international order” and that “Everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society.” Currently the digital world does a poor job in achieving any of these objectives. Whereas laws of civility govern the physical world and lawmakers and law-enforcers endeavour to keep us safe from harassment and threats, few such protections are afforded online. The digital world is anarchic, and largely without recognition of rights, public order or general welfare. It’s every person for him or herself. That is in opposition to the soul of the UDHR, which envisions a latticework of rights and responsibilities of all humans – one that might keep us responsible to each other and invested in our mutual wellbeing.
This is not the feeling we get while online. So the digital world has some work to do. If we add to the UDHR a handful of amendments necessary and specific to the digital world, we just might create a framework within which all but the most outlaw tech entities might operate. Here are two amendments: we need to clarify that all surveillance is inherently abhorrent and should be undertaken only in the interest of law enforcement, and even then, only after an independent judiciary signs off on that surveillance. All other dossier-creation is inherently immoral and stands in clear violation of everything that the UDHR states and implies. If we eliminate all tracking from the web – and all tracking is surveillance, after all – we’d be well on our way to a digital world that actually conformed to the spirit of the UDHR.
Most important of all, though, is that we need to ensure that humans in the 21st century will be allowed to enjoy analogue lives. When a student needs a $1,000 device to do her homework, her fundamental rights are being violated. When any government service requires the ownership of a smartphone to gain access to basic services, then their rights are being compromised. Scientific studies have proved that every additional hour we spend in front of screens makes us less happy and less healthy. So we must put the brakes on moving every last element of our lives into the digital realm. We must ensure that humans can live offline as much as humanly possible.

After a heated two-and-a-half-hour debate on Saturday night, the backwards step by the four major oil producers shocked delegates at the UN climate conference in Katowice as ministers flew in for the final week of high-level discussions.
It has also raised fears among scientists that the US president, Donald Trump, is going from passively withdrawing from climate talks to actively undermining them alongside a coalition of climate deniers.
Two months ago, representatives from the world’s governments hugged after agreeing on the 1.5C report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), commissioned to spell out the dire consequences should that level of warming be exceeded and how it can be avoided.
Reaching a global consensus was a painstaking process involving thousands of scientists sifting through years of research and diplomats working through the night to ensure the wording was acceptable to all nations.
But when it was submitted to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change on Saturday, the four oil allies – with Saudi Arabia as the most obdurate – rejected a motion to “welcome” the study. Instead, they said it should merely be “noted”, which would make it much easier for governments to ignore. The motion has not yet been able to pass as a result of the lack of consensus.
It opened up a rift at the talks that will be hard to close in the coming five days. During the plenary, the EU, a bloc of the 47 least developed countries, as well as African and Latin and South American nations, all spoke in favour of the report. Several denounced the four countries trying to dilute its importance.
Rueanna Haynes, a delegate for St Kitts and Nevis, told the plenary it was “ludicrous” not to welcome a report that UN member nations had commissioned two years earlier and to hold up crucial talks over two words.
“It’s very frustrating that we are not able to take into account the report’s findings: we are talking about the future of the world – it sounds like hyperbole when I say it, but that’s how serious it is,” she told the Guardian. “I would say that this issue has to be resolved. This is going to drag out and the success of the COP is going to hang on this as well as other issues.”
Scientists were also outraged. “It is troubling. Saudi Arabia has always had bad behaviour in climate talks, but it could be overruled when it was alone or just with Kuwait. That it has now been joined by the US and Russia is much more dangerous,” said Alden Meyer, the director of strategy and policy in the Union of Concerned Scientists.
He said the shift in the US position would be embarrassing for the country if it persisted. “Donald Trump is the denier-in-chief. He takes a personal interest in dissing scientists,” said Meyer. “But the science won’t go away. The law of thermodynamics can’t be ignored.”
Climate campaigners said the four blocking governments had been overrun by fossil-fuel interests and were trying to sideline the study.
May Boeve, the executive director of the activist group 350.org, said: “Deliberately ignoring the IPCC report would be wholly irresponsible and 350.org stands with the rest of world in condemning these climate deniers … and the vested fossil fuel interests behind them.” 
Ministers have only five days to establish a rulebook for the Paris agreement. A wild card is the role of the host nation, Poland – the most coal-dependant nation in Europe – which will chair the final week of the meeting.
“The big challenge now is for the Polish presidency to set aside its obsession with coal, get out of the way and allow full acknowledgement of the IPCC 1.5C report, and its implications for increasing the ambition of all countries, in the conclusion of COP24 later this week,” said Bill Hare, the managing director of Climate Analytics.
 As well as acceptance of the report, there are several other potential fights brewing regarding transparency rules for reporting emissions and proposals for wealthy high emitters to provide financial support to poorer nations struggling to adapt.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/09/us-russia-ally-saudi-arabia-water-down-climate-pledges-un

The end of the first week of the UN climate talks – known as COP24 – in Katowice, Poland, has been mired by protracted debate over whether the conference should “welcome” or “note” a key report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The IPCC’s 1.5 degrees report, released in October, warned the world would have to cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 45% by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5C and potentially avoid some of the worst effects of climate change, including a dramatically increased risk of drought, flood, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people.
The UN climate conference commissioned the IPCC report, but when that body went to “welcome” the report’s findings and commit to continuing its work, four nations – the US, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia, all major oil and gas producers – refused to accept the wording, insisting instead that the convention simply “note” the findings.
Negotiators spent two and a half hours trying to hammer out a compromise without success.
The apparently minor semantic debate has significant consequences, and the deadlock ensures the debate will spill into the second critical week of negotiations, with key government ministers set to arrive in Katowice.
Most of the world’s countries spoke out in fierce opposition to the oil allies’ position.
The push to adopt the wording “welcome” was led by the Maldives, leader of the alliance of small island states, of which Australia’s Pacific island neighbours are members.
They were backed by a broad swathe of support, including from the EU, the bloc of 47 least developed countries, the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean, African, American and European nations, and Pacific countries such as the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu.
Australia did not speak during the at-times heated debate, a silence noted by many countries on the floor of the conference, Dr Bill Hare, the managing director of Climate Analytics and a lead author on previous IPCC reports, told Guardian Australia.
“Australia’s silence in the face of this attack yesterday shocked many countries and is widely seen as de facto support for the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait’s refusal to welcome the IPCC report,” Hare said.
Richie Merzian, climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute, said widespread goodwill across the Katowice talks was being undermined by “a handful of countries” trying to disconnect the science and urgency from the implementation of the Paris agreement.
“It is disappointing but not surprising that Australia kept its head down during the debate … by remaining silent and not putting a position forward, Australia has tacitly supported the US, Russia and Saudi Arabia’s rejection of the latest science on climate change.”
Merzian said Australia’s regional neighbours, including New Zealand and Pacific islands, had voiced strong support for the IPCC’s report, which was a key outcome of the Paris agreement.
“A number of delegates privately shared their frustration that countries like Australia stood on the sidelines while Trump’s, Putin’s and King Salman’s representatives laid waste to the fundamental climate science.”
Hare said the interests of the fossil fuel industry were seeking to thwart the conference’s drive towards larger emissions cuts.
“The fossil fuel interest – coal, oil and gas – campaign against the IPCC 1.5 report and science continues to play out in the climate talks, but even those countries [opposing welcoming the report] are being hit by the impacts of only one degree of warming.
“The big challenge now is for the Polish presidency to set aside its obsession with coal, get out of the way and allow full acknowledgement of the IPCC 1.5C report, and its implications for increasing the ambition of all countries, in the conclusion of COP24 later this week.”
Australia’s environment minister, Melissa Price, arrived in Katowice on Sunday, with negotiations set to resume Monday morning.
“The government is committed to the Paris agreement and our emissions reduction targets,” she said before leaving Australia. “Australia’s participation in the Paris agreement and in COP24 is in our national interest, in the interests of the Indo-Pacific region, and the international community as a whole.”
Price said a priority for Australia at COP24 was to ensure a robust framework of rules to govern the reporting of Paris agreement targets. “Australia’s emissions reporting is of an exceptionally high standard and we are advocating for rules that bring other countries up to the standard to which we adhere.”
The latest Australian government figures, released last month, show the country’s carbon emissions continue to rise, at a rate significantly higher than recent years.
Australia’s emissions, seasonally adjusted, increased 1.3% over the past quarter. Excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (for which the calculations are controversial), they are at a record high.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/10/australias-silence-during-climate-change-debate-shocks-cop24-delegates

Thanks, that clarifies things.
Mind you, my experience of garages, whether small independent or a dealership waving the manufacturer's flag has generally been bad. I try to avoid them. The other day, though, I went to a VW dealership with my 19 year old car, just for a quick fix by the people who ought to know the car... They just didn't want to know, and pointed me towards an independent whose work I've found shoddy in the past. I'll do it myself.
My best garage experience in recent years was with an independent SAAB specialist. The car was always throwing up some issue or other, which, without the £1800 worth of diagnostic equipment, I couldn't address, but the garage proprietor was the best, most knowledgeable, bullshit free guy I've ever encountered in the business...

I hope someone will think about the melting blocks of ice when the news show this years ""Light and Ice-sculpture"" festivals around the Northern Hemisphere during the Holidays. And ponder if art is just to show something pretty - or if art can also do something else. Even giving a thought to what will happen with them pretty ice-sculptures. And why they these days are increasingly shaped in cold-rooms - because working for weeks outside with them is risky also in the traditionally cold Nordic nations. 
Art can make us reflect upon such things. 
Though I get it is more fun to ponder if the Avengers will use time-travel in the spring to fix things - than to ponder how to slow down our own Ragnarok - an artificial introduction of carbon dioxide molecules within 200 years that is now on the verge of reversing 50 million years of natural processes

To point out that this use CO2 and thus is ironic, means that Attenborough TV shows are bad for the planet - is that correct? 
Art was always about taking somewhere and place it in a context. Duchamp made a fountain. We see the amazing images of Salgado and Adams. Both extreme abstractions and landscape photos take both time and the z-dimension out of the art. Still we watch it. Still it is touching. 
Art is also activist (look at Salgado again). 
There is more to this world than strict documentation and cost-benefit analysis. There is art. There is room for reflection. And I urge people who can to watch it. There is something special about hearing the sound of glacial ice melting. And if one pay attention - one will see that the visual characteristics of glacial ice is different from the one we made by freezing water in the fridge. 
I find it interesting that so many find this provoking. In itself that makes a trained scientist like myself think that there is something deeper than an artist just present some chunks of ice. 
Because it does make us think about consumer society. That a product of a few cars worth in mass does come with transportation. That ice sure does melt slow even in areas where ice at the moment could not survive. Even if these - 50(?) tons look large. While Greenland - where ice are conditioned to exist shed close to 300 million tons net - every year. These things. 
I do not think this art is trying to teach us about the physics of glacier ice. Or AGW. And one does not need to like this art to understand AGW - as little as one need to be a star in solving differential equations to understand the concept of AGW. 
But it can make someone experience something. Reflect upon something. 
I have taken scientists with half a life worth of studying glacial ice up to actual glaciers. Scientists who has never actually seen a glacier in real life after a decade or more of doing their core scientific work. A lot of glaciologists are not field scientists. 
I have seen tears. Experienced scientists sitting down - in a moment of quiet. Touching them. Hugging them (really - flat down with arms stretched out as if trying to embrace the whole entity). I have done the same thing in reverse - hugging a section of the first ice-core spanning 400,000 years (the ""Vostok"") still being preserved in laboratories. 
For science Vostok was and is special - because it took science from 1970 to 1997 to get these 400,000+ years worth of data. Two generations of science. Since it is expanded to 800,000 years of data. 
I do not think non-scientists will be this emotional about ice either - just as with art. 
But it does allow for reflection. Even political reflections. Because there are nations on this planet now that cut their funding for climate science. Because they do not like the answers these lumps of ice (for example) gives. It is so much convenient to say one does not believe - right? 
From a scientific point of view - to study frozen water is a really difficult science. Because water is a very strange substance. There are volumes of science on how and where conditions makes ice start to deform (flow). How ice does (or not) slide over the ground. How diffusion works. 
But as Prof. Richard Alley succinctly pointed out in a lecture some 30 years ago - best rule of thumb is that heat melts ice. It is a bit more complex than that - but it is one good rule of thumb - based on some pretty good science. 
I completely get that people do not like art. That is fine. But like science itself - one can not falsify much stuff with linear regression. And there are things on this planet that has value outside of the austerity bible of cost-benefit zero-sum calculations. 
The great thing about art is that it does not force itself upon us. We are free to dislike it. But thermodynamics is not so kind. 
I find that the artistic side of our evolution - allowing us to make it - and find everything from pure joy to reflection to sadness to dislike when exposed to it as one our more redeeming qualities. It is not like we really need the artform of music, is it? Or is it? Nor do we need the artform of film - most people do not watch films much even though people gasp collectively when a CGI guy with a gauntlet snapped his finger and made fictional figures evaporate (or whatever). I did gasp. But I completely see how silly it is when one think about the CO2 cost of such a silly story earning billions is. Flying some person around the world just because he plays Norse god even more fictionus than the religious character it was based on. Is it really more silly to let melting ice melt in a city than what the billion dollar industry of a movie does? In between the same guys making a silly film about a fictional ""Ragnarok"" based on a less silly religious belief system? Really?

Olafur Eliasson brings the frozen fjord to Britain,article,http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/dec/11/icebergs-ahead-olafur-eliasson-brings-the-frozen-fjord-to-britain-ice-watch-london-climate-change,0,"Olafur Eliasson is putting the chill into climate change. The revered Scandinavian artist has placed 24 large blocks of centuries-old ice, harvested from the Nuup Kangerlua fjord in Greenland, in a circle outside the Tate Modern in London, with another six on display in the City.
The purpose of Ice Watch London, a collaboration with award-winning Greenlandic geologist Minik Rosing, is to bring the effects of climate change closer to home, putting people in direct contact with its effects so that they can feel – and even sniff and lick – the ice as it slowly melts away.
“I’ve been studying behavioural psychology, and looking into the consequences of experience,” says the Icelandic-Danish artist. “What does it mean to experience something? Does it change you or not change you? It turns out that data alone only promotes a small degree of change. So in order to create the massive behavioural change needed [to tackle climate change] we have to emotionalise that data, make it physically tangible.”
Each ice block was fished out of the sea after it had broken away from the Greenland ice sheet – then transported in fridge containers to the UK (“Just like the ones that take your frozen prawns to Selfridges,” grins Rosing). The blocks, which weigh between 1.5 and 6 tonnes each, all have to be of a shape that is unlikely to break – when Ice Watch was on display in Copenhagen and Paris, the public were fond of scrambling up and sliding down the blocks.
Of course, such interaction is the point of the project. As Eliasson puts it: “Roll around on it, climb on it, listen to it!”
The icebergs are made up of compressed snow rather than frozen water, meaning that each block contains tiny little bubbles of air. Put your ear up against them and you will hear a magical popping and fizzing sound.
“It sounds so beautiful,” says Rosing. “That is air that was trapped before we started polluting the atmosphere. Those bubbles have almost half the CO2 content as the air outside the iceberg. It was trapped maybe 10,000 years ago, maybe 100,000, so you can smell what air used to smell like before we polluted it. And you can take a drink of it, beautiful, natural water.”
The artwork arrives here to coincide with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest stark warning that we have only 12 years to limit the worst effects of climate change. Eliasson and Rosing both point out the rather chilling statistic that 10,000 blocks of ice such as the ones on display in London are falling from the ice sheet every single second. However, they both passionately believe that focusing on scare stories is the wrong way to tackle climate change. “Instead of fear-based narratives, you need a positive narrative to make people change their behaviour,” says Eliasson, “and that’s why I think the culture sector has a strong mandate to take on some leadership here.”
“We have to provide a glimpse of hope,” adds Rosing. “People think the scientists come with the bad news about climate change but actually we come with the good news. We understand what’s happening, we know exactly what needs to be done and we actually have the means to fix it. The only reason we’ve been able to upset the global environment system is because we have enormous power. If we direct that same enormous power to improving the system, we can get it back on track.”
Eliasson’s is perhaps best known here for his 2003 Tate Modern installation The Weather Project, which hung a gigantic sun in the gallery’s turbine hall and attracted over two million visitors. His work has often focused on environmental themes: Green River used uranine, a non-toxic dye, to turn rivers in Stockholm, Tokyo and LA a dazzling bright green, while his Little Sun project provided small, solar-powered lamps to local entrepreneurs in communities where electricity was scarce. Even during the installation of this latest work, which started on Monday, Eliasson says his ice blocks have had an unusual effect on people: “The crane guy outside who was lifting and putting them down said ‘You know what? These are actually really heavy!’ Another woman touched it and said ‘wow, it’s really cold!’ Of course she knew this but the knowledge of her hand is so different to the knowledge in our heads.”
Ice Watch is set to run until 21 December, providing the weather doesn’t melt them away before. After that date, any ice left unmelted will be taken to local community and cultural institutions as part of an extended educational programme.
The exhibition comes before a major retrospective of Eliasson’s work at the Tate Modern that starts on 11 July 2019. That, too, will have a climate focus, perhaps inevitably so given Eliasson’s longstanding interest in environmental matters. For the catalogue, he has interviewed Elke Weber, the psychologist whose research into human behaviour has shaped his recent thinking about how to change people’s actions through art. The show will also contain a work from 20 years ago, in which Eliasson flew over Iceland documenting glaciers from above with a camera.
“It’s one of my oldest works, but also one of the first where I was focusing on the question of climate and glaciers,” he says.
“And now,” adds Rosing, striking a rare forlorn note, “those glaciers will probably be gone.”

We are children of our era; our era is political. 
All affairs, day and night, yours, ours, theirs, are political affairs. 
Like it or not, your genes have a political past, your skin a political cast, your eyes a political aspect. What you say has a resonance; what you are silent about is telling. Either way, it's political. 
Even when you head for the hills you're taking political steps on political ground. 
Even apolitical poems are political, and above us shines the moon, by now no longer lunar. To be or not to be, that is the question. Question? What question? Dear, here's a suggestion: a political question. 
You don't even have to be a human being to gain political significance. Crude oil will do, or concentrated feed, or any raw material.

If you try this game, quite logically, you might be asked to come up with a suggestion; well, you could suggest, say, that school marks are a measure of social wealth and if the electorate decided to express this social wealth in money terms, a 7 could be deemed to create a profit of 70 or 700 pounds, this being money created from nothing (which is what banks do), a sort of new money supply, and if this profit were invested in creating more ""green jobs"", the ""green economy"" could grow and grow and so the ""non-green economy"" could shrink and shrink.(Be care full; this profit is not something added to a purchase price.)', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1544614461000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'they are a charge on public and private purses', u'effect': u'not done enough'}, {u'cause': u'reluctant governments and ceos', u'effect': u'which is not proving very successful'}, {u'cause': u'us', u'effect': u'climate change'}], u'author_id': u'12826250', u'id': u'123640867', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ReluctantModerate', u'text': u'Carbon Dioxide, and all the other greenhouse gasses can only warm the atmosphere as they increase.

We also need a action mix, not just one that depicts one way of dealing with things as socialist and the other as individual, libertarian and beautiful.
If we had time, we could sit back and see how climate action could be solely driven by individuals and grow organically as a movement and save the world. But this hasn't happened in the last 50 years or so that scientists have been trying to bring people's attention to global warming, so why should we trust it will happen now?

It seems like climate change and global warming is a conversation that’s going to be hard to avoid this Christmas.
But some ways of talking are better than others. To help you prepare for difficult conversations here are five different ways you can try to talk about climate change, or anything else difficult and controversial, this holidays.
This is not a winning strategy in itself. The facts have been around for more than 50 years but the debate has taken a course that has at times ignored science.
Sure, you can throw intellectual spaghetti at the wall and see if it sticks. But there are better options.
In a recent interview, professor of linguistics and cognitive science George Lakoff railed against “enlightenment reasoning”, which is the belief that “if you just tell people the facts, they’ll reach the right conclusion”
“That just isn’t true,” Lakoff says. “People think in terms of conceptual structures called frames and metaphors. It’s not just the facts.”
Compelling stories steeped in emotion and backed with facts – that’s the way to talk about global warming.
Earlier this year the UN released a handbook for talking about climate change which recommends “telling a human story, talking about the real world, knowing what matters to the audience, and employing visual aids”.
This advice takes advantage of processes that are literally hardwired in our brains and have assisted with our survival. Or, as moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt said, the “human mind is a story processor, not a logic processor”.
You don’t have to look far to find these stories.
Tell your family about the joint US and Australian firefighting efforts that have been running for 20 years but may be stopped because we are moving towards a “year round” fire season and will be too busy battling blazes at home to help anyone else.
The process of simply hearing what the person says is enough to defuse the emotional charge
Tell them about the bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, which could hit again next year with heat waves breaking records that have stood for 118 years by more than 5C.
Tell them about the low-lying island nations like Kiribati, which are being threatened by storm surges and rising sea levels, and then show them this picture.
If you need something festive perhaps mention that summer heat waves have destroyed one third of the Christmas tree crops in the UK, something already well known in Australia.
If you do have to quote facts and figures, use graphs to bring them to life. These animated charts of global temperature over time are compelling and this collection of 10 graphs is a little dated but still worth bookmarking.
Chances are you’re not going to meet outright deniers this Christmas. The overwhelming majority of people believe in global warming – 73% of the Australian public at last count.
The problem is urgency. So make your conversations about the tangible present with solutions. This might mean talking about smaller things first so it doesn’t sound so big and difficult to deal with that it is overwhelming.
Talk about the droughts across Australia. The fires in Queensland and California. The increased severity of storms and hurricanes such as those that hit Florida and Houston or the single cyclone that wiped out more than 60% of Vanuatu’s economy.
Keep things real, immediate, and tangible.
In the case that you do run into deniers, or denialist rhetoric, it’s important to resist the urge to repeat false claims while attempting to refute them.
I’ve written before about the downsides of acting as a publicist for views you disagree with. In short, it’s counterproductive and usually ends up strengthening the other side’s arguments. You want to avoid repeating claims – but by all means refute them forcefully. 
An example of this would be if someone raises scientific consensus. You say “more scientists agree on global warming than on plate tectonics” but don’t repeat whatever claim has prompted this.
Then there is framing. A frame is a theory that suggests that how something is presented to an audience can influence how people process that information.
Think about the “carbon tax”. This was either a failure or triumph of framing depending on how you look at it. The ETS was actually not a tax, in fact, as this article  explains, it’s kind of the opposite.
But still, it was framed as a tax. People don’t like taxes. Opposition built. Election were lost. The tax that was not a tax was scrapped.
We can learn from this.
In 2003 Republican consultant Frank Luntz laid out the climate strategy used by conservatives for the last 15 years. This was leaked in a memo and included advice such as using the term “climate change” instead of “global warming” because it sounded more natural and less alarming. This has led to the often repeated “climate is always changing” argument.
To counter this framing you have to not engage with it but to push a different, more compelling, frame – Lakoff suggests “climate crisis” but global warming also works.
This is about all of our futures – our lives, our quality of life, and that of our children. Keep it in that frame and you’re a lot closer to changing minds.
Non-violent communication (NVC) is a methodology created by psychologist Marshall Rosenberg as a way to bridge communication divides by focusing on universal human needs.
While it sounds quite touchy-feely, it is used by everyone from companies to personal therapists, and even hostage negotiators. NVC is all about listening, repeating, asking questions, and thinking about what needs are being expressed.
You begin with neutral observation and repetition. These conversations can degenerate to yelling matches without people even realising what the other is trying to say.
If someone tells you “climate change is natural” and that they’re sick of alarmists, NVC advises repeating back “I’m hearing you say that what’s happening is normal and people are exaggerating the dangers, is that right”.
In conversations that can quickly devolve into sloganistic shouting the process of simply hearing what the person says is enough to defuse the emotional charge.
The second step is to talk about emotions rather than policy positions or facts, which should sound familiar by now.
If someone tells you they are sick of the “climate change cult” and “lying scientists”, ask them what they are feeling rather than arguing about something they are already upset about.
Do they feel confused, angry, overwhelmed, incredulous? Talking about the feeling behind the statement and your own feelings can help you start to see things from each others perspective, as long as you are doing it respectfully.
That’s a lot of talking about feelings but I assure you, this is effective – you can probably see now why I brought up hostage negotiations at the start.
Step three is to identify what need is being expressed – you can find a list here. I’ve written before about the empowering belief of climate denialism – and what a relief it would be if it were true.
The truth is that people don’t simply believe things. They hold beliefs because they empower them or give them utility. Try to understand what that utility or empowerment is.
The final step is a request. Ask the person if they would be willing to look at one of the graphs above, or read a first person piece from a firefighter, a farmer, or a soldier.
The main thing is to keep trying.
Stress the urgency, try to understand where people come from, have the conversations. This affects us all.

What, I believe, Comfortablyplumb is advocating is pretty much the same as my view and that of most who rationally and objectively study the issues and/or work in the energy sector. We need to use all the tools available to us in the most appropriate manner. On the demand side better energy conservation and demand management, on the supply side renewables of all types appropriate to any given area, CCS and nuclear power.Furthermore publications like the Guardian should fully appreciate the existential threat of climate change and stop the petty tribalism (in search of increased readership) of playing both technologies and politics off against each other.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1544874898000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'100526028', u'in_reply_to': u'123767951', u'id': u'123772129', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ComfortablyPlumb', u'text': u'BQSTART
I think that the reason for this is that the fossil fuel industry never saw nuclear power as a threat, so why oppose it?
BQENDI don't think that is true - nuclear power is campaigned about not just by the coal sector, but coal mining unions too.
In Germany, a weakened coalition was forced to simultaneously accede to the wishes of the coal unions and the Green party and agree to phase out nuclear, with only coal power to replace it - a move which, with all the activity in the energiewende, pleased both sides as well as giving the appearance of being a 'Green' policy except that it completely counterbalanced their massive investment in renewables with a net result of no fall in emissions.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1544873859000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'14842422', u'in_reply_to': u'123722407', u'id': u'123771604', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'chrisbrown', u'text': u'Good and evil are not helpful concepts for understanding the situation we find ourselves in.

Wilson was the first to drive ... and like lemmings they all followed his bad example.
Until world leaders stop wasting fossil fuels on their travelling which is inessential in the age of video conferencing, no one will believe those who do not lead by example. The rich and famous celebrity whinging about climate change while jetting about are just as bad... do as I say, not as I do. Al Gore's carbon footprint made a mockery of his concern for the planet.
The only solution is population control - other ideas are mere figleaves to gain the impression of doing something which in the great scheme of things is pretty pointless when hundreds of coal fired power stations are being built, nuclear stations decommissioned, forests burnt down, and ever more vehicles on the roads of the planet.

Your question carries the hidden assumption that the greenhouse properties of CO2 are affected by its concentration.

It's the amount of CO2 that matters, not its concentration. There are about 3 trillion tonnes of atmospheric CO2 (up from about 2 trillion pre-industrial).

AR5 concluded that collapse of the overturning circulation would cause significant global-scale climate disruption, including abrupt cooling around the North Atlantic. Weakening was expected in the 21st century, but an abrupt collapse was not, unless models seriously underestimate sensitivity to heat or freshwater, or the input of meltwater from Greenland is much faster than expected.... Based on current models, significant but gradual reductions in strength of the overturning circulation are expected if warming continues. However, sudden ocean circulation collapse remains unlikely, while still not being excluded, especially beyond 2100.

Human-caused climate change was behind 15 deadly weather disasters in 2017, including droughts, floods and heatwaves. The world’s leading climate scientists, in a special report for the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), have warned that there is only a dozen years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C. To meet that target, global carbon emissions need to drop by 45% by 2030. Instead they are going up. We need radical, urgent change. So it is appalling that negotiators in Poland at the 24th Conference of the Parties, or COP24, are finding it so hard to push ahead with implementing the climate deal signed three years ago in Paris.
This is largely because rising rightwing nationalism has vitiated the global solidarity needed to avoid a catastrophe. Under the Paris agreement, effective action to tackle climate change requires global cooperation on three fronts: first, nations set demanding carbon-reduction targets for their own societies; second, countries are held accountable for meeting these targets through surveillance mechanisms; and third, rich states provide cash for poorer ones to transition to a carbon-free future. Yet none of this is possible when the most important actors on the world stage think that the chief business of the nation state lies at home. The biggest problem is the US president, Donald Trump – a longtime climate-change denier. While negotiators were discussing how to lower carbon emissions, Mr Trump’s officials unveiled two schemes promoting fossil fuels. The US’s rogue behaviour has encouraged others to behave badly: notably Saudi Arabia, which played a key role in attempts to wreck the summit’s “welcoming” of the IPCC report. Last month, Brazil’s president-elect, Jair Bolsonaro, chose as his foreign minister a climate-change denier, and the nation has pulled out of hosting COP25. The top European leaders – Emmanuel Macron, Theresa May and Angela Merkel – are inwardly focused, leaving Poland, the current talks’ host, to sing the virtues of its large coal stocks. The other big players are India and China: the latter has the global heft but is not internationally deft; for the former, the opposite is true.
Public opinion is way ahead of national politics. In the US there has been a definite shift in beliefs: more than 80% of Americans, including most Republicans, believe climate change is happening. Tens of thousands of people in Brussels marched ahead of the summit in Poland. The collapse of the planet’s biosphere has permeated the public consciousness. This means that there are breakthroughs: Poland relented to create a group that will make sure the summit’s goals will be ambitious. Germany has stumped up extra cash to ensure funding pledges are met. Even the US has been allowed to play a constructive role in creating rules by which nations agree to abide by in meeting climate targets – because everyone has an interest in creating a backdoor for Washington to re-enter the agreement. About 80% of all energy traded is oil, coal or gas. The world’s economy runs on fossil fuel, which is destroying our planet.

In The Graun and elsewhere there is much disgust and self-righteousness expressed at people who are categorised as -- ugh -- not even The Right but The FAR Right because those people seem to want... well; what do they want? They seem to want a kind of democracy more immediate than that of electing an MP or equivalent every few years and they want to live in a community that is their kind of community and they want those things without having to be aligned to some club or group that is political or economic.
I look at this and wonder why it is perceived as so bad. Many Frenchmen want to be French, Germans German, Britons British, and to belong to smaller social structures too, such as being a Geordie, a Londoner, or, smaller still, a member of a family.
The Blairs (is it fair to single him out?) of this world have tried to jam multicultural this and that down people's throats. Patently many people enjoy being in the social group in which they grew-up and don't like being told that they shouldn't, particularly by someone who is distant in several senses.
Perhaps populism, nationalism, patriotism, regionalism or whatever anthropologists care to call it should be embraced, even lauded, as a mechanism for binding people together that works. Modern communications enable us to see how people are in Country-X or Area-Y and perhaps to adopt some of their practices -- but without having 100s of them imposed upon our village or town and being told we must tread carefully in the area in which they, as we would in similar circumstances, have congregated, lest we, behaving as is our habit, offend their sensibilities.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1544770860000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'those people seem to want', u'effect': u'right'}], u'author_id': u'17141403', u'id': u'123725471', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'JohnHughes', u'text': u'BQSTART

It seems there is. In the US, according to Dunn and Norton, the standard falls around $75,000. Researchers at Princeton examined Gallup poll data from nearly 500,000 US households and found that higher family incomes were related to better moods on a day to day basis. However, the positive effects of money had no effect on people's happiness and moods after a level of $ 75,000.00 was attained.

The result is that like the anti Iraq war march, it achieves a flash in the pan and does not move public policy. Decades of nonviolence have basically achieved nothing except teaching the police how to demoralize crowds.
What works in practise is a broad, community rooted, committed movement that shows the willingness to smash. That permits a violent reaction from the police but it also permits escalation by the protesters that puts the authorities in a position of either declaring war on their own entire public (impossible, the country would grind to a halt) or trying to negotiate.
Smashing here can be directed against property and the working of infrastructure (such as slow driving protests on the motorway). But it also implies the willingness to battle cops when they try to re-impose the status quo with force.
It's vital, even if you aren't inclined to smash, that you express support for ""a diversity of tactics"".

It isn’t the first and it won’t be the last. Occupy, the Arab spring and #MeToo are other recent examples of this new politics. Some of it is good. Some of it is not: a leaderless movement, self-organised on Reddit, helped elect Donald Trump. But leaderless movements are spreading, and we need to understand where they come from, what is legitimate action and, if you want to start one, what works and what doesn’t.
Leaderless movements spring from frustration with conventional top-down politics, a frustration shared by many
The Arab spring began with the self-immolation of one despairing young man in Tunisia; the revolt rapidly spread across the region, just as protests have proliferated in France. In highly connected complex systems, such as the world today, the action of a single agent can suddenly trigger what complexity theorists call a “phase shift” across the entire system.
We cannot predict which agent or what event might be that trigger. But we already know that the multiplying connections of our worldoffer an unprecedented opportunity for the rise and spread of leaderless movements.
Leaderless movements spring from frustration with conventional top-down politics, a frustration shared by many, not only those on the streets. Polls suggest the gilets jaunes are supported by a large majority of the French public. Who believes that writing to your MP, or signing a petition to No 10 makes any difference to problems such as inequality, the chronic housing shortage or the emerging climate disaster? Even voting feels like a feeble response to these deep-seated problems that are functions not only of government policies but more of the economic system itself.
What such movements oppose is usually clear, but what they propose is inevitably less so: that is their nature. The serial popular uprisings of the Arab spring all rejected authoritarian rule, whether in Tunisia, Egypt or Syria. But in most places there was no agreement about what kind of government should replace the dictators. In Eygpt, the Tahrir Square protests failed to create an organised democratic political party that could win an election. Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood, long highly organised and thus prepared for such a moment, stepped into the political vacuum. In turn, this provoked further mass protest, which eventually brought to power another dictatorship as repressive as Hosni Mubarak’s.
When the demand is for change in social relations– norms more than laws – such as the end of sexual harassment, the results can be as rapid but also more enduring and positive. The #MeToo movement has provoked questioning of gender relations across the world. The British deputy prime minister, Damian Green, was forced to resign; in India, a cabinet minister. The effects are uneven, and far from universal, but sexual harassers have been outed and ousted from positions of power in the media, NGOs and governments.
Some mass action has required leadership. The race discrimination that confronted the US civil rights movement was deeply entrenched in both American society and its laws. Martin Luther King and other leaders paid exquisite attention to strategy, switching tactics according to what worked and what didn’t. King correctly judged, however, that real and lasting equality required the reform of capitalism – a change in the system itself. In a sense, his objective went from the singular to the plural. And that is where his campaign hit the rocks. Momentum dissipated when King started to talk about economic equality: there was no agreement on the diagnosis, or the solution.
The Occupy movement faced a similar problem. It succeeded in inserting inequality and economic injustice into the mainstream political conversation – politicians had avoided the topic before. But Occupy couldn’t articulate a specific political programme to reform the system. I was in Zuccotti Park in New York City, where the protest movement began, when the “general assembly” invited the participants to pin notes listing their demands on to trees. Ideas were soon plastered up, from petitioning Washington DC to replacing the dollar – many of which, of course, were irreconcilable with each other.
This is why a leaderless response to the climate change disaster is tricky. It’s striking that in Emmanuel Macron’s fuel tax rises the gilets jaunes opposed the very thing demanded by Extinction Rebellion, Britain’s newly minted leaderless movement: aggressive policies to reduce carbon emissions to net zero. Macron’s proposals would have hit the poorest hardest, illustrating that resolving the crises of the environment and inequality requires a more comprehensive, carefully wrought solution to both. But leaderless movements have largely proved incapable of such complicated decision-making, as anyone at Zuccotti Park will attest.
Conventional party politicians, reasserting their own claim to legitimacy, insist that such problems can only be arbitrated by imposing more top-down policy. But when most feel powerless about the things that matter, this may only provoke further protests.
Ultimately, to address profound systemic challenges, we shall need new participatory and inclusive decision-making structures to negotiate the difficult choices. An example of these forums has emerged in parts of Syria, of all places. Rightly, this is precisely what the Extinction Rebellion is also demanding.
Inevitably, leaderless movements face questions about their legitimacy. One answer lies in their methods. The Macron government has exploited the violence seen in Paris and elsewhere to claim that the gilets jaunes movement is illegitimate and anti-democratic. Mahatma Gandhi, and later King, realised that nonviolent action – such as the satyagraha salt march or the Montgomery bus boycott – denies the authorities this line of attack. On the contrary, the violence used by those authorities – the British colonial government or the police of the southern US states – against nonviolent protestors helped build their own legitimacy and attracted global attention.
Complexity science tells us something else important. System-wide shifts happen when the system is primed for change, at so-called criticality. In the Middle East there was almost universal anger at the existing political status quo, so it took only one match to light the fire of revolt. Meeting people in colleges and towns across the UK but also in the US (where I lived until recently) you can hear the mounting frustration with a political and economic system that is totally unresponsive to the needs of the 99%, and offers no credible answer to the climate emergency.
There will be more leaderless movements to express this frustration, just as there will be more rightwing demagogues, like Trump or Boris Johnson, who seek to exploit it to their own advantage. For the right ones to prevail, we must insist on nonviolence as well as commitment to dialogue with – and not denunciation of – those who disagree. Messily, a new form of politics is upon us, and we must ensure that it peacefully and democratically produces deep systematic reform, not the counter-reaction of the authoritarians. Get ready.

The conference will mark a vital deadline for countries to comply with their commitments on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and move on to tougher targets for the decade to 2030, and so it is likely to be a fractious affair.
If successful, the move would be a strong signal of the UK government’s determination to retain its role on the world stage after Brexit.
Claire Perry, the climate change minister, flew to Poland on Thursday after taking part in the Conservative party’s vote on Theresa May’s future, which she called “24 hours of political self-indulgence”.
Perry told journalists: “We have to make sure we can deliver a good COP [Conference of the Parties], as 2020 will be a really vital COP, and we absolutely want to be part of that process [of making it a success].”
She pointed to the UK’s efforts in cutting greenhouse gas emissions and investing in green jobs, saying Britain had decarbonised faster per unit of GDP than any other country in the past decade, and created 400,000 jobs in the low-carbon economy. “We have a really good track record in the UK,” she said.
In Poland, the UK joined with other EU member states and scores of developing countries in committing to scale up their ambition on climate change, with a focus on preventing global warming from breaching 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, in line with scientific warnings.
The UN awards the hosting of the COP, as the annual meeting is known, usually by alternating among developed and developing countries, and different continents, though the rules can be somewhat flexible. Next year’s host was supposed to be Brazil, but the incoming president, Jair Bolsonaro, is hostile to the Paris agreement and has withdrawn the offer. Chile and Costa Rica are understood to be considering alternative bids.
Some campaigners at the current climate change talks in Poland, which have stalled over continuing disagreements on how to implement the Paris agreement, praised the UK’s move.
Gareth Redmond-King, the head of climate change at WWF UK, said: “This is great news and we welcome the bid to host the 2020 [conference]. It’s an opportunity for the UK to lead the way on climate change at a time when the need for action has never been starker.”
COP26, as the 2020 conference is known in UN jargon, will also be notable for the role of the US. Under Donald Trump’s presidency, the country has begun the process of withdrawal from the Paris agreement, but that could be halted if he is replaced in the 2020 election.
Bolsonaro has indicated he may take Brazil out of the Paris agreement, and the divisions between developed and developing countries that have characterised the current talks are likely to remain in the intervening years, giving the UK a diplomatic mountain to climb to make a success of the talks if awarded host-country status.

Happily, there are thinkers such as Thomas Piketty to tell us how it could all be so different. A new plan for the EU, devised by the French economist and dozens of other Europeans, takes aim at some of these perennial problems – and offers some tentative solutions.
It seems particularly relevant, at a time when France’s gilets jaunes are tearing up Paris because of grinding austerity, that here is a plan that would raise money from big multinationals, not struggling families.
It also seems apposite that, with few concrete plans to deliver the cuts in carbon emissions required to keep the planet from overheating, here is a plan that would set a firm carbon price.
It feels urgent that, at a time when immigration and asylum have upended European politics, here at last is a proposal for funding a response. And any plan to make the EU more lovable is surely overdue: the British predicament is a testament to that.
Prospects for enacting the Piketty plan may be slim, given Europe’s perennial difficulty in finding consensus: not even everyone on the left will agree, as Yanis Varoufakis makes clear in this piece about his own plan to revive the EU. 
But at least it’s a plan.
Elsewhere, one of our abiding themes in 2018 has been homelessness, an issue that always comes to the fore at this time of year. With rates climbing in many wealthy countries, it was good to hear of the remarkable work by a Dublin doctor to try to make a difference.
Finally: the Russian robot that turned out to be a man in a suit, the Santa who lost his cool and started swearing, and the Londoners who replied with typically dry humour to a New York Times request for victims of petty crime to come forward.
This article, published by Ensia, delved into the mistakes Japan made in reforesting landscapes after the second world war, and the lessons it holds for other countries aiming to plant millions of trees in coming years to sequester carbon.
Also, as the COP climate talks concluded in Poland, we salute our colleagues at Le Monde for their series on measures to fight global warming, including the Swedish neighbourhood powered entirely by renewables (this article is in French).

The result will not be the breakthrough campaigners and some countries were hoping for, but will keep discussions alive on formulating key aspects of the implementation rules for the 2015 Paris accord.
Delegates have been thrashing out a text on the complex mechanisms required to put the Paris goals into effect for the past two weeks, and appeared partly successful as the talks overran their Friday deadline and looked likely to continue into late afternoon on Saturday at least.
The text will give countries clarity on key points such as accounting for their greenhouse gas emissions and recording their carbon reductions. They will also go some way to encourage the stepping up of each country’s climate change efforts.
Among the issues holding up progress is the highly technical question of what should happen to the market for carbon credits, held by some countries in recognition of their emissions-cutting efforts and their carbon sinks, such as forests.
These credits count toward countries’ emissions-cutting targets. Brazil introduced wording that would benefit the country for its huge rainforest cover, but critics said contained loopholes that allowed for double counting of carbon credits would severely undermine the integrity of the system.
That question is unlikely to be resolved in the time remaining, but gave an indication of Brazil’s likely stance in future talks. Next year’s conference was supposed to be held in Brazil, but will take place in Chile because Brazil’s incoming president, Jair Bolsonaro, withdrew the offer to host.
Brazil has been a reliable supporter of the annual talks in the past and has worked to broker deals between the developed and developing world. Without that support in future, the talks are only likely to grow more fractious.
The US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have also played a disruptive role, watering down a resolution that would have welcomed the recent IPCC report that a temperature rise of 1.5C would have dire consequences.
The compromise in the redrafted text would have all countries “welcome the timely completion” of the IPCC report, but campaigners pointed out that this was weak because it refers merely to the timing of the report rather than its content. The EU, by contrast, and several other developed countries joined with scores of developing nations in announcing they would focus on preventing a 1.5C rise in their carbon-cutting efforts.
There were few new offers from the rich world of financing for developing countries to help them cut emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change, another issue that has been pushed to future talks.
As the last-minute negotiations wore on, delegates were saddened to hear of the death overnight of the veteran Philippine negotiator, Bernaditas de Castro Muller, who was a notable presence at the talks for nearly three decades.

After last-minute wrangling over wording, late on Saturday night delegates in Poland finally agreed a text that contains most of the “rulebook” needed to guide countries’ implementation of the Paris goals.
These include complex technical issues such as how countries should measure and report on their greenhouse gas emissions, and account for progress on meeting their commitments on curbing carbon, with an agreement to work on setting new targets for financial assistance to poor countries. Resolving these should mean countries can move ahead with meeting their targets.
“This is a good agreement,” the European commissioner Miguel Cañete told the Guardian. “We have more to do but we can move forward now.”
Nicholas Stern, author of the seminal review of the economics of climate change, said: “This has been another summit of tough negotiations, but it has ultimately succeeded in its crucial primary task of agreeing the so-called rulebook for the Paris agreement.”
One important issue that could not be resolved was over carbon markets, and how countries can gain credits for their efforts to cut emissions and their carbon sinks, such as forests, which absorb carbon dioxide. After Brazil, which hopes to benefit from its huge rainforest cover, insisted on wording that critics said would allow for double counting of credits and undermine the integrity of the system, this issue was postponed until next year.
While the conference broadly succeeded within its narrow technical remit, however, key questions on tackling climate change were ignored or put off. Foremost among these is the inadequacy of countries’ current national targets for curbing greenhouse gases. With current targets, the world is likely to face 3C or more of warming, which scientists warn would bring disaster.
Paul Bledsoe, a former climate adviser to President Bill Clinton, said: “Gaining a strong regime of accounting for emissions is an essential step on getting a handle on global emissions, and a major achievement. But the biggest breakthroughs on emissions cuts must be done at the head of state level over the next several years, not in a few days by ministerial negotiators.”
The conference also failed to take account of the warnings by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the global body of the world’s leading climate scientists, which only two months ago presented a bleak picture of the damage that would be done if global temperature rises reached or exceeded 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.
The panel said that the result would be heatwaves, droughts, floods, the die-off of coral reefs, and the decline of agricultural productivity in large swathes of the world. The Paris agreement binds countries to avoid a 2C temperature rise, with an aspiration to limit warming to no more than 1.5C. Time is running out: the IPCC’s findings imply that there is about a decade left to set the world on a new track.
This year was the fourth hottest on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization, and extreme weather – such as the heatwave in the UK, wildfires in Europe and the US, floods in India and storms in south-east Asia – affected every continent.
Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace, said: “A year of climate disasters and a dire warning from the world’s top scientists should have led to so much more. Instead, governments let the people down again as they ignored the science and the plight of the vulnerable. Adopting a set of rules for climate action is not nearly enough; without immediate action, even the strongest rules will not get us anywhere.”
The two-week conference, known as COP24, in Poland’s coal-fuelled heartland started with Sir David Attenborough warning of the collapse of civilisation if untrammelled climate change were allowed to take hold. “Right now, we are facing a manmade disaster of global scale, our greatest threat in thousands of years: climate change,” the veteran broadcaster and naturalist told delegates. “If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.”
The secretary general of the UN, António Guterres, also stepped up his rhetoric, warning it would be “immoral and suicidal” to fail to take strong action.
The 15-year-old Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg, whose strike to raise awareness of the issue drew global attention, was scathing in her speech to the conference: “You’re not mature enough to tell it like it is. Even that burden you leave to your children.”
There were encouraging signs of shifting geopolitics at the talks. China and the EU were able to settle differences on how to account for and verify greenhouse gas emissions, and the EU and a handful of other rich countries joined with scores of developing nations in promising to focus on the 1.5C limit in setting their future emissions-cutting targets.
But while the conference ended in a show of unity, with the Polish minister in charge leaping from the podium table into the audience in glee as it finally closed 30 hours after the deadline, the talks also displayed new rift lines.
Brazil, under its incoming president, Jair Bolsonaro, who is hostile to the Paris agreement and sceptical of climate science, held up agreement for nearly a day by insisting on a change to the rules on carbon credits that critics say would undermine the system. That decision has been put off to next year, but the stance of Brazil under Bolsonaro – he also withdrew Brazil’s offer to host next year’s conference – troubles many other countries. Brazil previously acted as a powerbroker between developed and developing nations, and without that role future talks may be more acrimonious.
The US also showed how Donald Trump’s presidency is changing its role, when it joined with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to prevent the conference from fully embracing the IPCC’s findings. In previous years, while Saudi Arabia has played an obstructive and delaying role behind closed doors, it has rarely been willing to take a public stance against agreement, and Russia has remained largely quiet since allowing for the adoption of the Kyoto protocol in 2004. Australia, which has played a shifting role in the talks under successive governments, also joined with US supporters in a celebration of coal.
It seems that Trump’s hostility to climate science is emboldening other countries to take a more aggressive role in fighting progress. David Waskow, of the World Resources Institute, told the Guardian: “[The US’s new stance] is giving these countries more space for what they want to do.”
Despite the progress made at this year’s talks, some believe that the UN process will always be too slow to measure up to the scale and urgency of the problems, and new ways should be found to take action independently.
Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said: “In the climate emergency we’re now in, slow success is no success. [The rulebook] is decades too late. It should be clear that the UN consensus process can never produce the muscular agreement we need to meet the emergency.”
He advocates sectoral agreements for heavy industries such as steel, aluminium and cement that would require companies in those industries to reduce their emissions, removing any competitive disadvantage to businesses in being first-movers in cutting carbon.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/16/katowice-we-can-move-forward-now-un-climate-talks-take-significant-step

The only way of replacing fossil fuels is via hydrogen.
BQENDGood post, but I'd say that whilst it's certainly major, it is not the
only way.
 At present, 95% of our hydrogen supply comes from Natural Gas.
We can CCS that and replace some with biogas and, if we're being pragmatic, GMO algae and gen IV nuclear (VHTR) which can in all likelihood produce (electricity and) industrial levels of hydrogen more cost effectively than electrolysis powered by a.n.other low carbon source.
Another tool is to decarbonise our supply lines.60% of our gas is imported and a large proportion of that (150,000GWh) is LNG.
It's unpopular, but if we extracted our own instead of importing it then we save a lot of carbon.
Imported LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) is 21.05kgCO₂ (e)/GJ whereas domestic natural extracted gas is 5.9kgCO₂(e)/GJSo that would be a total saving of 8,180,999,985kg of CO₂ if we fracced our own gas instead of importing LNG at current levels.
That may not sound particularly massive - but the per capita emission in the UK is circa 8 tonnes of CO₂.
In other words, this simple measure would completely eliminate the carbon of approaching one million British people.

There is no way we can replace all energy use via electricity alone. For example, in most European countries gas demand and electricity demand are approximately equal. So we can't just double the electricity grid; and there are issues with storage and transmission that can't be solved via the electricity grid alone; the gas grid supplies 5-7 times the peak load of the electricity grid. 
So really, the answer to solving climate change lies in how quickly we can understand that hydrogen represents the only means of decarbonising gas. And a lot of this gas will need to be met with CCS. We just won't double the capacity of renewables within the 2050 timeframe. 
So putting all this together (no other option exists); we end up with - ""how do we legislate to ensure all gas use is decarbonised via CCS?""
This means we need to have carbon pricing mechanisms pay for the implementation of reformers to take the carbon out of gas. We need to have a completely decarbonised gas grid. And this means we need to start changing some gas burners to hydrogen; some gas turbines. 
Its going to be difficult to plan how this should occur without large regions switching to hydrogen so that we can see how everything works out. But really, this is what the talks need to be about - this is a technical problem in many respects.
I just don't think that enough people have fully understood what its going to take to decarbonise, or have a clear understanding of what must happen. 
The gas grid needs to be decarbonised. Its as simple as that; and more people should read the studies and accept this fact - there is no other way to do it.

Not double, in other words. The text – again, full disclosure, which I co-authored – says the key processes in the 2016 study were simply represented and are still poorly understood, and that their triggering by future warming is uncertain. The Met Office scientists decided to use an older study of Antarctica led by Anders Levermann instead: one that does not include this catastrophic ice cliff collapse, and that agrees with other studies published since the IPCC. A bit higher, but not much. The news is bad, but could have been worse.

Massive release of hydrogen sulfide to the surface ocean and atmosphere during intervals of oceanic anoxia 
Simple calculations show that if deep-water H2S concentrations increased beyond a critical threshold during oceanic anoxic intervals of Earth history, the chemocline separating sulfidic deep waters from oxygenated surface waters could have risen abruptly to the ocean surface (a chemocline upward excursion). 
Atmospheric photochemical modeling indicates that resulting fluxes of H2S to the atmosphere (>2000 times the small modern flux from volcanoes) would likely have led to toxic levels of H2S in the atmosphere. 
Moreover, the ozone shield would have been destroyed, and methane levels would have risen to >100 ppm. 
We thus propose (1) chemocline upward excursion as a kill mechanism during the end-Permian, Late Devonian, and Cenomanian–Turonian extinctions, and (2) persistently high atmospheric H2S levels as a factor that impeded evolution of eukaryotic life on land during the Proterozoic.

This is really a very huge problem. The surface waters of the ocean are warmer and hence less dense than in the deep ocean. So it takes a lot of energy to turn the ocean over, takes around 1,000 years.
Now, as the surface warms faster than the depths, it gets less dense, so it is even harder to turn the ocean over. So it gets more strongly stratified.
The nutrient-rich waters from the depths, which feed great fisheries like the anchoveta and sardine, slow their journey to the surface while oxygen-rich surface waters slow their journey to the depths and the ocean turns to desert.

It's common sense to realise that a warmer climate with the same rainfall can result in more evaporation and lower soil moisture resulting in drought.
The increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall events with global warming is well documented and leads to increased flooding. While this may seem to contradict the preceding paragraph, the increase in extreme rainfall events occurs at the expense of moderate rainfall events. This can lead to drought and flood occurring in the same year as we just seen in South Eastern Australia.
Heatwaves and extremely hot days have increased in both frequency and duration of the former as our climate has warmed. With increased evaporation and reduced soil moisture fire seasons have increased in both length and area affected.
Global warming has decreased the high latitude temperature gradient reducing the energy of the jetstream causing weather patterns to remain in place. This can cause intense cold snaps that last for weeks as I found on my only visit to such latitudes.
What you call the ""Ice age"" is a popular term for the glacial periods, which, interspersed with interglacial periods, have been a characteristic of the last 2.6 million years of this planets history. During glacial periods Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation (NHHLSI) which varies over periods of roughly 100,000 years due to orbital and axial cycles, is low. Atmospheric CO2 drops to 290 to 200 ppm. Glacials are ended by a NHHLSI peak accompanied within 1,000 years by rising CO2 and global greenhouse warming for 10,000 years causing glacial continental ice sheets to retreat as CO2 reaches the interglacial level of around 280 ppm 
 The last glacial period ended 9,000 years ago and NHHLSI has continued to decline. The global warming of the last 150 years has been due to an increase in atmospheric CO2 from 280 to more than 400 ppm due to people extracting and burning fossil fuels.

Ever since President Trump’s announcement in 2017 that the US would withdraw from the Paris agreement, the question has been whether the UN process could continue to work. Much like the communique that came out of the recent G20, the agreement on a set of rules to implement promises made in Paris shows that while multilateralism has been damaged, it is not dead. Flawed and inadequate though it is, the process that has developed since the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed in Rio in 1992 is still the best hope we have of staving off the most terrifying impacts of global warming.
The sticking point of carbon credits, with new demands from Brazil regarding the treatment of forests, was pushed back to next year. But the agreement on how governments will measure and report on emissions cuts is important. The dynamic that previously pitted developing against developed countries has significantly shifted.
Minds will now turn to the next deadline: 2020, when countries must demonstrate that they have met old targets and set new, much tougher ones. This round of talks, which the UK aims to host, is even more crucial following recent warnings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that current goals are nowhere near ambitious enough. While these set the planet on a course towards a 3C rise in temperatures, scientists believe even 1.5C would bring serious consequences. We have around 12 years in which to bring an unstable situation under control.
Drastic changes to the global economy are the only option, underpinned by a rapid shift to low and zero-carbon energy, along with adaptation and mitigation measures including new mechanisms to manage migration. The US’s refusal, in Poland, to embrace the IPCC’s findings, along with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, was wrong-headed and a hint of troubles ahead. Next year UN secretary general António Guterres will attempt to break the logjam when he hosts a climate summit with heads of state.
Once, the UK claimed a global leadership role on the environment, which was at least partly justified by the 2008 Climate Change Act. Political paralysis connected to Brexit is not the only reason why it now sits on the margins, while increasing cooperation between the EU and China is one of the more hopeful recent signs. The UK’s bid to host the 2020 summit should focus minds, not least on the contradictions of an energy policy that combines phasing out coal with the promotion of fracking. While the UN framework is essential, it cannot do the heavy lifting of cutting emissions, which will be done by nation states or not at all.
This month’s pledge by Danish shipping giant Maersk to be carbon neutral by 2050 was important. Businesses too have a responsibility to the societies in which they operate. But governments cannot wait for the private sector, let alone the energy companies on whose riches so much of the global economy rests. They, and the politicians who champion them, are the vested interests against whom the battle for the future must be fought. Some long-term investors are starting to recognise the risks. So are more and more people, as extreme weather linked to warmer temperatures becomes more frequent. Greta Thunberg, the 15-year-old Swedish activist who addressed the UN in Poland, was right to say “the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/16/the-guardian-view-on-cop24-while-climate-talks-continue-there-is-hope

The name was chosen by the boss of EnviroBuild, a sustainable building materials company, who paid $25,000 (£19,800) at an auction for the right. The small legless creature was found in Panama and EnviroBuild’s Aidan Bell said its ability to bury its head in the ground matched Donald Trump’s approach to global warming.
Trump’s distinctive hair has already led to comparisons to a poisonous furry caterpillar and a golden-plumed pheasant, while a yellow-crowned moth was called Neopalpa donaldtrumpi in 2017.
Climate change is already harming Americans’ lives, from wildfires to floods, and will get worse, according to a US government report published in November. Trump’s response to the report was: “I don’t believe it.”
The only event his administration put on at the recent UN climate summit in Poland extolled the virtues of fossil fuels, to cries of “shame on you” from protesters.
The newly discovered creature is a caecilian and its naming rights were auctioned to raise money for the Rainforest Trust. The scientists who found the 10cm amphibian have agreed to use the name Dermophis donaldtrumpi when they officially publish the discovery in scientific literature.
Bell said: “It is the perfect name. Caecilian is taken from the Latin caecus, meaning ‘blind’, perfectly mirroring the strategic vision President Trump has consistently shown towards climate change.”
As an amphibian, the shiny animal is particularly susceptible to the impacts of global warming and is therefore in danger of becoming extinct as a result of its namesake’s climate policies, the Rainforest Trust said.
Chris Redston, the executive director of Rainforest Trust UK, said: “Protecting the world’s remaining rainforests is acknowledged as one of the most effective ways to mitigate climate change, yet every day nearly 70,000 acres of rainforest are destroyed forever.
“This destruction is not only one of the main causes of climate change, but it is also having a devastating impact on endangered wildlife, indigenous communities and the planet’s weather patterns.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/18/blind-amphibian-named-after-trumps-climate-change-stance

Talking with evangelicals about climate change,article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/19/talking-with-evangelicals-about-climate-change-south,0,"I was, frankly, nervous about speaking to people of faith in the south about climate change. I wrestled with my own preconceived notions and past experiences, and was surprised when conversations took inspiring, if not transcendent, turns.
Secular as I am now, I still think fondly of my childhood minister, Dr Lehman, who loved college basketball and Honda Accords (he drove 13 of them during his lifetime). At the conclusion of each Lakeside Baptist service, he’d call the eastern North Carolina congregation to action.
“Go forth,” he said as the organ began to play, “and be involved in the world.”
My family later moved to Spartanburg, South Carolina, and my high school experience felt ripped from the pages of the Footloose script. Local parents disowned gay sons; classmates openly questioned the science of evolution in biology class; Young Life leaders plastered an Abstinence Pledge on the wall of our public school cafeteria.
My frustration from those years has at times stopped me from reaching out to those in the faith-based community, especially regarding political issues like climate change. I’m aware of my own bias, the way it was formed by negative experiences, and how it limits my understanding of believers and their choices. This realization helps me understand why believers might in turn have problems connecting with someone like me.
But if we’re going to address climate change in time to prevent catastrophic results, we’re going to do it by taking cooperative action with those with whom we disagree. I find myself wondering if similar discussions are happening in faith-based communities, and why there hasn’t been a more palpable response to climate change among people of faith in the south.
While climate change scenarios have all the hallmarks of biblical narrative – violent storms, epic floods, plagues, resource scarcity, the displacement of people – it’s considered liberal political terrain. Scott Coleman, a practicing Baptist and the amiable environmental manager of Little St Simons Island, a mostly undeveloped strip of shoreline off the coast of Georgia, tells me that “environmental stewardship is often associated with liberal politics, thus looked upon negatively”.
The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.
The political power of the pulpit is undeniable, even in the post-Billy Graham south, where in many states nearly half of all citizens attend church services.
I can’t help but imagine the sheer impact a faith-based movement could have on expediting climate action. Scott Coleman agrees. “I think that if our faith leaders in the south were more outspoken about the importance of creation care, it would go a long way in helping to depoliticize environmental issues in our region,” he says. “And if we could depoliticize environmental stewardship in the south, imagine the progress we could make with elevating environmental stewardship in southern culture.”
I spoke with people of faith in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia, and it became clear that the primary barrier to climate action is the fact that it’s been yoked with the liberal agenda. Climate activist and author Anna Jane Joyner, whose father is the pastor of a megachurch in North Carolina, writes that she grew up lumping “environmentalists in with hippies and liberals and all the other people who were probably going to hell”.
Dr Lucas Johnston, a professor of religion and environment at Wake Forest University, explains that “there is a longstanding antipathy toward environmental sentiments in Christian, and especially evangelical circles, because they have, for centuries, been imagined as pernicious and dangerous, and possibly bordering on paganism.”
I asked former six-term South Carolina Republican congressman Bob Inglis why discussing climate change is so difficult in the south. A proponent of growing the eco-right and setting the free market upon the challenges of climate change, he called the environmental movement a bird with a left wing so large it can’t fly straight. Climate change is “rarely talked about in the language of conservatism”, he explained. “If you want someone to have a conversion moment, it helps for them to hear it in their own language, from someone they trust.”
Inglis has been trying to start the conversation in conservative southern circles since having his own conversion moment on a trip to Antarctica in 2006. A scientist drilled into the ice, and Inglis saw, firsthand, the Industrial Revolution’s impact on the ice record, which revealed a long period of stability with a sudden uptick in carbon dioxide levels. He accepted then that burning fossil fuels changed the chemistry of the atmosphere. He was later booed at public events for stating his belief in climate change.
We reject the notion that God gave us the Earth to do with whatever we please.
While in office, Inglis introduced a Raise Wages, Cut Carbon bill. Though grounded in science and conservative economic principles, his efforts were seen as subversive by Tea Party opponents, who essentially implied his bill would destroy civilization. “I had crossed the line of orthodoxy,” he said.
There’s a perceived social and political cost to speaking up about climate issues among people of faith in the south. Roughly half of the southerners I spoke with felt that people in the south avoided talking about climate change altogether because it was awkward and politically divisive. Mary Beene, a pastor in Savannah, notes that “in our congregation, it was a more controversial topic than race or sexuality”. She observed that some women in the south who believed in climate change worried “it simply would not be polite to challenge what the men … were saying in public.”
Indeed, white male evangelicals are still dominating the conversation and decision-making power structures.
Watch, for example, this clip from a 2014 GOP Senate primary debate in North Carolina, where four contenders, including Senator Thom Tillis, deny that manmade activity influences climate change in under one minute. Tillis, whom the Center for Responsive Politics reports as having received over $260,000 from oil, gas and coal interests, won the Senate seat, with 63% of his voters identifying as evangelicals or born-again Christians. Ninety-five percent of them were white.
According to Pew, 77% of Hispanic Catholics are likely to say human activity has contributed to the Earth’s warming. Religiously unaffiliated (64%) and black Protestants (56%) are also likely to tie climate change to human activity. Pew points out that “fewer white mainline Protestants (41%) view climate change as primarily due to human activity … white evangelical Protestants are least likely to hold this view.”
When Rabbi Rachael Bregman moved to Brunswick, Georgia, she was told: hurricanes don’t happen here. Then she evacuated for both Irma and Matthew. “Both of the evacuations were on top of the holy days where we say the words of the Unataneh Tokef,” she tells me. “It’s a prayer which asks, ‘who by fire, who by water … who by drowning’ regarding the end of one’s life. Those questions felt very real and not metaphorical.”
Her synagogue is 12 feet above sea level and a half-mile from the ocean’s edge. During recent hurricanes, they “evacuated our five Torah scrolls, locked the doors and hoped for the best for our 130-year-old building. What has surprised me,” she says, “is how little has changed and how little environmental activism sprang up as a result.”
Bregman, like many I talked to, has witnessed climate change firsthand and is eager to see more responsiveness in the faith-based community. She has made personal changes, like switching to an electric car; greening up at the synagogue; and offering a sermon on climate change.
Tony Lankford, the senior pastor at the First Baptist church in Saint Simons, has also improved the church’s energy and water use, and organized a Coastal Green Team Summit for faith leaders to discuss climate change.
There is a lack of emphasis on climate change in the South due to a lack of knowledge. We often experience it but, we don’t know how to articulate what we experience.
Lankford feels that “regardless of political or theological leanings, there is agreement upon the basic tenet that God formed all of this beauty around us, and scripture [Genesis 1-2] gives us a responsibility to be stewards of that creation. For me, thus, mismanagement and abuse of creation is not only immoral or unethical, but is sinful.”
The majority of southern believers I spoke to reported never hearing climate change mentioned in a sermon, but, like Lankford, could ground feelings about protecting the Earth in scripture, and felt that there was a strong moral imperative to protect the planet and its inhabitants.
Several mentioned Dr Katharine Wilkinson’s book Between God and Green: How Evangelicals Are Cultivating a Middle Ground on Climate Change as helping them articulate a scriptural basis for taking climate action in the future.
When Bob Inglis – someone with whom I probably disagree on several core issues – spoke with reverence about seeing an Australian scientist evangelize about the natural world at the Great Barrier Reef, I could recognize his passion for the natural world as my own. Sometimes, common ground gets lost in semantics.
Inglis gave me the rational and the emotional case for his conversion from skeptic to climate change believer. The emotional case is what has stayed with me most since our talk, and is one I hope other skeptics manage to hear from their children, like Inglis did.
His son once told him, lovingly: “Be relevant to my future. Show some courage.”
A note from the author: I started this column with the intention of joining a conversation I knew was already happening in the south, and your emails helped make that a reality last week.
I heard from retired marine biologists in Arkansas, philanthropists in Georgia, theologists in Virginia, poets and boat captains in Louisiana, lawyers in Florida, clean air activists in Mississippi. I also heard from climate change deniers, brand marketers, and … an old boyfriend.
I want to witness and listen to the south as it really is - not just how I want it to be. I’m doing my best to stay curious and open-minded and look forward to your continued responses. I hit the road in January, with an eye toward Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama. What should I see there?

Marathon negotiations ended early on Wednesday with a benchmark CO2 emissions standard of 550 grams per kWh for all European power plants by 2025. But coal-dependent Poland secured a loophole allowing countries another year to negotiate new “capacity mechanisms” that would be exempted from the deadline.
It could allow subsidies to keep unprofitable coal plants running until 2035, five years beyond a projected cut-off for meeting the Paris goals.
Bill Hare, the director of the Climate Analytics thinktank and a former Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change lead author, told the Guardian: “Continued support for coal as just agreed by the EU is completely inconsistent with meeting the Paris agreement goals and in particular with limiting warming to 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels].”
“It appears to be a de facto rejection of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finding that coal needs to exit the power sector rapidly. In the EU this means by 2030.”
Greenpeace said the stay of execution for coal subsidies showed many EU governments were still not serious about climate action.
After the deal was signed, the EU’s climate commissioner, Miguel Arias Cañete, tweeted: “A more flexible market will facilitate the integration of more renewables. We also limit capacity mechanisms and #support550 to move #BeyondCoal. #CleanEnergyEU completed.”
The European parliament’s chief negotiator in the talks, the MEP Krišjānis Kariņš, said the deal “will help the transformation to cleaner electricity production and it will open up more competition in electricity across the EU border – good for the climate and good for the wallet”.
Europe is committed to a goal of limiting global warming to “well below 2C” and has pledged to cut its carbon dioxide emissions by at least 40% by 2030. Last month, Cañete himself launched an EU strategy for achieving “climate neutrality” by 2050 in order to reach the UN’s 1.5C target.
Florent Marcellesi, a Green MEP involved in the talks, said the delayed introduction of the emissions standard was “a free licence to go on polluting despite the impact on climate and public health”. It was also insufficient to meet the EU’s Paris climate goals, he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/19/eu-coal-subsidy-phase-out-completely-inconsistent-paris-climate-deal

It was 8am on Thursday 8 November. He heard the piercing metallic clang of propane tanks exploding in the distance. His sister, who lived nearby, called to ask him to help a relative in the area, but Goggia told her that he couldn’t: chunks of burning wood were falling from the sky. 
Goggia inhabited the same stucco, three-bedroom house he grew up in. Now it was time to leave. By 9am he was on the road, accompanied by his tabby cat, Mikey. But the street was so clogged with people trying to escape that Goggia barely moved. The fire was getting closer. The van was going to burn up with him and the cat inside, he thought. So he turned back around against the traffic.
Goggia didn’t know it yet, but he had been engulfed by the deadliest wildfire in recorded California history. Soon at least 86 people would be dead in a new and ferocious kind of climate change-inflected wildfire. And Paradise would suffer a fate that appears increasingly likely: the total destruction of a modern American city.
This is a reconstruction of Paradise’s final hours, based on interviews with more than 50 residents, first responders and wildfire scientists.
“You are ascending into Paradise,” read a road sign on the way into town, a charming spot in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains in northern California.
In truth, if this was a utopia it was a mellow sort. Dating back to the Gold Rush, Paradise was less a garden of earthly delights than a quiet community of 27,000, with homes and trailer parks hidden amid dense stands of pines and oaks.
Most here were middle and lower income. The population skewed towards retirees, but residents say there was also a younger influx escaping real estate prices elsewhere in California. When a Starbucks opened several months ago, a local joke went, Paradise had truly arrived.
But one menace was constant. Wildfires are a normal part of the forest ecosystem in California, and over the past decade parts of Paradise have been threatened by at least four fires. More than 200 structures were destroyed in 2008.
Recent conditions have boosted the risks. Years of drought exacerbated by global warming have left its forests achingly dry and littered with dead trees. And because there has been a policy of suppressing wildfires to protect homes and businesses in the state since the early 1900s, the landscape is now unusually dense with shrubs and young trees that would otherwise have been burned off by naturally occurring blazes. Fire experts, who have long spoken out about the danger, don’t see this as vegetation – they see it as fuel.
Paradise’s geography makes it particularly vulnerable. It sits on a ridge between two canyons that meet like the lines at the top of a triangle, providing magnificent vistas but also impeding escape in the event of a disaster. One main thoroughfare, Skyway, leads out of town and into the valley to the west.
Residents could opt in to an alert system that would notify them of trouble via telephone, text and email, and Paradise had an emergency plan that split the city into evacuation zones. Evacuations would proceed based on which areas were affected, and during a disaster, cars would be permitted to use both lanes on certain roads to flee.
But the plan, officials would later say, had a crucial vulnerability: it did not envision the panicked evacuation of the entire town at once.
Two days before the fire, the gas and electric company PG&amp;E, which serves much of northern California, warned roughly 70,000 customers in nine counties, including in Paradise, that it was considering shutting off power because of increased fire risks from high winds and low humidity.
Sparks from PG&amp;E equipment have been blamed for igniting a number of fires, including the Tubbs fire, which killed 22 in wine country in 2017, and 2015’s Butte fire, which killed two and destroyed more than 900 structures after a tree came into contact with a power line.
The night before the fire, the utility company said it was continuing to monitor weather conditions, and by 10pm it still hadn’t made a final decision about whether to turn off power.
3.30am Thursday, Paradise 
On the day the blaze broke out, Susan Van Horn was having trouble sleeping. Lying in bed in her double-wide mobile home, she noticed the wind: gusts tearing through the oak trees on her half-acre property, falling branches and acorns clattering on to her roof. “I thought, ‘if we’re going to have a fire, this is it,’” said Van Horn, 66.
Normally the wind in California blows from west to east – from the Pacific Ocean inland. But, particularly in the fall, a different pattern emerges: hot northerly air from the Nevada deserts courses over the Sierra Nevada, rushing downslope over towns like Paradise. These are winds that firefighters fear because they disperse wildfire embers like dandelion seeds flung into the breeze. In Paradise that morning, there were northerly gusts of up to 70mph.
At 6.15am, PG&amp;E reported a power outage on one of its transmission lines near the community of Pulga, in the hills about 10 miles east of Paradise. By 6.30am, according to the company, an employee observed fire on the same transmission line. It would be christened the Camp fire, after the fire’s location at Camp Creek Road. Cal Fire officials are investigating a second possible ignition point, also at 6.30am and near the same area.
Rob Nichols, 51, an 18-year veteran of the Paradise police, rose at 7am to gusty winds and an unsettling red glow in the sky, visible from the back patio of the home he shared with his wife and young stepchildren. The glow concerned him, and he called a colleague at the station, who told him about the small fire burning near Pulga. Paradise, the colleague said, would probably be OK.
8am, Paradise police station
When Nichols arrived at work, 911 calls were pouring in, and ash was falling from the sky as if from a volcano. He had a very bad feeling. He called his wife and told her to pack the kids in the car and leave.
Evacuations were ordered for the tiny communities east of Paradise, but the situation quickly spiraled into something far more terrifying. The flames were being propelled downslope by gales at speeds of 80 football fields a minute. Suddenly they were approaching Paradise itself.
At around 8.30am, Nichols got a call to respond to a fire. Strangely, it wasn’t east of Paradise – it was in the heart of the city.
Nichols and a trainee officer went looking for flames. They drove past the homes of family and friends and arrived at a small gated lot where they found the fire. It seemed to have appeared out of nowhere. They hopped a fence and Nichols turned on a hose, but no water came out. By this time, firefighters were being inundated with calls from all over town and could not respond. The pair were left with no choice but to run from house to house, banging on doors to alert people, some still asleep, that it was time to go.
Nichols recognized what was happening. Extreme winds were lofting embers to areas far to the west of the main body of flames, igniting so-called spot fires.
These spot fires destroyed all hope for an orderly evacuation, said Nichols. “When you make fire evacuation plans you think in your mind the fire is going to come from the east or the west side.” But this one blew fires all over town. “Before you knew it, all your evacuation routes are on fire.”
9am, Paradise elementary school
Some of those who opted in to the alert system say they received warnings, but others did not, and many locals say they had no official notification at all that they were in the fire’s path. That could be because the fire destroyed cell towers and other communication infrastructure, preventing the alert from reaching some residents.
Early on Thursday morning Krystin Harvey, a 44-year-old homemaker, called her daughters’ high school to ask whether classes had been canceled owing to the plume she could see on the eastern horizon.
“They said they’re not going to cancel school for smoke,” she explained. After all, fires were a regular part of life in Paradise. So she and Arianne, 17, and Arissa, 16, climbed into her car. On the way they noticed that the pines were coated in ash, as if there had been a blizzard. She dropped them off, but at around 8.20am the school called: it was evacuating, and the girls would have to be collected.
At Paradise elementary, a teacher named Lynn Pitman, 54, had also seen the smoke and thought little of it. When it became so stifling that the children were sent in from the playground, she began to worry. Sitting at her desk to call parents, “I was shaking pretty bad.” Once only a few kids were left she gathered with the other teachers and their remaining students in a classroom upstairs.
Outside it was now growing dark, as if an eerie twilight were falling at 9am. “Looking at the kids’ faces I thought, ‘I gotta do something with them,’” Pitman said. Forcing cheeriness, she gave them snacks and began playing games, until police came through to check the building and told them to move. Buses were waiting next door, they said.
“Once I got outside, the smoke, the darkness – it looked like midnight,” Pitman said. “Then I got really scared.”
The winds were blowing plumes of smoke low over the town, forming a choking, swirling shroud about 1,500 meters deep. A fireman seemed shocked to see Pitman. The buses had already left, he said, and instructed her to find a car. Pitman quickly flagged down a woman named Millie, who she vaguely recognized, and threw herself and three students in the car. But it was no escape.
10am, Skyway
As many of the tens of thousands of inhabitants of Paradise, and of Magalia higher up in the hills, all tried to leave at once, the result was predictable but no less horrific: gridlock. Cars, RVs and trailers inched along as the fire outpaced them and trees and homes on either side of the road went up like torches. Some vehicles ran out of gas or caught fire themselves, blocking the way and making the jam worse. “You’re fight or flight, you’re trying to get out, to escape, and it’s bumper-to-bumper LA traffic,” said Pitman. “You can’t move, and flames are all around you.”
Inside their car, the temperature was rising. One of the boys asked if he could pray, and for a while they could all hear his small voice asking Jesus for help. Pitman called her husband to apologize for not leaving sooner. He listened as, in the background, Millie, the driver, pounded the steering wheel and shouted: “Go, go, go, everybody go.”
By now, the fire had morphed from a countryside blaze to one that raged its way from building to building. The Safeway, the Skyway Villa RV park, the Gold Nugget local history museum, the Paradise Adventist church, the mayor’s home, the police chief’s home: all went up.
Fires aren’t supposed to act like this any more. In 1906, a fire that broke out in the wake of San Francisco’s great earthquake incinerated the city. But decades of research into fire safety and changes to building codes were meant to have ameliorated large-scale structural conflagrations, said Faith Kearns, a researcher at the University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources. In recent years, though, things have begun to change. In 2017, some 3,000 single-family homes were destroyed in the city of Santa Rosa, and over 1,000 homes burned in summer 2018 in a fire that advanced into the city of Redding, which also saw a bizarre “fire tornado”.
The main drivers, Kearns believes, are a more extreme climate and more people living in fire-prone, semi-rural areas. “We engineered our way out of that kind of fire,” she said. “Now we’re seeing it come back.”
Back on the road, Allyn Pierce, the manager of the intensive care unit at Adventist Health Feather River, was on the run with two colleagues. After evacuating 67 patients they had hopped into Pierce’s Toyota truck but were almost immediately waylaid amid exploding gas tanks and burning cars.
The air conditioner was running full blast, yet the windows were hot enough to burn skin. Trying to keep the atmosphere light, Pierce put on music. Celine Dion’s song Ashes came on, and he skipped it. Instead they sang along to Peter Gabriel’s In Your Eyes. A Volkswagen Beetle passed Pierce’s truck and caught fire. Its driver jumped out and ran.
Cars, some abandoned, now completely blocked the road, and when a fire truck pulled up next to the Toyota, Pierce’s colleagues sought refuge in the cab. But he stayed: he hoped the road might somehow clear, and he didn’t want to trap anyone else behind him by leaving his own vehicle.
Soon the firefighters began covering their windows of their truck with heat-reflective blankets – their last resort when surrounded by fire. Pierce recorded a video for his family and friends, and buried it deep in his center console, hoping that it would survive if he did not. He expected that flames would overtake his truck in minutes. Listening to an acoustic version of A-ha’s Take on Me, he put his hands on the wheel and sang along to the chorus, trying to blot out the whirls of fire outside the window.
Pierce made it. A bulldozer miraculously appeared and began clearing abandoned cars to create a path out. By 10.30am, Pierce was back at the hospital, helping to set up a triage center and treating incoming patients.
Pitman also eventually made it off the ridge with her students – a journey that was usually 20 minutes took over three hours. On TV, she watched footage of her school burning.
Ken Lowe had never seen a fire so intense. As residents tried to flee, the Cal Fire chief, leading a “strike team” of five engines with three firefighters each, went the opposite way – back into town, trawling through the vicious jam.
Near the Fastrip gas station in the north of town, as vehicles began to catch fire and their occupants fled with nowhere to go, Lowe and his crews did the only thing they could think of to save lives. They shouted for people to run toward the wide intersection.
There, Lowe’s five fire trucks formed a physical barrier around 100 or so civilians and their dozens of dogs and cats, protecting them as the flames went past. “It was panic,” Lowe said: pitch black, trees lighting up like matches all around, power lines arcing, embers skidding through the sky like amber snowflakes.
As escape became impossible, firefighters elsewhere also tried to help people shelter in place. One couple, Diana and Helmut Bredow, and their son were corralled with others into an intersection as firefighters aimed water cannons at the encroaching flames, like soldiers defending a position from attack.
Near the site of the old Optimo bar,crews hatcheted their way inside some empty, newly constructed buildings and hustled anywhere from 100 to 200 people inside with their animals.
In the memory of one of the evacuees, everyone, and even the dogs, was composed and self-possessed. By contrast, Erin Roach 58, recalled that “people were crying – “I don’t wanna die.”An amateur artist, Roach had her paints with her, so she did the only thing she could to stay calm: she started painting. “I didn’t know what else to do.”
That morning Roach encountered a police officer who looked particularly stressed, so she put her arms around him.
It happened to be Nichols, the policeman who had discovered the spot fire a few hours earlier. “I thought she seemed like she needed a hug,” Nichols said, “and I’m sure she thought I needed one.”
For those the firefighters could not reach, survival was a matter of outpacing the flames. After following a light blinking in the darkness, one fire crew found a paraplegic man with scorched feet who had dragged himself 50 yards (45 meters) along a dry creek bed, and out of harm’s way. In the town of Concow, east of Paradise, over a dozen people waded into a reservoir for shelter, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
After turning his van around, William Goggia headed toward the home of his neighbors, the Romeros. On a rocky patch they had erected three enormous crucifixes. That was where he decided to leave his van with the cat still inside. He recalled addressing God: “I said, ‘I’m gonna leave him in your hands.’”
In the suffocating smoke, he went back out and followed the road by foot, hoping it would be easier to make progress. Yet he was not in perfect health. A locksmith for 30 years, Goggia, 56, had a heart attack three months previously and did landscaping work as his health allowed.
He hadn’t advanced very far before he was overcome by the choking fumes and collapsed to the ground. Vainly he tried to get up or get the attention of passing vehicles. At some point, his left eye was injured so severely that he was permanently blinded. Lying in a ditch at the side of the road, he thought he was going to die.
Finally a truck stopped for him. “Hell yeah, you can get a ride,” said the two men who crammed him into their truck among their belongings. Instead of aiming for safety, however, they turned towards the flames: one of the men wanted to save his tiny home, a residence the size of a garden shed that could be transported on a trailer.
Goggia thought the man was out of his mind, and indeed, just as they reached the spot, the tiny home caught fire, and the man retreated.
It seemed like a fatal detour. The road out was now blocked by flames, and the driver seemed unsure what to do. His friend pulled him out of the front seat, but the car would not start. Flames coiled and flickered into the cab through the open windows, and the sides of the truck began to melt. The floorboard was so hot that they had to lift their feet. Goggia’s leg nearest the door was severely burned, and he poured a bottle of water over himself to stop himself being cooked. The man in the back was trying to stomp and pat out fires that were igniting in the cab.
Finally the engine caught. The driver jammed the accelerator, and they blasted through the wall of fire.
It took firefighters 17 days to bring the Camp fire under control, by which time it had destroyed 14,000 homes, including almost 90% of those in Paradise, according to city officials. Authorities have spent weeks sifting through the rubble for human remains.
Of the 86 people who died in the fire, the overwhelming majority were found in Paradise. About 20 were found in the communities of Concow, Magalia and Butte Creek Canyon. Most were inside homes and other structures, and a smaller number were in cars.
The fire moved so quickly that it trapped the town’s most vulnerable inhabitants – its senior citizens. Of the deceased identified so far by authorities, 46 were aged 65 or older.
Paradise resident Chellie Saleen, 56, had risen at 6am, went for a coffee with a friend and observed a pall of smoke. Returning home, she received an alert by phone, and “all of a sudden someone was banging on door – it was my neighbor saying, ‘we gotta go now.’” She quickly changed out of her nightgown into jeans and a shirt and tried to call her 75-year-old mother, Joanne Caddy, who lived in Magalia, but couldn’t get through.
Her mother didn’t drive and depended on her for everything from her shopping to her medication. Saleen threw a few things in the car and headed in her mother’s direction through the abysmal traffic, but she was blocked by “a wall of fire”.
“She was probably expecting me,” Saleen said. She isn’t sure how her mother, or her mother’s two dogs, died. “I hope she was just sedated and sleeping and didn’t suffer.”
Saleen’s own home was destroyed. She has no idea where she will go next. “I feel alone,” she said. “I lived alone and took care of her.”
In the year before the fire, Beverly Craig Powers, 64, a nurse, had posted on social media of her deep affection for Paradise. She and her partner, Robert Duvall, 76, loved to camp and fish.
According to Kelci Craig, Powers’ niece, Duvall was trying to move his fishing boat to safety when the flames overtook him. Perhaps he, like many residents, assumed that the fire would be like the others that had imperiled Paradise: a threat, but not life-threatening. His remains were found in the car, and remains have also been discovered in the couple’s trailer, which the family assumes are Powers’.
Powers’ own brother worked for decades as a firefighter with Cal Fire, the state’s fire-protection agency, said Kelci Craig. “That’s what makes me sick. He spends his whole life fighting fire then loses his sister in one of the deadliest.”
Experts are urging change in the wake of the fire. Prescribed burns should be implemented more widely to reduce the fuel load, they argue, and the wisdom of siting settlements amid forests and grasslands should be questioned. Yet for those trained to read it, future tragedies are already inscribed on the California landscape.
Eighteen years before she was a fire scientist at the University of Idaho, Crystal Kolden worked as a firefighter based in Placerville, about 85 miles south-east of Paradise.
Last month, she drove from Idaho to southern California for Thanksgiving. It was like retracing earlier parts of her life, but the memory and the reality were jarringly discordant. Over 100m trees, mostly conifers, are estimated to have died in California in a five-year period of drought in the 2010s, and Kolden was “blown away by how many dead pine trees we saw – alone, in clusters, all over the place”, she said.
Of greater concern, she also saw that oaks, a resilient species that dot even the driest hills in California, were suffering. “When I fought fire, we didn’t worry much about the oaks,” she said. They are more moist and can slow fire. “Now what I see is a continuous bed of 20 to 40ft-high oak and pine trees that is tinder dry and ready to burn.”
The consequences for places like Paradise are clear. “The vegetation is responding very, very obviously to climate change extremes, and setting the stage for more disasters,” Kolden said. “Paradise will not be the last town we lose.”
Craig Clements, who researches the weather associated with wildfires at San José State University, had a blunter assessment. “This whole place is going to burn down. Paradise is just one example.”
Little remains of this understated utopia: the Starbucks; a gourmet pizza place; the occasional house, inexplicably still standing. Some hope the town can stage a comeback. The mayor, Jody Jones, for one, plans to rebuild her own home. But many Paradisians remain rootless: stuck in evacuation centers or scattered elsewhere.
In the heat of the moment, there was not always time to grab precious belongings. After waking at 3.30am, Susan Van Horn escaped with her “go-bag”, some changes of clothing and utility bills. She considers herself lucky. A high-school teacher, Virginia Partain, only had time to pick up her students’ draft college admission essays and a blanket. Retired teacher Suzanne Linebarger left with $30 of scallops she had purchased for dinner, a pair of mismatched shoes, and her swimming fins from a vacation to Mexico. “Why didn’t I grab my grandmother’s mandolin worth hundreds of dollars?” she wondered.
William Goggia got out with nothing but the clothes he was wearing. The fire left him with searing injuries: burns on his right leg and ear and a ruined eye. Even now, he cannot sleep without dreaming of the flames, and his sister is seeking donations for his care. Something else of his, however, did survive the destruction.
A day after he escaped, and while the town was still cordoned off by officials, Goggia snuck back in. The extent of his injuries had not yet been recognized – he was in terrible pain, and would later be admitted to the hospital for almost two weeks. But he was determined. Below the crosses, there was his van, still intact. He opened the door to a miaow.

Extinction Rebellion, a direct action group that has recently shut down key London roads, has demand the BBC makes the environment its “top editorial issue”.
Broadcasting House was locked down early on Friday afternoon, with BBC staff and guests unable to enter or leave the building while security kept the peaceful but noisy protesters away from the entrance.
Extinction Rebellion activists, who are demanding a meeting with the BBC director general, Tony Hall, said the corporation had a duty to broadcast about climate change with “the level of urgency placed on informing the public about the second world war”.
The broadcaster Anneka Rice said she was stuck in the BBC reception “with Simon Mayo, Ken Bruce and three policemen” during the protest.
Extinction Rebellion also organised protests on Friday at BBC offices in Bristol, Glasgow, Cambridge, Birmingham, Truro, Sheffield, Bangor, and the broadcaster’s Berlin bureau.
The campaign group launched two months ago, with a declaration of support from public figures including the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, who backed a campaign of civil disobedience to draw attention to the threat of climate and ecological change.
Since then, Extinction Rebellion activists have blocked bridges and glued themselves to the gates of Downing Street, earning media attention that has allowed the campaign to spread to 35 overseas countries.
The BBC has been criticised for its coverage of climate change, especially the decision to give airtime to climate change sceptics such as Lord Lawson, who oppose the scientific consensus. Earlier this year, the head of news, Fran Unsworth, told staff that the corporation had struggled with the topic: “Climate change has been a difficult subject for the BBC, and we get coverage of it wrong too often.”
She added: “To achieve impartiality, you do not need to include outright deniers of climate change in BBC coverage; in the same way you would not have someone denying that Manchester United won 2-0 last Saturday. The referee has spoken.”
The BBC acknowledged it had received a letter from a “newly formed campaign group” but did not comment on the demand for a meeting with the director general.
“The BBC has a proud record of leading the way in sustainability in the media industry and we’ve set out further action including cutting energy use further, eradicating single-use plastic and minimising the impact of necessary travel,” said a spokesperson.
“In the last charter period, we reduced our carbon footprint by a third. People can also see the clear impact programmes like Blue Planet II and Dynasties have had on public debate about the impact of humankind on the planet.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/dec/21/bbc-london-headquarters-put-on-lockdown-over-protest-by-climate-change-campaigners-extinction-rebellion

From Alaska to Finland, half a dozen Arctic towns have staked a claim to be the home of Santa Claus or whatever other name he is locally known as. And almost without exception, these winter wonderlands are hotting up.
In Sweden, festive tourists flock to Mora, which boasts a Santa headquarters known as Tomteland that follows local traditions dating back to the Viking era. But the effects of global warming are becoming harder to ignore.
Reindeers are becoming confused by unseasonal temperatures, according to the indigenous Sami. This spring, there were bad floods, and in summer, nearby woodland was destroyed by wildfires that swept through many areas in Sweden.
“I have consulted Mr Santa – or ‘Tomten’ which is his real Swedish name – and he is very concerned about climate change,” Anders Rosén, Mora’s communications manager, told the Guardian. “He has a very strong message to the decision makers of the world: ‘Please take climate change seriously and make decisions in order to save the planet.’“”
A more stable climate would also be better for business. Local ski slopes and cross-country tracks sometimes have to be kept in operation by artificial snow machines. A few years ago, there was no snow on 25 December but the temperature this week is –10C and there have been some falls in recent days so hopes are high that this year will deliver a white Christmas. “Even without snow, we are very good at creating the right Christmas atmosphere,” Rosén said. “The tradition of Christmas is very strong in Sweden.”
The Finnish city of Rovaniemireceives tens of thousands of letters to Santa from children around the world. Residents of the Lapland capital said the summer was freakishly hot and dry with temperatures above 30C for several weeks in a row. The winter snow arrived so late this year that tourist companies had to improvise with new activities for visitors, including hikes across lakes, where the ice is so crystal clear that fish can be seen near the bottom.
“The lakes are normally covered in snow,” said Sanna Kärkkäinen, the managing director of Visit Rovaniemi. “The weather has changed for sure in the past three to five years. It used to be more stable but now it goes from long mild periods to sudden extreme cold.”
In recent weeks, the weather has returned to something like its normal pattern and the population of the city – which triples each December with tourists from as far afield as Australia and the US – is once again living in a white landscape. Even so, the locals are worried. Every year, the character of Joulupukki (Old Man Christmas) delivers a festive message – and this year’s was a call for action. “Our friend nature has been in trouble for a while now and now we all can give one gift together: we can help nature. I wish you all a merry Christmas,” he told one reporter.
Drøbak – a Norwegian town 25 miles (40km) from Oslo – is home to another Santa Claus post office, as well as a year-round Christmas house. The local tourist manager claims to be the cousin of Santa Claus, who is said to live in the nearby island of Håøya. Compared with other Christmas grottos, this is in a relatively southern location and so the climate is mild with only a 60%-70% chance of a white Christmas. When the seasonal lights were turned on at the start of Advent it was raining, but the snow has finally come.
Hans Petter Treider, a local author who has written a book about the life and history of Santa Claus, said Drøbak was doing its bit to fight climate change with an electric ferry service to Santa’s island and a promise to make the town centre car-free by 2030. “We have one earth, and we must take care of it,” he said.
The Alaskan city of North Pole, which has its own Santa Claus house complete with a 42ft (13-metre) tall statue of the man in red, is in the middle of its second warmest winter on record. It was only last week that it finally registered freezing temperatures, a delay that one resident described as “unheard of”. Snow used to fall in October but, in recent years, people in the small city close to Fairbanks are more likely to see freezing rain. Last month, the US federal climate assessment said Alaska was warming faster than almost anywhere else in the world and that Alaskans would a hefty bill to pay as the population were forced to adapt.
Alaskan senator Lisa Murkowski, however, is pushing for more oil drilling in the state. The Republican also seems to be looking at the melting Arctic as a business prospect.
“There are very real opportunities for commerce in the Arctic region. I think Santa figured out that the shortest way to get around the globe was over the pole. He understood the geostrategic position of the Arctic,” she recently tweeted.
In Canada, the government has previously granted Santa Claus citizenship rights and established a postal district H0H 0H0 (Ho Ho Ho!) to cover the territory where the old man dressed in the country’s national colours is said to live. The environment ministry was reluctant to comment on a specific individual, but said the broader trends were apparent. “The ice-free area in the North Pole is getting larger and the ice that remains tends to be thinner, younger ice,” wrote spokesperson Mark Johnson. “The Arctic has been warming more than twice as fast as the world as a whole for the past 50 years. The area and duration of snow cover continue to decrease in the Arctic. Over the past 15 years snow has melted from the land surface earlier in the spring (April, May, June) with a shallower snowpack”. Although there has been warm spells over recent years, the weather this winter is expected to be seasonal.

In 1995 it was abolished | William Westermeyer,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/27/1993-agency-climate-change-abolished-office-technology-assessment,0,"Many agree that one of the most pressing problems the world faces today is climate change. The question of what to do about it, however, has become highly politicised. Scepticism about climate change is typically a conservative position and trust in the conclusions of the scientific community a more progressive one. While this politicisation is perhaps most evident in the United States, it is well known in many other countries.
But this wasn’t always the case. Between 1972 and 1995, a US agency named the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) existed to provide the practical means to help overcome such politicisation. During its 23-year existence, the OTA was in a unique position to assist members of Congress in understanding complex issues in science and technology.
The OTA was a non-partisan agency governed by a technology assessment board which consisted of of equal numbers of senators and representatives and equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. Its assessments strove for objectivity and comprehensiveness, and were considered state-of-the-art documents by many. The OTA provided Congress, at its request, with the information and options it needed for the issues with which it was grappling, but it was careful never to tell Congress what it should do. The methodology that OTA used was widely admired and imitated in the parliamentary units that many European countries established following OTA’s lead.
In the early 1990s there was still Congressional interest in taking action on climate change, which most of the scientific community already understood would become a major problem if not addressed. Thus, in October 1993, the OTA published a two-volume, 700-page report, Preparing for an Uncertain Climate, at the request of three Congressional committees. I was a principal author. The report identified more than 100 options to help coastal areas, water resource systems, agriculture, wetlands, forests, and federally protected natural areas adapt to climate change. Not only that, but the OTA had also proposed – in its comprehensive 1991 assessment, Changing by Degrees – steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that would help the US avoid climate change.
Imagine where we would be now if Congress had begun to address climate change at the time of these reports (and the early reports of other organisations, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).
Instead, the OTA was abolished in 1995, shortly after Republicans retook control of Congress and Newt Gingrich became speaker of the House of Representatives. At the time, the OTA was one of the most respected agencies in Washington.
Many reasons have been suggested for the move, but it mostly came down to a change in attitude towards the value of science and analysis in Congress. The OTA’s abolition was the proverbial canary in the coalmine with respect to the current anti-science attitude among many conservatives in and out of Congress. Since the 1990s, the pace of technological change has continued to accelerate, but few in Congress have the scientific or technological background to understand the new developments.
Now more than ever, the US Congress, as well as legislative bodies in other countries, need sources of unbiased and comprehensive information and analysis they can trust. When Democrats retake control of the House in 2019, they will have an opportunity to re-establish the OTA or an agency like it to assist Congress with complex science and technology issues. Ideally, this should be done by Democrats and their Republican colleagues together, so that technology assessment can once again be a bipartisan benefit to Congress.
Congress has already scheduled two days of hearings in January 2019 to consider how to respond to a changing climate. It would be well served if it could turn to its in-house technology assessment office for advice. Congress might ask a reconstituted OTA, for example, to assess the costs and benefits of implementing the provisions of the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, a bipartisan bill which was recently introduced in both the US House and Senate.
Climate change aside, the number of science and technology issues that may require legislative action continues to grow. A new OTA could also provide assistance, for example, on such issues as artificial intelligence, gene editing, cybersecurity, self-driving cars, alternative energy technologies, voting technologies, and dozens of other multifaceted issues that have, or should, come before Congress. These issues, of course, are of interest to countries other than the United States. The need for organisations in Europe and elsewhere that can provide impartial, non-partisan advice on the complicated science and technology issues of the day has never been greater.
We live in an age that seems at times to dismiss expertise, while the problems that require complex solutions grow ever greater. The OTA was an important source of clarity and understanding until it was abolished. Had we instead retained its valuable services, we could surely have reduced or avoided many of the very serious problems we now face.
In 2019, will the world prove able to heed this lesson?

In 2008 we were plunged into recession and during the second quarter of that year unemployment increased by 210,000. The then Minister for Work and Pensions Yvette Copper must have been well aware of the dire situation of our domestic labour market so why did she never even consider using the EU’s Safeguarding clauses[enlargement] which stated that restrictions on the freedom of movement from the accession countries could be reinstated for periods of 6 months, 12 months, etc...if the domestic Labour market was destabilised or even threatened by the freedom of movement and by 2008 this had clearly happened but Labour DID NOTHING!! Thanks Labour, the working classes needed you guys like a hole in the head! Were we really held in such contempt?? To me the answer is YES ABSOLUTELY! As stated hundreds of thousands lost their jobs and Labour just stood by and watched. They had been in power for over ten years so they knew the score, its not like they were just finding their feet. Now here we are ten years later and the likes Cooper are saying “we are worried about British jobs”. Can you believe the neck of these hypocrites??The above is a prime example of the betrayal of British workers and this is exactly why the working classes voted for Brexit, people quite rightly felt that they had been betrayed by Labour and the evidence I have provided above is quantifiable evidence of that betrayal at the highest levels of the Labour administration.

But get Brexit out of the way - which will be fastest by cancelling it
BQEND
Desperate stuff.
Reason why their won't be a second referendum.
A new referendum requires primary legislation that only the government can bring before Parliament. Only the government can allocate parliamentary time for such an Act to pass a referendum and it requires a minimum of 147 days to be legally held.
By the time Parliament reconvenes, there will be well below 147 days until EU parliamentary elections.
The EU has already reallocated the UK’s 27 parliamentary seats.
Legal advice provided to the government says that the UK’s EU membership would be ended by it having no MEPs, even if the UK tried to postpone Brexit on 29 March to create time for another referendum.
In spite of PV activists’ faux outrage, Corbyn won the party’s leadership election in September 2016 on a platform of respecting the referendum result.
Lab gained 3.5 million extra votes in last year’s general election on a manifesto that promised to respect the referendum result. In September this year, Labour’s ruling conference backed a policy of prioritising a general election and merely keeping open the option of another referendum. That option has limited time.
On 10 October, the EU’s chief negotiator expressed a clear preference for a permanent customs union with the UK – a plan that only Labour has put on the table and which would remove any issues with the Irish border.
Just a week ago, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said that while there is no EU appetite for any renegotiation of Theresa May’s Brexit deal, the EU would accommodate negotiations of an entirely new deal – while indicating that this would not be possible under a Tory government.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1546263408000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'18396741', u'in_reply_to': u'124172955', u'id': u'124192518', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'MrCosmopolite', u'text': u'Behind both the Netherlands and Belgium, and only just ahead of Germany.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1546267959000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'100411207', u'in_reply_to': u'124193237', u'id': u'124193881', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'secularvalues77', u'text': u'""The reaction to a couple of hundred 'Boat people' coming over at Christmas at all times has been disgusting.""

Pessimism fuelled by fears that young people will be the first generation who find themselves worse off than their parents; that gaping regional inequalities are going to widen post-Brexit; that the world will be overtaken by catastrophic climate change; that we are on the brink of an overwhelming instability in the global order not seen since the cold war.
There are certainly reasons to be glum going into 2019. There is not only a growing sense that Britain will be at the mercy of powerful global forces it can do little about. Brexit looms on the horizon, a challenge entirely of our own making that threatens to ensure there is next to no political capacity left for anything else.
But the fug of pessimism too easily distracts us from the eminently solvable nature of many of the challenges Britain faces. All it would take is political leadership, courage and ambition. Here are five ideas within the grasp of any government determined to make Britain a kinder, greener, more equitable place to live in the 2020s.
Our stretched lifespans are an incredible marker of human progress; a just cause for celebration. But not only are we living longer, we are living longer with frightening and debilitating conditions such as dementia that erode our mental as well as physical capacities. Yet as a society, we have given barely a thought to how we care for older people towards the end of their lives in a way that supports them to live fulfilling, rich lives rather than manages physical decline.
This will require profound shifts in how we think about care. But it should begin with a radical reform of entitlements in older age. It is ludicrous and ageist that someone diagnosed with cancer gets free care, whereas most people diagnosed with dementia have to fund their own care. The government should phase in free personal care, funded through progressive taxation. We must also reimagine caring as a high-skill profession, which should start with the government, the biggest buyer of care services, setting higher pay for carers.
Just as inventions such as the washing machine have transformed labour markets of the past, so automation and artificial intelligence will continue to transform the labour market of today. We should be wary of dystopian predictions of the end of work; past waves of technological progress have created new jobs to replace the ones displaced. But technology will transform the nature of work, leaving some without the skills they need to adapt, and, left unfettered, will increase inequality.
There has been insufficient thinking about how to improve the quality of work today, let alone in the future. We need to prepare by reforming post-18 education funding so that all young people get the sizable state subsidy that those who go to university do, regardless of which route they pick, and by setting up a reskilling fund to offer one-off grants to those who lose their jobs to automation. Unions should be offered new powers contingent on them diversifying their memberships, currently dominated by older, professional, better-paid workers.
Climate change poses an increasingly existential threat to mankind and the time available to stave off catastrophic levels of warming is running out. The government must do more to advocate for global net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and set out a plan for the UK to produce net-zero carbon emissions before 2050, including bringing forwards the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars to 2030.
Always-on technology is changing the way we live our lives, from the way we consume news, interact with friends and buy things. But technology has evolved far faster than government’s willingness to regulate. The government should introduce greater restrictions on the way monolithic tech companies operate. Potential options include establishing a legal “duty of care” towards their users to tackle online abuse, obliging providers to publish the algorithms that determine what people see in their feeds and increasing the digital services tax that will be levied on the UK revenue of large tech companies from 2020.
Our majoritarian, two-party system is struggling to cope with a freshly multidimensional political spectrum, in which Brexit has riven both main parties. The quality of political debate has degraded as politicians from both the fringe and the mainstream have grasped at the easy appeal of populism: blaming scapegoats and telling people there are no tough trade-offs.
There may be little appetite for the type of institutional reform, such as a more proportional voting system, that the Observer has long supported. But we urgently need to update electoral law for the 21st century, for example by bringing social media campaign spending within national caps and exploring ways to encourage consensus-building and informed debate into our politics, for example through the citizens’ assemblies used in the Irish Republic to empower people to deliberate and issue recommendations on key issues such as abortion.
The country indeed faces big societal, technological and climate-related challenges going into 2019. But their scale is far from unprecedented. With political leadership and spirit of the sort we saw in the late 1940s, it’s within the grasp of our leaders to ensure Britain can face the future with optimism.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/30/observer-blueprint-for-a-better-britain-in-2019

Each sector can at different times be in surplus or deficit, but overall they have to net out to zero.
It’s based on the most fundamental principle of economics, that one person’s spending is another’s income. And the same applies to these basic sectors.
So if the external sector (I used the more formal term Current Account) is in deficit (as it usually is) and the private sector is saving more than it’s investing, we have 2 sectors that are a drain on the money circuit.
If that situation was to persist without a money injection from the government sector that was equal to the sum of the 2 drains, economic activity would slow and unemployment would rise.
That “injection” could be either tax cuts or spending increases, the 2 tools of fiscal policy, either of which increases the deficit.
If for ideological reasons the government did the opposite, and cut spending to the point of running, or even attempting to run a surplus, all 3 sectors would be monetary drains and recession would be imminent.
If the household sector however, meanwhile, had decided to run down its savings and binge on debt, the economy might hold up a bit longer.
But relying on increasing household debt is unsustainable as we may be about to learn.

Help me out here JohnArmour. Can you clarify what you mean by “current account”, how is ”insufficient private sector investment” measured and when is household savings in “excess”. When you use these constraints to formulate a Commonwealth budget where spending is greater than revenues in Australia’s current circumstance how large can this difference be?
With all this said and done can I be bold and suggest that how the Commonwealth budgets manage spending and revenue collection may not be as important as how the Commonwealth spends and how it gathers revenue. If revenue collection decrease taxes on Australia’s wealth and taxes the less wealthy areas of the economy Australians will experince poor outcomes. Just as decreasing spending in areas of economic weakness and spending more on the wealth in the economy will also create poor outcomes for many Australians.

All the inflation risk is on the spending (aggregate demand) side.

And to an extent you can understand it – after all, they did win it. But this week the prime minister adopted a rather more bizarre strategy of trying to win the next election by fighting the 2007 election over again. It is about as likely to result in victory for Scott Morrison as it did the first time round for John Howard.
In Monday’s question time, the Morrison was at his shouty worst. Coming off the Victorian state election drubbing, the government MPs were hardly in a jocular mood and yet, oddly, Morrison decided to attack the opposition by invoking one of the more infamous jocular moments in Australian politics.
After railing at the ALP benchers for being “very cocky” he suggested that there was a warning ahead for voters, and it came in the form of Peter Garrett.
Yes, a man who left parliament five years ago.
The prime minister cast his mind back to 2007. The ALP were leading in the polls and Garrett had a conversation with Steve Price in Melbourne airport, in which in response to Price’s suggestion that it was “turning into the ‘me too’ election campaign”, Garrett replied, “Oh, don’t worry about that. Once we get in we will change all that.”
Garrett later told the media that he was not serious and that it was just “a casual conversation, jocular in manner.”
On Monday Morrison took us back to that time, telling parliament “I’ll never forget what Peter Garrett said back before the 2007 election. We all remember it. While they were all trying to pretend there wouldn’t be anything dramatic, that they would just be John Howard-lite if Kevin Rudd were elected, Peter Garrett let the cat out of the bag when he said, ‘We’ll change it all.’ That’s what the leader of the opposition’s plan is. That’s what the Labor party’s plan is. They want to change it all”.
Such history lessons are always quite fun, if only to recall that “me too” now has a very different meaning from the one ascribed to the Rudd strategy of being Howard-lite.
Yet, ironically, “me too” remains part of this election campaign – except now in its current meaning. The greater empowerment women feel, and their utter lack of patience with being told by those in power that changes take time, has meant the position of parties on gender issues is now a strong player in how people vote.
The worry is that the ALP’s big talk of change will become, once in government, a repetition of the same
And the Liberal party knows it – Kelly O’Dwyer was reported to have told colleagues this week that voters saw the party as “homophobic, anti-women, climate-change deniers”.
Gee, I wonder why?
This week in the Senate, the LNPs Barry O’Sullivan said of Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young that she had “a bit of Nick Xenophon in her” and his fellow senator Ian MacDonald responded to Greens senator Larissa Waters wearing a pair of earrings that said “Stop Adani” by asking the Senate if he could wear his “coal hi-vis jacket”.
And then of course there was the minister for resources, Matthew Canavan, who responded to the news that the Adani coalmine would begin construction (albeit on a much smaller scale than previously proposed) by tweeting reference to the bushfires in central Queensland caused by extreme heat conditions and referring to Adani as a “little Aussie battler”.
The problem with Morrison’s reference to the 2007 campaign is that there are a number of things the same, but also much that is different, and none helps the government.
Back then the Liberal party sought to engage in fear and also hoped that budget surpluses would be enough to have people overlook other economic concerns such as industrial relations. It didn’t work.
Now we again see the Liberal party clinging to the budget surplus as the ultimate aim of any government. The prime minister this week announced the date of next year’s budget and that it would be in surplus. He and the party hopes this will be enough to counter any concerns about flat real wages growth over the past four years. Thus far the polls suggest it is not working.
The big difference is that in 2007 the presumed fear was that the ALP would get in and change everything; now the real fear is that it won’t.
Morrison suggesting that if the Labor gets in it’ll change everything is actually a free ad for the ALP. The worry is that Labor’s big talk of change will become, once in government, a repetition of the same.
For example, Labor’s energy policy is basically a resurrection of the Liberal party’s national energy guarantee – albeit with much greater emissions reduction targets. As Katharine Murphy has rightly noted, so damaged has climate change policy become in this country that the reformed Neg is probably a smart ploy. But all the same, it is hardly the bold policy that is needed.
On Friday the latest greenhouse gas emissions targets were released. And, once again, total emissions (excluding land use, land use change and forestry) rose, the annual level of greenhouse gas emissions jumping 0.6% - the biggest quarterly jump in over 13 years.
2007 was also an election that featured climate change – indeed, it was an issue that severely wounded the government, as under Howard the Liberal party was lost in a haze of denialism and wilfully ignorant intransigence.
Once again climate change politics is back in a big way. The extreme temperatures and early start to the bushfire season have placed the LNP’s policy shambles on the issue in the spotlight.
The demonstrations by school students this week is the work of a generation holding their elders in rightful contempt. Their voting parents may not have also taken to the streets, but the Victorian election showed they have had enough of the LNP’s inability to even come up with a plausible energy policy that deals with climate change.
The 2007 election was one where the economy was growing well and the budget was in surplus, and yet the government was caught out on issues of workplace relations and climate change and was seen to be out of touch with the way the times were headed.
It is not an election that members of this government should wish to recall. And if Morrison believes the best tactic is to make people afraid the ALP will change it all once they get in, then he might as well give Bill Shorten the keys to the Lodge right now.
Not only do voters not want Shorten to be Morrison-lite; the problem for the government is they don’t particularly want Morrison and what his party stands for either.

At least 19 major insurers holding more than $6tn in assets – a fifth of the industry’s global assets – have now divested from coal, according to a report from the Unfriend Coal campaign, which represents a coalition of a dozen environmental groups including Greenpeace, 350.org and the Sierra Club.
This is up from $4tn – equivalent to 13% of global assets – that were covered by coal exclusion policies a year ago. The study rates 24 of the world’s biggest insurers on their efforts to distance themselves from the fossil fuel industry.
A growing number of insurers are taking action, faced with mounting losses from disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires, whose frequency and severity has increased due to a warming climate. Global losses reached $337bn last year, including insured losses of $144bn.
The report found that Europe’s four biggest insurers have restricted insurance for coal. Germany’s Allianz and Italy’s Generali limited underwriting this year, while French firm Axa tightened its policy further.
A third of the global reinsurance market has also restricted cover for coal, with the reinsurance firms Swiss Re and Munich Re limiting their underwriting this year.
UK insurers, though, have made less progress than European firms. Lloyd’s of London, the world’s oldest insurance market, has done nothing to encourage its syndicates to stop insuring coal or sell their coal investments, the report said, although it excluded coal from the investment strategy for its own central fund in April.
Lloyd’s said: “The Lloyd’s market is made up of more than 50 insurance companies that run almost 100 syndicates between them. These insurance companies each have their own investment policies. It is not the corporation’s role to set investment strategy for the market, although we think that by showing leadership in this area, others in the Lloyd’s market and wider insurance sector will be encouraged to follow.”
Aviva and Legal &amp; General are focused on engaging with coal companies to create change, and only sell their coal holdings in exceptional circumstances. Neither provides insurance to coal companies, but Aviva is one of the top investors in the Polish coal industry, whose plans to build more than 7 gigawatts of new coal power are inconsistent with the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change, according to Unfriend Coal.
Unfriend Coal’s campaign coordinator, Lucie Pinson, said trying to engage with coal companies was “a waste of time” and that cutting financial ties with them was the only way forward.
Across the Atlantic, none of the nine leading US insurers have taken any action. In Japan, there are the first signs of change, as three large life insurers – Nippon Life, Dai-ichi Life and Meiji Yasuda Life – have announced they will no longer fund new coal projects.
Globally, Allianz is the only company that has pledged to cut its financial ties with coal companies completely by 2040, by stopping both underwriting and insuring in coal. 
The UK insurance broker Willis Towers Watson warned in September that “finding alternative sources [of coal insurance] is likely to become increasingly challenging – especially if North American insurers begin to follow the European lead”.
The Unfriend Coal report is being presented to insurers at an insurance and climate risk conference in London, and as the UN climate change conference gets under way in Poland on Monday.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/03/insurers-in-uk-and-us-lagging-behind-in-divesting-from-coal-report-finds

Children frolic in the water. Palm trees sway in the ocean breeze. Chickens run between thatched huts as fishing nets hang by the beach, ready for the next outing. It feels like very little has ever changed here.
Yet this tranquillity belies the enormity of the change ahead. Few countries are more vulnerable to climate change than Madagascar, the location of which – in the Indian Ocean, off the south-east coast of Africa – leaves it hugely exposed. The island nation’s pervasive poverty and lack of economic development also severely restrict its capacity to adapt to climatic shifts.
Broadly speaking, the main changes experienced by Madagascar will be rising temperatures, extended drought periods, as seen in the south, greater variability in rainfall, the intensification of cyclones – cyclone Enawo, in 2017, was the most destructive in 13 years – and rising sea levels and sea temperatures.
In Kivalo, much of this is already familiar. “The southern wind used to start in January and last until June or July,” says Bikison Thomas, a local fisherman. “But it’s still going now [ in November].”
On very windy days, fishermen cannot go out to sea. “There is also more fog, which makes it difficult to leave early in the morning,”says Thomas.
Other factors are also contributing to reduced catches, not least overfishing and the loss of mangrove, a crucial habitat for the regeneration of fish stocks.
Further down the coast, in the city of Morondava, hotels and restaurants in the seaside neighbourhood of Nosy Kely are grappling with another effect of climate change: sea-level rise. Two years ago, Chayune Badouraly bought a hotel there, the Coco Beach: it had a few bungalows and a lovely beach. Badouraly then built a new building with bedrooms, a reception and a restaurant. But in September, during the powerful equinox tides, the sea destroyed two of his five bungalows. The water level has not returned to its original level since.
“We used to have 150m of beach, now it’s minus five,” he says, bitterly. “I knew we had coastal erosion problems, but I didn’t think it would be that bad. I would never have bought.”
The government of Madagascar is well aware of the country’s vulnerability. It has ratified the Paris climate agreement and climate change is listed in every major policy document. Budget allocations usually fall short, however, says Jane Razanamiharisoa, director of adaptation at the National Bureau for the Coordination of Climate Change. “As part of the consultation for the national adaptation plan, we have lobbied about the importance of getting the ministry of planning and budget involved, so that decision-makers can factor climate change in the budget,” says Razanamiharisoa.
The government is also piloting adaptation projects in key sectors, but Razanamiharisoa believes that, for Madagascar to boost its resilience, climate change must become embedded in policy “in every sector, and at every level: national, regional and local”.
Although there are plans to build sea defences in Morondava, Badouraly says it could take months, even years for anything to materialise. Since September, the sea now laps right up against the new buildings, so he’s taken the problem into his own hands by building a 60-metre long sea defence wall from stone blocks, steel rods and sand bags. “Everything we earn goes there,” says Reza Vally, Coco Beach’s manager.
In Kivalo, WWF is piloting the development of beekeeping and ecotourism. The initiatives offer alternative revenues to fishing and protect the mangrove by making it the cornerstone of the new activities. The organisation estimates that 80% of mangrove destruction in the area is due to human factors, and 20% to climate change; rising sea level and less rainfall means increased salinity levels and more silting in mangrove areas.
“There is nothing we can do about [climate change factors], but we can work on the human factors,” says Eli Todimanana, capacity building offer at WWF Madagascar.
Despite the new activities being far removed from anything they had ever done, the villagers have embraced the opportunity. The village now has 12 hives, kept in a secure enclosure, and they have had two honey harvests over the past year.
Since different species of mangrove trees flower at different times of the year, Todimanana says they could have up to four harvests a year once they master the art of beekeeping. “Can you imagine? Fishermen converted to beekeepers, that’s quite something,” he says. “They have tough lives: they leave at 4am to fish, come back by midday; then they must look after their nets. It’s quite hard to fit in other activities.”
The village has also started receiving tourists, making the best of its postcard location. There are pirogue tours, crab-fishing excursions in the mangrove and meals cooked by local women. WWF has provided training and technical support throughout.
Justin Rakotomanahira, a local fisherman and president of Kivalo’s village association, says the new activities have been like a window to the world: “It’s allowed us to meet new people and learn new skills, which we’ll be able to pass on to our children. Fishing is our life but, given the current pressures, this move [to other activities] is really important.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/dec/03/climate-adaptation-fishermen-madagascar-beekeeping-kivalo-wwf

The sum represents a doubling of the five-year investment plan put in place after the landmark Paris agreement of 2015.
Governments will meet in Poland this week and next to thrash out an implementation plan for the Paris accord, which binds countries to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration of a 1.5C limit.
Reports have shown the dangers of extreme weather if warming reaches 1.5C, and the need for governments to more than triple their efforts if these goals are to be maintained.
Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank, said the poorest and most vulnerable people were at the greatest risk, and urged other financial institutions to follow its lead.
“We are pushing ourselves to do more and go faster on climate and we call on the global community to do the same,” he said. “This is about putting countries and communities in charge of building a safer, more climate-resilient future.”
This year, the World Bank devoted $20.5bn to climate change, meeting the targets it promised as part of the Paris agreement two years early. However, the group has decided more is needed.
Adapting to the effects of climate change that are already inevitable will be a key aim, and for the first time the World Bank will put this effort on an equal footing with reductions in emissions, investing $50bn in direct finance to adaptation over the period.
Of the $200bn, half will come in direct funding from the World Bank and half will be loans and other forms of assistance from other parts of the World Bank group, aimed at mobilising further finance from the private sector.
For instance, some funding will go towards providing early-warning systems and high-quality weather forecasts, which is expected to help 250 million people in 30 developing countries prepare for extreme weather.
Further funding will go towards “smart agriculture”, which is better adapted to the expected changes in weather and will help protect food production in some of the worst-affected developing countries. It will also help to protect 120m hectares of forest.
Kristalina Georgieva, the chief executive of the World Bank, said: “People are losing their lives and livelihoods because of the disastrous effects of climate change. We must fight the causes but also adapt to the consequences.”
Andrew Steer, the president of the World Resources Institute, said the bold and ambitious commitments would send a strong signal to private sector financiers.
“With climate impacts already taking a heavy toll around the globe, we know a far greater response is needed. Investing in climate action is the smart choice – it can reduce poverty, inspire innovation and bring far-reaching benefits to society,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/03/world-bank-invest-climate-change

The naturalist was chosen to represent the world’s people in addressing delegates of almost 200 nations who are in Katowice to negotiate how to turn pledges made in the 2015 Paris climate deal into reality.
As part of the UN’s people’s seat initiative, messages were gathered from all over the world to inform Attenborough’s address on Monday. “Right now we are facing a manmade disaster of global scale, our greatest threat in thousands of years: climate change,” he said. “If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.”
“Do you not see what is going on around you?” asks one young man in a video message played as part of a montage to the delegates. “We are already seeing increased impacts of climate change in China,” says a young woman. Another woman, standing outside a building burned down by a wildfire, says: “This used to be my home.”
Attenborough said: “The world’s people have spoken. Time is running out. They want you, the decision-makers, to act now. Leaders of the world, you must lead. The continuation of civilisations and the natural world upon which we depend is in your hands.”
Attenborough urged everyone to use the UN’s new ActNow chatbot, designed to give people the power and knowledge to take personal action against climate change.
Recent studies show the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, and the top four in the past four years. Climate action must be increased fivefold to limit warming to the 1.5C scientists advise, according to the UN.
The COP24 summit was also addressed by António Guterres, the UN secretary general. “Climate change is running faster than we are and we must catch up sooner rather than later before it is too late,” he said. “For many, people, regions and even countries this is already a matter of life or death.”
Guterres said the two-week summit was the most important since Paris and that it must deliver firm funding commitments. “We have a collective responsibility to invest in averting global climate chaos,” he said.
He highlighted the opportunities of the green economy: “Climate action offers a compelling path to transform our world for the better. Governments and investors need to bet on the green economy, not the grey.”
Andrzej Duda, the president of Poland, spoke at the opening ceremony, saying the use of “efficient” coal technology was not contradictory to taking climate action. Poland generates 80% of its electricity from coal but has cut its carbon emissions by 30% since 1988 through better energy efficiency.
Friends of the Earth International said the sponsorship of the summit by a Polish coal company “raises the middle finger to the climate”.
A major goal for the Polish government at the summit is to promote a “just transition” for workers in fossil fuel industries into other jobs. “Safeguarding and creating sustainable employment and decent work are crucial to ensure public support for long-term emission reductions,” says a declaration that may be adopted at the summit and is supported by the EU.
In the run-up to the summit, Donald Trump expressed denial about climate change, while there were attacks on the UN process from Brazil’s incoming administration under Jair Bolsonaro.
Ricardo Navarro, of Friends of the Earth in El Salvador, said: “We must build an alternative future based on a just energy transformation. We face the threat of rightwing populist and climate-denying leaders further undermining climate protection and racing to exploit fossil fuels. We must resist.”
Another goal of the summit is for nations to increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions; currently they are on target for a disastrous 3C of warming. The prime minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, who led the 2017 UN climate summit, said his country had raised its ambitions. He told the summit: “If we can do it, you can do it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/03/david-attenborough-collapse-civilisation-on-horizon-un-climate-summit

In theory, there has never been a better time for developing countries to install renewable energy such as solar or wind to combat climate change. The UN’s Green Climate Fund (GCF), along with the World Bank and regional development banks, have all said they intend to significantly increase their green energy financing, offering developing countries cheap loans and grants. Many donor countries like Britain and Japan have also pledged to help poorer nations switch to clean energy.
But as diplomats and organisations from 190 countries will hear this week at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, the reality is that the public money available is not nearly enough to meet their needs. Existing funds will not provide clean electricity for people who live beyond grids.
The GCF, set up in 2010 to handle the money countries pledged to help the world adapt to climate change, is the great new hope for developing countries. But it has had a slow and torrid start, with rich countries backsliding on their pledges to fund it and poor countries bitterly complaining that international banks control the funds for their own profit. Last year Donald Trump cancelled $2bn (£1.57bn) of the $3bn promised to the GCF by former president Barack Obama. More recently, Australia has chosen not to contribute.
“We now have 93 projects, worth $4.6bn. Thirty-nine projects, worth $1.6bn in GCF resources, are under implementation, and we expect to have disbursed around $483m by the end of the year,” said Simon Wilson, head of communication in the external affairs division of the Korea-based operation.
Wilson says more than 40% of the GCF’s projects are micro- or small-scale investments of under $250,000. “Demand for climate finance already exceeds supply, and disbursement of funds for energy projects is expected to pick up quickly over the next few years,” he said.
But Neha Rai, senior researcher at London-based International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), said little international climate money is funding decentralised, or off-grid, energy.
“Of the $14bn approved so far for climate finance worldwide, about 40%, or $5.6bn, has been marked for energy projects. But only 3% ($475m) has been allocated for decentralised energy. That is the equivalent of just $51m a year,” she says.
Instead of accessing public funds from governments, developing countries must turn to commercial banks. But these, motivated by profit, are loth to provide money to what they consider risky projects.
“For a [clean energy] proposal to be accepted by a bank, it needs hard data and a wealth of detail,” says Nathan Rive, a climate change specialist with the Asian Development Bank. “However, in many developing countries data on energy and emissions is sparse, unavailable or unreliable, making detailed project-specific climate assessments difficult.”
The resulting bias toward more developed countries is stark. Of the roughly $333bn estimated by financial research group Bloomberg New Energy Finance to have been invested worldwide in renewable energy in 2017, nearly $280bn went to China, the US, Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia.
A handful of middle-income countries like Mexico and South Korea, India, Brazil and Egypt absorbed a further $28bn. The remaining countries attracted only about $25bn between them, despite having most of the people currently without electricity.
Ironically, climate change may be making it even harder for developing countries to raise money for renewable energy projects. Particularly vulnerable ones, such as Bangladesh and small island states, must pay more to borrow because climate change is regarded by banks as an extra financial risk, according to a new UN Environment Programme–backed study.
Researchers who examined the financial data of 48 countries, including Bangladesh, Guatemala, Kenya and Vietnam, found that vulnerable countries have had to pay an extra $62bn for capital over the past 10 years.
“Climate vulnerability has already raised the average cost of borrowing to developing countries through higher interest rates. We expect the additional interest payments attributable to climate vulnerability to increase to between $146bn and $188bn over the next decade,” says Charles Donovan, director of the Centre for Climate Finance at Imperial College Business School.
Consultants working with ministers and banks to raise clean energy finance say the world’s 47 least developed countries and the 39 small island developing states are barely on the financial map for clean energy.
“There are major challenges in reaching least developed countries and small island developing states, due to a lack of sophisticated capital. As a result of this … renewable energy projects tend to be located in middle-income countries,” said Virginie Fayolle, a senior economist who leads climate finance at Acclimatise, a London-based consultancy which advises developing countries on how to access climate finance.
Developing countries require a higher level of investment in infrastructure, such as small-scale, off-grid and decentralised projects, to reach more remote populations, said Ming Yang, a senior climate change specialist at the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which has provided a significant amount of money for small-scale electrification.
Between October 1991 and August 2017, the GEF granted $1.19bn to 254 renewable energy projects. Of these, 43% are micro-grids, mini-grids or decentralised, said Yang.
“The problem is not that there is not enough money. It is lack of political will. There is definitely institutional bias against poor countries when it comes to sustainable energy,” said Lidy Nacpil, coordinator of the Asian Peoples’ Movement on Debt and Development.
“We see renewable energy as a public good and say that governments and international financial institutions should use public funds to take the lead in developing democratic renewable energy systems,” she said.

After thousands of masked protesters fought running battles with police and burned cars, buildings and barricades in the most affluent areas of Paris on Saturday, the gilets jaunes – or yellow vests – citizens’ protest movement continued on Monday with peaceful anti-government demonstrations at barricades on roads and at fuel depots across France.
High-school students – who have been protesting against changes to colleges and the university system – also seized on the mood of protest and stepped up their blockades.
About 100 high schools were fully or partially blockaded around the country, including in the southern city of Toulouse and in Créteil in the Paris area.
Seven teenagers were arrested after riot police were called to the Jean-Pierre Timbaud high school in Aubervilliers in the northern Paris suburbs where a car was overturned and bins were set alight.
French authorities traditionally fear high school students joining protests because their demonstrations often spread fast. An official at the education authority in Créteil said: “Pretexts are clearly being used to commit urban violence.”
An 80-year-old woman died in Marseille on Monday after she was hit by a police teargas grenade on Saturday. She was inside her apartment and had opened her windows to close her shutters when she was hit by the grenade as police confronted protesters. She died in hospital after surgery.
Meanwhile, 11 fuel depots across France were shut down after being blockaded by protesters. More than 70 petrol stations had run out of fuel and restrictions were in place in Brittany on how much fuel motorists could purchase.
An opinion poll for Harris Interactive taken after Saturday’s violence in Paris found 72% of French people still supported the protest movement that began last month in response to a rise in environmental taxes on fuel and has morphed into opposition to the government of the centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, amid a sense that the tax system is unfair and favours the rich.
The prime minister is expected to meet protesters’ representatives on Tuesday, but the grassroots movement, which emerged on social media, has no leadership nor a defined structure. One Paris representative said he had received death threats warning him not to meet the government.
Jacline Mouraud, one of the protest movement’s prime instigators, said scrapping the fuel tax was a “prerequisite for any discussion” with the government.
Macron’s challenge in calming the widespread anger against the government is complicated by his own desire not to yield to street protests, which repeatedly forced his predecessors into U-turns.
“Thinking that, as we have always done for 30 years, that you make a little symbolic gesture and then we sweep the dust under the carpet, that doesn’t resolve the fundamental, structural problem,” the government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said, implying the government would not make major concessions.
Most opposition politicians urged the government to abandon a planned tax on fuel that was to begin in January; the only exception was the Green party, which said instead that tax must be fairer.
Laurent Wauquiez, the hardline leader of the rightwing Les Républicains party, said Macron should call a referendum on carbon tax “to let the people’s voice be heard”, but did not specify exactly what form a referendum would take.
The economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, said the solution for tackling the low purchasing power of struggling families lay in reducing the tax burden in France, which is among the highest in Europe.
“We must speed up the reduction of taxes,” he said. “But for that we must speed up the decrease in public spending.”
Saturday’s violence in Paris has alarmed the French business community, which claims it has already lost billions of euros, as representatives met the economy minister.
Hotel unions said bookings were down 15%. Retailers in Paris and other cities in which there were violent protests on Saturday, such as Toulouse, said they had suffered major losses in the crucial run-up to Christmas.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/03/students-blockade-schools-as-french-protests-spread

Perhaps, The Guardian could update this story accordingly and rename it “The Guardian view on the Yellow shirts” ?Uh ?Glad to read that the myth of the “poor” oppressed yellow gilets is about to be debunked.To start with the Yellow shirts are everything but poor, at least by British standards they wouldn’t be, they are house owners.They have bought Noddy houses in Noddy dwellings in the middle of nowhere or that old village house at bargain price, precisely because it was located miles away of everything, be it shops, secondary education schools and off course from where the jobs are.If they are pensioners, they will moan that there is no GP, let aside a Chemist store which they can access without a car.None of the above categories were threatened at gun point to buy said houses.As journalists like a convenient name this group of population were described as the Rurbain(s) as in Rural + Urban, when it became trendy, some 20ish years ago.They were very welcomed in rural communities because it takes just one extra kid to keep a classroom open.I remember reading a story about this British family in Dordogne whose two children “rescued” a French village school which closure notice was written on the wall.When French “Rurbans” started suing farmers whose farms stood next to their rebuilt stone houses on the ground that pig sh*t stinks, it went a little bit less well.If a good deal of these lower middle class house owners couldn’t afford the diesel bill associated with the remote location of their houses, they shouldn’t have bought them in the first place.Cake and eat it springs to mind.As a consequence, French find themselves with a fringe of their population which want to benefit of a country side lifestyle and fresh air for their children and expect the majority who lives in Cities, for some don’t even own a car, to subsidize them whilst their own children and aging parents choke on diesel fumes.By the same measure, electric cars charging points in Cities have to be paid for at the expense of the local taxpayers council taxes ....but not by those who will reload their cars in order to return on the cheap to their comfy dwellings.The electric car itself being subsidized at the expense of every other taxpayers.Yet, 7 in 10 French “understand” (supposedly) and support the Yellow Gilets or is it shirts .... mass manipulation, anyone ?', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1544014565000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'precisely it was located miles away of everything', u'effect': u'they have bought noddy houses in noddy dwellings in the middle of nowhere or that old village house at bargain price be it shops'}, {u'cause': u'it takes just one extra kid to keep a classroom open', u'effect': u'they were very welcomed in rural communities'}], u'author_id': u'17062045', u'id': u'123358323', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'1000100101', u'text': u'BQSTART

But as he flew higher, he lost a sense of the public mood and failed to face up early on to a crisis which brought his modern industrial society to a halt. In doing so he revealed an inability to control events or win around public opinion. Then the country was Britain and the young prime minister Tony Blair. Today the nation is France; and the leader is Emmanuel Macron. Then, as now, a series of seemingly leaderless protests saw aggrieved social constituents latch on to a narrowly framed but popular economic grievance: the rising cost of fuel due to green taxes. Mr Blair considered bringing in the army. Mr Macron weighs up whether a state of emergency will restore order.
It is tempting think plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose – but that would ignore the broader picture. President Macron faces a threat far more existential than Mr Blair did. Liberal democracies are being destabilised by the ability of groups to organise and criticise on social media with arguments that previously would have taken longer to enter the political bloodstream. The gilets jaunes (yellow vest) unrest saw 170,000 take to the nation’s streets at the weekend. Rioters torched cars and buildings. Scribbled on the Arc de Triomphe was “Macron resignation”. Mr Macron’s pro-business rhetoric and tin ear for the street have seen him cast as the embodiment of the nation’s elite, disconnected from the country, and willing to favour the rich.
Mr Macron was right to suggest that higher fuel taxes are needed to fight climate change. Promoting green policies is crucial in the week that climate talks begin in Poland. We have just a dozen years to reduce emissions and cap global warming at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Mr Blair ended above-inflation increases of fuel prices. This was a mistake: the long-term survival of this planet rests on politicians making the right call. But while higher taxes can be useful to change people’s behaviours, they are not sufficient when so many people feel they are an extra burden in precarious times. Mr Macron ought to recall the words of Louis XIV’s finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who remarked wisely that “the art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest possible amount of feathers with the smallest possible amount of hissing”. The sound of gilets jaunes hissing is now ringing in the French president’s ears.
Seen as aloof and well-off, Mr Macron needs to regain his popular touch. His party, La République En Marche, will square off against the far-right Rassemblement National (the re-branded National Front) in the European parliament elections next May. Mr Macron staked his future on winning over Germany by delivering pro-market structural reforms in France, which would put an end to EU reprimands over Paris’s budget plans. His bet that tax cuts would be more popular than more spending has not paid off. Whatever their benefits, the only tax cut people remember is the one for the rich. Mr Macron’s big ideas have also been relegated by Berlin in favour of smaller measures. It would be smarter now to steer Europe away from market-heavy policies and put a greater emphasis on growth in France’s stuttering economy. The unemployment rate is still stubbornly close to 10%. Mr Macron is right that the eurozone would operate better with a federal fiscal capacity and a full banking union. But he can only make those arguments by being canny enough to win over voters at home.

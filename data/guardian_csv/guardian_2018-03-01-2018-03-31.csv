The region experienced its warmest winter on record. Sea ice hit record lows for the time of year, new US weather data revealed on Tuesday.
“It’s just crazy, crazy stuff,” said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, who has been studying the Arctic since 1982. “These heat waves – I’ve never seen anything like this.”
Experts say what’s happening is unprecedented, part of a global warming-driven cycle that probably played a role in the recent strong, icy storms in Europe and the north-eastern US.
The land weather station closest to the North Pole, at the tip of Greenland, spent more than 60 hours above freezing in February. Before this year, scientists had seen the temperature there rise above freezing in February only twice before, and then extremely briefly. Last month’s record-high temperatures have been more like those typical of May, said Ruth Mottram, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute.
Of nearly three dozen different Arctic weather stations, 15 of them were at least 10F (5.6C) above normal for the winter.
“The extended warmth really has staggered all of us,” Mottram said. 
In February, Arctic sea ice covered 5.4m sq miles, about 62,000 sq miles smaller than last year’s record low, the ice data center reported, and it was 521,000 square miles below the 30-year normal.
Sea ice is frozen ocean water that, in contrast to icebergs and glaciers, forms, grows and melts on the ocean. It is still growing, but “whatever we grow now is going to be thin stuff” that easily melts in the summer, Serreze said.
Something similar has been noted in the Pacific with open water on the normally iced-up Bering Sea, said the data center senior scientist Walt Meier. To be happening on opposite sides of the Arctic at the same time was unusual, he added.
“Climate change is the overriding thing,” Meier said. ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/06/arctic-warmest-winter-record-climate-change

My point about systemic failure was aimed at human productive and logistical networks.

Indeed the strike became a threat to the fuel distribution network, posing hazard of a feedback induced logical failure.

Some physical systems (computers are physical systems of course: if I had more space I would describe the difference more carefully) also have this kind of property, usually known as chaos or sensitive dependence on initial conditions (SDIC): tiny changes get blown up into huge later changes in the system. Weather, famously, is one such (which is why exponential increases in the computing power we can put into forecasting weather only result in roughly linear improvements in the time we can forecast it for).
Climate does not seem to be one of those systems: small changes in forcings tend to result in small changes to the climate. I am not sure if we understand mathematically why that is, or whether there are regions of the phase space of climate where there is SDIC (there almost certainly are: see below). But we have at least two sorts of experimental evidence that the climate is well-behaved in this sense: first of all we have quite good records of the way the climate behaved in the past, in particular during several cycles of glaciations & deglaciations, and it didn't fall off any cliffs, even when the total temperature swings were ~10 degrees. Secondly we can look around us and see life, and life depends on the climate not continually lashing about: trees, for instance, depend on changes being slow because they can't get up and walk to where the climate is more suitable for them, but have to creep around over hundreds or thousands of years by growing child trees in better places. And there are a lot of trees.
None of this means that there are not regions in the phase space where the climate does lash around wildly: as I said, almost certainly there are. But there's no real evidence that we're close to such a region. The most worrying thing is that we're pushing change into the system at a rate much faster than it has happened, almost ever (the event that killed the dinosaurs was faster: things like ice-ages were much slower, as was the PETM).
And even assuming the climate does not fall off a cliff in some way, the results of the changes driven by us are still very bad, of course.
In response to your comment about the US and food security: yes, obviously the US will not be the first country where a lot of people starve after harvests fail.

East Antarctic ice sheet Thresholds for disintegration of the East Antarctic ice sheet by surface melting involve warmings above 20°C, a situation that has not occurred for at least the last 15 million years (Barker et al., 1999), and which is far more than thought possible under any scenario of climatic change currently under consideration. In that case, the ice sheet would decay over a period of at least 10,000 years.

...........we list the linear trend in the signals due to ENSO, volcanic forcing and solar variation in table 3. The magnitudes of these trend contributions are quite small compared to the overall trends. In fact the net trend due to these three factors is negative for all data sets except UAH, for which it is zero. Hence these factors have not contributed to an upward trend in temperature data, rather they have contributed a very slight downward trend.

Since the sum of all known natural forcings are negative, and the sum of all known anthropogenic forcings (and their feedbacks) more than account for observed warming, it is a very simple logical conclusion.

I think that as far as we know it has been broadly robust in the past, for instance: except in the case of really huge disturbances like enormous rocks falling from space. Certainly it seems unlikely that we'd see the kind of life we do if the climate kept falling off cliffs.
On the other hand you could argue that what is happening now is a really large disturbance: certainly the rate of change (which, within limits, is the bad thing) is about ten times higher now than it was during the most recent deglaciation, for instance.

That paper mentions Turkey, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Egypt as planning more polluting coal, and the Climate Action Tracker says pledges from China, India and Indonesia are not 'consistent with limiting warming below 2 °C as it would require many other countries to make a comparably greater effort and much deeper reductions'.
So how do we help achieve the necessary ambition in industrialising countries? Diplomacy and co-operation, obviously, but also international or bilateral mechanisms? Governments need to invest as well as regulate at many levels. Besides assistance with decarbonising, countries can also impose Border Carbon Adjustments, which should encourage producer countries to align their pricing of fossil fuels appropriately (so that producer nations keep the income rather than the country imposing the duty).

I don't think Erik wants to be seen as an expert, he's always come across to me as an eager laymen and I believe that's his intention. 
Anyway, it's self-evident that there is absolutely nothing untoward about a layman posting information from expert presentations. There's nothing wrong with pointing out that, for instance, one expert opinion is not necessarily the view of the collective literature, as you often do.
But if you are going to impose your morality on others as you have with Erik, I am going to impose mine on you: Your sin is not having an ounce of self-awareness and resultantly an almost comical lack of empathy with your fellow-neurotics posting on this board.

The issue is that sea levels keep rising for several hundred years after we stabilize temperatures, largely due to the continued melting of ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland from the heat already in the climate system.
The study considered two scenarios. In the first, human carbon pollution peaks somewhere between 2020 and 2035 and falls quickly thereafter, reaching zero between 2035 and 2055 and staying there. Global temperatures in the first scenario peak at and remain steady below 2°C. In the second scenario, we capture and sequester carbon to reach net negative emissions (more captured than emitted) between 2040 and 2060, resulting in falling global temperatures in the second half of the century.
The authors found that global average sea level will most likely rise by about 1.3 meters by 2300 in the first scenario, and by 1 meter in the second. However, there is large uncertainty due to how little we understand about the stability of the large ice sheets in Greenland and especially Antarctica. At the high end of possible ice sheet loss, we could see as much as 4.5 meters of sea level rise by 2300 in the first scenario, and close to 3 meters in the second scenario.
The study also shows that it’s critical that our carbon pollution peaks soon. Each 5-year delay – a peak in 2025 instead of 2020, for example – most likely adds 20 cm of sea level rise by 2300, and could potentially add a full meter due to the uncertainty associated with the large ice sheets:
we find that a delay of global peak emissions by 5 years in scenarios compatible with the Paris Agreement results in around 20 cm of additional median sea-level rise in 2300 … we estimate that each 5 years of delay bear the risk of an additional 1 m of sea-level rise by 2300 … Delayed near-term mitigation action in the next decades will leave a substantial legacy for long-term sea-level rise.
And remember, this is all for scenarios in which we meet the Paris climate targets, which we’re currently not on pace to achieve. If we miss the Paris targets, sea levels will rise higher yet.
Another new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that sea level rise has been accelerating. If the rate of acceleration continues – which the lead author notes is a conservative estimate – we would see an additional 65 cm (close to a meter above pre-industrial sea level) of sea level rise by 2100.
Yet another new study published in The Cryosphere using satellite data found that while the East Antarctic Ice Sheet has remained stable in recent years, ice loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has accelerated. Antarctica is now discharging 1.93 trillion tons of ice each year, up from about 1.89 trillion tons per year in 2008. When accounting for snow accumulation, the continent is losing about 183 billion tons of ice per year – enough to raise sea levels by about 3 to 5 millimeters per decade by itself. The melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet is likewise accelerating and is now responsible for about 25% of annual sea level rise (8.5 millimeters per decade).
Meanwhile, the Arctic has been remarkably warm in February – as much as 35°C hotter than average in some areas. In mid-winter, when sea ice should be growing, in the Bering Sea it’s instead shrinking. 
Today's Bering Sea ice extent was lower than any value from Jan 15th to May 2nd during any of the previous 38 years; and the Feb 20th value was only half of the previous lowest Feb 20 value. #akwx @AlaskaWx @ZLabe pic.twitter.com/FPXThXkdUC
The hot Arctic is important because the temperature difference between the Arctic and lower latitudes is one of the main forces that keeps the jet stream moving steadily west-to-east. With a hot Arctic, the jet stream is weakened, leading to weird weather in the USA and Europe. As a result, the western states have been experiencing relatively quite cold temperatures, while the US east coast has been unseasonably hot.
To sum up, ice sheet melt is accelerating, as in turn is sea level rise. Even if we manage to achieve the Paris target of less than 2°C global warming above pre-industrial temperatures, we’re likely to eventually see more than a meter of sea level rise, and potentially several meters. The longer we take to reach peak carbon pollution in the coming years, the higher the oceans will rise. Disappearing sea ice in the rapidly-warming Arctic also appears to be causing increasingly weird and extreme weather in places like America and Europe.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/01/decisions-today-will-decide-antarctic-ice-sheet-loss-and-sea-level-rise

As I have pointed out only a few days ago, this is ""noise""
It is not statistically relevant.
It is not scientifically relevant.
It makes no difference to the climate trend.
Climate is measured over 30 years, as defined back in 1934 by the IMO (the WMO's predecessor). This is text book knowledge for anyone genuinely interested in climate matters.
As others have pointed out, the genuinely informed were expecting such wilfully ignorant tripe and were taking bets on when it would be posted by the deniers.
Well done, you may have made some people some money for so hastily proclaiming a cooling trend and confirming the statistical and scientific ignorance of deniers writ large.
On top of which as has also been pointed out you are using El Nino peak years to try and prove your point which is why you are doubly wrong because we know the El Nino/La Nina cycles which are internal variables are the reason the 30 years period was chosen.

So-called climate sceptics have only one plan - to confuse people.
They provide a selection of conflicting ideas, along these lines:
When considering global temperature rise, declining sea ice area, melting glaciers, or sea level rise .........
(a) it is not happening and
(b) it is a natural event and
(c) it is a good thing
All at the same time, or one at a time, as required.
Some say ""Temperatures havn't changed for ...... years."" (With various different numbers in the gap.)
Others say ""The Earth has been cooling for ..... years."" (As above)
Some say ""It's the Sun causing the warming."" (solar scientists don't agree).
Others say ""It's all a hoax"".
Or ""It's a religion"".
Others say ""There's an Ice Age coming"".
Or ""It's all caused by volcanoes.""
And so on and so on.
Some say there is no such thing as a greenhouse effect (there is), others say the rise in CO2 is natural (it isn't).
When one of them posts any one of the above ideas, strangely the others (who have posted different ideas just before) don't pile in and argue with them.
They only argue with people posting material based on scientific research.
It's a fringe view, based on no evidence.
They appear to be just another group of conspiracy theorists - but of course some are linked to various vested interests.

Oh, as expected - you want to compare an El Nino event with the period straight after an El Nino event.
However, every La Nina year since 1998 has been warmer than every El Nino year before 1995.
To date, all 17 years of the 21st century rank among the 18 warmest on record (adding 1998 makes up the full 18.)
The top 5 years (from NOAA) are - 5th, 2010 ....... 4th, 2014 .... 3rd, 2017 ...... 2nd, 2015 .... 1st, 2016.
The ENSO cycle is the most significant short-term cycle; it contributes some of the ""wiggle"" in the trend.

NOW in central England, we don't get an average of 10 to 20 mornings with snow cover per year any more, because central England is warmer.

To investigate the role of feedback mechanisms Pithan and Maritsen employ an inverted radiative kernel methodology and devise a linear decomposition of the individual contributions to tropical and Arctic warming (Fig. 1). They find that on average lapse rate and surface albedo feedback contribute the same amount to Arctic warming, but since lapse rate feedback cools the tropics it is the main contributor to Arctic amplification. Also Planck feedback makes a sizeable contribution to Arctic amplification, such that together these two temperature feedbacks dominate the response.
BQEND my bold.
The overal science on Planck feedback-
BQSTART
the Planck feedback: The higher the temperature of a radiating body, the more energy it radiates. This is a negative feedback, and it is very strong, so the total feedback is negative for our Earth. In climate science, the Planck feedback is often not mentioned and explained explicitly.

i.e. A feedback that reduces an initial warming is a ""negative feedback."", yet the study you refer to suggests that it may have greater role in Arctic amplified warming and hence a positive feedback.

It has never been so warm for so long at this time of year before and it is just possible that the effects will be catastrophic. We are talking, of course, about the Arctic, where over vast areas of frozen sea the temperatures are higher than they are in Britain today. A blast of winter in Britain and across much of northern Europe is unpleasant but perfectly survivable and affects few people outside the region, but a period of unseasonal warming in the Arctic could be the harbinger of something that changes the whole world for the worse. Both could be connected so that the cold winds that belong in the Arctic have broken out southwards to chill us while warm winds melt the ice cap. We don’t know, but that’s no reason for complacency.
Precisely because climate change on the scale now under way is outside all previous experience of which we have records, it’s impossible to know which unprecedented fluctuations are those that mark the transition to a new and more dangerous state. That determination can only be made long afterwards, when it is too late to change anything. It does not mean there is nothing to worry about; only that we can’t be certain what ought to worry us. This one probably should. The weather in the Arctic has always shifted dramatically over short periods, but the drama has never been this intense since records began. At one spot in Greenland the temperature rose 36C above the annual average, and for two days in February the north pole has been warmer than Zurich in Switzerland.
The system of global climate is extremely complicated and full of feedback loops that are not properly understood, but the worry is that the freak warming of the Arctic marks the emergence of a new feedback loop where increasing temperature leads to still more destabilising rises. The polar vortex, a great girdle of winds that keeps the cold air of the Arctic separate from the warmer air of temperate regions, seems to be weakening. Warm air goes north; cold air comes south. In the long run, everything grows warmer.
At the moment, this seems to be mainly affecting the Arctic sea ice, which is shrinking at an astonishing rate but does not of itself contribute to rising sea levels. The fear must be that the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, which rest on buried land, will melt and drown many of the world’s most populated coastlines. Sea levels will rise for the rest of this century even if the ambitious targets of the Paris accords are met. These commit the world to cutting the net emissions of greenhouse gases to zero by 2050. Even if that happens, the latest research suggests that sea levels will continue to rise for another two centuries, and may do so by a completely catastrophic amount. The change in behaviour must come quickly: every five years’ delay in action may add another 20cm to the projected sea level rise.
All these changes may seem small and distant. It is human nature to worry more about 2cm of snow falling in our back yard today than all the oceans of the world rising by 10 times as much over the next century. But the one is a parochial inconvenience and the other a global catastrophe. The snow this week may be a warning of something very much more destructive and we should act as if it were, even if we can’t be certain that it is. The consequences of misplaced optimism would be far worse than those of a pessimism that was not borne out by events. Our descendants won’t thank us if they never see any snow in a shrunken Britain where the coastline runs past Cambridge.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/01/the-guardian-view-on-snow-and-ice-its-too-cold-here-but-too-warm-in-the-arctic

They have an important part to play. And they do in this country. As does thermal and PV solar.
But heat pumps are only one element of the future. They require vast amounts of electricity throughout the winter cycle. Even a minergy standard home, of which there are virtually none in Britain, will require 3000 kWh per heating season. Or 20 kWh per day on an average winter day. Or 30 kWh on a cold day. When the grid is creaking. By comparison our entire domestic electricity consumption per year is 1800 kWh. And many homes here produce more eletricity than they use.
Presumable, in addition to the mass use of heat pumps, you also want electrical cars. How are you going to cope?
Your claims on emissions are wrong. For one thing carbon monoxiode is highly toxic, but not a greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide is. It is the result of incomplete combustion. State-of-the-art wood burning does not produce methane. Methane emissions are also the result of incomplete combustion, ie incomplete chemical reduction because of insufficient temperatures and oxygen input. 
You need to check your chemistry. If you knew German I would refer you to the association of Swiss oven builders and their computer modulations requisite for every single oven installed.
The same holds for black carbon. It is fuel emitted unburnt.
You refer to 'domestic heaters’. Again you are unaware of the technologies developed in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and elsewhere. We do not use Villagers or Agas.
There is no single fix to the energy and climate future. In the building sector heat pumps are one very important element. But they require an awful lot of electrical power, in winter, when it is least available. I have a fairly good grasp on the capacities of the Alpine storage batteries in winter and know their limitations, as well as the limitations of the grid in Continental Europe. In Britain the situation is much worse. Without interconnectors to the Continent, Norway and Ireland, the UK cannot install sufficient heat pump capacity. Particularly as long as it still exports waste to Oslo (of all places) to heat the homes in Norway, in combination with electricity generation and steam for industries. With plenty of oil, gas, and hydro electricity available.
We are far ahead of the UK in combined heating systems in cities, from waste burning, sewage treatment plants, geothermal, and waste heat from industries, office servers and cooling systems. And wood there plays a part, as woodchips, pellets, and logs. Whereas Britain still does landfills, with huge amounts of uncaptured methane emissions. They are extremely potent climate agents.
In new homes we need no outside heating input at all. Solar with a one hundred cubic metre boiler will do.
But the real crunch is the combustion engine, road transport. Urban transit systems, trains, trams, trolleybuses on renewable electricity, cycling, walking, planning reducing commuter distances: that is where the music plays. And air transport. Why airline kerosene is untaxed is difficult to convey.

""It seems that wood burning is not climate neutral in the short term and requires an increase in forested area to be climate neutral in the longer term.""
Some serious thinking is required here. And scientific analysis. 
In sustainable forestry, with as much wood growing as is used for heating, the carbon balance over one year is neutral. And incidentally dead wood rotting will release the same amount of carbon as will wood used for heating, unless it is buried and sealed in the ground, turning to peat and eventually coal under water in moors. 
Sustainable forestry prevails across the European Alps. In fact more wood grows (and eventually decomposes unless used) than is harvested. Heating with woodchips and pellets therefore makes sense. And so do log fires with state-of-the-art burning facilities ensuring high temperatures and a sufficient oxygen supply to ensure a complete chemical reduction. 
Any burning of coal and oil will release all the carbon extracted from the earth into the atmosphere, and even supposedly environment friendly gas contains considerable amounts of carbon which is released as carbon dioxide upon burning.
In sustainable forestry the very same amount of carbon dioxide is released by burning or rotting as is split up into carbon and oxygen and thus turned into wood by photosynthesis in the same annual cycle, reducing the carbon dioxide to carbon and oxygen. It is hence carbon neutral. And has been for millenia. In fact since the last ice age. When forests began to grow.
So, given sustainable forestry, with the same amount of wood growing as is used, heating with wood will be carbon neutral. Coal, oil and gas will not.
Our area has the highest amount of timber per hectare of forest in Europe: 400 cubic metres. It also has a lot of biodiversity, with a mix of many kinds of trees, as well as a mix of old and young trees side by side. The maximum amount of trees foresters are allowed to cut in any area is defined by the height of the trees. With trees measuring a length of 25 m, a circle of at the most 50 m diametres may be cut. But mostly individual trees will be taken out, providing space and light for the others and for saplings to grow naturally. Called ungleich verjüngter Blenterwald.
In many areas chimneys are equipped with filtres. Our chimney has a steel tube with a 30,000 Volt DC electrode magnetising any unburnt soot particles, which will then settle on the steel tube, where the chimney sweep will vacuum them up.
The claims made by the article are unsustainable. They only apply if forests are cut down wholesale, as they will be for cattle grazing or soy bean production, or for coconut palms. Instead of castigating wood burners, the authors might have pointed out the effects of meat production in Brazil. Or beef, pork or chicken production and consumption in our parts, with soy beans used as fodder.
Burning wood alongside sustainable forestry is climate friendly. The statement above to the contrary else is untenable. Eat less meat if you wish to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In the process you will also lower methane emissions by cattle.

If you harvest from a large enough area, and know the limits, it's easily possible to 'grow' more carbon than you burn. The yield is variable, obviously, depending on tree types and terrain.
Many hardwood forests in S.E. Ontario are woefully mismanaged as woodlots. You can tell this from the size of the logs generally harvested for firewood. It's not uncommon for people to destroy the unwanted smaller trees in order to pull out the big stuff.
With 'selective thinning' you'll see stretch marks on the remaining trees after only a few years - as growth accelerates, the canopy is opened up, and competition is removed. You hardly ever need to cut big healthy trees. Dead and dying trees are often dangerous to cut and are such a wonderful wildlife resource that they are best left. Intelligently harvested firewood consists mostly of smaller dia. trees. The best trees are grown on and individually harvested at maturity for fine furniture etc. Firewood should only be a small part of the overall harvest. Of course as you go back and rework an area (always with the same philosophy) the thinnings you harvest are inevitably of increased size. It's essentially just horticulture - on a larger scale. As we've only just begun to understand the symbiotic complexities of what's going on under the forest floor, whatever we do in terms of harvest should be done with a very high degree of humility. If you're not tearing up the forest with heavy machinery and ATV's it's almost impossible to see where you've been working after six months or so. After five or six years the growth on the remaining trees can be quite remarkable.
A wood stove should only be considered as part of an equation. Buying and burning wood in a city, outside of that equation, makes absolutely no sense.

Semi-industrialised mass clear cutting for ship building and steel making was the death knell for many areas.

Similarly, the wood heating industry tells us that the wood would rot if not burned. Yet most fallen trees decay in open air and don't produce methane.

The argument being that burning wood produces more general unwanted material (CO2, CO, SO2, soot and particulates) per KWh generated than burning fossil fuels. The fact that is definitely correct is not disputed. The only issue being the dubious definition of ""renewable"" in that a replanted tree will take up most of released CO2 but that will take a hell of a long time and of course all those other serious irritants (especially particulates) will have done serious damage to the environment and people in the meantime.So it should go without saying that we should really stop as much combustion as possible to improve matters for everyone. The options are therefore non combustion renewables (as appropriate to area) and any other ultra low carbon energy sources.To look at the energy density aspect (what will give you banks for your buck) here are some comparisons.Water atop a 100m high hydro electric dam has 0.001MJ/Kg in potential energyWind about a global average 0.005MJ/square metre Solar about a global average 0.03MJ/square metreClearly these options have very low energy density compared to fossil fuels where for example diesel fuel is around 48MJ/Kg which is 48,000 times more energy than the hydro equivalent. This, by comparison, massively more powerful source is simply why we have developed and used fossil fuels all these years.So what other ultra low carbon fuel source is there available?

And there’s no assurance all that carbon will wind up back in trees and the ground, the scientists caution. Logged land could be put to other uses, new forests might be managed differently than the ones they replaced, and insect infestations or droughts could make it hard to reestablish trees. A scientific panel advising the EPA on how to account for carbon released from biomass power plants has cautioned against treating all projects equally. “Carbon neutrality cannot be assumed for all biomass energy a priori,” the panel wrote in a 2012 report”. …. / …. “While some scientists express reservations about a rush to biomass energy, others say it could be a valuable, low-carbon power source. That depends partly on where the fuel comes from, says Tim Volk, a forestry scientist at the State University of New York in Syracuse. He’s experimenting with fast-growing shrub willows that can be harvested on cycles as short as 3 years. Volk says states and the biomass power industry are hindered by a lack of clear, uniform federal guidelines about which power plants will pass muster and which won’t. He was one of more than 100 scientists that signed a 2014 letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy urging the agency to consider the carbon benefits of using wood for energy. ""I think that would be a mistake to declare all forest biomass as carbon neutral,” Volk says. “But let’s set up an assessment system where we can identify those that will have a low-carbon footprint and those that will have a high-carbon footprint.""

In fact, many of the problems with politics comes from people getting very dogmatic about things they don't really understand - sometimes called the Dunning-Kruger effect. 
I see a lot of lay commentators absolutely convinced that they , and sometimes they alone, know the answer to climate-change and everything else. It would be better if everyone except Einstein admitted that an awful lot of smarter and better-informed people disagreed with them on all sorts of issues.
What people ought to be saying is that on lots of issues, there is simply no consensus. If everyone acknowledged this, then we should be discussing how to resolve these issues.
BQENDWell then let's stick to discussing the issue instead of getting side-tracked.

BQSTART
My particular focus is climate-change which I consider is a serious problem, and although some think that the problem can be solved with renewable energy alone, I don't. My opinion doesn't count much, although I'm rather certain I'm better informed than most TG commentators. But the opinions of James Hanson and scores of others does count, and cannot be dismissed because a whole lot of lay people have an ideological grudge against nuclear energy.
BQENDNuclear power offers unique performance advantages for portable high power and energy applications - submarines, aircraft carriers, icebreakers, tugs - which make additional risks worth risking. However, for grid power and most other purposes, nuclear power is too risky, in my opinion.
Renewable energy is plentiful so there is no need to burn fossil fuels.
BQSTART
In this case, I think the answer is easy. If there were an entirely transparent process, where contracts were offered to supply continuous electricity to the grid, where any renewable energy providers had to roll generation, storage, extra grid costs, and backup into 1 delivery price, it could actually be proven what the answer is.

This should be reabsorbed as trees regrow. For logs from mature Canadian woodland, it could take more than 100 years before the atmospheric CO2 is less than the alternative scenario of burning a fossil fuel and leaving the trees in the forest.
This matters to prevent climate tipping points such as an ice-free Arctic or shifting monsoon patterns before the wider decarbonisation can take place following the trajectories of the Paris and Kyoto agreements.

Global investors worth $84bn have joined together to file a shareholder motion calling on Rio Tinto to rethink its membership of the MCA, NSW Minerals Council (NSWMC) and the Queensland Resources Council (QRC). It demands Rio Tinto reveal all membership fees paid since 2012, review the consistency of the MCA’s lobbying positions with those held by Rio Tinto, and disclose what it would take for Rio to quit its membership of the MCA.
The action was coordinated by the Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), which is fresh from successfully forcing the country’s biggest miner, BHP, to agree to similar demands.
If the campaign successfully forces both companies to leave the MCA, it would remove about a third of the MCA’s revenue from membership fees. As such, even the threat of leaving could force the MCA to shift its lobbying positions.
When ACCR coordinated a similar motion filed at BHP’s annual general meeting, despite it not winning a vote, BHP agreed to conduct a review of industry associations. That review announced plans to leave the World Coal Association, and declared BHP would quit the MCA if it did not change the way it lobbied for coal.
The resolution filed today was submitted by the Australian Local Government Super, the Church of England Pensions Board and the Seventh Swedish National Pension Fund (AP7).
Together they have $84bn worth of assets under management, and collectively are thought to hold more than $100m worth of Rio Tinto shares.
The resolution is unlikely to gain a majority of votes at the two AGMs held in the UK and Australia (Rio is listed in London and Sydney), but even a significant minority of votes would send a strong signal and could secure a win for ACCR, as it did with BHP.
Despite BHP already agreeing to many of the demands before the AGM voted on the resolution, and the board recommending shareholders vote against it, about 10% of shareholders voted in favour. Brynn O’Brien, the executive director of ACCR, said that was significant, and anything above 5% was taken very seriously by a board.
O’Brien expected more shareholders to support the Rio Tinto motion because it was backed by large institutional investments, unlike the BHP motion, and hoped the board would recommend that shareholders support the motion.
“We think this is really in the company’s interest, so the board should support it and recommend that shareolders vote for it,” she said.
Such a move would not be unprecedented for Rio Tinto. In 2016, the company was faced with a shareholder motion calling for greater transparency on how it deals with climate risk, and the board supported it, recommending shareholders vote in favour.
Bill Hartnett, head of sustainability at Local Government Super, one of the co-filers of the motion, said high energy prices in Australia were a result of the prolonged climate and energy debate here, and that was harming the value of their investment in Rio Tinto.
“We estimate that these high electricity prices are adding tens to hundreds of millions of dollars to Rio Tinto’s overall costs,” he said. “The shareholder value in supporting industry groups with contrary energy and climate positions is not clear to LGS, particularly as Rio has exited the thermal coal business in Australia.”
Adam Matthews, head of engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board, said Rio’s support of the Paris climate agreement demanded that it not support lobbying that is counter to the agreement’s aims.
“For Rio Tinto to be part of the solution to climate change requires consistency in all the company’s activities and from the organisations it supports to lobby on its behalf,” Matthews said.
The wording of the resolution is similar to that filed with BHP, and laments climate and energy policy, when it exists in Australia, being “short-lived policy subject to relentless scrutiny and adversarial campaigning by industry bodies”.
It also outlines the way the MCA and other pro-coal lobby groups supported by Rio Tinto have campaigned for the destruction of Australia’s carbon tax and mining tax, and pushed for government funding for coal power stations.
O’Brien said the shareholder motion is part of a growing and unstoppable movement from investors around the world.
“The drumbeat of opposition to coal lobbyists like the Minerals Council of Australia is only growing louder. The interest by European funds in this resolution reflects the fact that Australia’s inaction on climate and energy has impacts beyond our borders,” she said.
Dylan Tanner is executive director of InfluenceMap, a UK-based NGO that tracks how corporations influence climate policy around the world. He said his group has seen a rise in interest from investors to improve the role companies in their portfolios play in climate and energy debates.
“We have detected a genuine uptick in concern recently and I personally feel 2018 will be the year shareholders get tough on companies who maintain links to egregious lobbyists holding back critical policy progress on a key existential threat to our common future,” he said.
The shareholder revolt has come on the same day as the corporate regulator began legal proceedings in the federal court against Rio, its former chief executive Tom Albanese, and its former chief financial officer Guy Elliott. 
The proceedings relate to statements in Rio Tinto’s annual report for 2011, which the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) alleges were misleading or deceptive.
In December 2010, Rio announced a takeover offer for Riversdale Mining Limited which was completed in August 2011 at a total cost of over US$4bn. Following the acquisition, Rio delisted Riversdale and renamed it Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique.
Asic alleges that Rio Tinto engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct by misrepresenting the reserves and resources of Riversdale in its 2011 annual report.
On 17 January 2013, Rio Tinto announced it expected to recognise a non-cash impairment charge of approximately US$14bn (post-tax) in its 2012 full-year results, including roughly US$3bn relating to Riversdale. It was also announced that Albanese, an American, had stepped down from his role as CEO.

The research, published on Friday in the journal Scientific Reports, comes amid growing concern about the warming of Greenland, Siberia, Alaska and other far northern regions, which have recently experienced unusually prolonged and frequent midwinter temperature spikes. 
The authors from the University of California, Davis, based the study on temperature records and 743 previous phenological studies looking at timings of bird migrations, flowers blooming and amphibians calling. The results showed a curve, with spring events occurring earlier further north of the equator. 
“Spring is arriving earlier, and the Arctic is experiencing greater advances of spring than lower latitudes,” said lead author Eric Post, a fellow of the John Muir Institute and polar ecologist at UC Davis.
Over the past 10 years, this means the end of winter will come about a day earlier in Los Angeles, but two weeks earlier in the Arctic. The authors say the northward increase in the rate of springtime advance is roughly three times greater than indicated by previous studies.
This underlines how pronounced climate change is in the Arctic, where temperatures are rising twice as fast as the global average and ice fields are rapidly shrinking. 
The warming trend has been unusually apparent in recent weeks. Although the sun has not reached the high Arctic since October, temperatures has been above freezing for 61 hours – more than three times the previous record – at Greenland’s northernmost weather monitoring station.
Martin Stendel, lead scientist of the Polar Portal and a senior researcher at the Danish Meteorological Institute, said temperatures in the central Arctic have been 4C warmer than average this winter. In February, several regions were 10C above historic norms. Despite fluctuations, he expects this trend to continue. 
“Think of waves on the beach. Some are high, some are low. That’s the weather. But in the background the tide is coming in. That’s climate change. Even though the waves haven’t changed their properties, they come closer and closer to your feet,” he says. The consequences would include increased melting of the ice sheet, less sea ice, thawing permafrost both on land and under the sea, less snow and more rain even in winter.
The weather has appeared out of joint seasonally and geographically. As much of northern Europe was hit by blizzards and chills, the Danish media joked that residents should visit the Arctic special forces base at Daneborg because it is warmer there.
The Information newspaper interviewed a member of the Sirius Dog Sled Patrol at the base – one of the most northern permanent outposts of humanity – who said the high temperature had turned slow into slush and made sledding heavy.
The handful of troops at the base are used to spending months in cold and darkness. “The first day the sun doesn’t come up you think ‘Wow’,” one member told Greenland Today in 2015. “The water and the rivers stop running because they freeze. The fjord freezes too, so there are no waves or swells that lap at the shore. The small birds fly south so there is no birdsong. Only the ravens overwinter. And then a thick layer of snow comes that muffles everything even more.”
On some patrols, they encounter blizzards that last for days and temperatures as low at -51C.
But there is increasingly frequent respite in the form of warm “foehn wind”. This abrupt warming and drying of moist winds as they pass over ice-masses or mountains is commonly seen in the Alps. Similar phenomenon are the Chinook or “snow eater” of the North American Rocky Mountains; the Zonda of the South American Andes; and the Helm wind of the English Pennines.
February has seen such warmth arrive with unprecedented frequency. 
One member of the Arctic Patrol described the effect as surreal. “Outside, the dogs lie on their backs boiling and we dance around in our underwear enjoying it, until the cold returns.”

Pleased to see my bags have made it too. I was asked to avoid packing synthetic and down clothing wherever possible because it could contaminate the environment, so was pleased all those carefully selected natural fibres had made it with me across the Atlantic. Luke, my press contact at Greenpeace, meets me, which is just as well as I don’t really speak Spanish. We get a taxi to the dock and I have my first view of the Arctic Sunrise – the Greenpeace ship last in the news when it was stormed by the Russian FSB in the Arctic. It is bustling with people fixing things, loading things, working and chatting. Everyone is friendly. I wonder about the different stories that bring them all here. Are they the kind of people who want to jump off the edge of the map, as Werner Herzog found in his documentary about the Antarctic? The ship is smaller than I’d imagined and more “workmanlike”. If I had ever been in any doubt, I now realise that the next two weeks, crossing some of the roughest water in the world to a place that is mostly uninhabitable, isn’t going to be a cruise. 
We were meant to set sail first thing this morning. But the ship is still a flurry of activity and the weather in the Drake Passage – the notorious stretch of water between South America and the Antarctic – is described as “not good”, so we have to wait. I decide to stretch my legs with a walk into the centre of Punta Arenas. It starts off well with a magical view out over forbidding seas towards the Southern Ocean, and I think I spot an albatross. But it ends more prosaically when I am attacked by a dog.
At breakfast I hear sobering tales of the passage ahead. Apparently the ship is notorious for its pitching and rolling, and known affectionately as the “washing machine.” The ship’s doctor, a lovely man, said it can be so severe the walls become the floor and if you hold on to the rail on the bridge your legs fly up behind you so you effectively do a handstand. In the afternoon, I work in my cabin – I want to make sure I make the most of the trip journalistically. Greenpeace is supporting an EU-backed proposal to create the world’s biggest ocean sanctuary in the waters around Antarctica – seas controlled by a disparate group of countries including the UK, US and Australia. While here I hope to report on the undiscovered ecosystems discovered by scientists on board the ship, the threats facing wildlife because of climate change and krill fishing, and the state of the Antarctic ice shelves. But at least as important for me is to soak up as much as I can of this place, and to absorb any wider lessons there may be here for the broader environment movement.
Did some exercise in the makeshift gym in the hold (a couple of yoga mats, some free weights, a rowing machine and exercise bike) before breakfast. At 8am it is cleaning duty – as I am not crew I don’t have to help out but was told that it aids morale if people pitch in. Surprisingly I have found I quite enjoy sweeping the corridors and cleaning the toilets – it makes me feel, in a very small way, part of the daily routine of life on board. We are due to set sail today and at lunch I overhear the captain and some of the engineers laughing as the “newbies” (journalists, photographers, Greenpeace campaign team) tumble into the mess, talking and laughing. They say something along the lines of “look at them all laughing and happy now ... they have no idea what is coming”.
I wake to a moderate swell. During cleaning duties I begin to feel a bit rough so finish an article and lie down, which helps a lot. Later I go up on the bridge and speak to the first mate, Fernando, who shows me the weather forecast for the next few days – five-metre-plus swell and 40-knot headwinds. “It will be rough,” he tells me cheerfully. “You will not enjoy it, but it is not dangerous.”
I have not been able to leave my bunk for two days as the ship is tossed around by huge waves. The pitching and rolling don’t seem to have any rhythm. One minute I am being pushed with some force into my mattress - the next I am lifted, almost hovering, above the bed. My head is repeatedly shunted into the headboard, my feet into the wall at the end of the bed. Every so often a wave catches the boat just right and I am lifted and shunted at the same time so I am left standing, pretty much vertical, on the wall at the bottom of my bed. I try to make it to the mess but the stairs, which in normal times are steep, become momentarily horizontal when each wave hits. My brain, in its current scrambled state, cannot work out when it is safe to try to get up them, so I retreat to my bed. Luke very kindly brings me a banana. 
Apparently I am not the only one who has been suffering. Many people have been confined to their bunks and one crew member has been so ill he has been put on a drip. Managed to get up for a bit this afternoon and watch Pulp Fiction on the ship television but soon retreat to my bunk. Been told that tomorrow we will wake up in Antarctica proper – and calmer waters!
A different world. I see an iceberg through the porthole in the cabin before I get out of bed. After my first breakfast in three days I go onto deck – the first time we have been allowed outside in days. The sea is much calmer and the air bitterly cold. It is quite a scene. Low cloud obscures the tops of the ice-covered mountains rising straight out of the sea and icebergs loom up on either side of the ship. Before I have finished my cup of tea, I see three pods of whales, several seals and innumerable penguins. The place teems with life. To my deprived modern eye, used to sparsely populated “nature”, it feels an almost claustrophobic, disconcerting level of abundance. Another whale – a humpback – arches its tail out of the water and dives into the deep 100 metres from the ship. We have arrived.
Greenpeace takes its responsibilities here seriously. The expedition involves lots of landings to view penguin colonies and seals close up. We have had several biosecurity briefings explaining how to avoid spreading diseases on our boots and clothes. And today we have to abort a trip to a penguin colony for the wonderful reason that there is too much wildlife. It is impossible to land without disturbing them. As one of the ship’s crew says, “this has to be a place where the needs of the wildlife come before anything else.”
I’m supposed to be going on a helicopter ride across the peninsula to land – the first time it’s been done – on the huge iceberg the size of London that broke away from the Larsen C ice shelf last year. So far, however, the weather has not been good enough. I am slightly anxious about the trip as the pilot, who is very experienced in the region, is obviously not convinced it is a good idea (too far, difficult terrain, etc). But we are on standby to fly at first light tomorrow if weather permits.
A bad night’s sleep, due in part to the prospect of the helicopter trip and in part to dreams haunted by the wonderful book I am reading – Apsley Cherry-Garrard’s The Worst Journey in the World, a fascinating and terrifying account of the bravery of the men involved in the British attempt to reach the south pole in 1910. At a 4am meeting, it is decided the weather is too bad. Later, Greenpeace decides to cancel the trip altogether because of the pilot’s concerns. It is a shame, but the right decision. It is the second mate’s birthday and there’s a bit of a party in the evening, booze flowing and good fun all round.
A magical day. It is my favourite kind of weather: clear blue sky and sharp cold air. The visibility is pin-sharp and the views from the ship are quite incredible – some of the ridges and peaks I can see would be famous if they were anywhere else in the world. Spent a couple of hours in a penguin colony just watching them waddle to and from the sea, as seals bobbed in and out of the surf and whales glided past in the distance. A day that will stay long in the memory.
Last morning on the ship. We don’t have to brave the Drake Passage on the way back, but our flight on a small plane to Chile is weather-dependent, so I’m a bit tense. I have been away for nearly three weeks and I’m keen to be reunited with my young family. But after a couple of hours’ wait we get the all-clear from the airport – which I later discover consists of a couple of huts on a bleak, wind-ravaged island – and we are on our way. I take one last look out of the window at the Antarctic being swallowed up by the cloud below. What a privilege it has been.
I sit in the airport, having a beer and waiting for my 14-hour flight back to London. The images of ice and mountains, and the abundance of life in Antarctic waters, are still fresh in my mind: they bring a smile to my face as I write. I have discovered I don’t possess sea-legs but have nevertheless managed to publish articles from the ship, trying to give readers an idea of what is at stake down here – and how a new ocean sanctuary might begin to address some of those issues. I feel I have gained a lifelong appreciation for this truly remarkable place and an understanding – which I hope has come across in my reporting – that although Antarctica seems like an untouched, pristine wilderness, it is threatened by the all-too-familiar perils of climate change and industrial-scale fishing.

Now for their protection | Lucy Siegle,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/adelie-penguin-supercolony-protection-vital,0,"Warning: the drone footage of the discovery of a “supercolony” of Adélie penguins, released by researchers last week, is addictive. The finding, based on penguin guano originally noticed on satellite imagery, led to a penguin census in the region using drone-based cameras before teams were sent in to the region. It’s a story of hope. Adélie penguin populations have fallen by more than 65% in the past 25 years. Over the last seven years, thousands of chicks have died in a “catastrophic breeding failure” in the west of the Antarctic peninsula.
So the discovery of an additional 1.5 million Adélie penguins living quietly on the Danger Islands, in the east Antarctic peninsula, is the conservation equivalent of finding a substantive amount of change down the back of a sofa on the day rent is due. Eviction and extinction have seemingly been postponed.
But we shouldn’t count our chicks. Announcing the secret colony to the world will be an anxious time for the scientists. In popular imaginations, populations are either endangered or fine. The nuances get lost. Society at large has a binary approach to species conservation. Hopeful news throws us off the scent of the enormous amount of work and funding needed to stem what some scientists are calling the “biological annihilation” of wildlife in recent decades.
One of the greatest conservation conundrums is that public support (essential) tends to flow towards species but generally we couldn’t give two hoots about protecting the actual spaces where the species live. Last week’s penguin discovery has been wrapped in important assertions. The site of the find of 700,000 breeding pairs on the Danger Islands in the Weddell Sea is an area where the impacts of climate change have not yet been felt and there is little human activity. Enthusiasm for this supercolony needs to translate into a legally enforceable marine protected area, so that the penguins, left undisturbed for 60 years, remain that way.

Even one with a car on order had not turned up in the snow, said Mark Lavery, chief executive of Cambria Automobiles, looking at a £75,000 Jaguar coupe: “She doesn’t want to spoil an F-type with all that salt on the roads.”
The unseasonal weather will only be a blip on sales: a bigger worry for the industry is the dark, persistent cloud over the future of diesel. The bottom is falling out of the market, to the point where one of Lavery’s managing directors couldn’t persuade his own mother to buy one: “His mum is 74, has driven a diesel for the last 15 years and has now changed it for a petrol one – a higher carbon-emitting, more polluting car.”
Yet while diesel vehicles were pushed by the industry and government on the promise of cutting carbon dioxide emissions, the world is now more urgently addressing its dirty corollary: the NOx emissions which have fouled urban areas and contribute to 40,000-50,000 premature deaths a year in the UK alone from air pollution. 
The drumbeat against diesel picked up pace this week as judges decided that German cities, in the heart of Europe’s biggest car market, have the right to ban diesels on their streets, and Rome’s mayor proposed an outright ban from 2024, a year before Paris expects the same. 
In London, in April 2019 an ultra-low emission zone will double the congestion charge payable to drive in the city centre for any but the very newest, Euro 6, diesel cars, and campaigners are pushing for even tougher sanctions. Boroughs including Islington and Camden have introduced higher parking charges for diesel drivers. 
Other UK cities are still considering how to implement so-called “toxin taxes” on drivers of older vehicles, although Manchester and Leeds have made clear that ordinary car drivers would not be charged. 
Some manufacturers see the writing on the wall: this week, Fiat Chrysler announced plans to end production of diesel cars by 2022; Porsche has ditched two models and Toyota has indicated it will never launch a new diesel. 
But British manufacturers are keen to resist: Jaguar Land Rover in particular is on the hook, with diesel representing around 90% of its cars sold in 2017. It invested heavily four years ago in a new, multi-billion pound Euro 6 engine plant in Wolverhampton, just as Ford was spending almost £400m on its diesel plant in Dagenham. 
In 2017, UK car sales fell, marginally, for the first time in five years – but diesel numbers tumbled spectacularly, by 17.1%. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) pointed to relatively small tax reforms announced by the chancellor in the autumn as prompting a further exodus, with 30% fewer diesels sold last November and December than the same time in 2016.
Even if measures are far short of any ban, David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston University, said: “In a sense the damage is already being done. Consumers have been spooked.” 
Bailey predicts that diesel’s UK market share will drop from one in two cars sold in the first half of this decade to one in seven by 2025. 
Growing evidence about the health damage from diesel pollution was thrust to the forefront by the Volkswagen scandal. While only the German manufacturer was found to be deliberately rigging emission tests, virtually every other carmakers’ model was found to be far dirtier outside the lab. As the industry lobbied to delay stringent, real-world emission tests, the interim period saw some models licensed as Euro 6-compliant that would breach limits set after September 2017. 
Greenpeace has now unearthed data showing many Euro 6 models on sale emit far more NOx than industry rhetoric about their cleanest cars might lead people to believe. Bailey says: “That’s likely to add to confusion for consumers over whether they should buy diesel at all. On this, the industry seems to have collectively shot itself in the foot.”
Resale values have fallen: according to comparison website motorway.co.uk, the average price of a used diesel car fell 5% between the first and final quarter of 2017, while petrol models grew 10% more expensive. 
Lavery is unsurprised: “In and around the M25, there’s a massive switch to hybrid and petrol – less so outside. The conversation is, I want out of my diesel and into a petrol. The average consumer isn’t concerned about their emissions: they’re concerned they won’t be able to drive it where they want to without being penalised.” 
He said that there are “pre-Euro 6 cars that, frankly, have the emissions of a small third world country”. 
But he worries that people are being deterred from buying newer, cleaner diesels. “We shop online and a lot of things get delivered by the oldest, most polluting vans. Government has to come up with a scrappage scheme to get them off the roads – but the current policy just encourages the opposite.”
The SMMT warned this week that the decline of diesel models would increase Britain’s carbon emissions as petrol engines are less fuel efficient – although the larger effect on rising CO2 was the sale of larger cars. 
The campaigners who forced the government, through a supreme court challenge, to belatedly tackle Britain’s dangerously polluted air remain sceptical. Andrea Lee of ClientEarth said: “It is no use flying the flag for a ‘clean’ technology when we keep seeing more incriminating data that confirms that it isn’t.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/04/the-death-of-diesel-can-struggling-industry-woo-back-consumers

Did you know that what’s on your plate plays a larger role in contributing to climate change than the car you drive? When most wealthy people think about their carbon footprint, or their contributions to climate change, they’ll think about where their electricity and heat come from or what they drive. They’ll think about fossil fuels and miles per gallon, about LED lights and mass transit – but not so much about combine harvesters or processed meals or food waste. Few consider the impacts of the food they eat, despite the fact that globally, food systems account for roughly one quarter of all manmade greenhouse gas emissions. That’s more than the entire transportation sector, more than all industrial practices, and roughly the same as the production of electricity and heat.
Meanwhile, the most immediate threat of climate change for most of the global population will be at the dinner table, as our ability to grow critical staple crops is being affected by the warming we’ve already experienced. Between 1980 and 2008, for instance, wheat yields dropped 5.5 % and maize yields fell 3.8% due to rising temperatures. Climate change threatens the food security of millions of poor people around the world. Young people are increasingly keen to protect the environment by shifting to animal-product-free diets. They seek plant proteins which taste like meat, while insects are also growing popular as an alternative.
What these inverse challenges – that food and agriculture are both enormous contributors to climate change, and massively impacted by it – really tell us is that our food systems, as currently structured, are facing major challenges.
There is a much larger problem that implores us to look beyond farm and agricultural practices. We need to open our eyes to solutions that address the full scope of the challenge to create more sustainable and equitable food systems. That way, we can provide healthy food for all people while we protect our planet’s resources at the same time.
So what are food systems? Everything from seed and soil to the supermarket to the plate to the landfill. Food systems include the growing, harvesting, processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items.
While farming alone accounts for 10-12% of global greenhouse gas emissions, when we look at entire food systems the contributions to climate change more than double. A recent report published by the Meridian Institute lays out the many factors throughout food systems that spell trouble for the climate, and also explains why a broad systems-wide perspective is necessary for implementing effective changes.
Consider deforestation and soil. A narrow view of agriculture alone would neglect the fact that a full 80% of the forests that are clear cut or destroyed are done so to create farmland. Forests are massive carbon sinks. So is soil, locking away two to three times as much carbon as there is present in the atmosphere. But farmers can help restore ecosystem functions and build resilient communities by producing crops and livestock in productive ways that sequester carbon and protect forests.
Or consider food waste. Not just the scraps that you throw away, but throughout the entire food system. A staggering 30-40% of the food produced in the world is never eaten. Some never gets harvested, some spoils before it reaches consumers, and a lot is tossed away by retailers, restaurants, and at home. For the sake of comparing emissions, if food waste were its own country it would be the third largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world, after only China and the United States. 
This says nothing of the gross injustice of wasting so much food while so many in the world go hungry. In the developing world, improving infrastructure along the food chain – including cold storage – would prevent much good food being lost. In the developed world, retailers can prevent large amounts of waste by finding outlets for slightly blemished goods and consumers can limit waste by buying food in amounts they actually want and need.
There are countless more examples of challenges and solutions all throughout the food system — from production of fertiliser to distribution systems to the production of dried and purified foods that make up processed meals to the diets and lifestyles of the public. Everyone has a role to play; these challenges cannot be solved in a vacuum.
The complex, dynamic, and widely diverse forms of the world’s many food systems yield some wildly divergent outcomes in terms of nutrition, health, and environmental and climate impacts. It is critical that we start to better examine what works in some systems and what must be improved in others, in order to produce more equitable, just, and sustainable outcomes around the world.
Just as there’s no universal crop that grows everywhere, there’s no “one size fits all” model food system to implement across the world. A broader systems-wide perspective is necessary if there is any hope for truly transformative change. It’s time to look beyond farming and agriculture and to see the whole picture, to create systems that cause less harm to the climate and are more resilient to the impacts we’re already suffering from global warming. 
Food is a fundamental human need and to eat is a basic human right. Our food systems must deliver that need, fairly and equitably, without worsening the impacts of climate change.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/05/why-what-we-eat-is-crucial-to-the-climate-change-question

The paper actually says this... My sympathy that you don’t agree... 1.8 mm/yr. tide gauges.
BQEND
Wait are you serious Michel, you really don't get this? Oh. I didn't think anyone could be that dense. Sorry, my sympathies. Shall we try again?
1. Nobody, including myself is disagreeing that there is a 1.8mm/yr rise in tidal gauges in the period 1972-2008.
2. However you have said that the tidal gauges rate ""is roughly half of the rate of rise claimed from satellite altimetry"". This is incorrect and Church does not claim this.
3. Satellite data starts in 1993, not 1972. Now, in chronology, 1972 is 19 years before 1993. Are you with me so far bumpkins? I know, terrifically difficult stuff. The 1993-2009 satellite trend/yr is 3.2mm per year. 
4. Now, I posted you another Church paper from 2011 referencing the same tidal dataset you are. The 1993-2009 trend for tidal gauges in 2.8mm for that period.
5. Pay special attention here bumpkins. If you want to compare trends from two different data sets, you have to use the same time period. I know! Look how much about trends you are learning about today! This is because the period 1972-1993 will naturally have a slower trend because global warming was not as strong in this pre-satellite period. With me so far? I know, very complex.
6. When we compare tidal gauge data from 1993-2009 with satellite data from 1993-2009 the difference is 0.4mm per year. However since they have error bars of +/- 0.8mm and 0.4mm respectively, there is no real discrepancy between the two datasets.
7. Now that we use the same time periods, your claim that tidal gauge data shows a trend that ""is roughly half of the rate of rise claimed from satellite altimetry""  turns out to be a very silly domain error in thinking that two different time periods should have the same trend.
Now, bumpkins, please pretend that none of this was posted to you several times, and continue telling me what a clever clogs you are.

But i do see countless papers about different parts of the globe
BQEND
Nobody denies that different parts of the globe experienced warming over a number of centuries. You however fail to acknowledge that many areas also saw no warming or even cooling.
The IPCC literature review becomes relevant here since it has brought together regional, hemispheric and global reconstructions and concluded, with high confidence, that there was no globally synchronous MWP. You have now several times ignored this.
BQSTART
Are you still unconvinced about the MCA being global?
BQEND
Again, happening in different parts of the globe is not global or globally synchronous. You are still ignoring the vast majority of evidence I have posted.
Nobody disputes that different parts of the globe had periods of warming at different times during the MWP. However you simply refuse to acknowledge that they were not globally synchronous, or that other large areas experienced no warming or even cooling (the other papers I posted to you).
BQSTART
Ignoring the IPCC review, means I'm a denier?
BQEND
Yes ignoring the most comprehensive review of all reconstructions in a debate on said reconstructions, after it has been posted to you repeatedly, makes you a science denier.
BQSTART
Maybe take a look at my previous post and re-think the accusation.
BQEND
Why? All you are posting is that many areas around the globe experienced a warming trend over the course of several centuries in the MWP as shown in reconstructions. In my first comment to you I acknowledged this - this is a complete non-sequitur.
When the IPCC reviewed all these reconstructions they concluded with high confidence that this warming was not globally synchronous as today's warming. You have repeatedly ignored the most comprehensive review on the matter despite it having been posted to you several times now.
That's not acceptable behaviour, whether you call it denial or anything else. The simple fact is: when paleoclimatic scientists come together to review the entire literature on the MWP, they state the evidence shows quite clearly that the MWP did no happen as you state it did.

The point about the present warming is that it is happening at the same time everywhere (that is what is meant by ""synchronous""). Yes, different parts of the planet are warming at different rates (for reasons that are well understood) but the direction of temperature is the same everywhere....... and all within a very brief window in time.
As for ocean heat content, it is important to differentiate between this and the La Nina-like conditions that appear to have prevailed in the surface waters of the eastern Pacific during medieval times. One would indeed expect ocean heat content to be high during a period of high solar/low volcanic activity, as both of these forcings lead to increased incident radiation on the oceans and hence a direct warming effect. Greenhouse forcing, however, does not exert a direct warming effect on the oceans.

Well yes, thats what the balance of evidence seems to suggest, although - to argue synchronous or not requires a strict definition of what synchronous is - and more importantly, why that definition of synchronousity is important and arguably how it relates to 'modern warming'..

This is a great point which should be made more often.
One of the hallmarks of good science is that it starts from a Coherent hypotheses that is confirmed and becomes a theory.
The deniers with their lack of Coherent scientific explanation fall at the first hurdle.
The second property good science has is Consilience of Evidence(TM). Again deniers don't have that, they randomly cherry pick stuff out of context to support their personal preferred ideological position.
The third property of good science is Consensus, which can only arise when the first two criteria have been fulfilled and subjected to robust scientific and adult scrutiny.
Once again, deniers can't achieve that. There's a video of one of their seminars on how to engage with the media where they argue about whether to claim CO2 doesn't cause warming or not.

It's also worth pointing out that even the most recent proxy data from the 2K reconstruction represents a mean for the period 1970-2000AD, so it doesn't fully capture the impact of the recent warming.', u'recommendation_count': u'5', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1520842443000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'a recovery in solar activity', u'effect': u'that some of the early warming was'}], u'author_id': u'16473314', u'in_reply_to': u'113402100', u'id': u'113411020', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'GoldenAppleCorps', u'text': u'I’m sure there are a lot of questions that you avoid thinking about.

15 of those 30 years exhibited no increase in average global temperature, even though, as you say, co2 output was massive! Better think of another cause.
BQEND
Incorrect.Firstly your claim of no warming for 15 years (no dates given, but I'm guessing 1998 as a start point) is wrong, warming at a lower rate was observed.
Secondly, as commented elsewhere, the models don't operate over such short timescales.
Thirdly, the climate system is made up of:- Atmosphere- Biosphere- Cryosphere- Geosphere- Hydrosphere.
This is text book knowledge. I have the 6th edition published back in 1989, original was rom the 1960's.
As has been pointed out the hydrosphere is the largest component, so it is entirely anticipated that that will absorb more of the energy. It's just a silly and scientifically baseless conspiracy theory to suggest otherwise.
This has been pointed out ad nauseam, and is a good example of a PRATT.PointRebuttedAThousandTimes.
If deniers like you can't find something better to come up with, then it simply shows the intellectual and scientific paucity of your arguments.

Why wasn't this predicted in the models

As side from your false claim about no warming, the GCMs are not designed for short term variation, they are designed to produce projections over the relevant period for climate - 30 years.
This length of period was chosen in 1934 by the IMO, the WMO's predecessor. 
The reason it was chosen was due to the internal variables in the climate system that can cause short term periods when temperatures (or other indicators) undershoot or overshoot the long term trend.
Internal variables include ENSO, AMO, volcanic activity, etc. These could not be predicted back in the 1930's, and nor can they be predicted now more than a few months out.

Take this one for instance on Pacific Ocean Heat Content;
http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6158/617
""Observed increases in ocean heat content (OHC) and temperature are robust indicators of global warming during the past several decades. We used high-resolution proxy records from sediment cores to extend these observations in the Pacific 10,000 years beyond the instrumental record. We show that water masses linked to North Pacific and Antarctic intermediate waters were warmer by 2.1 ± 0.4°C and 1.5 ± 0.4°C, respectively, during the middle Holocene Thermal Maximum than over the past century. Both water masses were ~0.9°C warmer during the Medieval Warm period than during the Little Ice Age and ~0.65° warmer than in recent decades. ""

There have been three large winter storms already this year; and there will be droughts and accelerated glacial melt that should be refilling water tables in places like Colorado. Storm surges are now commonplace, affecting most of the east coast. Wildfires etc.
And then there is the mistaken belief that fracking is the way towards a low-carbon society. It is the opposite - in no way is fracking low-carbon even given a potential reduction in the methane that is in the atmosphere now, sometime later this century; even if they do manage to use more low-cost renewable electricity, energy efficiency and electric transport. The dependence on gas will continue to haunt. 
It is a twisted motivation that tries to construe something that is patently bad into something good; but this is the only resort for these Republicans who cannot see reality through the fog of some kind of 60s fantasy that is long over, and the economics just don't work out any more.
Becoming a 'fossil fuel superpower' whatever that might try to mean is probably the least intelligent thing they can try to do right now; and I will explain why: fracking is just not profitable. On a basic economics level and they aren't making any money - they are barely covering the costs of not importing oil & gas, and are now exporting it at net cost to themselves; presumably just to make headlines and impress oil & gas industry analysts. What they don't know is that they are now famous for the opposite reasons and are simply hoping everyone won't notice. Coal is over yet they try and revive it like giving shots to a corpse. Utterly pointless and the situation with excess gas-fired generation is starting to look frighteningly similar - people are not making gas turbines anymore yet they still try to sell the dream of fossil fuels as if no lower-cost alternative had been found - while spending $48 billion in upgrading LNG export terminals that will continue to generate losses for years to come - and thats if they are able to find enough gas in the first place. 
Australia has a high gas price, and Japan has 170 hydrogen refueling stations finalised by the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and very little natural gas supplies of their own. With solar at ever lower cost electrolysis is finally undercutting the cost of steam methane reforming - the traditional way of making hydrogen - and so will start exporting in the approaching few years. 
However, this is just the start. Between massive subsidies, wildly fluctuating wholesale prices, geopolitical dependencies and a host of other reasons - the economics of renewable hydrogen production are going to beat the lowest prices that government-subsidised fracking or any other form of fossil methane can go.

CFIUS members are collectively charged with evaluating proposed foreign acquisitions for potential national security issues, then turning their findings over to the president. By law, the committee can’t veto a transaction; only the president can. All nine federal agencies were required to approve the Uranium One transaction before it could go forward. According to The New York Times, Clinton may not have even directly participated in the decision. Then-Assistant Secretary of State Jose Fernandez, whose job it was to represent the State Dept. on CFIUS, said Clinton “never intervened” in committee matters. Clinton herself has said she wasn’t personally involved.ttps://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hillary-clinton-uranium-russia-deal/

The field of climate science publishes a document that gives the world its view of what the consensus of that field is. Other academies produce documents that surmise their understanding of the state of climate science. This is the opinions of huge amount of specialised labour to form an over view that can be used to inform the policies that guide the economies of 7 billion plus people.
Any buffoon can cherry pick quotes from say Dick Lindzens or Judy Curry and claim that these ""quote-a-mationizings"" is doing ""real sciencey ting"".

BQEND
Hiatus periods of 10 to 15 years can arise as a manifestation of internal decadal climate variability, which sometimes enhances and sometimes counteracts the long-term externally forced trend. Internal variability thus diminishes the relevance of trends over periods as short as 10 to 15 years for long-term climate change (Box 2.2, Section 2.4.3). Furthermore, the timing of internal decadal climate variability is not expected to be matched by the CMIP5 historical simulations, owing to the predictability horizon of at most 10 to 20 years (Section 11.2.2; CMIP5 historical simulations are typically started around nominally 1850 from a control run). However, climate models exhibit individual decades of GMST trend hiatus even during a prolonged phase of energy uptake of the climate system (e.g., Figure 9.8; Easterling and Wehner, 2009; Knight et al., 2009), in which case the energy budget would be balanced by increasing subsurface–ocean heat uptake (Meehl et al., 2011, 2013a; Guemas et al., 2013).

BQSTART
""It's becoming clearer that the Medieval Warm Period was patchy, not global,"" said lead author Nicolás Young, a glacial geologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory... 
Gifford Miller, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Colorado, called the paper ""a coup de grace on the Medieval Warm Period."" Miller said it shows ""with great clarity of evidence"" that ""the idea of a consistently warm Medieval period is certainly an oversimplification and of little utility."".... 
Astrid Ogilvie, a climate historian currently based at Iceland's Akureyri University said... ""I think the Medieval Warm Period has been built on many false premises, but it still clings to the popular imagination.""
BQEND
The IPCC support these claims with high confidence:
BQSTART
Continental-scale surface temperature reconstructions show, with high confidence, multi-decadal periods during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (year 950 to 1250) that were in some regions as warm as in the late 20th century. These regional warm periods did not occur as coherently across regions as the warming in the late 20th century (high confidence).
BQEND
The graphic on page 78 shows very clearly a lack of a global warming trend during the MWP - especially compared to modern warming (this is supported by the analysis in the reports, rather than my own eyeballing). Page 409 & 419 similarly - there is no global warming signal during the MWP period.
Can really go all day with papers showing regional cooling during the supposed MWP. From another paper:
BQSTART
[S]everal glaciers in western North America advanced during Medieval time and that some glaciers achieved extents similar to those at the peak of the Little Ice Age, many hundred years later. The advances cannot be reconciled with a climate similar to that of the twentieth century, which has been argued to be an analog
BQEND
Another:
BQSTART
The Medieval period is found to display warmth that matches or exceeds that of the past decade in some regions, but which falls well below recent levels globally. This period is marked by a tendency for La Niña–like [cooler] conditions in the tropical Pacific... Relative warmth in the central North Pacific MCA is consistent with the expected extratropical signature of the strong observed La Niña–like pattern in the tropical Pacific ( strong cooling in the east and warming in the west). Certain regions, such as central Eurasia, northwestern North America, and (with less confidence) parts of the South Atlantic, exhibit anomalous coolness.

You are now arguing that evidence for a globally synchronous event comes from a paper that concludes the opposite, based on your eyeballing of a graph. The same graph from which the paper itself states:
""Our regional temperature reconstructions (Fig. 2) [the graph you are eyeballing] also show little evidence for globally synchronized multi-decadal shifts that would mark well-defined worldwide MWP and LIA intervals. Instead, the specific timing of peak warm and cold intervals varies regionally, with multi-decadal variability resulting in regionally specific temperature departures from an underlying global cooling trend.""
BQSTART
I see quite pronounced warming circa 950AD in Arctic, Europe, North America and Antarctica (4 continents).
BQEND
The Arctic is not a continent. 
You have also ignored the successive IPCC literature reviews, which find no evidence anywhere in the peer-reviewed record for your claims. Ignoring this review does not help your case. This is perhaps the reason why you find yourself being accused of ""denial"".
BQSTART
For the Medieval Warming Period, the proxies in this report do not cover Australasia.
BQEND
The paper has proxies starting in 1000... but again you are the one who demands there was a globally synchronous event so a lack of data in one paper that concludes the opposite does not help your case unless you can show a more extensive reconstruction.
None exists or you would have posted it.
BQSTART
I posted a paper on here not long ago confirming pronounced MWP signal in the African continent.
BQEND
And so? Again, no global reconstruction shows a globally synchronous event.
BQSTART
[I]ts pretty obvious that prior to the LIA, there was pronounced warming, and then a general cooling, and then a general warming again.
BQEND
I am sure it feels very convincing to you, and unfortunately arguing the subjective eyeballing of graphs is impossible online. This is why we quote from the papers themselves to check our assumptions. In your case the paper states you are mistaken.

This is a political article rather than a scientific one
BQEND
This is true. Science solved the basic relationships - the solution is political (in democratic nations). If not one would argue for Technocracy or Scientism. 
Now - one can of course argue that politics already is ""Econominism"" to an unhealthy level - especially since economics is not based on laws of nature and has an exceptional failure-rate wen it comes to predictive skill compare to any natural science. 
Anyhow - since democracy has it's advantages compared to other options - the solutions to AGW must involve politics. Although it has to be said - politics based on ""alternative realities"" is really not good. Even economics go extra pear-shaped if politicians think that the solution to a problem is simply to print more currency, for example. When health-politicians think that HIV can be fixed with alcohol and root-fruits (as being popular in southern parts of Africa that happens to have crazy AIDS issues) - it is really not helpful. In other nations - it is popular to think that climate change is caused by a Chinese hoax - and that is not helpful either. It is better if political discussions are based on facts. Just look at them 350 millions going straight to healthcare in the UK as of soon. 
And this is what we see at present. Reality free democracies doing all sorts of bonkers things, contradicting on purpose the best evidence that human cooperation can provide - for some gooey lovely political feeling. And allowing politics to support free will to the extent that voters soon will demand aircraft to Spain with no wings - to make the journey cheaper - because free will is promised by democracy - and according to some - wings on air planes is a scientific conspiracy to make travel more costly - as equivalent. 
I am actually pondering being for that group being given access to those types of aircraft. Douglas Adams style. It includes Air Force One. Wings are clearly a hoax for a president that think that CO2 is political. He should demand his flight is wing-less. This would be a nice addition to Darwin Awards 2018 - and help the gene pool - well - maybe not after seeing his kids. 
My point still stands - politics is involved. Science only present a challenge. Like - it is stupid to make floors of paper. So politics can make a law that those who build a paper with a thin paper-floor - actually are breaking the laws of criminality - by selling a product that does not sustain the laws of gravity - for example. 
The laws against shooting people has similar scientific arguments behind it - to propell a bullet out of a barrel at high speeds has by science been found to have catastrophic consequences for the receiver. After intenst scientific investigations and many many scientific papers - there is no a consensus that there is a difference between having ""an open mind"" and a ""hole in the head"", for example. 
Hence - to take students into school and open minds is legal - to create hole in head is illegal. This is a political decision in most nations - based on rigorous scientific analyses. 
But of course - in politics it is perfectly possible to disregard the laws of science - and as president argue for shooting people in the pussy, as a current example that even makes UN-delegates consider that psychiatry is called for and they are diplomats without any heart. 
Science has a thing or two to say about that as well. And the consensus is that it is not good for a whole set of reasons. Now you can disregard the scientific consensus of how people bleed to death - enter shock - becomes physically traumatised - and you can of course disagree with other softer sciences tell you that it is not really perfect to shoot women in the pussy. You can even disagree with the ""pick-up-artists"" that write a book about picking up girls - and claim that to shoot them in the pussy first seems to be a turn off for them. 
This could be a conspiracy of course. And it clearly does not stop a democracy. 
So where does this leave us? Well - I think a bit of reality is supported by facts. 
And I think a lot of voters should learn a bit more about ethical relativism - especially since many seems to have a rather non-consequential take on this relativism. It seems that one can be very relativistic when it comes to physics - but very strict when it comes to foreigners, for example. And this is before we add a moral layer. 
It is - well - interesting. 
I am all for wings, by the way -- because fluid dynamics is amazing.

We’ve had both Republicans and Democrats in charge since the first report from the IPCC in 1990.

As I said but clearly lack empathy to make it understandable to the current audience given its weak scientific footing, the reason the rate of rise was so high was lifting people out of poverty. This is nothing to do with the US.

There are also people on the left like Naomi Klein who are dead set against carbon pricing because it doesn’t punish the polluters enough ... the people that you identify who believe in a) carbon pricing and b) expansion of nuclear power, I suspect they’re a tiny minority of the people concerned with climate … What we need are polling data on how many people really would support carbon pricing and an expansion of nuclear and other low carbon energy sources.
Here Pinker has created a strange straw man that bears no resemblance to the real population of American liberals and environmentalists. In fact, the polling data he wonders about already exists.
For example, a 2016 survey by Yale and George Mason universities found that 73% of Democrats support a carbon tax or a combination of tax and regulations (a further 17% favored carbon pollution regulations only). In fact, most consider putting a price on carbon pollution the single most crucial step in tackling global warming. Even Naomi Klein has said, “I don’t think a carbon tax is a silver bullet, but I think a progressively designed carbon tax is part of a slate of policies that we need.”
While it’s true that a majority of liberals oppose building more nuclear power plants, 38% support the idea. Some environmental groups like Greenpeace do oppose nuclear power, but Pinker’s other example, NRDC merely points out that new nuclear plants are currently uneconomical, and even suggests, “The federal government should continue to fund research into nuclear energy.” There are strong economic reasons to oppose building new nuclear power as an inefficient use of resources when renewables today are cheaper and can be deployed more quickly. That being said, were nuclear power funding included in comprehensive legislation to tackle climate change, most liberals and environmentalists would accept that deal in a heartbeat. 
There’s cultural pressure to place the blame on ‘both sides,’ for example by claiming that while conservatives reject science on climate change and evolution, liberals reject it on the safety of GMOs and vaccines. However, research has shown this is simply not the case – Democrats and Republicans are equally likely to distrust GMOs, and conservatives are the group that most opposes vaccines.
It’s also important to remember that the Republican Party is the only major political party in the world whose leaders reject the need to tackle climate change. And their president made America the only country to reject the Paris climate agreement. There simply is no equivalent on the political left.
In The New York Times, Nicholas Kristof pointed to research led by Yale’s Dan Kahan showing that when presented with data about a politically charged issue like gun control, the mathematical and cognitive abilities of “Democrats and Republicans alike went to pieces,” as Kristof interpreted it. But Kahan’s data showed the problem was much more pronounced among conservatives. 
In the experiment, numerically-adept Democrats were about 33% more likely to misinterpret (made-up) data when it suggested that gun control increases crime, but numerically-adept Republicans were 70% more likely to misinterpret the same data when it suggested that gun control decreases crime. Democrats who are weak at math weren’t biased at all, whereas Republicans who are bad at math were 50% more likely to get the answer right when it confirmed their ideological biases. The difference between conservatives and liberals in both cases was stark. 
I tracked down this study. It wasn’t easy since Kristof’s column doesn’t link to it. Or provide the title. Or name any of the authors. Or say when it was published. The study can be found here, and its main results are in the screencap below. https://t.co/NcEYCFK04c pic.twitter.com/NJTbWLB4nZ
Surveys have shown that increased general science knowledge makes Democrats more likely to accept human-caused global warming – the same is not true for Republicans. Thus, it’s certainly true that ideology is preventing conservatives from accepting certain scientific realities. The problem is in the temptation to assume ‘both sides’ are equally guilty of letting ideological bias cloud their judgment. As Kahan’s research showed, some liberals are certainly guilty of this sort of bias, but it’s a far bigger problem among conservatives.
So how did America get here? Political polarization has been on the rise in America on both sides of the political spectrum for the past four decades. But a rating of ideology-based voting in Congress created by Kenneth Poole and Howard Rosenthal found that while Democrats are gradually becoming more liberal, Republicans in Congress have become radically more conservative since 1980. 
In 1987, the FCC under Reagan repealed the Fairness Doctrine, which required television and radio stations to be equitable and balanced. The Rush Limbaugh Show then launched in 1988, and so came the rise of right-wing radio. Fox News launched in 1996, providing conservatives a source of politically-biased news coverage. Combined with conservative news websites like Breitbart, Drudge, and Infowars, the right-wing echo chamber can envelop anyone who seeks only news spun to confirm their ideological biases.
In a 2012 survey, participants who only watched Fox News were less likely to correctly answer questions about domestic or international events than viewers of any other news source (NPR, Sunday political shows, The Daily Show, talk radio, MSNBC, or CNN), or even people with no news exposure. And on the subject of climate change, the vast majority of Fox News coverage has been factually inaccurate. 
Unsurprisingly, public trust in science over the past 40 years has only fallen among one group – conservatives. That aligns with research showing that watching Fox News or listening to Rush Limbaugh decreases viewer trust in scientists.
Here's how it works--the ""liberal"" New York Times has 3 right-wing columnists who each write 2 columns a week; the right wing Wall Street Journal has no liberal columnists. ""Liberal"" PBS just created a new show for conservatives, no liberals ever appear on right-wing Fox.
America’s climate inaction simply cannot be blamed on ‘both sides.’ Democrats have proposed cap and trade legislation – a concept invented by Republicans – to address the issue. House Democrats even passed the legislation before a lack of Republican support doomed it in the Senate. More recently, Democrats have proposed revenue-neutral climate legislation in order to appeal to small-government, free market conservatives. President Obama took America’s first comprehensive steps to tackle climate change by joining the Paris climate accords and implementing the Clean Power Plan – his Republican successor revoked both.
Quite simply, the Republican Party is the problem. Some within the party are slowly making progress in fixing it, for example in the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus. But breaking through America’s climate policy gridlock may require bursting the right-wing media bubble.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/05/stop-blaming-both-sides-for-americas-climate-failures

The former UN secretary general said Trump’s move was politically damaging to international action to limit carbon emissions and had created difficulties in delivering financial aid from richer to poorer countries to help the latter cope with a warming world.
“United States is a big problem now. I think the United States’ decision to withdraw from this Paris agreement really creates a serious problem,” Ban said in an interview with the Guardian.
“They [the Trump administration] have given serious damage to the political side. All the countries are very serious and concerned about this [the US declaring its withdrawal from the climate deal].”
Although Trump indicated in a recent interview that the US may not leave the global accord, Ban said the remarks were not clear. He said the apparent shift in position may have been the result of lobbying from European leaders such as the French president, Emmanuel Macron.
Ban said he hoped Trump would take better advice. “What President Trump has been saying is politically shortsighted and scientifically based on wrong advice; I don’t know who advised him,” he said.
While Europe has been seen as a champion of global climate talks and international efforts to rein in temperature rises, Ban said he was worried this role could be put at risk by political strife.
“I am concerned because of the divisions that are now happening within the EU, not to mention this Brexit, and political difficulties and issues such as refugees,” he said. 
He said he hoped Macron and Angela Merkel would take on a leadership role and he had pressed the French president on the issue during an hour-long meeting in December.
Ban said Britain had a duty to keep up action on climate change despite Brexit. “They [the UK government] still have a political and moral responsibility on this issue,” he said.
The US saying it would withdraw from the Paris agreement had imperilled the $100bn-a-year of climate aid the world’s richest countries have pledged to the poorest by 2020, Ban said.
“Without the US, we have a lot of difficulties, particularly mobilising financing,” he said, adding that he was particularly concerned about the one-third of funding the US would normally provide to committees administering billions of dollars in climate money.
“Who will make up all this losses which will not be paid by the US? That’s a serious problem now,” he said.
He said the private sector may have to play a greater role than previously envisaged, and he was working with the World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, the former UN secretary general Kofi Annan and the former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres to address the challenge.
Despite these setbacks to climate action, Ban said he was encouraged that China was still fully committed to reducing emissions. “President Xi Jinping clearly mentioned that China is fully onboard, understanding that the climate is changing,” Ban said of a meeting with the Chinese leader in November.
Another promising sign was the We Are Still In campaign, a group of US cities, states and businesses that have pledged to stick to the Paris targets regardless of Trump. “This is a groundswell of people,” Ban said.
He said he would dedicate his life beyond the UN to continuing climate change advocacy.
Despite the US’s backtracking, Ban said he remained confident the world could meet the target of limiting temperature increases to less than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and the aspiration to keep them under 1.5C. “I am quite optimistic we will make it happen,” he said.
Ban was recently appointed president of the Seoul-based Global Green Growth Institute, which he hopes to expand beyond its 28 member countries.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/05/ban-ki-moon-us-paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal

Those benefits are direct benefits to the farmers themselves.
As far as having environmentalists buy the uncleared land from farmers, this is exactly what the LNP government's direct action plan achieves. Any farmer who refrains from clearing their land can apply to the government for a compensation payment from the direct action plan budget. The farmer still owns the land but they are restricted as to how much of it they are allowed to clear. Sadly, some farmers are claiming for not clearing land they have no intention of clearing and cannot even afford to clear. Also some farmers are taking the payments and then clearing the very land they have promised to the government in return for our tax payer dollars, not to clear.

Legislation dictates the law but courts interpret the law, determine how the law will be applied, and to who, and clarifies what is meant by the words used in the legislation. Therefore, court cases determine how the law will work in real life examples, which then set precendents which are to be followed by courts in future similar cases. Hence, no matter how this case is decided, it will have impact, because it will determine how these laws will be applied in future courts all around Australia.

Point 1. It is there land they purchased it so yes they are entitled to use this land for farming purposes. This includes clearing unproductive vegetation. Last time I looked we don't exist in a communist state, so is their land. If you want it left for the environment then you buy the land.
Point 2,3,4 don't make any real sense other then to explain how vegetation can be used and are not valid reasons for preventing farmers clearing vegetation from their land. Simple cause we have national parks to preserve and keep our environment safe.
Point 5 not all land clearing is bad if properly regulated. However if you are saying farmers can't ever clear their land because the environment needs it more. Give the farmers their money back and turn it into a national park. 
There should be comparisons drawn between UK and Australia thank you very much. The hyprocracy of people in the UK telling other countries how they can use their land. When historically zero 0% of UK natural forest remains, all cleared centuries ago. A Google search shows only 10% of UK land mass remains forested. Should UK be first returning vast tracks of land to forests at home. What is UK policy in terms of clearing natural vegetation on farms. Look to your own backyard first before preventing legitimate development in other countries.
Farmers managing their purchased land, following govt guidelines as to what and how they manage their land including land clearing should be allowed. Australia has plenty natural forests and more national parks can be created without hampering farmers ability to farm their land.
Land clearing is a legitimate practice for farmers to farm. Lastly show some respect for farmers who put the food on your plate and understand they live in the environment they farm they understand not to harm or destroy it. Many farmers actively work to protect the environment.

Andrews Government backs racehorses over threatened species!  A fragile coastal reserve in south-west Victoria has been invaded by racehorse trainers using it as a ‘race track’. They’re tearing up the beaches and dunes and jeopardising the future of threatened birds such as hooded plovers.What’s worse, the Andrews Government is letting them!
Highly-strung racehorses are currently pounding up and down the beaches between Port Fairy and Warrnambool. Belfast Coastal Reserve is one of the most significant sites for threatened hooded plovers, critically endangered orange-bellied parrots, and numerous migratory shorebirds.
The horses are intimidating local beachgoers, risking the safety of the general public, and putting our vulnerable wildlife at risk.
Hooded plovers cannot co-exist with commercial racehorse training because it churns up the sand, disturbs the chicks and nesting birds, crushes eggs and damages protective nest fencing. 
But the Andrews Government plans to reward the commercial racehorse trainers by giving them a licence to continue, and allowing a major increase of up to 250 racehorses per day thundering along the beach!
In January 2018, Parks Victoria released the draft coastal management plan for the Belfast Coastal Reserve, which reversed a cap on racehorses numbers put in place in 2016. Just 12 months earlier a factsheet produced by the state government acknowledged the rapid increase in horse numbers. The draft management plan itself recognises that it fails to reduce risks to high conservation zones.Community concerns continue to mount about the impacts of commercial racehorse training on the reserve’s natural, cultural and recreational values; the protection of which was the reason for the reserve being created in the first place during the 1980s. This is essentially an act of privatisation of our public beaches.

The case, brought by the Environment Centre NT, is believed to be the first of its kind in Australia, using the consideration of greenhouse gas emissions from clearing as a lever to seek to have an approval overturned.
“I think it’s groundbreaking,” said Shar Molloy, director of ECNT.
In November 2017, the Northern Territory government approved the clearing of 20,432 hectares of land on the Maryfield station property – an area more than three times the size of Manhattan.
The clearing application was referred to the Northern Territory Environmental Protection Agency, which decides whether an action requires a full environmental assessment.
The NTEPA briefly considered the greenhouse gas emissions from the action concluding that they “are likely to make a considerable contribution to the NT’s annual greenhouse gas emissions”.
But the assessment went on to say the NTEPA did not consider that would be a “significant impact” on the environment. The reasoning they gave was that the NT government does not have a policy on the matter.
Despite the proposed clearing being the largest ever approved in the NT, and previous smaller applications forced to undergo environmental assessment, the NTEPA decided a full environmental assessment was not needed for the Maryfield clearing.
It went on to recommend to the pastoral lands board, which is the final decision maker, that the clearing be approved with a number of conditions related to biodiversity.
The pastoral lands board then approved the clearing, but ignored some of those conditions.
The ECNT, represented by the Environmental Defenders Office NT, is alleging that both the NTEPA and the pastoral lands board failed to properly consider the impacts of the clearing on greenhouse gas emissions.
It is widely thought to be the first Australian case to challenge the approval of a land clearing action on the basis of its impact on climate change.
Given the scale of the clearing, EDO NT principal lawyer Gillian Duggin said “it is of substantial public interest for the court to explore the errors we say exist in their decision making processes”.
“The decisions challenged by this case have drawn attention to the significant weaknesses in the current legal and policy frameworks for land clearing and climate change in the Northern Territory – this is a major concern for our client,” Duggin said.
Molloy said they decided to take up the case because they were shocked by the scale of the approval, and the fact it occurred without a full environmental assessment.
“This huge clearing permit granted should never have been granted. It will wipe out intact forest and woodland, threatens native wildlife, and will increase the NT’s greenhouse gas emissions,” said Molloy.
“It is the biggest clearing permit ever granted in the NT. For the NT EPA to find a full environmental assessment was not necessary is completely untenable.”
Glenn Walker from The Wilderness Society said the clearing is likely to cause up to about 3 megatonnes of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions. That figure is based on detailed scientific studies of clearing on nearby properties, and is difficult to get a firm estimate of.
“On a territory scale, the emissions from this one station, and the deforestation that could occur, is equal to 15 to 20% of the Northern Territory’s annual emissions,” said Walker. “That’s an enormous dent in their emissions reduction efforts.”
Duggin said that while it is concerning that the NT government has failed to put in place an emissions or climate change policy, that does not mean the EPA can avoid considering greenhouse gas emissions when assessing clearing proposals.
“In this case, however, it is the responsibility of the EPA to make its decisions according to the legislation that exists, notwithstanding the absence of a climate change policy. Our client will argue that hasn’t occurred in this instance”, said Duggin.
Bruce Lindsay, a lawyer at Environment Justice Australia in Melbourne said the case would be keenly watched by environmental lawyers around the country, and there could be scope for similar challenges elsewhere.
“I think under our amended Climate Change Act 2017 in Victoria there is scope for decision makers and policy makers to be required to take account of climate change, although in rather hedged language,” said Lindsay. “This has not yet been tested in a judicial proceeding.”
Land clearing in Australia has been a significant contributor to the country’s greenhouse gas emissions.
In 1990, before short-lived land-clearing controls came into law in Queensland, a quarter of Australia’s total greenhouse gas emissions were caused by deforestation. Emissions from land clearing dropped after 2010 but are rising sharply again.
While in recent decades, the majority of the country’s clearing has occurred in Queensland, other states and territories look like they could be following in Queensland’s footsteps.
In 2016 and 2017, the NT government approved about 45,500 hectares of land for clearing through the Pastoral Lands Board. That was an almost tenfold jump over the average of the previous 12 years of about 4,600 hectares, which was already an area two-thirds the size of Manhattan",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/09/landmark-case-challenges-land-clearing-based-on-climate-change-impact

Some of us are too old to be around as things get worse. The children who weren't around for the party will get stuck with the bill.

This, perhaps somewhat discreditable, hope has sustained me for a while, as well. But then I consider Insectageddon, and the Yangtse River Dolphin, and the sticklebacks on Belvedere Marshes when I was a child. Yes, I also am too old to expect to see the real excitement likely in the second half of the Century - or the heroic measures that avert it, giving way briefly to optimism. But when I consider these things I notice how much we have already lost during my lifetime. 
Two years ago I moved to a new place down the valley in Switzerland, and stag beetles crashed through the garden in their blundering way on the evenings of the first Summer. That same year we visited friends in Toscana and I saw the very same species on my first night in their road. I thought: Well, there's a thing.  I hadn't seen one in nearly 40 years, since I was a sprog. They must have been queueing for the buses that all turned up at once.
Then I saw the trees felled all over Walenstadt this year, and the newly-fallen trees after the storms being assiduously dragged out of the forest for firewood. And I noticed again that even here there is not an old pollard or a decayed trunk to be seen in the local woods. And I thought of the beetles, and the thought was: This too shall pass.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1520499229000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'16997462', u'in_reply_to': u'113245059', u'id': u'113254860', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Elliott Bignell', u'text': u'sheedysleftpeg - I was speaking figuratively, but if you want to be literal we are probably talking more pineapple than Shoreditch.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1520498605000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'16997462', u'in_reply_to': u'113249581', u'id': u'113254493', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Elliott Bignell', u'text': u'It's a famous quote from somebody, probably Yogi Berra.

There's no evidence of sea level rise acceleration due to climate-change, man-made or otherwise at the Fort Point tide gauge (near the south end of the Golden Gate Bridge). The apparent sea level rise rate over the last 30 years is 1.8 mm/yr, however the nearest GPS station with a long term trend (Point Tiburon), shows the land dropping at -0.6mm/yr, so sea levl rise due to steric/mass/trade wind pattern changes looks to be lower than 1.8 mm/yr.
A rolling 30 year trend of the monthly tide gauge data shows the period with the highest rate of sea level rise to be one ending in 1886 (the record starts in 1854) at 4.8 mm/yr. The rate of rise was pretty steady at between 2 and 3 mm/yr from 1940 to 2000, but has slowed down since.

There never, not just in human but in ALL of earth's history, a change like this, this fast and due to the causes.
We can analyse the CO2 - the isotope content - that is added and appearing in higher concentration in the atmosphere. The natural occuring CO2 has a different isotope count then that which is released when we burn CO2. Easy to measure. The CO2 that is massively increasing matches the isotope counts of CO2 that is released when burning Fossil Fuels. That, too, is simply measurable. There's no known natural source of CO2 of that type. No modelling, actual data, and clear evidence that we humans are the source of the added greenhouse gas.

The findings, from two new scientific studies, come as California’s neighboring west coast states Oregon and Washington have both faltered in their legislative attempts to address climate change and deliver a rebuke to Donald Trump’s dismissal of the issue.
The problems faced by the progressive coastal bastions have been sobering on two fronts: not only is the western flank of the US experiencing the escalating consequences of climate change, but widespread Democratic dominance at state level has failed to enact ambitious policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
“The states are struggling to fill the gap for the federal government on climate change,” said Nives Dolsak, of the school of marine and environmental affairs at the University of Washington.
“In Washington, we are holding a very good policy hostage because it’s not perfect. Inclusion and equity concerns means we are losing momentum and public support on climate change.”
The quibbling comes as climate change tightens its grip on the west coast. San Francisco can lay claim to being one of the greenest cities in the US, through its embrace of clean energy, mandated recycling and banning of single-use plastic bags, yet it faces a steep challenge to avoid the ravages of sea level rise.
Researchers using satellite-based radar and GPS have discovered large areas of land beside the San Francisco bay is sinking, exacerbating the threat from sea level rise and storms. Places such as San Francisco airport, Foster City and Treasure Island are subsiding by as much as 10mm a year, doubling the area previously considered at risk of flooding by the end of the century, according to the Science Advances-published study.
 In all, around 48 to 166 sq miles of the bay’s shoreline is set to be prone to flooding, even under a moderate rate of sea level rise. This scenario would worsen if melting glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica trigger a far faster rate of ocean expansion. 
 “There are about 7 million people living on the bay who could be vulnerable” said Patrick Barnard, a geologist at the US Geological Survey who wasn’t involved in the research.
“A huge number of people along the west coast are in low-lying areas, in Los Angeles and San Francisco all the way up to Seattle. All the options will have to be on the table, from replenishing coastal marshes to sea walls to managed retreat.”
California is facing a buffeting from increased flooding – around $763bn if its assets are exposed to inundation – at the same time as parts of its agriculture base declines due to rising temperatures.
 Recent University of California research found that the yield of some crops could drop by 40% by 2050, with the situation becoming so severe by the end of the century that peaches, walnuts and apricots may be unviable in the central valley. Almonds, avocados, cherries and strawberries also face sharp crop declines.
Faced with such threats, the governors of California, Washington and Oregon have spearheaded criticism of Trump for taking a hammer to national climate policies and withdrawing the US from the Paris climate accords. But progress hasn’t been much easier closer to home.
While California has a statewide emissions reduction scheme, it has clashed with the Trump administration over the state’s stringent vehicle fuel standards. And California’s neighbors to the north are struggling to demonstrate that states can compensate for the lack of federal action on climate change, even those where Democrats have a firm grip on power.
 Last week, an effort to introduce the first straight tax on carbon dioxide emissions failed in Washington state, with governor Jay Inslee admitting it couldn’t pass the Democrat-controlled senate. “On the arc of history, we’re not quite far along enough on the arc,” said Inslee, a Democrat and vocal proponent of action on climate change. “That day will come, but it wasn’t quite here yet.”
 The tax, which would’ve started at $20 per ton CO2 emitted, faced criticism it would increase the cost of energy or, conversely, that it wouldn’t generate sufficient money for clean energy programs. Meanwhile, in Oregon, another state dominated by elected Democrats, lawmakers failed to agree on a cap on greenhouse gases and will instead revisit the issue in 2019.
The stuttering progress of climate change policies sits awkwardly with international assurances from the broad coalition opposed to Trump that the US has not given up on tackling dangerous global warming.
“Rather than getting bogged down in how money from a carbon tax would be spent, we need to make climate change a bipartisan issue again,” said Aseem Prakash, the director of the center for environmental politics at the University of Washington. 
“Environment groups need to reach out to Republicans for workable policy, not policy that’s perfect in every single way.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/07/san-francisco-rising-sea-level-threat-climate-change

On Friday, the NSW land and environment court ruled the Land Management (Native Vegetation) Code was invalid, since it was not approved by the NSW environment minister before it was implemented by the primary industries minister.
The code was created to exempt clearing from the usual development assessment procedure and was introduced after the NSW Coalition government overhauled the state’s conservation laws in 2016, making land clearing easier for farmers.
But the laws were thrown into disarray on Friday when the Nature Conservation Council (NCC) of NSW won a challenge against them, after it was revealed the proper procedure for implementing them had not been followed.
The NCC and the NSW environmental defenders office, which represented the NCC, said on Friday the government should not simply remake the laws, since the case showed the environment minister, Gabrielle Upton, had not done the work required to protect biodiversity.
“This is not simply a matter of incorrect paperwork,” said David Morris, the chief executive of the environmental defenders office NSW. “Ecologically sustainable development is not just another box to tick. The environment minister has a legal responsibility to protect biodiversity in this state.”
But the government made no delay remaking the laws, announcing on Saturday it had been completed.
“The remade code is identical to the previous one and is an integral part of the new land management framework which gives landowners the tools and certainty they need,” said David Witherdin, the CEO of Local Land Services, which oversees clearing under the codes. 
The move was condemned by the NCC.
“By waving these laws through a second time without even pausing to consider the consequences, Premier Berejiklian has gone against the wishes of voters and the advice of leading scientists,” the NCC’s CEO, Kate Smolski, said.
“The government’s own experts have warned 99% of koala habit on private land is left exposed to clearing by these laws and that there would be a spike in tree loss of up to 45%.
“As the state’s peak environment organisation, we will continue to do everything we can to expose the damage of land clearing and will not stop until we have laws that give nature the protection it deserves.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/11/nsw-laws-that-make-land-clearing-easier-reinstated-by-berejiklian-government

Other times, it feels existential. More than a few people have left successful restaurant careers to pursue something they find more consequential. But the narrative you hear more frequently is about the person who leaves their desk job to work with something more tangible – namely food.
This is more or less my experience. I worked for the better part of a decade editing books – oral histories documenting human rights crises, experimental fiction, literary nonfiction, that sort of thing. If you’d asked me at the time, I would have labelled such work as serious work, as opposed to my lifelong interest in food, which I would have described as frivolous. And I would have been correct on some level. While for most of human existence, food has been a survival necessity, it hasn’t been confined to that role for more than a millennium. In the economically advantaged parts of the world, the majority of us don’t eat most of our meals because we need to; we eat because we want to.
But my experience of working in the food world has been different from what I expected. Seven years ago, I left my serious publishing job to make a food magazine called Lucky Peach. At one point during the magazine’s run, I doubled down on the food world and started a nonprofit organisation called ZeroFoodprint, which helps restaurants understand and reduce their climate impact. Whenever I ask myself what the hell I’m doing, I try to take the long view of these two endeavours.
I won’t get too deep into the nitty-gritty of restaurants’ relationship to climate change, but the long and short of it is that growing, shipping, cooking and disposing of food is a major contributor to greenhouse gases. It’s not impossible to counteract the effect – in fact, it’s easier than people think – but it still takes time and thought and a little bit of money. But the payoff for doing so is largely intangible: you feel better about yourself and there’s some unsubstantiated logic that, if you do right by the world, people will notice and come to your restaurant.
But even with such vague rewards, restaurants have been eager to do their part. Chefs and restaurateurs reach out to our organisation to ask how they can contribute. They open up to us about how much money they spend on ingredients and energy, where it comes from and how they use it. Then they listen to what they can do better. It’s a mind-boggling and uplifting thing to witness.
We’ve helped multiple restaurants go completely carbon-neutral, and dozens more reduce their emissions. For instance, a few years ago, the restaurant Noma in Copenhagen learned through our study that they were getting their electricity from a coal-fired power plant. By sending an email to their power company and requesting their power source be switched to a sustainable one, they reduced their emissions by 30%. Their energy bill went up, but they didn’t flinch.
There are limitations to what restaurants can change, of course. Of all the things we eat, commodity-raised beef is the single largest contributor to climate change, owing mostly to poor manure-disposal techniques. High-end restaurants can turn to more sustainable choices (grass-fed and “carbon-ranched” cattle are better alternatives) but as long as diners want $1 cheeseburgers, feedlot cows will continue to fart and poop our planet warmer. Plus, in the grand scheme of things, the restaurant industry makes up only a small part of the food system, which accounts for somewhere around a third of the world’s greenhouse gases. Even if we recruited a thousand restaurants to go carbon-neutral, it wouldn’t change the trajectory of the climate.
But this is where the frivolous side of food is important. Food is not simply a commodity – it’s a cultural undertaking. In fact, it’s pop culture. People admire chefs and covet restaurants. If chefs as a group decide that sustainable food is better food, consumers will follow. Twenty-five years ago, organic produce meant very little to most people. Thanks largely to the work of chefs, organic is now a widely held value.
And there’s the rub. Food’s not a worthwhile pursuit in spite of its frivolity, but rather because of it. Whenever my chosen profession has me questioning my purpose, I think about the countless meals I’ve had in the pursuit of good food and good stories – many of them with people who look differently, speak differently and believe and uphold opposing values to my own. It’s too optimistic to say food can bridge these divides, but I think it can be shared ground.
We can choose to believe we have nothing in common with people on the other side of the aisle or the world, but the way we eat proves otherwise. I’ve sat in restaurants with people whom I’d never want to socialise with and had dinner with people whose opinions differ totally from mine except for a mutual affection for pizza and cold, cheap beer. That might not sound like much, but it’s enough to get us around the same table. • Chris Ying is appearing at the Melbourne Food and Wine festival; he is presenting at the Theatre of Ideas – Sustainability on 17 March ($20-$40) and at the Eat Your Words by Cordon Bleu food-writing course on 17-18 March ($478).

The analysis, commissioned by the Australian Automobile Association, which is campaigning for real-world testing, examined affected VW cars before recall and immediately after.
A 2010 Volkswagen Golf used an average of 7% more fuel after it had been recalled, ranging from 2% more in urban areas to 14% more on highways. The real-world testing showed a reduction in harmful emissions, but emissions from nitrogen oxides were still four times the levels observed in lab testing.
Consumer group Choice said the results underscored the “urgent need” to update the process used for testing cars sold in Australia.
“Calculating fuel use in a lab does little to help consumers understand the running and environmental costs of the cars they’re buying,” said Katinka Day, head of campaigns and policy at Choice. “Lab tests have also produced inconsistent results, which make realistic comparisons nearly impossible. It’s time Australia follows the lead of other jurisdictions, such as the EU, and adopt real-world driving tests for emissions.”
Volkswagen became embroiled in a major corporate scandal – known as “dieselgate” – in 2015 when it emerged that millions of cars had been fitted with software designed to suppress emissions during testing. Almost 100,000 Australians own a car affected by the “defeat device” software.
A class action against Volkswagen on behalf of Australian owners is being heard in the federal court in Sydney. 
As the federal government prepares to release new vehicle emissions standards, the AAA has argued there is no point setting tougher standards “unless information on real-world performance is in the hands of consumers”.
Volkswagen has rejected the AAA’s findings on the fuel efficiency of its recalled cars. 
“The German government approved Volkswagen’s software update on the basis that it did not adversely affect the emissions or fuel economy of vehicles in test conditions,” the company said in a statement. “The leading motorists’ organisations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland have tested vehicles and concluded that vehicles continue to perform as expected after the software update.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/12/volkswagens-in-australia-using-more-diesel-after-recall-research-finds

You are talking science fiction throughout your entire post because you are acting like the future is fact. The quote from you I used above was the prize-winner of ridiculous predictive assertions.

BQEND
The IPCC does not say this.
From 280 ppm (or 0.028%) to over 400 ppm (0.04%) is an increase of over 40%. It would be correct to say there has been a ~0.01 percentage point increase - but that is not the same thing.
It makes little sense to express the CO2 rise in percentage points, because it relates CO2 to something entirely irrelevant - a very large volume of non-greenhouse gases that have no effect at all on CO2's radiative properties.
Furthermore, the increase has been entirely due to human activity. If industrialisation had not happened, CO2 would still be at the pre-industrial level of ~280 ppm.
It is correct to say that about one twentieth of all CO2 emissions are due to human activity (actually a bit less) but, again, that is something quite different. Natural CO2 emissions are fully offset by natural absorption, whereas anthropogenic emissions are only partly absorbed.

The mournful remark supposedly made by foreign secretary Sir Edward Grey at dusk on 3 August 1914 referred to Britain’s imminent entry into the first world war. But the sentiment captures something of our own moment, in the midst of an intensifying campaign against nature.
According to the World Wildlife Fund’s 2016 Living Planet Report, over the last four decades the international animal population was reduced by nearly 60%. More than a billion fewer birds inhabit North America today compared to 40 years ago. In Britain, certain iconic species (grey partridges, tree sparrows, etc) have fallen by 90%. In Germany, flying insects have declined by 76% over the past 27 years. Almost half of Borneo’s orangutans died or were removed between 1999 and 2015. Elephant numbers have dropped by 62% in a decade, with on average one adult killed by poachers every 15 minutes.
We inherited a planet of beauty and wonders – and we’re saying goodbye to all that.
The cultural historian Paul Fussell once identified the catastrophe of the first world war with the distinctive sensibility of modernity, noting how 20th century history had “domesticate[d] the fantastic and normalize[d] the unspeakable.”
Consider, then, the work of climate change.
In February, for instance, scientists recorded temperatures 35 degrees above the historical average in Siberia, a phenomenon that apparently corresponded with the unprecedented cold snap across Europe.
As concentrated CO2 intensifies extreme events, a new and diabolical weather will, we’re told, become the norm for a generation already accustomising itself to such everyday atrocities as about eight million tons of plastics are washed into the ocean each year.
It may seem impossible to imagine, that a technologically advanced society could choose, in essence, to destroy itself, but that is what we’re now in the process of doing.”
This passage from the New Yorker’s Elizabeth Kolbert concluded a piece on global warming, which was published way back in 2005. Over the 13 years since, the warnings from scientists have grown both more specific and desperate – and yet the march to destruction has only redoubled its pace.
The extraordinary – almost absurd – contrast between what we should be doing and what’s actually taking place fosters low-level climate denialism. Coral experts might publicise, again and again and again, the dire state of the Great Barrier Reef but the ongoing political inaction inevitably blunts their message.
It can’t be so bad, we think: if a natural wonder were truly under threat, our politicians wouldn’t simply stand aside and watch.
The first world war killed 20 million people and maimed 21 million others. It shattered the economy of Europe, displaced entire populations, and set in train events that culminated, scarcely two decades later, with another, even more apocalyptic slaughter
And it, too, was a disaster foretold, a widely-anticipated cataclysm that proceeded more-on-less schedule despite regular warnings about what was to come.
As early as 1898, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia initiated a conference to discuss international arbitration and limit the arms race taking place in Europe. At its opening session at The Hague, he noted that the competition between nations, in which each country was building up its forces to defend against its neighbours, had “transform[ed] the armed peace into a crushing burden that weighs on all nations and, if prolonged, will lead to the very cataclysm that it seeks to avert.”
Over the next years, the rivalries intensified, leading to further militarisation and a complex series of (often secret) treaties, as, between 1908 and 1913, the military spending of the major powers increased by 50%.
In 1912, the international socialist movement had staged an emergency meeting in Basel in Switzerland in which representatives from almost every nation spoke out for peace.
“The great European peoples are constantly on the point of being driven against one another,” the congress resolved, “although these attempts are against humanity and reason cannot be justified by even the slightest pretext of being in the interest of the people.”
Yet in early 1914, Winston Churchill noted that “the world is arming as it has never armed before”. The eventual declaration of war in August that year was still a shock – but only in the sense that those attending a patient expiring from a long illness might be startled by the death rattle.
The appeals to humanity and reason did not move states jostling for trade and commercial advantages. For the people of Europe, the arms race was disastrous; for specific governments, it made perfect sense, for those who did not compete risked falling behind.
The same might be said today.
From a global perspective, the necessity to abandon fossil fuels cannot be denied. But for individual economies, change risks undermining comparative advantages.
If we don’t sell coal, says Malcolm Turnbull, our competitors will – which was, of course precisely the logic of the British fleet expansion in 1908.
The devastation of the first world war eventually engendered a wave of revolt from a populace appalled at the carnage their politicians had wrought.
Climate change has not yet spurred an equivalent of the mutinies in France or the revolution in Petrograd or the uprising in Berlin.
Yet Labor’s appalling equivocation over the Adani mine – a piece of environmental vandalism for which there can be no justification – illustrates the urgency with which we need a new and different type of politics.
The stakes could not be higher. Lamps are going out all over the natural world … and no one will ever see them lit again.

1. The mean coal rank weighted by volume can't be determined from data either of us has found (yet). The mining takes place in sub-bituminous coals is a really all we know (and we don't even know that for sure but it seems probable given it's use as a thermal coal). This is an over simplification, but the ""natural"" rank of the coal, i.e. that based on it's depth of burial appears to be low. Only the coal subjected to the heat of intrusion, i.e. normally an ""unnatural"" event for coal, reaches the grade of anthracite, and probably then only very close to the dyke/sill/pipe. The 80 to 90% carbon by weight in-situ would only be correct if the coal was all anthracite, or maybe low-volatile bituminous, which is flat out false. Don't forget the ash ranges between 9 and 25% by weight, so even if the coal was all anthracite, it wouldn't reach 90% carbon in situ (although the specific gravity would be higher of course for high ash samples of anthracite).
2. All the coals in your referenced study are bituminous. You can tell this by looking at the mean maximum vitrinite reflectance values. So in this case ""low rank"" means ""low rank bituminous"", not sub-bituminous coals. The rank probably spans the range of Hi-Vol B to Low volatile bituminous coals in this study, so it's not a relevant counterpoint.

No it's not. This is wishful thinking on your part. The word ""A"" in front of ""typically"" means ""a seam"" as in one. Or maybe you'd like to divide this coal you allegedly claim is multiple beds, measured cumulatively into 30 one metre thick beds and ponder then how the fairy tale theory of ""liquidizing"" 1.5 trillion tonnes of in-situ coal still works.

BQEND
Three mistakes I've noted are:
1. The in-situ weight percent of carbon is not 80 to 90% for a sub-bitumenous coal, depending on ash content, it might be 60%. Lignite is even less in-situ and you guessed the coal currently being mined at Norilsk was brown (lignite) to black (sub-bitumenous) coal, so nowhere near 90% carbon by weight in situ. If the coal at Norilsk was bitumenous coal into the coking grade coals no doubt they would mine more of it and put it on a barge south since it's value is much more as a coking coal than thermal coal.
2. At the time these were young coals so there were not subject to the liquifaction process which happens in a coke oven. That's still true for Tunguska coals like which are being mined a Norilsk.

There is extensive evidence of the Triassic basalts that followed the end-Permian magmatic intrusion.
As discussed above Ogden and Sleep provide a number of areal estimates depending on the details of the processes involved - thickness of the cumulative coal seams and which factions of the coal deposits are removed - all equally probable in a coal basin of that size subjected to magmatic intrusion at the end-Permian.
Given the size of the basin and the small fraction needed to supply the carbon necessary for the end-Permian carbon excursion, it's hardly surprising that a good part of the coal is still there. That the coal remaining also is widely intruded by dykes and sills shows that the potential for coal / magma mixing and volcanism at the end-Permian was high. Where there are now dykes, pipes and sills there was coal before the end-Permian magmatic intrusion. This coal was burnt in explosive volcanic eruptions of coal / magma mix.

At the time of the end-Permian magma intrusions coal of the Tunguska Basin would have been of a similar age and degree of compaction to the current early Cenozoic coals of Victoria - a lignite.

Provide a reference to the peer reviewed papers published in proper scientific journals where some scientists claim that the coal was ejected the short distance to the surface by explosions. Note that explosive eruptions and incorporation of the coal into magma both occurred as described by Ogden and Sleep.
Incorporation of surrounding bedrock by magma is a well researched feature of volcanism in part because it produces mineral deposits of economic value. In the early stages of a flood basalt event before feeder dykes become well coated with solidified magma incorporation by melting and fracturing of bedrock would be expected to occur. This was the case with the Siberian flood basalt province when eruptions started at the end of the Permian.
""neither one explains how every single seam underlying 11,000 sq km, and totaling 92 m in cumulative thickness could be incorporated and 'washed' to the surface.""
Ogden and Sleep don't suggest that ""every seam underlying 11,000 sq km out of 500,000 sq km totaling 92 m in cumulative thickness"" was incorporated in rising magma and transported (""washed"") to the surface but they do mention evidence in the region of magmatic intrusion into very small coal seams which is not surprising given the age and friability of the coal deposits. They also describe the heat liquification of coal by magmatic intrusion and consequent bouyancy driven movement of this coal magma mix up to the surface through joints typical of such sediments.
""It not plausible because there is not a cumulative 92 m of coal continuous across the basin.""
Ogden and Sleep did not posit the need for a continuous cumulative 92 m of coal across the basin but also described the situation of lesser cumulative thickness such as 30 m and the need for a increase in the area subject to magmatic intrusion to around 40,000 sq km. 11,000 sq km or 40,000 sq km out of 500,000 sq km are both likely.

BQSTART
I found that link and posted it earlier above. As to whether it explains how 1,000 km^3 of coal could be ejected to the surface, either by explosion as some scientists claim, or mixing with lava and being ""washed"" to the surface, neither one explains how every single seam underlying an area of 11,000 km^2, and totalling 92 m in cumulative coal thickness could be incorporated and ""washed"" to the surface by basalt sills.
BQEND
It's not plausible because there is not a cumulative 92 m of coal continuous across the basin, that's the maximum they found at one spot. The other point (which I also make above is that) a lot of that coal in the cumullative thickness number is likely in thin seams down to 1 metre or less, and to get their small areal extent, Ogden and Sleep assumed the complete cumulative coal sequence had to be ""liquifyed"" and brought to surface, so the implication is that every seam, had to have a basalt sill wash into it, liquify the entire seam and wash it back to the pipe and up to surface.
This is not a plausible scenario, and as I also noted above, the Ogden and Sleep paper uses an incorrect number for the in-situ by weight % of carbon in a low rank seam, which is much too high, probably double of the actual number, but it's hard to tell since they don't specify the rank except as ""low"".', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1521208053000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'there is not a cumulative 92 m of coal continuous across the basin', u'effect': u""it 's not plausible""}], u'author_id': u'3638543', u'in_reply_to': u'113616488', u'id': u'113636469', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'GoldenAppleCorps', u'text': u'BTW it is called 'confirmation bias', not confirmation error.Though judging by your comments it is unsurprising that you don't know the difference between error and bias.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1521197100000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'17327071', u'in_reply_to': u'113614123', u'id': u'113626211', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ID2310987', u'text': u'That's got to be the daftest reason for burning coal I've ever heard.', u'recommendation_count': u'26', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1521194836000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'2515806', u'in_reply_to': u'113623884', u'id': u'113624120', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'John Smith', u'text': u'It demonstrates that 'Keep it in the ground' could be a dangerous strategy.

Germany remains on their same carbon emissions reduction targets.
BQENDAn open Letter to President Macron from Hansen and other climate scientists/experts.
""July 1, 2017Dear President Macron,
We are writing as environmentalists, conservationists and climate scientists to congratulate you on your win in the presidential election, and to applaud your push for a carbon tax. Nobody has done more for advancing clean energy on the grid than France. In light of this knowledge, we are also writing to express our alarm at your decision to move France away from clean nuclear power.
Few nations have done more than France to demonstrate the humanitarian and environmental benefits of creating a high-energy, nuclear-powered, and electrified society. Not only was France host of United Nations climate talks, it also has some of the lowest per capita carbon emissions of any developed nation.
Any reduction in France’s nuclear generation will increase fossil fuel generation and pollution given the low capacity factors and intermittency of solar and wind. Germany is a case in point. Its emissions have been largely unchanged since 2009 and actually increased in both 2015 and 2016 due to nuclear plant closures. Despite having installed 4 percent more solar and 11 percent more wind capacity, Germany’s generation from the two sources decreased 3 percent and 2 percent respectively, since it wasn’t as sunny or windy in 2016 as in 2015.
And where France has some of the cheapest and cleanest electricity in Europe, Germany has some of the most expensive and dirtiest. Germany spent nearly 24 billion euros above market price in 2016 for its renewable energy production feed-in tariffs alone, but emissions have remained stagnant. Germany is set to miss its 2020 emission reduction goals by a wide margin. Despite its huge investment in renewables, only 46 percent of Germany’s electricity comes from clean energy sources as compared to 93 percent in France.
Solar and wind can play an important role in France. However, if France is to make investments in solar and wind similar to those of Germany, they should add to France’s share of clean energy, not inadvertently reduce it. Renewables can contribute to the further electrification of the transportation sector, which France has already done with its trains and should continue to do with personal vehicles.
Shifting from nuclear to fossil fuels and renewables would grievously harm the French economy in three ways: higher electricity prices for consumers and industry, an end to France’s lucrative electricity exports, and — perhaps most importantly — the destruction of France’s nuclear export sector. If the French nuclear fleet is forced to operate at lower capacity factors, it will cripple the French nuclear industry by adding costs and shrinking revenues. Eventually this will lead to poorer safety standards and less opportunities to fund research, development and efforts to export French nuclear technologies. Nations seeking to build new nuclear plants rightly want to know that the product France is selling is one that France itself values.
The French nuclear program has historically been the envy of the world. It demonstrated in the 1970s and 80s that the decarbonization of an industrialized country’s electricity sector is in fact possible. For France, the next necessary step to help combat climate change and improve air quality is to increase clean electricity from all non-fossil sources and massively reduce fossil fuels used in heating and the transportation sector. Nuclear power must play a central role in this.

Do you think that there is an 11,000 sq km crater somewhere in Siberia?""
Keep in mind that the paper by Ogden and Sleep that you have quoted from describes on page 61 eruption from a small vent of the coal / magma mixture drawn from an area 1 km wide surrounding the vent. Such an eruption would last only 14 days as the coal/ magma mix is soon depleted. The intrusion of magma would work its way through the coal seams producing further vents and small eruptions. While these small vent eruptions would be explosive any craters created would be small and would have been buried by the non-intrusive Triassic basalts that followed.
While craters or more correctly calderas 11,000 sq km in size are formed in island arc volcanism - for example Lake Toba, the mafic intrusion of coal seam volcanism produces instead a series of short lived small vents and small craters.
""1000 cubic km is approximately 1.5 trillion tons of coal-in-situ, but many orders of magnitude of interburden above the coal would need to have been 'exploded' to surface.""
At the time of the mafic intrusions the Siberian coal measures would have been relatively young with at most only 60 millions years of overburden above them - its thickness dependent on the erosion and depositional history that followed its deposition. As described on page 60 of Ogden and Sleep, The overburden and the interburden (between the coal seams) did not need to be blown or exploded off as mafic magma intrusion liguified the coal causing it to move upward through joints to vents where explosive eruptions did occur. They describe magmatic intrusion and liquification of quite small coal seams as well as larger ones.
""It's not a reasonable argument that this much coal somehow was 'exploded' to the surface, along with all the rock interburden.""
No one is making that argument. See paragraph above.
""I note my initial point that large quantities of coal cannot be burned underground as implied by this article has not been challenged.""

You also quote from and provide a link to the paper by Ogden and Sleep (2011) ""Explosive eruption of coal and basalt and the end-Permian extinction""PNAS Vol 109 No 1 pp 59-62 if you had read you would have seen the description of injection of hot magma as sills into friable coal seams resulting in the formation of a mix of hot coal and magma or coal volatiles and magma which as experience in coking plants and coal furnaces shows produces a fluidised mix which is pushed to the surface to erupt and ignite explosively upon exposure to air. The injection of magma brought the coal seam up to ignition temperature and fluidised it to transport all or part of it to the surface where it ignited. You seem to have misinterpreted the article.
As to the extent of the lavas in question, I refer you to https://www.le.ac.uk/gl/ads/SiberianTraps/GeolSett.htmlwhich describes the extent of the basalt province which covered an area equal to Western Europe.

Resources are finite. But the club of Rome got their estimates ridiculously wildly wrong because they didn’t understand the provenance of the resource estimates. Nor did they understand the evolution of technologies to recover the resources in question. 
This lack of understanding, and a lack of questioning to improve understanding, is typical of when people obtain answers that suit their a priori positions. If they had felt that the answer was “wrong”, they would have required more deeply. 
Confirmation error.

In this event, coined “the Great Dying,” over 90% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species went extinct. It took about 10 million years for life on Earth to recover from this catastrophic event.
Scientists have proposed a number of possible culprits responsible for this mass extinction, including an asteroid impact, mercury poisoning, a collapse of the ozone layer, and acid rain. Heavy volcanic activity in Siberia was suspected to play a key role in the end-Permian event.
Recently, geologist Dr Benjamin Burger identified a rock layer in Utah that he believed might have formed during the Permian and subsequent Triassic period that could shed light on the cause of the Great Dying.
During the Permian, Earth’s continents were still combined as one Pangea, and modern day Utah was on the supercontinent’s west coast. Samples from the end-Permian have been collected from rock layers in Asia, near the volcanic eruptions, but Utah was on the other side of Pangaea. Burger’s samples could thus provide a unique perspective of what was happening on the other side of the world from the eruptions. Burger collected and analyzed samples from the rock layer, and documented the whole process in a fascinating video:
Burger’s samples painted a grim picture of Earth’s environment at the end of the Permian period. A sharp drop in calcium carbonate levels indicated that the oceans had become acidic. A similar decline in organic content matched up with the immense loss of life in the oceans during this period. The presence of pyrite pointed to an anoxic ocean (without oxygen), meaning the oceans were effectively one massive dead zone. 
Bacteria ate the oversupply of dead bodies, producing hydrogen sulfide gas, creating a toxic atmosphere. The hydrogen sulfide oxidized in the atmosphere to form sulfur dioxide, creating acid rain, which killed much of the plant life on Earth. Elevated barium levels in the samples had likely been carried up from the ocean depths by a massive release of methane. 
Levels of various metals in the rock samples were critical in identifying the culprit of this mass extinction event. As in end-Permian samples collected from other locations around the world, Burger didn’t find the kinds of rare metals that are associated with asteroid impacts. There simply isn’t evidence that an asteroid struck at the right time to cause the Great Dying.
However, Burger did find high levels of mercury and lead in his samples, coinciding with the end of the Permian period. Mercury has also been identified in end-Permian samples from other sites. Lead and mercury aren’t associated with volcanic ash, but they are a byproduct of burning coal. Burger also identified a shift from heavier carbon-13 to lighter carbon-12; the latter results from burning fossil fuels.
The Permian was the end of the Carboniferous period, which means “coal-bearing.” Many large coal deposits were created in the Carboniferous, including in Asia. Previous research has shown that the Permian mass extinction event didn’t coincide with the start of the Siberian volcanic eruptions and lava flows, but rather 300,000 years later. That’s when the lava began to inject as sheets of magma underground, where Burger’s data suggests it ignited coal deposits.
The coal ignition triggered the series of events that led to Earth’s worst mass extinction. Its sulfur emissions created the acid rain that killed forests. Its carbon emissions acidified the oceans and warmed the planet, killing most marine life. The dead bodies fed bacteria that produced toxic hydrogen sulfide gas, which in turn killed off more species. The warming of the oceans produced a large methane release, which accelerated global warming faster yet. As Burger put it,
Things went from bad to worse, and you can now begin to understand how life nearly died out. Global warming, acid oceans, anoxia, not to mention a toxic atmosphere. We are lucky to be alive at all!
Scientists are observing many of the same signs of dangerously rapid climate change today. There’s more lighter carbon-12 in the atmosphere because the increase in atmospheric carbon levels is due entirely to humans burning fossil fuels. There are an increasing number of dead zones in the oceans. Burning coal was causing acid rain, although we largely solved that problem through Clean Air Acts, and in the US, a sulfur dioxide cap and trade system implemented by a Republican administration. 
We’ve had less success in tackling carbon dioxide pollution, which continues to rise. As a result, the oceans are becoming increasingly acidic, and temperatures increasingly hot. Scientists today also worry about potentially large releases of methane from the ocean floor and Arctic.
These are some of the similarities between the climate change that nearly wiped out life on Earth 252 million years ago and the climate change today. Both appear to have largely been caused by burning coal. A 2011 study found that over the past 500 years, species are now going extinct at least as fast as they did during the five previous mass extinction events.

Under the proposal Australia would adopt a mandatory fuel efficiency standard of 105g of CO2 a kilometre by 2022, three years earlier than a proposal being considered by the federal government.
It would also cut tariffs and charges on new electric or zero-emissions vehicles, including the 5% import tariff, GST and stamp duty, in order to lower the purchase price to match new petrol or diesel cars, and offer three years free registration on new zero-emissions vehicles.
The tax breaks, as well as a $151m national fund to build up to 3,000 electric car charging stations, would be funded by a 17% tax on fossil fuel emitting cars with a purchase price of more than $65,000. That tax would be imposed on top of the existing 33% luxury vehicle tax for cars in that price range and is expected to generate $500m a year over a limited four-year run.
A University of New South Wales researcher, Gail Broadbent, who is studying electric vehicles at the university’s school of biological, earth, and environmental sciences, said the targets were achievable and would increase Australia’s sluggish adoption of electric vehicles, provided exemptions were included for remote Indigenous communities that were unlikely to have access to a charging station.
Broadbent said introducing strict vehicle emissions targets was essential for increasing the uptake of hybrid, electric, fuel cell and other zero-emissions vehicles in Australia.
“There is no incentive for vehicle manufacturers to bring them into the country so we just get fobbed off the old vehicles,” she told Guardian Australia. “Electric vehicles are cheaper to maintain so there’s no incentive for manufacturers to bring them here if the policy settings do not shift.”
The proposal would also impose targets on large car manufacturers so that 2% of all car and light vehicle sales in Australia in 2020, increasing to 10% by 2050, were of zero-emissions vehicles.
Electric cars make up just 0.1% of new car sales in Australia, compared with 20% in Norway and the Netherlands, which have both introduced targets to phase out fossil fuel emitting cars by 2025 and 2030 respectively. 
Broadbent said research by UNSW showed concern about the lack of charging stations was the biggest barrier to Australians purchasing an electric car. According to the environment and energy minister Josh Frydenberg, Australia has 476 public car charging stations.
The Turnbull government, through the ministerial forum on vehicle emissions, proposed introducing a mandatory 105g CO2 per km fuel efficiency standard by 2025, prompting strong backlash from the automotive industry and lobby groups. 
A discussion paper excluded consideration of the fuel standards which would provide “the greatest health and environmental benefits”.
Frydenberg has said the federal government supports the rollout of electric vehicles, including offering a discount to the luxury car tax for low-emissions vehicles. He says he expects the number of electric vehicles on Australian roads to increase almost 60-fold to 230,000 cars by 2025.
The Greens climate change and energy spokesman, Adam Bandt, called on Labor to support the policy, which was to be announced as part of the Batman byelection campaign.
“This plan is the quantum leap we need to reduce emissions, meet our paltry Paris targets and to stop people dying from air pollution,” Bandt said.
Federal Labor’s emissions reduction policies are focused around a 50% renewable energy target by 2030, but the South Australian Labor government, which will go to the polls on the same day as Batman, has pledged to waive stamp duty and five years’ registration costs for new electric or zero-emissions cars if re-elected.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/13/greens-electric-car-push-end-sale-of-petrol-and-diesel-vehicles-by-2030

This is like asking for the recipe for curry. There are many different types of curry, and the result depends upon which spices are used and how they are combined.
For a long time, clouds over the Southern Ocean have puzzled meteorologists; there are more of them and they hang around for longer than climate models predict. Benjamin Murray and his colleagues from the University of Leeds have shown this is because of the delicate ingredients that goes into Southern Ocean clouds.
Writing in the journal PNAS, they show that the ultra-clean air in this region means there is a paucity of particles to encourage the growth of ice. So, instead of progressing through the usual cloud cycle, where particles help ice crystals to grow and fall out, Southern Ocean clouds persist as a mist of miniscule droplets, struggling to gain weight and fall from the sky. 
Currently, climate models don’t include the right type of particles in their recipe for clouds and, consequently, they fail to reproduce massive areas of Southern Ocean cloud – some as big as the entire UK. This means they miscalculate the amount of heat reflected, with knock-on consequences for predicting weather and climate.

A sharp increase in temperatures across the Arctic since the early 1990s has coincided with an uptick in abnormally cold snaps in winter, particularly in the eastern US, according to new research that analyzed temperature data from 1950 onwards.
Extreme cold winter weather is up to four times more likely when temperatures in the Arctic are unusually high, the study found. Researchers compared daily temperatures from across the Arctic region with something called the accumulated winter season severity index, which grades winter weather based on temperature, snow fall and snow depth, across 12 US cities.
“There’s a remarkably strong correlation between a warm Arctic and cold winter weather further south,” said Judah Cohen, a climatologist at Atmospheric and Environmental Research. “It’s a complex story – global warming is contributing to milder temperatures but is also having unforeseen consequences such as this.”
The Arctic has just experienced its toastiest winter on record, with parts of the region 20C (68F) warmer than the long-term average, a situation scientists have variously described as “crazy,” “weird,” and “simply shocking”. The far north latitudes are warming around twice as quickly as the global average, diminishing glaciers and sea ice and imperiling creatures such as polar bears.
Two large winter storms recently swept the US east coast in less than a week, unloading up to three inches of snow per hour in places, resulting in several deaths, thousands of cancelled flights, closed schools and snarled traffic.
The cold front even reached Florida, contributing to a recent surge in manatee deaths. So far this year, 166 of the marine mammals have been found dead off the state’s coast, with stress from the cold the leading cause of mortality. “Manatees may join polar bears as one of the first iconic victims of extinction in the wild from climate change,” said Jeff Ruch, executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility.
The US storms follow freezing winds from Siberia – dubbed the ‘beast from the east’ – that battered parts of Europe, with the British army deployed to help liberate hundreds of stranded drivers on UK motorways.
“This winter is a great example of what we can expect from climate change,” said Cohen. “In the US we had the ‘bomb cyclone’ in January, followed by July-like warm weather in February that I’d never seen before. And now we’ve had a parade of powerful winter storms and the beast from the east. It’s mind boggling.”
The research didn’t look at the reasons behind the trend of see-sawing temperatures between the Arctic and areas to the south but Cohen said it was consistent with the theory that the polar vortex – which shot to public consciousness during a 2014 cold spell – is being disrupted as the earth heats up.
The polar vortex is a low pressure system that swirls around the polar region. Sometimes it can stray further south, bringing cold Arctic air with it. There is continuing conjecture over the impact climate change is having but some scientists believe warming temperatures could be weakening the polar vortex’s flow, allowing it to meander towards the equator.
This nuanced picture of the consequences of climate change has been derided by Donald Trump, with the president using Twitter to mockingly reference cold weather during almost every winter in recent years. In December, Trump tweeted that “perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming” amid plunging temperatures.
Scientists say this stance overlooks the complicated changes underway in the environment as the world warms due to human activity, by an average of around 1C over the past century. This temperature rise hasn’t been uniform across the globe and has fueled an array of conditions, from increased flood risk in some areas to drought conditions and heatwaves in others.
Richard Alley, a leading glacier and climate expert at Penn State who was not involved in Cohen’s research, said the study is “fascinating” and “important” but added the discrepancy between Arctic temperatures and winter weather elsewhere could have other drivers, such as a warm Gulf of Mexico feeding extra energy into storms along the US east coast.
 “The broadest picture is that we are indeed warming the world’s climate, primarily from carbon dioxide release from fossil-fuel burning, and this will impact us and other living things,” said Alley. 
The Arctic’s role is seen quite differently by some other scientists, however, who point out that occasional outbursts of cold weather haven’t altered the trend that winters in the US northeast have been getting warmer, particularly since the 1970s.
“There have always been cold outbreaks. The cold air has to go somewhere,” said Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
“The issue is whether the air stays put or gets loose. Some years it is contained, other years it breaks out. The question is where and what is the cause. This study reaffirms the relationship but not its cause. The Arctic likely plays a modest role in terms of feedbacks but it is unlikely it is a cause.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/13/extreme-winter-weather-becoming-more-common-as-arctic-warms-study-finds

Mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds are also likely to disappear on a catastrophic scale in the Amazon and other naturally rich ecosysterms in Africa, Asia, North America and Australia if temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, concludes the study by WWF, the University of East Anglia and the James Cook University.
The research in the journal Climate Change examined the impact of three different levels of warming – 2C (the upper target in the 2015 Paris agreement), 3.2C (the likely rise given existing national commitments) and 4.5C (the forecast outcome if emissions trends remain unchanged) on nearly 80,000 plant and animal species in 35 of the world’s most biodiverse regions.
If governments fail to set more ambitious commitments than those currently on the table, the report projects devastating losses of more than 60% of plant species and almost 50% of animal species in the Amazon at a temperature rise of 3.2C. 
If countries lift their efforts sufficiently to reach the 2C goal, the outlook is improved – but still grim – with more than 35% of species at risk of local extinction in the region. If no actions are taken, the picture is apocalyptic, with a likely loss of more than 70% of plant and reptile species and a more than 60% decline of mammal, reptile and bird species in the Amazon.
The picture was similarly alarming in the two other worst affected areas – south-west Australia and the Miombo woodlands in Africa. But nowhere among the selected 35 hotspots escaped massive losses of wildlife, which would have a dire knock-on effect on human society and wellbeing.
The authors considered how warmer weather and wilder rainfall patterns (more droughts and storms) could negatively affect savannas in Africa, jungles in Bangladesh, the Cerrado-Pantanal in Brazil, the Yangtze delta and coastlines in Europe, Madagascar and the Caribbean. It noted how this would create tensions over water between humans and animals, for example African elephants, which drink as much as 250 litres (50 gallons) a day. Sea-level rises would also be devastating for many species, such as tigers in the Sundarbans, which would see 96% of breeding grounds submerged.
The losses might even be higher because the disappearance of one species - such as a tree - can have a knock-on effect on other ecosystems. Fewer plants can also means less rain, according to other recent studies on the role played by the Amazon. More pressing risks – such as habitat loss from land clearance and pollution – were not accounted for.
William Laurance, director of the Centre for Tropical Environmental and Sustainability Science, said: “For the Amazon and Guianas, the WWF report is scary as hell. The loss of half or more of the region’s stunning plant diversity would be a biological blow of almost unimaginable severity.
“However, such computer models with all their assumptions and complexities are really ‘scientific cartoons’ giving us only a rough sketch of the future. But even if they’re only half right, these are very frightening cartoons indeed.”
The study considered two main ways to reduce these losses: adaptation (helping species to migrate to new territories) and mitigation (cutting greenhouse gases more aggressively). The former produced modest improvements thanks to the creation of eco-corridors between protected areas, but this was little help to slow-moving or almost stationary groups, such as orchids, plants, amphibians and reptiles. WWF said there may be a need to translocate such species, which would otherwise be outrun by the pace of climate change.
A partial solution may be relocation. Some animals, such as wolves, have been successfully reintroduced to their former ranges. A paper published today by the Royal identified 130 areas across the globe that might be suitable for carnivore reintroduction and concluded that rewilding will be essential for conservation in the future.
Far better, the authors say, is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to keep warming as close to 1.5C as possible.
“The numbers are a bit of a wake-up call,” said Stephen Cornelius, chief adviser to WWF on climate issues. “If there is one message it is that mitigation makes a big difference. But even that is not enough for a lot of species ... What will be the new normal in coming decades is not something that wildlife has seen before.”
Experts on Amazon wildlife said the findings were alarming, though they noted that such projections are a rough guide to the future.
 Last month, a separate study predicted an ecological tipping point if 25% of the Amazon is deforested, which would cause droughts and environmental degradation over a wider area. The authors argue the 2014-15 drought in São Paulo is a precursor to what may come unless deforestation is halted and more trees are planted. While this is contentious and relates to the size of the forest rather than the number of species, it highlights the wider impacts of a diminished Amazon, which would apply to a different extent with the weakening of forests in other countries.
 Many species are already at risk from other factors, such as habitat destruction, invasive rivals and disease. Climate change adds to those pressures, prompting fears that a sixth mass extinction is already underway.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/14/worlds-great-forests-could-lose-half-of-all-wildlife-as-planet-warms-report

When my wife was studying for her u/g degree, it was being suggested that the Amazon (and other tropical rainforests) were the “lungs of the Earth”, or similarly emotive nonsense - sorry I have limited patience for Biology when it indulges in philosophical narrative and strays away from science. Subsequently, as fashions changed, savannah and temperate grasslands were considered to be more important, as were the tremendous soil-creating capacity of temperate forests.
If we maintain the diversity, but manage agriculture so as to protect and enhance the thin soils, it may be that a better overall outcome could be achieved than simply leaving the rainforest to its own devices.
As an aside, it appears that there may be a perhaps 20,000 year cycle of greening and desertification of the Sahara.

This dichotomy is based on a supposed difference between the two that appears from application of a life cycle analysis. No doubt, Dr. Field has run such an analysis based on data that he has collected somehow and from someplace.
We (i) run the largest ethanol plant in Europe, processing corn, and (ii) we tried to build the largest cellulosic ethanol plant in the world, in Macedonia, running on switchgrass grown on marginal abandoned land (which we actually did- and it's still there in Macedonia if anyone wants to look at it). We are, as far as we know, the only people on the planet who could bridge Dr. Field's theory with actual data. We don't know Dr. Field. He has never contacted us. His work is certainly for us in no way informative; it is not even informed.
To our surprise, when we ran the numbers based on how things work in the real world, our corn ethanol has 80% GHG savings. Our switchgrass ethanol would have had 60-70% GHG savings. That was not the only reason that project was never built, but this is an important lesson. Lest anyone cheekily claim that our LCA doesn't include fertiliser or transport or anything else, this is a full LCA, not biased one way or another, with lots an lots of actual inputs instead of default values. It is what is required by law of any biofuel in the European Union.
Out of touch academics like Dr. Field, who collect data only through desk research and who know so little about what that data represents (how people actually farm, how much natural gas is actually used, what conversion rations are practicable vs. what is promoted) do no service to climate research, and they often impede actual climate progress.
Biofuels are needed to displace oil. Any biofuel that is better than oil deserves support. The academic fervour to identify the ""best biofuel"" is misguided both because we need lots of things to displace oil, not just one, and because academics are certain to get it wrong in identifying what is best (until they start getting mud on their shoes rather than simply scrolling the Internet).

Great expanses such as the Beacons are covered with heather because that’s the reliable natural cover that is part of that ecosystem.
BQEND
The Beacons are not covered in 'great expanses' of heather- and besides the farming is restricted in national parks. But even without restrictions the farming is not maintaining nature- and half the time it is at war with it.
Heather/Heath is a preclimatic ecology- often associated with either wetland heath or dry heath [as Heathrow was- non productive farmland they turned into an airport]- the 'natural' process is colonisation by hardy plants like the heathers, some grasses and rushes- the soil is acid making it difficult for broad leaf trees. Scotpine and willow would be the first to arrive, followed by birch, rowen- as the soil became less acid woodland trees that compete by shading arrive and become dominant- such as lime and oak, with hazel and ash able to get a foot hold.
And woodland, coppice, wetland [beavers] etc have far greater water capacity than monocrops of heather for raising grouse.
Left to there own devices the Breacon Beacons would be covered in mixed woodland and the heather pushed out. Grazers will create clearings, where heather can survive, beavers will create wetlands so pushing up acidity in the soil or at least maintaining it. Fire is an early part of colonisation - heather, pine, and gorse have potential for destructive wild fires [I know them first hand]- but the coppice prone trees recover quickly.

Every two years, an area roughly the size of Britain is abandoned. Has humanity’s insatiable land grab reached a turning point? And can we take this opportunity to build a world in which farming has a smaller footprint, and where nature can rebound from the toll we have inflicted upon it?

Today’s biofuels generally come from food crops such as corn and sugar, and so compete for agricultural land and fresh water. Algae can be grown in concrete ponds of salt water, on barren or desert land. 
Production of advanced biofuels made from algae could grow rapidly in the late 2020s, according to Synthetic Genomics, the biotech company that has formed a partnership with ExxonMobil to develop the fuel.
The two companies said last week that by 2025 they were aiming to set up one or more demonstration plants to produce 10,000 barrels a day of diesel and jet fuel from genetically modified algae. Synthetic Genomics argues that scaling up production could be relatively quick. 
The aim is to produce biofuels that will be cost competitive with conventional oil-based fuels at crude prices of about $60 to $65 a barrel. 
Oliver Fetzer, chief executive of Synthetic Genomics, said: “Once we’re past 2025, if our trajectory stays on track, there’s no reason why we would not be able to scale up quickly.”

Another avenue that Audi are pursuing now are the 'Sunflow' e-fuels made purely from bacteria, any type of water, and a carbon dioxide stream. However, looking at the website it seems obvious that the way they are using this carbon dioxide is to utilise a lot of it in bulk at concentrations that are unlikely to be derived from just biomass - so its just getting a second use out of carbon, using bacteria. Interesting, but not technically a biofuel and wholly dependent on the source of CO2.https://fleetworld.co.uk/audi-makes-breakthrough-in-e-gas-prodution/
The absolute best answer to the question of bio-based fuels is a combination of these types of things used specifically for air travel, which I think is going to be difficult to decarbonise considering the maturity of the various technologies currently in use, and the testing etc required to effect a change to a new technology.
What genuinely needs to happen is a wholesale shift to bio-gas/biomethane. The advantages of biogas are as follows and can be easily verified by farmers' reports, studies etc - this is what needs to happen.a) Biogas is carbon negative as the remaining substrate from AD units goes back on the soilb) This reduces or replaces the fossil fertilizer that would otherwise be usedc) Not using fossil fertilizer halts the chemical decomposition of the soil, which halts the emission of nitrous oxides - a powerful GHGd) Fertilizer pollution and run-off are minimised, as can be verifiede) This industrially-produced organic fertilizer creates healthier, more climate-resiliant crops that need less waterf) Obviously the farmer is producing a lot of energy which within an effective logistics environment, produces approx €800,000 of biogas per silo annuallyg) Various local quality of life impacts such as reduced smell etc.
Many gas network operators and providers plan to reduce their carbon emissions before 2050. This is because it can be cheaper than refitting a very old metal gas network, or some appliances (potentially, we are still waiting for studies on this) for hydrogen. Plastic pipes work a lot better with no problems regarding an increased pressure within the pipe, and various issues. So if a country cannot or does not want to go 100% hydrogen, then combining biogas with hydrogen can both make up a significant proportion of domestic gas use with zero change to appliances or pipes. This is because biogas contains carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide which are easy to combine with hydrogen via biomethanation; producing a chemically-identical gas to the one we use today in most homes. Of overall domestic gas use in most western countries (without including transport of industry), this biogas could replace over 1/3 of domestic consumption; and in combination with H2 about two-thirds. With fuel cells or higher efficiency; lower demand, the figure is close to 100% - this is why many studies point to this being a viable and cost-effective route for gas companies to take going out to 2050. Personally, I believe hydrogen will play a more prominant role but certainly biogas is very much a growth industry and carries many other advantages for agriculture that cannot be avoided if we are to cope with these various problems concurrently.

I am pleased for you, having this positive experience. 
My direct experience of agriculture, having grown up in farming country, is that it is an intensely industrialised process that is extremely intolerant of nature. It systematically poisons and eradicates anything other than the narrow range of plants and animals it produces. Bird populations are continuing to plummet, insects have been devastated and bees are under threat around the world because of powerful insecticides. The industry is not kind to its practitioners either, with exposure to powerful carcinogens such as found in sheep dip. 
Looking for farmers to save us from oil barons is a bit like the old lady who swallowed a fly. And then hilariously swallows a spider to fix it. And so on. 
Some bio-energy makes sense. Like some wind and solar in appropriate niches. But these are all fiddling around the edges rather than addressing Central issues of copious cheap reliable and sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels.

David is sadly missed. His excellent analysis “Sustainable energy without the hot air” is wonderfully revealing of the realistic options we face, taking Britain as an example. He looks at a range of viable alternatives for sustainable energy supply, minimising fossil carbon emissions. Biofuel (predominately in the form of wood burning and of energy recovered from biowaste) is a small component of any of the options he shows. 
So many of the “feelgood” and fashionable “alternatives” simply evaporate when viewed by scientists as part of the bigger picture and in real-world contexts outside the ivory towers, and outside vested interests and special interest groups.

Where will Nature go now? In places such as Britain, it has been a struggle to reclaim any land from industrial agriculture for nature corridors and islands to allow at least some space for something other than industrial monocultures. In large swathes of sub-Saharan Africa there is direct competition between biofuels and growing of food. The “marginal” areas are often game reserves and areas of retreat for wildlife under pressure from increasing populations. 
The challenge of growing sufficient food in a changing world is frequently cited as an argument for accelerating action against climate change. 
Calls for a renewed focus on biofuels, with the obvious increased pressure that this will exert on wildlife and “natural” (unfarmed) environments is something of an eye-opener. This is one of the champions of action against climate change writing this article. But this looks like just one more short-sighted economic initiative. Like building extensive wind farms in South Australia that now need even greater expenditure on energy storage to make them reliable and to recover the value of the initial investment.

I'd be interested to see research that examined the amount of land required to produce sufficient amounts of biofuels to burn for the UK's transportation systems. In contrast to ecological reports that suggest, in general, the UK's land management ( historically) has severely neglected the fact that land isn't merely a area of space their for human exploitation, it's a component of a ecosystem. Ecosystems where many species evolved.
I think, in general, the same monetary values, above and beyond ecological awareness, remain at the heart of many people's decision making processes.
Of course society needs energy. However, we have become accustomed to having a economic system that gives us all we want ( more stuff and more power) rather than focusing on we need ( a comparably stable climate, clean air and water etc). 
In many communities this "" win,win "" hypothesis ( neutral carbon) means they have digressed environmentally as potentially biodiverse habitats ( using evidenced based conservation biology, ecology etc) are changed to provide biofuel plantations of conifer tree's for people to burn in their homes thus emit the polutents where they live. 
There is much cognitive dissonance regarding environmental issues and a hell of alot of ignorance. Thus l wouldn't be surprised in 30 years or society has simply shifted the problems of CO2 emissions ( one one part of the problem. E.g. Deforestation, habitat loss, over fishing, ) into other area's ( e.g. polutents from burning biofuels and the huge amounts of land required for plantations).

So, what can we do now to help the future? 
The easiest answer is to use energy more wisely and quit wasting our precious resources. Second, we can increase our use of clean energy, particularly wind and solar power. These are great starts but we will still need some liquid fuels and for those, we can make decisions about the best fuels for the environment. There has been extensive conversation recently about biofuels and how they may help solve the climate problem. 
The term “biofuels” has many meanings, but basically they are grown fuels (like corn ethanol) that we can use instead of fossil fuels (like petroleum). While biofuels can be any fuel produced from plant material, historically they have been produced from food crops such as corn and soy. But, new technologies are enabling biofuel production from non-edible gases, wood, and other plant waste material.
The beauty of biofuels is that they suck carbon dioxide out of the air as they grow. When we burn them in our automobiles, we release carbon dioxide, but it is the same carbon that the plants absorbed while growing. Just on that basis, biofuels appear to be zero net emitters. 
But this view is too simplistic. It takes energy to grow biofuels; it takes fertilizer, tractors, transportation, and energy to convert the plants to liquid fuels. Planting and growing these crops can also change how much carbon is stored in the soil. And using existing food crops or arable land for biofuel production might lead to deforestation if farms are expanded elsewhere to make up for lost food production.
 So, if you want to accurately assess the impact of biofuels, you need to look at what’s called a “life cycle analysis,” which basically means the effort it takes to grow the crops, harvest them, convert them to fuel, transport them to distribution sites, and combust them. 
I have done some research in this area. Back in 2009, I did a study with my former student Fushcia-Ann Hoover, and we compared different feedstocks for ethanol. You can have corn, soybeans, sugarcane, switchgrass, poplar trees, and others. What is the best crop? Which is easiest to grow? Which is best for the environment?
What we found, way back in 2009, is that if non-commercial crops were grown, you could actually end up with fuel that was significantly cleaner than petroleum. The trick was finding clean crops that don’t need a lot of fertilizer, water, and other inputs. Corn ethanol for instance is not the best choice. You need so much water, fertilizer, and other costs, that it almost doesn’t make it worthwhile. But other crops such as switchgrass, grown on marginal lands, have real a potential. Marginal lands are farmlands that are not optimal for growing crops.
Our conclusion in 2009 was straightforward. Don’t use good cropland for biofuels. Rather, use marginal croplands, with minimal water and fertilizer, to create plants that can be converted to biofuels. 
But our conclusion wasn’t the end of the story. There are other details that researchers should consider. For instance, how far from the croplands to the refinery? How much energy is needed to transport the fuels? All these issues matter and they were the focus of a recent research paper just published in Nature Energy. This study used an actual biofuel refinery located in Kansas for the basis of the study. And the authors counted all the emissions that occur during the lifecycle analysis of these biofuels. They realized that marginal croplands give lower yields, so there are competing issues of productivity and greenhouse gas reduction.
Then there’s the complicating factor of economics. The price of biofuels and the price of greenhouse gases matter. If society is willing to pay a small pollution charge like a carbon tax, it supports the producers of clean energy. But if society doesn’t put a premium on clean energy, it’s harder for clean industry companies to thrive.
In the new study, the authors discovered something fascinating. The found that the choices a farmer may make regarding what land to use for biofuels and how much fertilizer to use depend strongly on the price of clean fuels and the cost of greenhouse gases. Simply put, it we put a reasonable price on carbon pollution, farmers will be able to grow switchgrass, poplars, and other species, reduce greenhouse gases, and make money. 
But, if there is no cost to carbon pollution, farmers will be motivated to spend more money on fertilizer and that, in the end, will lead to more emissions. While all the scenarios resulted in large emissions reductions compared to gasoline, the reductions were especially large for the scenarios that included a carbon price. 
So, there is a delicate balance. The balance is made more clear when we realize that farming location matters. If biofuels are grown close to refineries, less pollution is created in transporting the fuels to the refinery. However, this limits cropland choices to those nearer to refineries. 
With this balance of competing factors, the authors find room for improvement; currently we are not optimizing the performance in terms of both economic and environmental factors. In order to do this right, we have to balance all these mentioned issues. We can’t just focus on transportation costs, fertilizer costs, and land quality costs; we have to consider these costs all together as a system.
I spoke to the lead author of the paper, Dr. John Field, from Colorado State University and asked him about the significance of this work.
Agriculture is being challenged by increasing food demand, and changes to regional climate. On top of this, most plans to combat climate change rely on the agricultural sector to increase carbon storage in soils, and to produce raw materials for the large-scale production of biofuels and power. Modeling studies like ours attempt to predict on a farm-by-farm basis where the best opportunities for biofuel crop production and soil carbon storage lie, how much they might cost, and how those two goals trade off. 
Our results suggest that biofuels can have a wide range of environmental outcomes depending on exactly where and how those crops are grown, but climate benefits can be increased at relatively low cost.
This is another great example of clean energy technologies that will help us solve the climate problem while continuing our use of fuels that drive the economy. It’s a win-win situation.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/14/biofuels-can-help-solve-climate-change-especially-with-a-carbon-tax

You accuse me of mind reading. And then you invent a position for me regarding future outcomes. 
All the indications are that the timeframes for major temperature increase are such that we will have plenty of time to adapt. I view several short to medium term threats as being of greater importance, and consider that we should focus the use of our resources accordingly. This is clearly too sophisticated and nuanced for you to get your mind around, and so you defend yourself by childish sniping. 
Change is important, even if often unwelcome. The scale and speed of change can threaten social structure in possibly devastating ways. The cost and availability of energy, and the extent to which the general ambition for improved circumstances is seen to be satisfied are huge forces. Climate change is one threat among many. And, given current rates of action (some profoundly ill-judged, however) on “climate”, we need to keep adjusting our approach to ensure that priorities are appropriate. 
If you have any interest in broadening your horizons, I suggest that you should read Eric Cline’s “1177 BC the year that civilisation collapsed”. Perhaps also “The Collapse of Complex Societies”by Joseph Tainter

Do you think car companies care whether we buy diesel/petrol cars or electric? It makes no difference to them so long as we keep replacing older cars with new ones. And of course, that is precisely what the ban on older diesele/petrol cars will do! I suspect that car companies are even helping to lobby for this change over.

None of what you've said justifies the campaign by the fossil fuel industry against climate science. They've funded most of the climate skeptic movements. They've spent billions lobbying governments and undermining policy. They've slowed down humanity's response to a massive threat by decades. 
If you're looking for a ""why"", the reason is the fossil fuel industry is a natural monopoly/oligopoly. It's got high barriers to entry. The reason they're opposed the movement to renewables is because they want to shut out competition.

This is pure nonsense. The whole world economy has never been dependent on tobacco. It's not even remotely comparable.

I should think that's an improvement. Do you think it would be better if Exxon actively opposed the Paris agreement and published climate change denial documents attacking it? The Paris agreement is pretty much toothless, but still better than nothing.
Unfortunately the game is ""not up"" for oil and to a large extent gas. Incidentally the oil and gas companies are far more in touch with reality on this question in terms of current conditions. Conditions may change, but unfortunately that's the way it is right now. They are a very long way from being stupid.
Much is made of EVs and they are going to make a contribution to emissions reduction. How much and how fast remains to be seen. But they are not going to put oil companies out of business anytime soon. Road passages vehicles (cars, buses, motorbikes etc) only account for about 25% of global oil consumption. There's a scarcity of good options to get rid of the other 75% right now. 
Few seem to able to put in any sort of effort into thinking about why oil companies want a carbon price. It's simple.

I’m not sure that people would have chosen to eat short-faced bears, or dire wolves. But despite potential prey in their millions, in the form of the American Bison, both these dangerous predators disappeared. 
So it would appear fair to speculate that, if any human agency were involved, the killing would have been at least partly deliberate. 
Similarly, hunting mammoths would have been an extremely dangerous business, with the return on effort limited by the time before the carcass would be inedible or attract too much scavengers attention. But they were hunted to extinction. Bison, on the other hand, might well be spot on for large family groups.

The issue of predicting the future is exactly my point. One only has to look at Hansen (1988), and the 50% overestimate of future warming, based on the best science that was available at the time, confirmed by hindcasting. And wildly wrong. 
We could be visited in future by alien civilisations. We could be wiped out by a meteor strike (definitely existential risk). We could face a radiation risk because of reversal of the magnetic poles. We could individually or collectively die as a result of debris falling from the various satellites and space stations in declining orbit.

Sounds about right. So why does the guardian never ever investigate the political and moral implications. Lets map it out - engaging in a crime against humanity should result in at least life time imprisonment and if the trials of the Nazis is anything to go by - people being hanged. I would say that is a pretty optimistic political prediction of what will happen when the results of these crimes become unavoidable in the next decade or two - the flooding of cities, the collapse of food supplies, the bankruptcies of states. The pessimistic and probably more realistic prediction is that law and order will collapse and the elites and their families will be dragged out of their mansions and sliced up in the street.

To the corporate leader dedicated to the capitalist, market economy success story of the last 50 years, that attitude is no doubt incomprehensible and downright ungrateful.
But it is hardly surprising given continuing scandals and declining ethics across the corporate and banking worlds, driven by the pernicious impact of short-termism, rising inequality and undue political influence; in large part the outcome of the oxymoron of “pay-for-performance” remuneration. So how is trust regained? The need for stronger leadership, ethics, greater transparency, open communications and improved culture feature prominently in current responses. 
But a far more fundamental requirement is ignored, namely that business must lead on really critical issues, particularly the point raised long ago by economist Kenneth Boulding: “Anyone who considers economic growth can continue indefinitely in a finite system is either a madman or an economist”. The constraints Boulding anticipated have now arrived, as burgeoning population and economic growth crash into global biophysical limits which cannot be circumvented.
Those constraints, encompassing resource shortages, biodiversity loss and pollution in various guises, do not feature in the capitalist economic lexicon, as technology and the market are supposed to overcome all as we march toward the sunlit uplands of the neoliberal nirvana. In the real world, the entire growth model under which Australia and global economies operate, is no longer sustainable; it sowed the seeds of its own destruction some time ago and is rapidly driving itself into the ground as growth rates decline. This is the great “black elephant” of business and politics; a known, knowable fact that no one wants to acknowledge – the unmentionable in the recent Business and Governance Summits around the country, as our leaders strive to compound the problem with self-defeating subterfuges to maximise growth, not least corporate tax cuts and trade agreements.
To the community, these constraints are increasingly obvious as the quality of life for the average person deteriorates in myriad ways. The rhetoric of much-vaunted corporate social responsibility no longer holds water when our supposed leaders are not prepared to address the issues that really count for our survival, let alone prosperity. 
These range from basic considerations such as ensuring food and water availability, to the creation of genuinely sustainable global societies. However, the first priority must be human-induced climate change, manifest as the lack of an atmosphere into which we can continue dumping carbon pollution from the burning of fossil fuels, agriculture and deforestation, without causing catastrophic consequences. 
Climate change is accelerating far faster than expected, to the point where it now represents an existential threat to humanity, that is a threat posing permanent large negative consequences which will be irreversible, an outcome being locked in today by our insistence on expanding the use of fossil fuels. This should be a major concern in Australia given that we are more exposed than most, but instead our leaders would have us embark on massive fossil fuel expansion. Already one of the world’s largest carbon polluters when exports are included, Australia is complicit in destroying the conditions which make human life possible. There is no greater crime against humanity.
The economic and social impacts will be devastating unless that policy is rapidly reversed. The unprecedented hurricane season in the Atlantic, bushfires in the Californian winter, extreme heat in many parts of South Asia and rapid heating of the Arctic with associated instability in the northern hemisphere weather system, are only the most recent portents of what is to come. The worst outcomes can only be avoided now by emergency action, akin to restructuring economies on a war-footing.
It finally seems to be dawning on corporate and investor leadership that climate change is a real and present danger which is not going away.
Company directors are personally liable for failing to assess and act upon climate risk, but the greenwash continues. Major corporates parade their credentials in support of serious climate action, but none of their scenarios and policies are in line with the Paris objective of constraining global temperature increase “well below 2.0C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.50C”.
Fortunately, as understanding of the risks improves, regulatory pressure mounts. The recommendations triggered by Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, via the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) are gradually being taken up, with companies voluntarily disclosing the impact which a 2C policy framework would have on their organisation, assuming such a framework was ever put in place (by governments?). Progress, but reactive and certainly not leadership. The question that must be answered is: “what are you doing proactively as a company to create a 2C world” – more realistically closer to 1.5C, as it is now patently clear that 2C is far too high?
If business genuinely wishes to regain trust, it must proactively face up to the challenge posed by climate change and initiate emergency action. Beyond that, it must open up honest debate on a new economic model to replace conventional growth. It is the only way business will be sustainable in the 21st century with a real social licence to operate.
In Churchill’s words: “Sometimes we have to do what is required”.

The cyclone, which intensified to category 4, brought with it heavy rain and strong winds in excess of 70mph to communities along the Bay of Plenty and Gisborne as well as to the country’s capital, Auckland. It was the third big storm to strike the country this year.
Across the Atlantic, in the northern and eastern parts of the US, a second “nor’easter” as coined by American meteorologists, brought further strong winds and heavy snowfall along the east coast, affecting the states of New York, Pennsylvania and Maine last Thursday. 
A third winter storm is expected to strike during the coming days bringing strong winds and a mix of heavy rain and snowfall.
The anomalous warmth in the Arctic, which in part was responsible for the swath of exceptional cold that swept through Europe over the past few weeks, has done little to maintain the extent of the sea ice in the region, which should now be approaching its typical maximum limit.
As it stands, and within the satellite record, the sea ice extent recording seems to have put this winter within the top three for having the lowest ice extent. And there has been a reduction in the ice cover over the last three consecutive winters.

Not according to reverred climate scientists. Have you not followed what they say? According to the
original hockey stick graph (and most of those that followed), the first half of the 20th century experienced an unprecedented temperature rise (in scale and rate) for a 1000 years!
While minor CO2 influence cannot be ruled out, the IPPC demonstrates and concludes that the early 20th century warming can be fully explained by natural drivers (mainly the Sun). It is well accepted that early 20th century CO2 emissions were insufficient to be a major driver.
Thus, by an amazing coincidence, the 20th century experienced both an unprecendeted (in 1000 years) NATURAL warming AND unprecedented MANMADE warming, one after the other.

We as a species have been reducing the standing biosphere since pre industrial times ( chopped down the ancient forests and the rain forests and played a great part in desertification of north Africa). We use this land for other things now so vast swathes of the earth's surface being turned back into woodland is a none starter ( and is only a one off benefit for 100-200years anyway as trees die)The acidification of oceans can only go so far due to it being a reversible / equilibrium process dependent upon temperature. Also we started at a point of equilibrium in pre industrial times so any temporary sequestration of Co2 into seawater will change ( usually harm) the aquatic environment because of the pH alteration.Co2 cannot escape into space as the earth is a closed system ( apart from space junk)So every tonne of Co2 produced from fossilised carbon sources stays with us.So we either stop producing it or live with the consequences.

How about we begin implementing the scientific information in order to mitigate anthropogenic climate change. Contrary to some BBC guys rhetoric on the show hard talk whom stated "" scientists don't know what should be done "" ( about climate change) ""we"" ( The science of ecology, conservation biology etc) know very well what needs to be done. Climate change is a behavioural problem of humans with stone age psychologies trying to live in a modern technological age. Whilst these technologies ( combined with our use of them.i.e. behaviour) are the major contributers of climate change, so ate the alternative technologies like renewable fuels and energy efficiency.', u'recommendation_count': u'5', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1521245231000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'15713576', u'in_reply_to': u'113654797', u'id': u'113655800', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'evolution rhythm', u'text': u'""justice for citizens who did nothing to cause the problem other than drive to work and heat their homes when they had no other alternatives.""
Well. Whilst that statement may suit the readers it's not entirely accurate. The fossil fuels ""discredit the science"" campaign was ""successful"" ( and continues to be in large area's of the USA) because ""they"" had a audience ( the general public) whom were not that difficult to convince.
As a analogy , a sociopath is someone whom has little empathy for other people. However, they are also intelligent thus know how to manipulate people in order to get what they want. In other words, someone whom has more of a agreeable character can easily be fooled by these individuals. The "" truth "" doesn't matter to them in pursuit of their objectives ( quite often sexual conquests). 
Large industry has also been known to display sociopathic ""personality"" disorders. However, this combined group behaviour is excused as just "" business"" in the pursuit of money ( resources) in order to justify to society why it's acceptable. 
So, many players ( high management/political level) with close links to the fossil fuel industry will not suddenly ""wake up"" to the scientific evidence on anthropogenic climate change. As their primary objective is resource acquisition ( Inc power) thus are cognitively biased towards any information which upholds that agenda ( including having their own scientists on the payroll in order to attempt to skew the general scientific consensus). 
However, this cognitive dissonance goes far deeper than a few high level players in the fossil fuel industries and their associated buddies in governments. The average psychology of humans tends to be a ""glass half full"" subjective view ( a evolutionary strategy). Which has been another significant causal effect why the evidence on the predicted negative impacts on anthropogenic climate change hasn't yet particularly ""sunk"" into the average ( majority of the populations ) cognitive processes. 
Thus as ecosystems begin to unravel those whom have kept their heads in the sand will literally have no where left to hide ( flight). 
It's going to be a difficult future. However, better late then never. And whom knows the long term future.

Now time is running out | Richard Wiles,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/15/50-years-climate-change-denial,0,"Fifty years ago, the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) delivered a report titled Sources, Abundance, and Fate of Gaseous Atmospheric Polluters to the American Petroleum Institute (API), a trade association for the fossil fuel industry.
The report, unearthed by researchers at the Center for International Environmental Law, is one of the earliest attempts by the industry to grapple with the impacts of rising CO2 levels, which Stanford’s researchers warned if left unabated “could bring about climatic changes” like temperature increases, melting of ice caps and sea level rise. 
The year was 1968, and the term “global warming” would not appear in a peer-reviewed academic journal until 1975. Famed Nasa scientist James Hansen would not testify before Congress that “global warming has begun” for another 20 years. And the US would not enter into – only to later pull out of – the Paris climate accord for nearly half a century.
The anniversary of SRI’s report to the API on climate change represents not just a damning piece of evidence of what the fossil fuel industry knew and when, but a signal of all that we have lost over the decades of policy inaction and interference. It should also serve as a potent motivator in the fight for climate accountability and justice.
At the time, CO2 levels in the atmosphere stood about 323ppm. The planet was warming but was still well within the historical norm. Sea levels had risen by about 4in compared with 1880 levels. The report, however, cautioned that “man is now engaged in a vast geophysical experiment with his environment, the Earth” and that “significant temperature changes are almost certain to occur by the year 2000”.
Those predictions proved to be correct: by the turn of the century, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had risen to 369ppm, causing a temperature increase of nearly half a degree over pre-industrial averages. Today, virtually all climate scientists agree there is little or no chance the world can stay within the goal of 1.5C, the limit of what scientists believe to be safe.
With each decade of delay and denial the impacts and costs of climate change have continued to mount
Over the next 20 years, the scientific community and policymakers around the world began to reach a consensus on the threat posed by rising CO2 levels. Scientists at least one major oil company, Exxon, did their own climate modeling, which agreed with the scientific consensus. During this period a budding movement to cut emissions began.
To counter and slow down that effort to address climate change, the fossil fuel industry began its long and powerful strategy of climate denial and obstructionism. Even though they knew the science, they also realized that attempts to control emissions could seriously damage their bottom lines.
In 1998, as the first global attempt to rein in climate pollution, the Kyoto protocol, was headed to the Senate for ratification, API circulated what has come to be known as the Victory Memo, a detailed road map to undermining science and promoting denial of climate change. According to API’s top strategists: “Victory will be achieved when: those promoting the Kyoto treaty on the basis of extant science appear to be out of touch with reality.”
The memo’s end goal was clear: create doubt about science where none existed, deceive the media and Congress about the risks of climate change, and block the momentum that was building to address rising emissions through the Kyoto protocol, a precursor to the Paris accord. ExxonMobil alone would go on to spend upwards of $30m on ads, front groups, and pseudoscience intended to carry out the plan. That’s in addition to the cash that flooded the coffers of climate deniers in Congress who are rewarded amply for willful ignorance.
API’s strategic deception campaign was a success, which is why we now stand at the brink of the highest global temperature considered safe. Just what it will mean to cross that line remains an ongoing question for atmospheric scientists, but we’ve already started to get a glimpse and it doesn’t look good.
The damage is all around us, from hurricanes on steroids – scientists attribute 15-40% (8in-24in) of the epic rain of Hurricane Harvey to climate change – to California’s deadly wildfires which were set up by five years of drought, followed by record snowfall, then record heat that turned huge areas of the state into tinderboxes. In 2017 there were 16 separate billion-dollar disasters in the US, resulting in a total of $306bn of damages, nearly $100bn more than the second highest year 2005 (Katrina). While technically climate change did not “cause” these disasters, most of the carnage was aggravated in some way by climate change and the fossil fuel emissions that cause it in the first place.
Other impacts are more long-term and irreparable. Anyone born after 1985 has never experienced a month with average temperatures that fall below the historical norm and, without action, probably never will. Mass coral bleaching events due to warming waters and ocean acidification have rendered large swaths of some of the ocean’s most diverse ecosystems lifeless. The vanishing Arctic ice cap appears already to be affecting global weather patterns, and the loss of ice in Antarctica may have reached a tipping point that many now view as irreversible, a development that will require tough and costly decisions for coastal cities.
It never had to be this way. But with each decade of delay and denial the impacts and costs of climate change have continued to mount. Now taxpayers are left holding the bill for a literal rising tide of impacts that pose the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced. Meeting that challenge must begin with accountability on the part of climate polluters, and justice for citizens who did nothing to cause the problem other than drive to work and heat their homes when they had no other alternatives.
We can’t turn back the clock, but we can turn off the fossil fuel firehose that’s been pumping CO2 into our atmosphere and demand that those who left it running help foot the bill for the cleanup. Already we’ve seen cities like New York, San Francisco, and other coastal cities file lawsuits against climate polluters, seeking to recover costs associated with planning for and adapting to a warming world. With massive costs facing hundreds more cities and no remedy in sight, more litigation will follow.
Making up for 50 years of delay and denial will not be easy, nor will it be cheap. But taxpayers should not have to shoulder the burden alone. The API and its climate polluters knowingly and deliberately caused this mess. They must help pay to clean it up.

First, to say “we” or “human activity” is responsible for biodiversity loss sidesteps the more serious challenge of identifying the specific socio-cultural, and, more centrally, economic drivers of destruction. Second, to slip easily from population rises to industrial development, housing and farming as the causes of the destruction of wild areas evades critical questions about what sort of industry, producing what sort of consumer goods and what kind of farming and food distribution system – let alone questions as to who has the power to decide and who gets to consume and who doesn’t.
Proposing remedies such as commercial big game hunting and “sustainable” tourism misses the central point of the article’s analysis: while loss of iconic big mammals is dreadful, the future of humanity and of life itself is threatened by deeper, wider and less visible processes such as the vast scale of loss of invertebrate species and populations, soil microorganisms and oceanic flora. The drastic declines in biodiversity not only compete with climate change for importance, but are intertwined with it and with the other processes of environmental degradation which together constitute a multi-dimensional crisis in the relationship between the dynamics of our global economy and society and the earth that sustains us. As to “natural capital”, this approach is well meant but risks of capitulating to the language and values of the very economic forces that are the most powerful drivers of destruction. Popular pressure and inter-governmental cooperation to restrain these forces by such measures as planning and regulation are urgently needed. In the longer term, only deep economic and social transformations give us any hope of a liveable and genuinely sustainable world.

The breaches came despite big emitters being granted generous carbon limits, in many cases above their highest previous pollution levels.
They were revealed in the first batch of emissions data released under the Coalition’s “safeguard mechanism”, part of the Direct Action climate policy introduced by carbon pricing opponent Tony Abbott.
Labor and industry body the Carbon Market Institute both said the use of Australian carbon credit units – mostly created through land-use based greenhouse gas reduction projects – was evidence the country had a carbon market despite the government claiming otherwise.
The opposition climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said businesses were now trading credits at prices the Coalition had claimed would wreck the economy under Labor. He said it showed the hypocrisy and ineffectiveness of the government’s approach to climate change.
“The Turnbull government should stop trying to mislead the Australian people and their own backbench,” he said. “[It should] admit that carbon pricing and trading is not only needed to take effective action on climate change, but their ineffective climate change policy also includes carbon trading.”
The Labor-Greens carbon price for all big emitters was $24.15 a tonne when the scheme was repealed and replaced by Direct Action under then prime minister Abbott in 2014. The price had been expected to fall to less than $10 a tonne the following year when international carbon trading began.
Comparatively few credits – about 448,000 – were bought last year under the safeguard mechanism, mostly for $14-$15 a tonne, suggesting a total cost to business of more than $6m.
The majority of the 154 emitters covered by the safeguard mechanism emitted less than their limit, known as a baseline, allowed last financial year. The biggest purchases of credits were by miners Anglo Coal (133,104 tonnes worth at the Capcoal mine in Queensland), Glencore (81,851 tonnes at the Tahmoor coalmine in NSW) and Rio Tinto (68,305 at the Alcan Gove bauxite mine in Arnhem Land).
The environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, did not directly address whether Australia had a carbon market. He said the safeguard mechanism was developed through consultation with a broad cross-section of industry, and provided flexible options for businesses to comply.
He said Labor had introduced a carbon tax that hit households and businesses, and was now promising a deep cut in emissions by 2030 without backing it up with a plan or costings. “In contrast, the government’s approach is to address climate change with policies that ensure we have an affordable and reliable energy system and competitive industries,” Frydenberg said.
Butler said the ALP supported the further development of carbon markets. 
The safeguard mechanism was promised to ensure cuts paid for using the main part of Direct Action – the $2.55bn emission reduction fund – were not undone by emissions increasing in other parts of the economy.
Government agency the Clean Energy Regulator sets an emissions limit for each large industrial site based on its highest level of emissions over the previous five years. But companies can apply to have the limit recalculated.
Consultants RepuTex last month found 57 industrial sites had been allowed increased baselines beyond previous emissions levels, prompting claims the safeguard mechanism was pointless. The new data shows eight of these operations breached their increased baseline.
The government is now considering making the safeguard mechanism less tied to historic emissions. A climate policy review released in December suggested emission limits could be loosened so they “increase with production, supporting business growth”.
The Greens climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, said most companies were compliant under the safeguard mechanism only because the system was broken – baselines were either too high to begin with or businesses had been granted higher baselines to avoid breaches.
“When you’ve got a pollution reduction policy that doesn’t reduce pollution, it’s time to start over,” he said.
Environment department data shows national emissions have risen each year since 2014. Under their current trajectory, the department projects emissions would be about 2% higher in 2030 than in 2005. The government’s target is a 26% to 28% cut over that time frame; Labor has proposed a 45% cut.
The Carbon Market Institute chief executive, Peter Castellas, said the safeguard mechanism data showed Australia clearly had a functioning carbon market that had been able to meet the demand of businesses that required credits.
It is understood most credits purchased were from surplus emissions cuts by companies that had won contracts under the emissions reduction. The carbon price spiked to as high as $18 a tonne – well beyond the average $11.90 under the emissions reduction fund – due to limited supply.
Castellas said industry had not been expected to breach the safeguard mechanism. Its operation augured well for a time when the demand for carbon credits increased.
“Safeguard mechanism baselines will inevitably have to decline if we are to meet below business as usual emissions required under Australia’s Paris agreement commitments,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/17/offsets-for-emissions-breaches-prove-australia-has-a-carbon-market-labor-says

This Guardian article is about a Nature comment. I am one of the authors of the Nature comment, and I suggest that people read it. It isn’t very long, and might clear up some of the confusion. 
I want to clarify a few things now. I don’t plan to get into a debate here, everyone is welcome to their opinion, but I do want to avoid misunderstandings. This is my personal response – I am not representing my co-authors here.
We didn’t at any point in the comment suggest building a wall as a direct physical obstacle to hold back a glacier.
The Nature comment is edited but not peer-reviewed. This is because it presents ideas and opinions rather than scientific results. I think that it is worth carrying out further scientific studies to investigate the viability of these polar geo-engineering projects (indeed such research is already underway), and such studies WILL be peer reviewed before publication. The peer review process is not a 100% guarantee of accuracy but it certainly helps.
I don’t want to see these projects implemented. I would rather see hard mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. I am glad to see that a lot of posters here want the same thing. But if such mitigation cannot be implemented (and this is the responsibility of policy makers not just scientists) then targeted geoengineering may be the lesser of two (or more) evils while emissions are brought down more gradually. I do not think that any kind of geoengineering should be viewed as a long term solution to human-induced climate change. I don’t know anyone who does.
We did not calculate the CO2 costs of the projects suggested in this Nature comment. Much research is needed before a decision can be made on any of these projects, including both scientific and engineering viability. Assessment of the CO2 impact of the project is one important aspect of this.

Over the last 2.6 million years largest scale advances and retreats of glaciers (glacial and interglacial periods) have occurred over 10,000s of years in response to orbital and axial oscillations or cycles. The last such major retreat occurrred between 19,000 and 9,000 years ago in response to a Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation (NHHLSI) peak which provoked the oxidation of carbon rich ocean sediments in the Southern Ocean causing global greenhouse warming. Natural processes are defined as those independent of human agency. As there was no human agency in the oxidation of those Southern Ocean sediments, the global greenhouse warming from 19,000 to 9,000 years ago was natural.
This natural deglacial warming resulted in a world at 9,000 ybp warmer than preindustrial centuries of the last millennium. This world stayed warm for another 4,000 years, then temperatures declined as NHHLSI declined resulting in the expansion of glaciers in recent millennia up until last century.
The very rapid warming and consequent current retreat of glaciers is caused by CO2 from the oxidation of coal and other fossil fuels by combustion which has involved human agency and is therefore not natural.
Many glaciers in retreat have revealed tree stumps of earlier forestation, screeds"" (screes) ""where they terminated in earlier times, and in a few cases human settlements"".

""Sea level is not rising any faster than it was before according to tidal gauges.""
Sea level was stable from 200 BC to 1000 AD, then rose at an average rate of 0.6 mm per year up to 1400 AD. It was stable again from 1400 AD to the late 19th century since then rose 210 mm from 1880 to 2009.
See Church and White (2011) ""Sea Level Rise from the Late 19th to Early 21st Century"" Surveys in Geophysics Volume 32 Issue 4-5 pp 585-602 September.
Note Figure 5 which shows the global mean sea level rise from the late 19th century to 2009.

This hugely wrong figure was then divided by the student numbers and derived a low resident to student population. When the correct resident population was used Canterbury went from the lowest ration to far and away the highest which is a generally well known fact.I personally discovered the source of his error and emailed him to have it corrected.

Raw data have to be adjusted for biases. Karl et al. (2015) is in fact a good example. It corrected the discrepancy between the old way of measuring ocean temperatures (engine room intakes) and the more recent data from buoys. This was important because the two methods give slightly different results.
Despite misinformed claims to the contrary, raw temperature data and adjustment methodologies are freely available, so anyone disputing the process can point out flaws in the statistical procedures or produce their own analysis. But they never do. 
In any event, the adjustments to the raw data are not actually very large, and you may be surprised to learn that over the long term they in fact decrease the total amount of warming.
This is a very useful short article on the subject, written by a scientist who contributed to a study with similar findings to Karl et al.

The controversial proposals include underwater walls, artificial islands and huge pumping stations that would channel cold water into the bases of glaciers to stop them from melting and sliding into the sea.
The researchers say the work – costing tens of billions of dollars a time – is urgently needed to prevent polar glaciers melting and raising sea levels. That would lead to major inundations of low-lying, densely populated areas, such as parts of Bangladesh, Japan and the Netherlands.
Flooding in these areas is likely to cost tens of trillions of dollars a year if global warming continues at its present rate, and vast sea-wall defences will need to be built to limit the devastation. Such costs make glacier engineering in polar regions a competitive alternative, according to the team, which is led by John Moore, professor of climate change at the University of Lapland.
“We think that geoengineering of glaciers could delay much of Greenland and Antarctica’s grounded ice from reaching the sea for centuries, buying time to address global warming,” the scientists write in the current issue of Nature. “Geoengineering of glaciers has received little attention in journals. Most people assume that it is unfeasible and environmentally undesirable. We disagree.”
Ideas put forward by the group specifically target the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctic because these will contribute more to sea rise this century than any other source, they say. Their proposals include:
• Building a 100-metre high wall on the seabed across a 5km wide fjord at the end of the Jakobshavn glacier in western Greenland. This would reduce influxes of warming sea water which are eroding the glacier’s base;
• Constructing artificial islands in front of glaciers in Antarctica in order to buttress them and limit their collapse as their ice melts due to global warming;
• Circulating cooled brine underneath glaciers such as the Pine Island glacier in Antarctica – in order to prevent their bases from melting and sliding towards the sea.
In each case, the team – which includes scientists in Finland and the US – acknowledges that costs would be in the billions. Construction is also likely to cause considerable disruption. For example, building a dam across the Jakobshavn fjord could affect ecology, fisheries and tourism, and large numbers of workers would have to be shipped in to complete the project.
Similarly, building artificial islands in front of glaciers would mean importing about six cubic kilometres of material, a task that would be immensely difficult in stormy Antarctic waters. And drilling through ice that is kilometres thick to pump down cooled water would also stretch the capabilities of engineers.
However, the team insists that such projects should be carefully assessed now as the likely costs appear to be compatible with those of other large energy and civil engineering works being planned across the globe. The issue is simple, they state: should we spend vast sums to wall off all the world’s coasts, or can we address the problem at its source?
“Potential risks, especially to local ecosystems, need careful analysis,” they conclude. “In our view, however, the greatest risk is doing nothing.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/18/billion-dollar-polar-geoengineering-to-slow-melting-glaciers-global-flooding

The Green Alliance said a more ambitious deadline of 2030 is also needed to avoid the UK squandering its leadership on electric cars.
While the number of electric cars being sold in the UK has rocketed in the past four years, Germany overtook the UK last year in its rise in the registrations of new plug-in hybrids and 100% battery-powered cars. A 2030 ban on combustion engine models would boost sales of electrified cars in the UK and even raise the prospect of the country becoming an net vehicle exporter, the Green Alliance said.
While the UK lags behind Germany on conventional car manufacturing, a fifth of the electric cars sold in Europe in 2016 were made at Nissan’s Sunderland plant in north-east England. BMW has pledged to make its electric Mini at its plant in Oxford, but UK-headquartered Jaguar Land Rover chose to build its first flagship electric car, the i-Pace, in Austria.
Dustin Benton, policy director at Green Alliance, said: “The government’s recent industrial strategy cites clean growth as one of the biggest economic opportunities for the UK, but if we keep building and buying dirty cars we’ll miss the growth opportunity of the century.”
The transport sector overtook energy in 2016 as the UK’s single biggest source of carbon emissions, as power generation has switched away from coal and towards renewables.
Carbon emissions from the average new car also rose last year for the first time in nearly two decades, as drivers opted for bigger models.
The Green Alliance found that an earlier phase-out for new diesels and petrol cars would affect the looming gap in the UK’s legally binding 2030 climate target. A 2030 deadline would cut the gap by 85%, or 98 million tonnes CO2e.
Sticking with a 2040 date would also lead to fossil-fuelled cars causing air pollution until the second half of the century, the thinktank said, given the average UK car is scrapped after 14 years. Four committees of MPs last week warned that air pollution is a “national health emergency” and called on the government to take tougher action.
Earlier action would also ease the UK’s reliance on oil imports at a time when oil and gas production from the North Sea is declining. Imports would be cut by nearly 50% by 2035, saving up to an estimated £6.63bn each year, the thinktank said.
While ministers last summer followed France by pledging to halt new petrol and diesel car sales by 2040, other countries are looking to ban them years earlier. Scotland is aiming for 2032, India wants to only sell electric models by 2030 and Norway, the world leader on the take-up of battery-powered cars, has set a 2025 deadline.
The Green Alliance said the government could take several other measures to sustain the UK’s leadership on electric cars, including public procurement. A grant of up to £4,500 to buyers of electric cars should also be extended, the group said, and government could further help by setting manufacturers sales targets for electric cars, starting at 15% of all cars sold in 2022 and rising to 45% by 2025.
The car industry body, the SMMT, said outright bans on petrol and diesels risked harming the new car market, and the sector could be undermined if not given enough time to adjust.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/18/uk-should-bring-2040-petrol-and-diesel-car-ban-forward-2030-green-alliance

More than 140 million people in just three regions of the developing world are likely to migrate within their native countries between now and 2050, the first report on the subject has found. 
The World Bank examined three regions, which between them account for 55% of the developing world’s population. In sub-Saharan Africa, 86 million are expected to be internally displaced over the period; in south Asia, about 40 million; and in Latin America, 17 million.
Such flows of people could cause enormous disruption, threatening governance and economic and social development, but the World Bank cautioned that it was still possible to stave off the worst effects.
“Climate change-driven migration will be a reality, but it does not need to be a crisis, provided we take action now and act boldly,” said John Roome, a senior director for climate change at the World Bank group.
He laid out three key actions governments should take: first, to accelerate their reductions of greenhouse gases; second, for national governments to incorporate climate change migration into their national development planning; and third, to invest in further data and analysis for use in planning development.
Within countries, the effects of climate change will create multiple “hotspots”: made up of the areas people move away from in large numbers, and the areas they move to.
“Local planners need to make sure the resources are made available, and to make sure it takes place in a comprehensive and coordinated manner,” said Roome.
Globally, many tens of millions more are expected to be similarly affected, creating huge problems for national and local governments. Nearly 3% of the population was judged likely to move owing to climate change in the areas studied – a proportion that might be repeated elsewhere.
Migration between countries has previously taken the spotlight, with its potential for cross-border conflicts, but internal migration may cause as much disruption, putting pressure on infrastructure, jobs, food and water resources.
The 140 million figure extrapolates from current trends, but could be reduced if changes are made. If economic development is made more inclusive, for instance through better education and infrastructure, internal migration across the three regions could drop to between 65 million and 105 million, according to the report. If strong action is taken on greenhouse gas emissions, as few as 30 million to 70 million may migrate.
Climate change is likely to most affect the poorest and most vulnerable, making agriculture difficult or even impossible across large swaths of the globe, threatening water resources and increasing the likelihood of floods, droughts and heatwaves in some areas. Sea level rises and violent storm surges are also likely to hit low-lying coastal areas, such as in Bangladesh.
Kristalina Georgieva, the chief executive of the World Bank, in her introduction to the report published on Monday, said: “There is growing recognition among researchers that more people will move within national borders to escape the effects of slow-onset climate change, such as droughts, crop failure and rising seas. 
“The number of climate migrants could be reduced by tens of millions as a result of global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and with far-sighted development planning. There is an opportunity now to plan and act for emerging climate change threats.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/19/climate-change-soon-to-cause-mass-movement-world-bank-warns

The instability is attributed to changes in the power generation mix, with thermal, synchronous generators leaving the system in favour of more renewable capacity, which can leave the grid at the mercy of the weather.
The new assessment from the AEMC released on Tuesday comes as the Turnbull government’s prospects of securing agreement for its national energy guarantee have improved courtesy of Jay Weatherill’s departure as the South Australian premier after Saturday’s state election.
Weatherill led the resistance at the state level to the Turnbull proposal, which is supposed to address some of the problems in Australia’s electricity network by imposing new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020.
The Energy Security Board is currently leading consultations with a range of stakeholders about the design of the policy, which will be considered next by federal and state energy ministers on 20 April.
While the Turnbull government has proposed the national energy guarantee as a mechanism to end the decade-long climate wars, the proposal remains contentious with stakeholders, including environment groups and analysts who argue it won’t deliver the scale of emissions reductions to ensure Australia conforms with our commitments under the Paris agreement.
New modelling from market analysts Reputex released on Monday also suggests the Turnbull government’s emissions reduction target for the electricity sector will be met thanks to state renewable energy targets – effectively rendering the federal proposal redundant in climate terms.
The AEMC has meanwhile released new reports taking stock of the reliability of the electricity system. It says system security issues have arisen as a consequence of less synchronous generation in the system and changes in the way generating units are being operated.
It says there has been a reduction in primary frequency control and associated degradation of the frequency distribution – which has implications across the grid.
The report notes that “over the last few years there has been a decreasing level of system inertia due to the withdrawal of synchronous thermal generation and increased penetration of non-synchronous generation” – a development that can “result in the failure of load or generation”.
The report says there were 11 incidents in 2016-17, including the statewide power blackout in South Australia. 
It says the frequency operating standard was met for the mainland over the course of the year but the frequency operating standard was not met for Tasmania for seven months of the 2016/17 financial year.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/20/energy-market-commission-says-electricity-grid-increasingly-unstable

Much discussion seems to focus on the deniers.

But it claims it is a problem that can just be managed away at some future date. (Which it almost certainly can't.) In that sense, managerialism is a greater barrier to action now, because it is an excuse for the corporate world to carry on business as usual.

The above describes 'lag' or 'latency'.
Now imagine the climate system, where there is anything from 20 - 50 years lag between EMISSIONS and WARMING. Fact. The climate response we've seen, the warming we've seen, is as a response to emissions from the last couple of hundred years up to about 50 years ago. Or, if we're very lucky, only 20 years ago.
But over the last 50 years and certainly over the last 20 years emissions haven't crashed to barely anything. They're risen inexorably over the timeframe. 
So, if the record temperatures we've seen are as a response to historic emissions and not to what we've put into the atmosphere over the last few decades, and if as a result of those historic emissions the arctic is mush, we're seeing sea levels rising, the seas are acidified, there is increased flooding, huge increase in drought and wildfire, appalling bleaching of coral reefs and ever more catastrophic hurricanes - but that's all without what we've put into the atmosphere over the last few decades, what kind of state do you think the climate will be in in 50 years' time? Given the feedback systems? 
(Feedback systems being one thing that triggers another, as in, as the oceans warm, metahne is released from the deep seat bed, which createws further warming, which releases more methane, in a cycle which gradually intensified and speeds up.And there are many others.
A few years ago in India temperatures rose so high (over 40C degrees) that people could not touch surfaces without blistering their hands. You took so calmly about 'adaption', 'coping', 'resilience'. But what about when temperatures reach 50C in India - ? The population won't survive that. Higher still and people will boil alive if they go outside.
These temperature rises are not survivable. 
The mistake you're making, as so many do, is to imagine that global warming is linear and will increase ever so gradually and gently over several decades. That gradually the temperatures will rise, like a barometer in the summer as the day advances in to the afternoon from the cooler morning. That is slightly what is happening now, today, NOW. But when the trigger points are reached, and warming goes out of control, and the exponential effect kicks in, temperatures will soar. Very very fast. Who knows how fast? If you think back to Sunday, when temperatures were minus 0 across the country, but by the next day were several degrees warmer - who's to say that a rise from 40C to 50C to 60C or higher won't happen almost overnight? I hope it doesn't, but who's to say it won't?

But you're completely missing the point. You're shutting down the science and instead defaulting to talking about my emotional state. As if it's all down to my pessimism rather than the science. Putting it down to 'pessimism' is neither here nor there.

BQEND
But, begging your pardon, this is ridiculous. You can't compare the cliamte system and atmosphere to your knowledge of computers. I know about computers, too. I have written software in the past, too. What's know about system design in computers got to do with it? I could talk about my intricate knowledge of the m mechanics of vacuum clceaners, or jet engines, or suspension bridges and it still won't have a damned thing to do with the climate system. I wouldn't rest on your laurels in that regard, if I were you.
As for the internet system design, again, that's totally irrelevant. The climate isn't a series of zeros and ones. It's a vast, interconnected, planetary climate system taking in the oceans and the air and plant life and trapped methane and CO2 emissions - it's not a linear system, it doesn't rely on linear calculations (which computer calculations are).
Global warming is not a lineart system. Warming an exponential system. The warmer it gets, the more quickly it will get hotter still. As you can infer directly from this article, if you understand what you're reading. (That is not meant to be rude.)

my understanding of these systems gives me hope that we will lose far less than you might think.

Oh but excuse me, gpwayne. I'm not a climate scientist. It's not what I think. You mistunderstand me completely. It's about what the world's climate scientists 'think'. And actually it isn't about what people 'think' or 'believe'. It's about hard science, facts, not 'thinking' things and 'believing' things. 
Fact. Your idea of resilience is essentially - and forgive me for saying so, again, I'm not trying to be rude - male arrogance. Your idea is that you can do anything, solve anything, you have the technical ability. Because you think you do.
But you don't. Because, as I've said a trillion times on this site, please tell me how, last summer, you could have used your male expertise to stop one of the Atlantic hurricanes in its tracks. Or stop a tsunami. Or stop a wildfire.
Temperatures will soar with global warming and the more they soar the faster they will soar, because of all the feedback mechanisms in place. Computer systems, the internet, do not have exponential qualities and they do not have feedback systems in the way the climate system does. They are linear systems, producing a result at the end of a string of noughts and ones. Even if the strings are millions of characters long, they are still linear systems.

The grief of thousands of years of human history which will be lost to the waves, the drought, the fire, knocks my brain about.
BQEND
I don't share this particular aspect of your pessimism. I do believe that we humans are in for a terrible time collectively, and a great deal of innocent flora and fauna will be collateral damage. But I have worked for 35 years in IT related industries, and my understanding of these systems gives me hope that we will lose far less than you might think.
My reasoning is based on the original designs for a resilient network system, designed by ARPA to mitigate against the disruption to communications brought about by nuclear war. The idea was to provide many redundant centres through which information could travel and be stored - what we now call the internet.
It is this remarkable resilience that leads me to believe the culture that you and I so value will survive, because our knowledge - science, the arts, technology - is stored in so many places that it's probably impossible to eliminate it all. Our achievements may well survive, even though very few of us will be around to benefit from it.
Anyway, that's my opinion - and I'm sticking to it (not that it does me a lot of good, but it's better than nothing).', u'recommendation_count': u'6', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1521620831000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u""our knowledge science is stored in so many places that it 's probably impossible to eliminate it all"", u'effect': u'the culture that you and i so value will survive'}], u'author_id': u'2947466', u'in_reply_to': u'113796573', u'id': u'113823140', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'DennisHorne', u'text': u'There is a problem now and it's going to get much worse.

Note first of all that I started my comment by enumerating ""The principle greenhouse gases contributing to climate change..."" - of which CO2 is the most prevalent. I then pointed out that water vapour does not ""contribute to climate change"" which is why I left it out of the list of contributory causes.
Put in scientific terms, I'm talking about forcings - sources of energy that induce change. Increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases like CO2 and methane trap additional energy in the environment. Water vapour does not - there can be no increase in water vapour in advance of temperature rises, only afterwards. Water vapour is uneven in distribution, unlike CO2e gases; cold places are very dry, hot places very humid, and neither effect can be considered 'global'.
Water vapour also cannot be described as anthropogenic; we do not emit, directly cause or increase water vapour (except in very small local events like power station cooling towers). 
So - CO2, methane et. al. cause global warming.

This is sort-of built in to the system. Most (UK) politicians understand that there is a serious problem, but their constituents are not writing them letters about climate change - they are writing about all sorts of other stuff. That makes it very difficult for said politicians to be at all 'radical' (actually just 'sensible'). They generally feel that they have no mandate.

We use nets that are 20 miles long. We use longlines that have one million or two million hooks. 
And we trawl, which means to take something the size of a tractor trailer truck that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds, put it on a big chain, and drag it across the sea floor to stir up the bottom and catch the fish. 
Think of it as being kind of the bulldozing of a city or of a forest, because it clears it away. And the habitat destruction is unbelievable. 
This is a photograph, a typical photograph, of what the continental shelves of the world look like. You can see the rows in the bottom, the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn. 
What that was, was a forest of sponges and coral, which is a critical habitat for the development of fish.

Here, in the Guardian, there is article after article quoting someone saying that emissions must be reduced, brought under control, by this date or that.
But, the latency in the system means the atmosphere hasn't even responded yet to emissions from decades ago. It makes no sense to pretend that stopping NOW will do a damned thing. It won't.
I was thinking about this recently, trying to work my way painfully to an answer. One option - ignorance. Politicians don't know. But, they have had so many briefings, scientists have given talks, with data, with slides, with presentations, at Westminster and elsewhere for literally decades, explaining carefully how the science works. So they can't not know - can they?
And yet, a few months ago I was at an event and met my local MP and mentioned this latency problem and she stared at me and said, oh, really, I didn't know that, is that so? As if she'd never heard of it. As if she too believed that if everyone within the borough 'cut back' today that would be a contributing to 'halting climate change'.
So then I thought, OK, they do all know, or most of them know, but they're all specialists in different fields, as politicians, they all have their briefs, so they simply put the information into a different compartment in theirminds, file it away, think it's for other people to deal with. Yet, the vast majority of politicains will have partners, families, children - and they're not shit scared?
I'm demented with fear and I don't even have kids.
I'm so long past the terrible grief of climate change. There was a time when I couldn't cope. When I thought of what the world will lose. Not just people, not just scientific knowledge, not just the natural world, but the inspiration of great minds, great composers, writers, architects, philosophers, dancers, artists, photographers, thinkers, entertainers. I find the thought of all human progress being chucked away deeply distressing.
Now, I don't shrug, far from it, but I've practised for a very long time now acceptance, or, more accurately, resignation. Nothing is being done, properly, businesses are still pouring noxious fumes into the air, emissions are pretty much the same, and for decades despite knowledge of what was going on hardly anything has been done and what there is is vastly too little vastly too late. It's obvious there is no hope. We are in a planetary emergency, there will be a mass wipeout of life on earth and give the timeframe of the emissions and the rapid warming, the earth will probably end up as a ball of fire in the sky, as Stephen Hawkings said. I think he's right. Earth will become another Venus.
So - and I've asked this question again and again - how is it that given the reality of the science, that this newspaper, which is not a stupid paper, and others, cheerfully allow articles to be published referring to 'in 50 years' time' and talk about the impact of cuts in X decades time, or this generation ofyoung people 'when they retire' - or anything at all, as if the world is going to continue as it is?
Is it lack of knowledge? - surely not. Is it that while the planet heats up people are just inclined to look after their own interests, make their money, create their product (this newspaper), shutting their eyes to reality?
Or is it this. Is it that the 'don't frighten the horses' approach to the reality of climate change and the impending apocalypse is very political indeed; it's simply a case of those who could inform the public, deliberately not informing the public, so as to keep the hysteria and terror at bay, so as to maintain public order.
Because, frankly, if people really understood, wouldn't there be protests around the world every day of the week, every hour, people standing in groups shouting and calling out for action? And, had people known, properly, wouldn't there have been such protests for at least the last 20 years? I think there would have been. 
But, fact, the truth is not acknowledged, the public is not told and the BBC still drags out its climate deniers for 'balance' and Nigel Lawson still comes out with his crap and there is no court action forcing misinformation to be illegal.
I think the lack of honest reporting on what is about to happen must be public order control. Mustn't it?

Global warming is real. But the effects are not acute yet. We can't crash the economy in a panicked response. That would make things worse and hurt very large numbers of people.As the problem develops, technological solutions will emerge.Demand for products and services that fix the problem will emerge.The market will meet that demand.Governmental policy will shift to facilitate effective responses.Resources will be adjusted to support this.This will direct science and technology to deliver the necessary technological fixes.There is sufficient know how and flexibility in the system to solve the problem over a realistic timescale.

This first link is a lecture from the distinguished Roger Revelle (b. 1909) who give a lecture on AGW back in 1980. 
This is a man who was fundamental to the first International Geophysical Year in 1958 - where international research on global changes first was organised. He was instrumental to the Mona Loa facility (aka the Keeling Curve) and he and Suess discussed ocean carbon buffering in the 1950's. 
In this lecture he talks about everything. The basic physics of AGW - effects (such as rainfall) the ecological problem of plant migration - and even genetic modification of plants to allow them to adapt to new seasonal and diurnal cycles, effect on global ocean and atmospheric patterns, chance for ice melt-down, human migration, renewable energy - the list goes on). The lecture is peppered by the use of ""uncertainty"" - as it lays out what science since 1980 has been preoccupied narrowing down and understand with greater detail and more confidence.

If one see this 40 year old lecture one is well informed about what science knows somewhat better today. Because at principal levels of understanding - this lecture is spot on.

Senator Dave Durenberger, the Minnesota Republican who heads the subcommittee, said: ''One of the frustrations of dealing with this issue is that it is virtually beyond the grasp of human imagination. Despite what the best scientific minds in the world tell us, our instinct is to reject them out of hand.''

Sen. Durenberger was very right - together with the best scientific minds of the time - as was the general outline the scientists gave based on skatchy data, coarse models but deep understanding of the physical principles that governs this planet. 
And since then, physics has become a Chinese Hoax in the time of ""alternative facts"" - after the global temperature has gone up around 0.7 C since the lecture was given - being around 2/3rds of the global heating since the 19th century. 
In perspective - a scientist publishing her first paper on climate change in 1980 is likely retired or close to retired now. 
Since Revelles talk - there has not been a single year where temperature was as cold as the 20th century average. A human born after 1976 did never experience how it is to live on a planet as cold the 20th century average temperature.

Although Australia doesn’t currently count carbon released from damaged seagrass meadows in its official greenhouse gas emissions, if it did, the results mean those figures might need to be revised upwards by more than 20%.
Seagrass is a flowering grass-like plant that grows in shallow waters. It gathers carbon dissolved in the sea and buries it below the surface, often storing similar amounts of carbon in the top metre of sediment as is stored in tropical forests.
But unlike forests that store carbon for about 60 years before releasing much of it, seagrass meadows often store the carbon for thousands of years until they are disturbed. That process is thought to offset up to 2% of humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions.
Recent studies have shown that when the top layer of actively growing seagrass is disturbed – either by local impacts such as boat anchors or climatic impacts like heatwaves – the carbon that has been sequestered over thousands of years can be quickly released.
Since the start of the 20th century, seagrass meadows worldwide have declined at an average rate of 0.9% per year, mostly due to direct human impacts such as coastal development and water quality degradation. Over the last century about 29% of global seagrass has been destroyed and it is estimated it is releasing carbon at a rate similar to the emissions of Australia and the UK combined.
Oscar Serrano and colleagues from Edith Cowan University in Western Australia examined how much carbon was released when the world’s largest collection of seagrass meadows at Shark Bay were damaged by a marine heatwave in 2010 and 2011. Between 0.6% and 2.4% of the world’s seagrass coverage exists in that one location, where it has been growing for about 8,000 years.
“Despite seagrasses having thrived over millennia in Shark Bay, unprecedented widespread losses occurred in the austral summer of 2010/2011,” the authors wrote in their paper published in Nature Climate Change.
The stored carbon is released when the dead seagrass allows oxygen to penetrate the layers of dead seagrass, changing the bacteria that live in it. Estimates vary as to how much oxygen can penetrate the dead seagrass, and therefore how much carbon is released after a disturbance.
The researchers found 22% of the seagrass in Shark Bay was lost after the heatwave, compared with a 2002 baseline. Depending on how much oxygen that allowed to penetrate the layers of dead seagrass, the researchers found that caused the release of between 2m and 9m tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent, in just the three years following the heatwave.
They found that if the seagrass loss was counted in Australia’s national emissions accounting in that period, it would have boosted Australia’s emissions from land-use change by between 4% and 21%.
“It’s a carbon bomb,” said Gary Kendrick, a co-author on the paper from the University of Western Australia. “And it’s one that has gone off without documentation.
“If we’re not counting this carbon, then we’re underestimating our footprint.”
Since seagrass meadows can take decades to repair, the researchers said the damage from the heatwave could cause up to 21m tonnes of CO2 to be released over the following 40 years.
Serrano said the damaged seagrass has a double-whammy impact on emissions.
“So when you have an event such as the losses at Shark Bay, you not only lose the seagrass as a way of removing CO2, but the sequestered gas is released back into the atmosphere during seagrass matter decomposition,” said Serrano.
The researchers said local impacts such as inappropriate tourism and fishing could be managed to protect the loss of seagrass, but protecting them against climate change may require more radical interventions.
They suggested manually sowing seeds or transplanting seedlings as options that should be considered, since encouraging faster recovering would limit the amount of carbon lost after the disturbance.
They also said more controversial options – such as transplanting more resilient species not native to the area – might also need to be considered.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/20/marine-heatwave-set-off-carbon-bomb-in-worlds-largest-seagrass-meadow

Global moves to tackle climate change through lawsuits are poised to break new ground this week, as groups and individuals seek to hold governments and companies accountable for the damage they are causing.
On Tuesday, action by 12 UK citizens reaches the high court for the first time, while on Wednesday in San Francisco, the science of climate change will effectively be on trial at a key moment in a lawsuit.
The litigation represents a new front of climate action, with citizens aiming to force stronger moves to cut carbon emissions, and win damages to pay the costs of dealing with the impacts of warming. 
Climate litigation is a ​new weapon for environmentalists who are turning to the courts in an attempt to hold governments and corporations to account for the environmental damage they cause. Advocates aim to use the law to force stronger government action to cut carbon emissions, and win damages from the companies responsible to cover the costs of dealing with the impacts of warming.
There are hundreds of cases in the pipeline around the globe from India to Uganda; Ireland to Norway, where campaigners are seeking to block oil drilling in the Arctic. The UK government is facing its first major brought by 12 citizens through a legal group called Plan B and which already has the support of the government’s former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir David King. But it is in the US, the world’s most litigious nation, that the greatest number of cases have been brought, with Arnold Schwarzenegger the latest to confirm he was preparing a lawsuit.
To date victories are rare​, but campaigners say wins are more likely in future, as public opinion – and the attitudes of judges – shift with the times. A flurry of billion-dollar cases against fossil fuel companies brought by New York city and communities in California over the rising seas has already pushed climate litigation into the limelight. But big oil is fighting back hard, with allegations of a politically motivated conspiracy against them. 
They are inspired by momentous cases from the past, from the defeat of big tobacco to the racial desegregation of schools in the US. Big oil is fighting back hard, but though victories have been rare to date wins are more likely in future, as legal experts say the attitudes of judges often shift with the times.
A flurry of billion-dollar cases against fossil fuel companies brought by New York city and communities in California over the rising seas has pushed climate litigation into the limelight. But cases are being brought across the globe, with more than 1,000 suits now logged by the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia law school in New York. 
The UK government is now facing its first major climate change lawsuit, brought by 12 citizens through a legal group called Plan B and which already has the support of the government’s former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir David King.
“The UK carbon target for 2050 does not match the Paris agreement goal and the government knows that,” says Tim Crosland, a barrister at Plan B. He says the purpose of the case is to make the government live up to its responsibilities: “It is about closing the accountability deficit which is one of the biggest problems with climate change – if everybody is responsible, nobody is responsible.”
The UK has had climate laws in place for a decade and is seen by some as a leading nation, but Crosland argues the great dangers of global warming make this irrelevant. “Either we don’t want to fall off the climate cliff edge or we do. Who is doing better than others is the wrong question.”
On Wednesday meanwhile, a landmark case in California, in which the cities of San Francisco and Oakland are suing major oil companies for damages, reaches an unprecedented moment with a day-long hearing on the science of climate change itself.
Further cases are under way from India to Uganda, and across Europe including the UK, Ireland, Belgium, Portugal and Norway, where campaigners are seeking to block oil drilling in the Arctic. In Colombia, 25 young plaintiffs are taking to the courts to halt deforestation.
Lawyers won a rare victory – now under appeal – in the 2015 Urgenda case in the Netherlands, with the court ruling the Dutch state must increase its cuts to emissions. A Pakistani farmer has also won a ruling that the “lethargy of the state in implementing [climate policies] offends the fundamental rights of the citizens”. And a Peruvian farmer is suing German energy company RWE over its alleged contribution to the melting glaciers near his Andean hometown.
But it is in the US, the world’s most litigious nation, that the greatest number of cases have been brought. The most high-profile suit against the government is the Juliana case, filed by 21 teenagers in Oregon, which saw off a Trump administration attempt to halt it earlier in March.
The basis of the case, says Julia Olson, lead counsel for Our Children’s Trust which is fighting the case, is failure of US administrations to protect its citizens by tackling global warming. “The US government has put these plaintiffs and other young people in a dangerous situation. First and foremost it is about personal security and the danger that exists presently. Beyond that, it is about protecting other fundamental rights under the US constitution – basic liberties such as to be able to decide where to live and to raise a family safely.
“I can’t convey how egregious and incredible this story is across every presidential administration of our government going back 60 years,” Olsen says. “This is not a Republican versus Democrat issue. Every president made those choices.” 
While lawsuits against governments seek stronger action, those against the fossil fuel industry seek a simpler remedy – money. The argument is that these companies knowingly sold products that caused damage and a financial settlement is required, drawing parallels with the titanic legal battle fought and won against the tobacco industry.
Michael Burger, at the Sabin Center, says there is a similarity in that these growing cases threaten a level of legal and reputational risk to the companies that might eventually force them to settle or face financial oblivion. 
“The other obvious similarity with tobacco is you have a long history of corporate obfuscation and attempts to blur the science and public understanding,” he says. Some of the characters involved are even the same – on both sides – with the same scientists defending both tobacco and oil companies and the same lawyers prosecuting them.
“But there is also a key difference,” says Burger. “Tobacco is a product individual people inhale and it gives them cancer. Fossil fuel production is the beginning of a long chain of causation that includes numerous corporate actors and individual consumers, as well as government licensing and permitting schemes. The causal chain is much longer.”
Scientists are now confident they can quantify the emissions resulting from each big company’s fossil fuels – just 90 firms are responsible for two-thirds of all emissions. But lawyers for the fossil fuel companies are robust in their response, saying a causal link to damages is “unprovable”. 
The oil giants are also fighting back, with ExxonMobil in January seeking court permission to “investigate potential claims of abuse of process, civil conspiracy, and constitutional violations” by the Californian officials suing them. One of these, Serge Dedina mayor of Imperial Beach, says: “This appears to be the same kind of bullying tactic that the industry uses again and again to avoid accountability.”
Industry lobby groups are also mobilising against climate litigation in the US, with the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) launching a campaign against “politically motivated legal attacks” in November. “It has become clear that these activist plaintiffs’ attorneys, sympathetic academics and agenda-driven media outlets are distorting the use of tort litigation to advance their narratives with the ultimate objective of undermining manufacturers and the engine of the American economy,” said Linda Kelly, NAM general counsel.
However, an international panel of senior judges concluded in January that many companies around the world may well already be in breach of existing laws in relation to their impact on climate change. “Very, very few enterprises currently meet their obligations – if they did [climate change] would mostly be solved,” said Jaap Spier, who was advocate general in the Dutch supreme court until 2016 and part of the panel that published the assessment.
Spier says judges are influenced by growing concerns in society, such as worries over climate change, and are increasingly likely to look favourably on climate litigation in coming years. “If you assume companies don’t [change] at some stage, I have not the slightest doubt that courts will understand that they must step in.”
More and more climate cases are being filed, with lawyers suggesting a range of factors, from the election of Donald Trump to more extreme weather events, to revelations about what fossil fuel companies knew about climate change dangers, and a growing awareness of the urgent need to act. 
Despite this, major victories at a supreme court level still appear years off. But Burger says even wins along the way to the highest court add to the pressure for change: “There is a victory here which is just surviving the initial motions to dismiss. Having courts advance these cases towards a trial could itself move fossil fuel companies to want to start to seek some other solution.”
Nick Butler, who spent 29 years at BP and is now at King’s College London, says the companies do not believe the point has been reached where they are likely to lose cases but the pressure is real nonetheless: “The legal actions add a further dimension to the pressure for change in an industry that has begun to accept the need to reinvent itself.”
Olson argues that the courts are starting to recognise the urgency and highlights that the district judge in the Juliana case, Ann Aiken, said climate change needs to be addressed with “all deliberate speed”. That is a potent phrase in the US, taken from the 1955 supreme court judgment on the Brown v Board of Education case that ordered the end of racial segregation of schools.
“We need a decision that says you cannot discriminate against young people and deprive them of a climate system that will sustain their lives,” she says. 
“[Aiken] very much understands that constitutional rights are at stake and that speed is the critical factor here. I think we will be on a very fast track.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/20/can-climate-litigation-save-the-world

Some of the UK’s best-loved dishes – including fish and chips and chicken tikka masala – could be under threat as a result of climate change, environmentalists warn in a new report on Tuesday.
Warmer seas could see populations of cod – long the staple in fish and chips – replaced by lesser-known substitutes, leading to an “anchovies and chips” fish supper as soon as 2050, the environmental charity WWF said. 
Research commissioned for Earth Hour, the world’s largest event to protect the planet, found that these and other favourites including the cheese ploughman’s platter and lamb cawl (Welsh lamb stew) may taste different and cost more in the future. Crucially, climate change could threaten the supply of the key ingredients in these dishes, leading to substitutes.
Britons could find themselves dining out on algae-fed chicken tikka masala, if chickens need to be fed on alternatives to soy if production is hit by higher temperatures and changes to rainfall. Other key ingredients of a tikka masala, such as rice, tomatoes and onions could all suffer price hikes and shortages as a result of fluctuating weather. 
To mark Earth Hour, which starts at 8.30pm on Saturday 24 March, WWF is urging people to make promises to change their life in one small way to help the environment, such as refusing plastic cutlery, carrying a refillable cup or cutting back on meat. 
“The threat to these classic dishes just shows that climate change could impact every aspect of our lives in future if we don’t act now,” said Gareth Redmond-King, head of energy and climate at WWF. “That’s why we want people to eat more sustainably. That doesn’t necessarily mean going vegan or vegetarian – it means each of us cutting back on the amount of fish, meat and dairy. If each of us takes a small action, together we can combat climate change and future-proof our best-loved dishes.”
Backing the scheme is One Planet Plate – a campaign by the Sustainable Restaurant Association to put sustainability on the menu and a chance for chefs worldwide to demonstrate to diners how they are sourcing and cooking sustainably. Diners can use a dynamic map to find restaurants – from Eurostar to Wahaca – serving a One Planet Plate.

California is a hotbed of climate change activism, so it perhaps wasn’t a surprise to see the cities of San Francisco and Oakland sue the world’s largest oil companies last year for allegedly knowing about the dire consequences of global warming while seeking to downplay or deny it.
More striking is the approach of the judge in the case, the unorthodox William Alsup. The judge, who previously learned coding techniques for a Silicon Valley lawsuit, has set out a list of questions for a climate change “tutorial” on the floor of the courtroom on Wednesday.
We’ve sought to help out the judge by answering his queries.
The onset and decline of ice ages on Earth over the past few million years have been primarily influenced by slight changes in the Earth’s orbit around the sun, which alters the amount of sunlight bombarding the polar regions. 
The last ice age started melting away around 19,000 years ago, which raised the global sea level by around 120 metres. The “little ice age” wasn’t a true ice age – rather a period of relative cooling in the northern hemisphere up until the 19th century, probably to do with volcanic eruptions and reduced solar activity. Since then, there has been a sharp decline in glaciers and sea ice driven by human-caused warming, rather than any other factor. 
It’s rather complex, but basically the molecules of gases such as carbon dioxide are able to bend and slow down solar radiation bouncing off the Earth and returning to space. Nitrogen and oxygen aren’t able to do this and so do not have the same greenhouse impact upon the planet. 
Infrared radiation from the sun hits the Earth and reflects back off the surface. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere intervene by trapping this heat and preventing it from escaping. 
As the world’s factories, vehicles and farms pump out tens of billions of tons of greenhouse gases every year, this has caused the Earth to warm by around 1C (1.8F) over the past century. 
A bit, but not enough to really matter. 
All that human activity does give off heat, although it’s dwarfed by the heating caused by greenhouse gases. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates this direct heat is around one hundredth the size of greenhouse gas-driven heat. The equation is slightly different in some large cities, however, due to the urban heat island phenomenon. 
Alsup’s grade school was right – humans (and other animals) breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. But this expulsion of CO2 is in balance with the world around us.
Say you eat a potato. In the months before you ate it, the potato grew by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Your meal provides you with some energy and you then breathe back out the CO2. So the process is essentially carbon neutral.
Extra carbon is being released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels, which have been buried in rocks for hundreds of millions of years. Plants and oceans are sucking up a huge amount of this extra CO2, but not all of it. The result is a warmer atmosphere and a warmer ocean. 
The burning of huge amounts of coal, oil and gas to power our homes, vehicles and factories. 
Losing an area of world’s forests equivalent to the size of New Zealand each year through cutting and fire isn’t helping either.
The US Environmental Protection Agency chief, Scott Pruitt, is also puzzled by this one, but the scientific community has been clear – the primary cause of recent warming has been the emission of carbon dioxide, along with other gases such as methane. 
Human activity is the “dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century” according to the US government’s latest climate assessment, with industrialization likely responsible for 0.6C to 0.8C in warming since the early 1950s.

The prime minister contacted the Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, on Wednesday morning, speaking for about three to four minutes. They mainly discussed the federally funded Australian defence force personnel based in Darwin helping out with the cyclone recovery.
It followed sustained local media coverage of Turnbull’s apparent silence over the cyclone which hit Darwin on Saturday as a category two on Saturday, uprooting hundreds of trees, damaging houses and buildings, and knocking out power for more than 26,000 people.
Four days on about 1,500 homes remained without electricity.
Turnbull’s lack of contact with the NT was compared with his visit on Monday to the New South Wales town of Tathra after a devastating bushfire destroyed about 70 homes.
“I know very well there are fires down south, I know politicians and the prime minister have visited those areas, and well done for that,” the Darwin lord mayor, Kon Vatskalis, told ABC Radio Darwin. “But I think somebody should show some interest for the 120,000 people here in Darwin who went through that [cyclone].”
On Tuesday the federal government announced financial assistance of $250 per person, for those who had been without power for 72 hours.
The opposition leader. Bill Shorten, who also visited Tathra, called Gunner on Monday.
The strength of the cyclone caught many by surprise, and was labelled a “wake-up call” for potentially complacent residents.
It came amid warnings from climate scientists about the likelihood of stronger cyclones in the future due to the effects of climate change, and calls for the Gunner government not to exacerbate it by lifting a moratorium on fracking.
The NT is keeping an eye on a second potential cyclone later this week. A tropical low has formed in the Arafura Sea and forecasters have warned it could develop on Thursday or Friday into a cyclone, likely tracking south-east towards the Gove peninsula and the Gulf of Carpentaria.

There are still several thousand customers without power. @PowerWaterCorp crews working incredibly hard &amp; remaining tasks are difficult.

Dr Graeme Pearman, the former chief of atmospheric research at the CSIRO, told Guardian Australia rising sea temperatures meant the strength of individual cyclones was likely to increase over time, and faster rising sea levels in Australia’s north increased the potential for damaging inundations.
Pearman said scientific research warned against doing anything which exacerbated the rate of warming.
The Australia Institute, which released a report on Tuesday about dramatic increases in the number of days over 35C in the NT, called on the territory government not to lift its moratorium on fracking – a decision due imminently.
“We know that greenhouse gases increase the ocean temperatures, which in turn increases the intensity of cyclones,” a spokesman for the organisation, Mark Ogge, said.
“If the Northern Territory lifted the fracking moratorium just one gas field will increase Australia’s emissions by at least 5% and triple the territory’s emissions,” he said, referring to potential gas exploration in the Beetaloo basin.
“This decision would throw fuel on the fire and effectively increase the intensity of cyclones that hit Australia.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2018/mar/21/cyclone-marcus-turnbull-sends-thoughts-five-days-after-storm-hit-darwin

Penny Sharpe, opposition environment spokeswoman, said NSW Labor would not sign off on proposed extensions because the government “knows the science underpinning the RFAs is out of date and incomplete”.
She said: “Importantly, the RFA assessment must include climate change as a consideration. Given the key role of forests for carbon storage, no RFA should be renewed without investigating their impact on climate change.
“The unnecessary rush to push ahead with early renewal of these agreements lays bare the government’s intentions: a quick and dirty escape from a complex policy issue before the 2019 state election.”
Sharpe’s comments came after Guardian Australia revealed on Wednesday the “now quite old” science that underpins the existing RFAs and whether they “remain valid for proposed extensions”.
The move by NSW Labor puts pressure on federal Labor to toughen its position on the RFA renewals across Australia.
A delegation of environment groups led by the National Parks Association of NSW will be in Canberra next Tuesday lobbying government and Labor MPs over the science underpinning the extended RFAs.
Oisin Sweeney, senior ecologist for the NPA, said it was significant that NSW Labor was insisting climate change be considered as part of new assessments of Australia’s native forests.
“Climate science wasn’t part of the comprehensive regional assessments for the old RFAs done 20 years ago, but clearly it should be now.”
Also yesterday, the Bob Brown Foundation flagged the possibility of challenging the Tasmanian RFA, which was extended last year on a permanent rolling five-yearly basis.
Jenny Weber, campaign manager for the foundation said, “[We’re] not surprised by the revelations today in The Guardian that the regional forest agreements are at risk of being legally invalid.
“The Tasmanian regional forest agreement was rolled over last year and the death warrant was signed on thousands of hectares of wild forests in Tasmania. This RFA, and any that will be rolled over in other states of Australia, is based on 20-year-old environmental and scientific assessments. That makes them a farce.
“We know this old science is driving species to the brink of extinction, for example the critically endangered swift parrot. Despite pleas by scientists working to prevent the swift parrot’s rapid spiral towards extinction – they have called for logging not to occur in the parrot’s habitat – logging of their habitat continues in Tasmania’s southern forests.”
Logging also continues in the Tarkine rainforests.
A
Sharpe criticised the Berejiklian government’s consultation on the long-overdue reviews of the RFAs and called for a proper assessment without a predetermined outcome.
“No one has been fooled by this all-in-one review and sham consultation exercise being undertaken in NSW – a review for which the outcome has already been decided is not really a review, so it is no wonder that numerous key stakeholders abandoned the consultation process.
She said concerns about the consultation had also been raised by scientists and environment groups which have withdrawn from the consultations because the government announced that it is was committed to renewing the RFAs regardless.
 “Labor has been unequivocal: Labor will not sign off on a rollover of the RFAs until there is a proper, independent, scientific assessment of their outcomes, and the assumptions of the original RFAs are revisited.

A 16-day heatwave that hit the region this summer exposed the vulnerability of the Sunraysia and western New South Wales regions. During that time, the Murray-Darling basin’s water managers scrambled to meet demand, as the region experienced a run of days over 35C between 16 and 29 January.
But it is the long-term scenario that has environmentalists and water authorities worried. Growth in permanent plantings, mainly water-intensive almond trees, has dramatically increased in the region. 
In the 20 years from 1997 to 2015 the area under irrigation in the Sunraysia district increased by 41% or 45,000 hectares, according to the Sunrise project that uses aerial photos to map land use.
There was some reversal during the millennium drought, but the pace of expansion has intensified in the past two years.
An additional 4500ha of permanent plantings (mainly almonds) was planted last winter and another 15,500ha is due to go in over the next five years along the lower Murray.
“The whole region is booming agriculturally,” Andrew Kremor, Lower Murray Water’s manager of customer and stakeholder relations, said. “Almonds are booming, table grapes are booming, even wine grapes.” 
Kremor said Lower Murray Water had managed to meet demand during January’s hot spell by planning ahead, raising the level of water in storages and reminding users of conservation measures such as watering at night.
But the Victorian Farmers Federation’s water council chairman, Richard Anderson, said the region had been “just days off facing major water restrictions”. He said: “If the hot weather had continued, we would have been in real trouble.”
Anderson said the problem was likely to get worse because many of the almond trees had yet to reach maturity, which would increase the demand for water.
Much of the irrigation expansion is also taking place on the basis of temporary water rights that are purchased each season, raising fears of what will happen if there is another drought.
There is no real sense of what water is truly available.
The ability to trade water throughout the Murray-Darling basin system has created a kind of gold rush. Under the Murray-Darling basin plan, it is possible to buy water rights outright or for a season from water holders and use them elsewhere in the river system. Restrictions are only triggered when river levels fall below certain thresholds.
As well as issues around availability of water, there are also delivery constraints. The Bambah choke limits the flow of water from the upper Murray to the Sunraysia region.
 Longtime resident of Mildura and celebrity chef Stefano de Pieri is worried. “Citrus is going very well, because of China. Also table grapes. People are investing a lot of money in almonds. At the moment they are doing well, but how long is a piece of string? Where do they get the confidence from?”
“I am baffled because there is no real sense of what water is truly available and what is not,” he said. “Buying, selling, renting. No one can really guarantee me that this water is available.”
In the millenium drought between 2005 and 2009, farmers in Mildura went through the heartbreak of having to leave citrus orchards and vineyards to wither. A number of family farms went under. De Pieri fears it will happen again.
The Murray Darling Basin Authority, which has oversight of the basin plan acknowledges that the risk of not having enough water to meet demand in the lower Murray has gone up substantially.
“From governments’ point of view – and that’s commonwealth and state governments – we are aware of the increasing development and are doing quite a bit of work on understanding what that will mean for future water demand,” said the MDBA’s executive director of river management, Andrew Reynolds.
“We got through that peak period this year – we managed pretty well – but we are conscious that if development continues, the risk profile increases as well.”
He said the MDBA’s role was to make sure investors were aware of the increasing risks and to provide information so they could make informed decisions.
He said the MDBA was doing research on when nut plantations require their peak amount of water and how this would interact with demand from other crops.
Reynolds said if another drought occurred the price of water rights was likely to rise sharply but this would likely prompt seasonal crop producers such as cotton and rice growers to sell their entitlements rather than plant.
In Mildura, between 2005 and 2009 during the millennium drought, large areas under irrigation were left to die after farmers who had been reliant on purchasing temporary water found themselves facing impossible prices.
At the moment Mildura feels like a boom town, riding on the water equivalent of a gold rush. 
 When the Guardian visited last week the coffee shops were full and the main street busy. Evidence of expansion of irrigation was everywhere, with new plantings taking root, literally.
The local press was trumpeting the record prices being paid for irrigated properties. 
Last week CK Life Sciences International, a company owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka Shing paid $45m for citrus and grape producer Naniloc Colignan Farms. In 2016 the company snapped up Seven Fields at Redcliffs in 2016 for $90m.
“The last 20 years has seen huge corporatisation and huge usage of big tracts of land to grow things. The game has changed. Whether the plan itself was the driver of this expansion, or the expansion itself is globally driven, it’s not clear,” De Pieri said.
He says the risk will be to the remaining small family farmers who will face skyrocketing water prices in a dry season. “We are operating in a vacuum, it’s grab what you can, when you can,” says De Pieri.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/22/murray-darling-system-under-strain-as-tree-plantations-increase-41

Combining all the available chronicles, there are six reported severe winters in England in the 50 years prior to 1565 and six in the 50 years after. This is a much higher occurrence rate than we experience today, but it is not an ice age – little or otherwise. 
Thames freeze years are slightly more frequent before the Maunder minimum began and also considerably more common 65 years after it ended.

You don'e seem to know this only applies in one geological context, specifically as glacial stages end, and it's clear the initial warming was due to astronomical cycles.
That warming drove CO2 out of oceans.
This CO2 then boosted the warming - most of the warming that changes glacial stages into interglacials comes from that CO2 in the second phase.
The current situation is different, because most of the extra CO2 now comes from burning carbon-rich fuels.
We're not currently coming out of a glacial stage, and the astronomical cycles are in a different phase at present.

""Global warming preceded by increasing carbon dioxide concentrations during the last deglaciation"" -Shakun et al, 2012

an antiphased hemispheric temperature response to ocean circulation changes superimposed on globally in-phase warming driven by increasing CO2 concentrations is an explanation for much of the temperature change at the end of the most recent ice age.

There's nothing biased about accepting the professional scientific consensus on climate change.
Solar cycles are not going to cool the Earth in the next few decades.
A few years ago, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) released a major correction to their sunspot history.
This effectively rules out any significant contribution to warming from changes in solar activity.
BQSTART
The apparent upward trend of solar activity between the 18th century and the late 20th century has now been identified as a major calibration error in the Group Sunspot Number. Now that this error has been corrected, solar activity appears to have remained relatively stable since the 1700s

The sea ice provides almost perfect concealment for submarines but brings problems too.
While the upper surface of the ice is smooth the underside is ridged with keels extending downwards for many metres and creating a dangerous collision hazard.
This uneven ice surface also scatters sonar, sometimes producing phantom images and confusing navigation. From a submarine, the ceaseless creaking and groaning of the shifting pack ice above takes some getting used to; worse, the high-pitched sounds can interfere with sonar reception.
The military submarines use sonar to measure the thickness of the ice, helping to validate scientific models of how the cover has changed over the years. Records from similar expeditions, gathered to help identify spots where the ice is thin enough for submarines to surface, have proved a valuable resource for scientists.
The Arctic may be spectacular and fascinating but it is a dangerous place for submarine operations. During the mission ICEX 2007 two sailors died in an explosion on board the Royal Navy nuclear submarine HMS Tireless. The Trenchant’s crew laid a wreath for them last week.

Last December AGL confirmed it would close Liddell in 2022 and replace the coal plant with a mix of renewables, gas power for peak periods and battery storage.
The company’s decision to retire the coal plant defied extraordinary public pressure from the Turnbull government. The Coalition wanted AGL to prolong the operating life of Liddell a further five years.
AGL rebuffed Canberra’s request and is proceeding with its own plan. The company says the extra capacity to replace Liddell will come from: a gas peaker power plant at Newcastle or another New South Wales site (250MW); an upgrade of the Bayswater coal plant (100MW); a Liddell battery (250MW); demand response (up to 150MW); a second gas peaker (500MW); and renewables (1,600MW).
The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, sought advice from the Australian Energy Market Operator after AGL made its decision public, and that advice will be released by the government on Friday.
Aemo concludes that extra generation capacity will be required in NSW unless AGL rolls out all three stages of its transition plan, or a competitor steps into the breach. It says without full commitment from AGL or new capacity from elsewhere “there remains a high risk of load shedding following the closure of Liddell”.
It says if an additional 850MW of dispatchable power resources is added to the electricity market by 2026-27, that will reduce the risk of load shedding to a one-in-10-year likelihood after the closure of the coal plant.
While there is a significant level of contracted capacity for renewable generation coming on stream over the next few years, Aemo says more dispatchable power is required because there is insufficient interconnector capability to ensure the reliable delivery of new electricity supply into NSW from other regions during periods of peak demand.
There is also a risk that generators underperform in high-demand conditions.
The impact of climate change is another factor. Aemo has told the government that the number of days each year involving “extreme peak temperatures” are increasing, requiring the market operator to work with the Bureau of Meteorology on its modelling and forecasting methods.
It says its experience in running the national electricity market over the past two summers indicates that a combination of higher-than-average temperatures, unplanned generation outages and loss of generation owing to weather conditions have pushed the grid into “lack of reserve” conditions.
Another factor is the increasing penetration of solar panels. Aemo says embedded solar PV generation across the national electricity market is leading to a later and shorter peak in operation demand.
The change in the generation mix is impacting the market operator’s forecasting models, as well as leaving the grid more exposed to prevailing weather conditions.
Aemo says if governments can agree on the government’s proposed national energy guarantee, that will provide the underlying policy framework to drive the necessary investments in disptachable generation in NSW.
It says if governments don’t sign off on the national energy guarantee and have the mechanism in place by next December, an alternative process to contract the 850MW of capacity will need to be pursued. It recommends a mechanism that can be used specifically in NSW, that is consistent with a pending national energy guarantee, be agreed by the end of 2018.
The national energy guarantee, if it is adopted by governments, would impose new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020.
The Energy Security Board is leading consultations with a range of stakeholders about the design of the policy, which will be considered by federal and state energy ministers on 20 April.
While environment groups and several market analysts have significant concerns about the Turnbull policy, the government’s chances of securing support for the national energy guarantee have improved courtesy of Jay Weatherill’s departure as the South Australian premier after Saturday’s state election.
Frydenberg says the Aemo advice reinforces the need for “governments at federal, state and territory level to get behind the national energy guarantee as our pathway to a more reliable and affordable energy system”.
He is calling on AGL “to commit as soon as possible to the next stages of their plan”, saying “the existence of a major shortfall in dispatchable power following Liddell’s closure would clearly present an unacceptable situation undermining the stability of the system”.
AGL welcomed the Aemo advice, saying it confirmed the NSW generation plan “addresses the potential shortfall” that may follow the closure of Liddell.
“We also welcome the market operator’s view that a competitive market approach to deliver the required resources is best for consumers,” AGL said in a statement.
It noted an independent assessment of AGL’s plan found the replacement generation would cost $83/MWh, compared with extending Liddell at $106/MWh. 
On Friday Frydenberg told Radio National those figures only reflected “the costs to them as a company in terms of maintaining Liddell staying open”. 
“What they’re not talking about is the cost to the market of having greater volatility in it,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/23/warning-of-power-shortfall-risk-after-closure-of-liddell-plant

The hearing was part of a courtroom showdown between liberal California cities and powerful oil corporations, including Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and BP. San Francisco and Oakland have sued the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies, arguing that they are responsible for damages related to global warming.
While climate change-related cases have entered courtrooms throughout the US, the judge in the California case, William Alsup, took the unusual step of convening a formal “tutorial” on the subject “so that the poor judge can learn some science”, allowing renowned experts and some of the biggest oil companies to answer key questions. 
“From Chevron’s perspective, there’s no debate about climate science,” said Theodore Boutrous Jr, the attorney for the US oil giant, which chose not to have scientists or experts testify on its behalf. While he repeatedly referred to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) conclusion that it is “extremely likely” humans have been the dominant cause of warming since the mid-20th century, he also worked to paint the problem as an international one for which individual corporations are not liable. 
“Climate change is a global issue that requires global engagement and global action,” he said, later saying “production and extraction” are not responsible for increases in emissions, but rather “economic and population growth” are, adding: “It’s the way people are living their lives.” 
The attorney spoke for hours in a packed San Francisco courtroom of attorneys, journalists and activists who lined up early in the dark of morning to get a seat, with dozens forced into a crowded overflow room and many live-tweeting fact-checks and commentary. 
The communities in California, known as a leader in climate activism, have argued that greenhouse gas emissions from the companies’ activities over time will cause billions of dollars’ worth of damage, have locked in significant rises in sea level, and are endangering lives. The defendants are accused of long knowing the environmental impact of their emissions and working to deny and conceal this knowledge. 
The Chevron attorney also presented a graph showing that China is burning more coal than the US, saying: “It really goes to the global nature of this.”
Environmentalists, however, pointed out that the assessment ignored cumulative emissions and that the US is the biggest carbon polluter in history.
Don Wuebbles, who helped lead the 2013 IPCC assessment of climate science and 2014 US National Climate Assessment, testified for the cities and noted that Chevron was relying on outdated reports: “The science does not stop at 2012 … There’s a lot we have learned over the last five years.”
He talked about severe weather incidents becoming more intense and noted that 2014 was “the warmest year on record”, adding: “2015 was warmer. 2016 was warmer yet.” Seventeen of the last 18 years were the warmest on record, he said. 
Chevron did not present any science from climate deniers, but climate change contrarians with ties to Donald Trump’s administration have also gotten involved in the litigation, offering to contribute a presentation. 
William Happer, a Princeton University physicist, rumored last year to be a frontrunner for Trump’s science adviser, co-authored a recent motion in the case that said: “It is not possible to tell how much of the modest recent warming can be ascribed to human influences.” He has previously described climate scientists as “a glassy-eyed cult”. 
Alsup, known as an unorthodox judge, who memorably learned to code for a Silicon Valley intellectual property lawsuit, said he had read headlines comparing his hearing to the famous Scopes “monkey trial” on evolution in the US and urged reporters in the room not to blow the event out of proportion. 
“If you get bored, you can just leave,” said Alsup, who said he wore his “science tie” with a solar system in honor of the hearing.
Although there was no meaningful cross-examination, the five-hour hearing offered a window into how the oil corporations can attempt to simultaneously acknowledge human-caused climate change while trying to fight off this type of litigation. Courts across the globe have increasingly become the new frontline for climate action, and the San Francisco case could also build a factual foundation that could be cited in future suits. 
At one point, Boutrous clarified that he was not speaking for the other companies, and Alsup at the end of the hearing ordered the other defendants to file motions saying whether they agreed with the Chevron attorney: “You can’t get away with sitting here in silence.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/21/climate-science-lawsuit-san-francisco-sues-chevron

Gosh Bernie, first true thing I've seen you type ;-)
Yes, but they are accustomed to denying science for their own political ends, e.g. Lawson and Monckton (assuming it's not a Poe and he was taking the mickey out of the author, he explains his otherwordly ""rationale"" to Will Storr in his book ""The Unpersuadables""). They'd do it for free.

The debate is not about that at all, as Nuccitelli well knows which you can confirm by reading his other writings. 
The fact that the oil company scientists are mainstream should come as no surprise to anyone who has read their published journal papers over the years and decades, and it demonstrates how deceitful Nuccitelli is being. The actual denial is not of if, but of how much global warming is likely to occur from our accelerating CO2 emissions and its increasing concentration from 280 ppm 150 years ago to 405 ppm now, on its way to a double of 560 ppm later this century. The how much is a function of two things-1) quantity of CO2 emissions2) climate sensitivity to CO2- the amount of warming from a doubling of CO2 ppmThese two are critical factors for any understanding how much warming will occur- continued modest warming, which seems the most likely trend, and would probably be benign as Freeman Dyson, Richard Lindzen, and Bjorn Lombourg predict or serious, even catastrophic warming from high climate sensitivity, as James Hansen and a few others predict. 
For over 50 years, determining climate sensitivity has been the main quest of climate science, but it stubbornly remains in the huge range of 1.5 to 4.5 according to the IPCC (and 0.6 to 6.0 if we include the outliers Lindzen and Hansen). The un-quantifiable positive and negative feed backs, mostly from from H20 water vapor and clouds, have so far made the determining climate sensitivity impossible. 
The ""climate denial"" Nuccitelli characterizes as science denial is instead the well respected position that climate sensitivity is near the low end of the IPCC 1.5 to 4.5 range, based on the empirical record, global temperatures the past 20 years, and the majority of recent peer reviewed papers by climate scientists. 
Whereas, helping the public and politicians understand climate science so that we might find common ground and craft responsible policy for what is likely- a continuing warming trend (about 0.9 C degrees the past 150 years) and sea level rise (about 2-3 mm per year) Nuccitelli instead is a source of misrepresentation about climate change, climate consensus, climate denial, and climate science. If you count him as a friend of climate science and of the effort to craft responsible policy to promote sustainability- you are being duped.As a life long environmentalist who teaches a course in climate science, I think we need to call out the con men who are promoting a political narrative in place of the science.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1522159684000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'13935060', u'id': u'114068406', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'dave6723', u'text': u'And look, BP even has a web page about it.

In 1996, British Petroleum resigned and later announced support for the Kyoto Protocol and commitment to greenhouse gas emission reductions.[83] In 1997, Royal Dutch Shell withdrew after criticism from European environmental groups. In 1999, Ford Motor Company was the first US company to withdraw; the New York Times described the departure as ""the latest sign of divisions within heavy industry over how to respond to global warming.""[84] DuPont left the coalition in 1997 and Shell Oil (US) left in 1998. In 2000, GCC corporate members were the targets of a national student-run university divestiture campaign. Between December, 1999 and early March, 2000, Texaco, the Southern Company, General Motors and Daimler-Chrysler withdrew.

Exxon Mobil were the only major quoted player to deny AGW, and even that changed when Tillerson took over from Raymond. Chevron took over Texaco and AFAICS took a more lukewarm approach than Texaco.
So absent evidence of covert funding for anti-AGW advertising or pseudo-science, it's hard to see how oil companies alone are responsible for our current fix. Yes they produced the stuff, but they didn't choose whether to cycle to work or drive an SUV, and whether to take off that sweater or turn on the a/c, we (consumers all over the world) did.
Of course its possible that corporate shareholders or rich individuals provided covert funding because they thought it would benefit their investments, but corporations can't control who buys their shares. And there is no shortage on the political right of people who don't want taxes, legislation and international agreements for ideological reasons. They may well choose to attack the science because they're not confident a purely political argument will get enough traction.
But pretending that the 20 years of inaction since 1997 is entirely down to oil companies funding a think-tank before they left around that date, is hiding from our own responsibilities.

BQEND
Unfortunately, this statement gives away how little you know about this subject.
Firstly, UAH is looking at the troposphere, not the surface temperature which is the more important (to us) part of the atmosphere and for which ECS and TCS are calculated for.
Secondly, the behaviour of the troposphere will be different to the other layers of the atmosphere for well known reasons.
Thirdly, a couple of year's worth of data are statistically and scientifically irrelevant. Climate is measured over 30+ years. A time period established by the IMO (the WMO's predecessor) back in 1934. Even the latest statistical techniques cannot filter out the noise from the trend for periods pop less than 17 years.
Fourthly, UAH data has to be heavily processed, an d the track record of that team is not good. They have had to have their work corrected repeatedly. Therefore at the moment it has to be taken with a pinch of salt.

Climate science is a very complex science, a young science, and an important science.
BQEND
Incorrect.It is not a young science. The basic physics were established in the mid C19, and AGW was predicted by Arrhenius in 1896.
It is correct to say it is complex, and we are still advancing the scientific understanding.
However, your argument boils down to ""we don't know everything, therefore we know nothing"". 
All the variations you mentioned are relatively well know, it is clouds, and feedbacks that are the main area of research to nailing down TCS and ECS.

Incorrect.Climate change denial (denial of AGW) has a continuum of positions which deniers can hold simultaneously:- there is no greenhouse affect- CO2 is not increasing- if it is then it is not from anthropogenic sources- if it is increasing, then it will have minimal affect- there is no increase in temperatures- if temperatures are increasing, it's a good thing- and if it isn't a good thing its too late anyway
Any and all of those points can also be accompanied with outright accusations of fraud and manipulation as part of variously socialist plots, plans for personal monetary gain, and or collusion with vested interests.
In this case, the article focusses on the level of alleged damages caused by fossil fuel companies aiding and abetting deniers in slowing the response to dealing with AGW by spreading FUD.

We are developing supercritical gas extraction, flash hydrogenation, flash pyrolysis, panel-bed filters and similar ways to use coal cleanly at essentially any scale and to cream off valuable liquids and gases as premium fuels before burning the rest.""

You are right that he is against the large scale coal to oil plants, but he against anything large-scale. He favours coal as long as it is at a small localised level. Which is a running theme in Lovins' work.
He advocates turning automobile engines into local generators instead of using large scale powerstations because mass production means the capital cost is lower.
He advocate cogeneration (i.e. burning fossil fuel to produce heat and electricity at the same time) as a supposed substitute for nuclear power.
He is against investment in electricity grids.
In short he opposes the large scale solutions (which subsequent history shows actually worked) and latches on to the small-scale techno-hype, which sounds superficially plausible but in hindsight turns out to be limited and/or problematic. Sound familiar?
He does manage to pick out wind as a winner - but ironically he plumps for vertical axis turbines because they happened to be in vogue.
One common trait of the anti-nuclearist is that their alternative solutions change endlessly over the years as the hype for each alternative rises and then falls, and the shortcomings become impossible to ignore.
Lovins no longer advocates coal. But he does advocate gas cogeneration.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1522052597000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'mass production means the capital cost is lower', u'effect': u'he advocates turning automobile engines into local generators instead of using large scale powerstations'}, {u'cause': u'they happened to be in vogue', u'effect': u'ironically he plumps for vertical axis turbines'}], u'author_id': u'2578657', u'in_reply_to': u'113991733', u'id': u'114007651', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'TTauriStellarbody', u'text': u'Please read my response and stop being a cry baby.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1522051662000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'16773618', u'in_reply_to': u'113996331', u'id': u'114007240', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'GoldenAppleCorps', u'text': u'Some day you will stop issuing cliches in the erroneous belief it give you the appearance of wisdom.

The plaintiffs are the coastal cities of San Francisco and Oakland. They’re suing five major oil companies (Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, ConocoPhillips and BP) to pay for the cities’ costs to cope with the sea level rise caused by global warming. Chevron’s lawyer presented the science for the defense, and most notably, began by explicitly accepting the expert consensus on human-caused global warming, saying:
From Chevron’s perspective, there is no debate about the science of climate change
Chevron’s first slide quotes #IPCC: “It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.” Says there is no debate on this consensus. #climatetutorial #climateliability
Deniers filed briefs in support of the defense, but they contradicted Chevron’s tutorial. For example, one brief filed by a group led by Christopher Monckton and Willie Soon began by stating, “The “consensus” about global warming is 0.3%, not 97%” (this is obviously incorrect). Another brief filed by William Happer, Steve Koonin, and Richard Lindzen argued that “It is not possible to tell how much of the modest recent warming can be ascribed to human influences.” Chevron and the IPCC disagree.
While it’s normal for climate deniers to deny the 97% expert consensus that humans are driving global warming, those submitting briefs on behalf of Big Oil were clearly not on the same page as its lawyer. Perhaps the oil companies should have sent the deniers a memo to stay out of this case. Clearly these groups are accustomed to denying climate science on the oil industry’s behalf.
The judge mandated that those submitting briefs detail their funding sources, and they listed a litany of oil companies and fossil fuel-funded think tanks. Among those listed by Monckton and Soon’s group were ExxonMobil, the Heartland Institute, and the Charles G. Koch Foundation. Among those listed by Happer, Koonin, and Lindzen were the Heritage Foundation, Peabody Coal, the Cato Institute, and the Texas Public Policy Foundation.
It’s a perfect example of the oil industry’s two-faced behavior. For decades their own scientists quietly published peer-reviewed research concluding that humans are causing global warming. That was the face we saw from Chevron’s lawyer. But at the same time, oil companies were funding contrarian scientists and think tanks to spread denial and doubt about that same science. That was the face revealed in the denier briefs.
Although they accept the expert climate consensus, the oil companies obviously don’t want to be held liable for the costs of the climate damages their products cause. In addition to emphasizing and exaggerating climate science uncertainties, Chevron’s lawyer noted that the IPCC states that climate change is caused “largely by economic and population growth,” not fossil fuel extraction. In other words, the oil industry’s strategy is to argue that individual climate impacts are difficult to pin down, and in any case, the blame lies not with the producers, but with the consumers of their products. It’s eerily similar to an argument made by tobacco industry lawyers:
Those who decide to start smoking or continue smoking should assume responsibility for a choice they make -- because no one can say they don’t know about the dangers associated with smoking
In short, the industry lawyers argue that the consequences are the fault of smokers and energy consumers, not the companies producing the dangerous products.
That argument didn’t work for the tobacco industry in the past, because they knew of the health risks associated with consuming their products, yet engaged in campaign to manufacture doubt to convince people to keep smoking. Ultimately, a federal judge found the tobacco industry guilty of fraud to further a conspiracy to deceive the American public about the dangers of their products.
It’s a more difficult case to make against the oil industry because their scientists published climate research in peer-reviewed journals available to the public, and their campaign to manufacture doubt about human-caused climate change was waged through intermediaries. They funded think tanks to do their dirty work, as we saw in the denier briefs.
Tobacco industry executives continued publicly denying their own scientists’ findings to the very end, even under oath. 
The oil industry has modified the tobacco playbook by accepting the scientific consensus. And Chevron’s lawyer argued that as a complex global problem, any climate remedies should be addressed through government policy rather than via the legal system.
Since it effectively owns the Republican Party, Big Oil can afford to accept the science to avoid legal ramifications, without fearing any such legislative consequences unless the Democratic Party takes full control of the US government, which won’t happen until 2021 at the earliest. 
It’s a brilliant strategy, and until Democrats take power and pass a carbon tax or other similar climate legislation (or enough Republican lawmakers stop denying the science and start finding bipartisan policy solutions), it might just work. 
But even if they lose this lawsuit, at least the cities of San Francisco and Oakland forced the oil companies’ hand. In a high-profile case, they accepted the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming. These companies have employed scientists researching climate change for four decades, and as the world’s biggest and most profitable producers of carbon-polluting products, have the strongest motivation to deny climate science. If even Big Oil accepts the reality of human-caused climate change when pressed in court, it’s difficult for anyone else to deny it from here forward.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/23/in-court-big-oil-rejected-climate-denial

Only in my 40s did I become a person whose heart lifts whenever he hears a grosbeak singing or a towhee calling, and who hurries out to see a golden plover that’s been reported in the neighbourhood, just because it’s a beautiful bird, with truly golden plumage, and has flown all the way from Alaska. When someone asks me why birds are so important to me, all I can do is sigh and shake my head, as if I’ve been asked to explain why I love my brothers. And yet the question is a fair one: why do birds matter?
My answer might begin with the vast scale of the avian domain. If you could see every bird in the world, you’d see the whole world. Things with feathers can be found in every corner of every ocean and in land habitats so bleak that they’re habitats for nothing else. Grey gulls raise their chicks in Chile’s Atacama desert, one of the driest places on Earth.
Emperor penguins incubate their eggs in Antarctica in winter. Goshawks nest in the Berlin cemetery where Marlene Dietrich is buried, sparrows in Manhattan traffic lights, swifts in sea caves, vultures on Himalayan cliffs, chaffinches in Chernobyl. The only forms of life more widely distributed than birds are microscopic.
To survive in so many different habitats, the world’s 10,000 or so bird species have evolved into a spectacular diversity of forms. They range in size from the ostrich, which can reach 2.7 metres (9ft) in height and is widespread in Africa, to the aptly named bee hummingbird, found only in Cuba. Their bills can be massive (pelicans, toucans), tiny (weebills) or as long as the rest of their body (sword-billed hummingbirds). Some birds – the painted bunting in Texas, Gould’s sunbird in South Asia, the rainbow lorikeet in Australia – are gaudier than any flower. Others come in one of the nearly infinite shades of brown that tax the vocabulary of avian taxonomists: rufous, fulvous, ferruginous, bran-coloured, foxy.
Birds are no less diverse behaviourally. Some are highly social, others anti. African queleas and flamingos gather in flocks of millions, and parakeets build whole parakeet cities out of sticks. Dippers walk alone and underwater, on the beds of mountain streams, and a wandering albatross may glide on its three-metre wingspan 500 miles away from any other albatrosses. I’ve met friendly birds, like the New Zealand fantail that once followed me down a trail, and I’ve met mean ones, like the caracara in Chile that swooped down and tried to knock my head off when I stared at it too long. Roadrunners kill rattlesnakes for food by teaming up on them, one bird distracting the snake while another sneaks up behind it. Bee-eaters eat bees. Leaftossers toss leaves. Thick-billed murres can dive underwater to a depth of 213 metres (700ft), peregrine falcons downward through the air at 240 miles an hour. A wren-like rushbird can spend its entire life beside one half-acre pond, while a cerulean warbler may migrate to Peru and then find its way back to the tree in New Jersey where it nested the year before.
Birds aren’t furry and cuddly, but in many respects they’re more similar to us than other mammals are. They build intricate homes and raise families in them. They take long winter vacations in warm places. Cockatoos are shrewd thinkers, solving puzzles that would challenge a chimpanzee, and crows like to play. (On days so windy that more practical birds stay grounded, I’ve seen crows launching themselves off hillsides and doing aerial somersaults, just for the fun of it, and I keep returning to the YouTube video of a crow in Russia sledding down a snowy roof on a plastic lid, flying back up with the lid in its beak, and sledding down again.) And then there are the songs with which birds, like us, fill the world. Nightingales trill in the suburbs of Europe, thrushes in downtown Quito, hwameis in Chengdu. Chickadees have a complex language for communicating – not only to each other but to every bird in their neighbourhood – about how safe or unsafe they feel from predators. Some lyrebirds in eastern Australia sing a tune their ancestors may have learned from a settler’s flute nearly a century ago. If you shoot too many pictures of a lyrebird, it will add the sound of your camera to its repertoire.
But birds also do the thing we all wish we could do but can’t, except in dreams: they fly. Eagles effortlessly ride thermals; hummingbirds pause in mid-air; quail burst into flight heart-stoppingly. Taken all together, the flight paths of birds bind the planet together like 100bn filaments, tree to tree and continent to continent. There was never a time when the world seemed large to them. After breeding, a European swift will stay aloft for nearly a year, flying to sub-Saharan Africa and back, eating and moulting and sleeping on the wing, without landing once. Young albatrosses spend as many as 10 years roving the open ocean before they first return to land to breed. A bar-tailed godwit has been tracked flying nonstop from Alaska to New Zealand, 7,264 miles in nine days, while a ruby-throated hummingbird may burn up a third of its tiny body weight to cross the Gulf of Mexico. The red knot, a small shorebird species, makes annual round trips between Tierra del Fuego and the Canadian Arctic; one long-lived individual, named B95 for the tag on its leg, has flown more miles than separate the Earth and the moon.
There is, however, one critical ability that human beings have and birds do not: mastery of their environment. Birds can’t protect wetlands, can’t manage a fishery, can’t air-condition their nests. They have only the instincts and the physical abilities that evolution has bequeathed to them. These have served them well for a very long time, 150m years longer than human beings have been around. But now human beings are changing the planet – its surface, its climate, its oceans – too quickly for birds to adapt to by evolving. Crows and gulls may thrive at our garbage dumps, blackbirds and cowbirds at our farms’ feedlots, robins and bulbuls in our city parks. But the future of most bird species depends on our commitment to preserving them. Are they valuable enough for us to make the effort?
Value, in the late Anthropocene, has come almost exclusively to mean economic value, utility to human beings. And certainly many wild birds are usefully edible. Some of them in turn eat noxious insects and rodents. Many others perform vital roles – pollinating plants, spreading seeds, serving as food for mammalian predators – in ecosystems whose continuing wildness has touristic or carbon-sequestering value. You may also hear it argued that bird populations function, like the proverbial coal-mine canary, as important indicators of ecological health. But do we really need the absence of birds to tell us when a marsh is severely polluted, a forest slashed and burned, or a fishery destroyed? The sad fact is that wild birds, in themselves, will never pull their weight in the human economy. They want to eat our blueberries.
What bird populations do usefully indicate is the health of our ethical values. One reason that birds matter – ought to matter – is that they are our last, best connection to a natural world that is otherwise receding. They’re the most vivid and widespread representatives of the Earth as it was before people arrived on it. They share descent with the largest animals ever to walk on land: the house finch outside your window is a tiny and beautifully adapted living dinosaur. A duck on your local pond looks and sounds very much like a duck 20m years ago, in the Miocene epoch, when birds ruled the planet. In an ever more artificial world, where featherless drones fill the air and Angry Birds can be simulated on our phones, we may see no reasonable need to cherish and support the former rulers of the natural realm. But is economic calculation our highest standard? After Shakespeare’s King Lear steps down from the throne, he pleads with his elder two daughters to grant him some vestige of his former majesty. When the daughters reply that they don’t see the need for it, the old king bursts out: “O, reason not the need!” To consign birds to oblivion is to forget what we’re the children of.
A person who says, “It’s too bad about the birds, but human beings come first” is making one of two implicit claims. The person may mean that human beings are no better than any other animal – that our fundamentally selfish selves, which are motivated by selfish genes, will always do whatever it takes to replicate our genes and maximise our pleasure, the non-human world be damned. This is the view of cynical realists, to whom a concern for other species is merely an annoying form of sentimentality. It’s a view that can’t be disproved, and it’s available to anyone who doesn’t mind admitting that he or she is hopelessly selfish. But “human beings come first” may also have the opposite meaning: that our species is uniquely worthy of monopolising the world’s resources because we are not like other animals, because we have consciousness and free will, the capacity to remember our pasts and shape our futures. This opposing view can be found among both religious believers and secular humanists, and it too is neither provably true nor provably false. But it does raise the question: if we’re incomparably more worthy than other animals, shouldn’t our ability to discern right from wrong, and to knowingly sacrifice some small fraction of our convenience for a larger good, make us more susceptible to the claims of nature, rather than less? Doesn’t a unique ability carry with it a unique responsibility?
A few years ago in a forest in north-east India, I heard and then began to feel, in my chest, a deep rhythmic whooshing. It sounded meteorological, but it was the wingbeats of a pair of great hornbills flying in to land in a fruiting tree. They had massive yellow bills and hefty white thighs; they looked like a cross between a toucan and a giant panda. As they clambered around in the tree, placidly eating fruit, I found myself crying out with joy. It was the sheer gorgeous fact of the great hornbill, which couldn’t have cared less about me.
The radical otherness of birds is integral to their beauty and their value. They are always among us but never of us. Their indifference to us ought to serve as a chastening reminder that we’re not the measure of all things. The stories we tell about the past and imagine for the future are mental constructions that birds can do without. Birds live squarely in the present. And at present, although our cats and our windows and our pesticides kill billions of them every year, and although some species have been lost for ever, their world is still very much alive. In every corner of the globe, in nests as small as walnuts or as large as haystacks, chicks are pecking through their shells and into the light.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/23/the-radical-otherness-of-birds-jonathan-franzen-on-why-they-matter

Eighteen months after Sajid Javid first took responsibility for a planning decision for a new coal mine at Highthorn, the communities secretary said he had concluded the project should not go ahead.
Environmental lawyers ClientEarth said the decision was the first time the UK government had rejected a planning application citing climate change as the reason.
Coal is the dirtiest fuel on the planet and emissions from its use as a source of heat and energy make it historically the single largest threat to our climate.
But it is also the largest source of electricity in the world, providing 41% of our electricity needs.
Clean coal relies on a series of technologies known as carbon capture and storage (CCS). In 2015, the International Energy Agency calculated that CCS could help reduce global carbon emissions by 13%, delivering a huge chunk of reductions needed by 2050 to keep below a 2C rise.
CCS technology aims to capture carbon dioxide generated at coal plants and store it underground in rock formations and aquifers.
But so far no major coal power plant has managed to make CCS work on a grand scale. Costs have proved prohibitive - especially as low natural gas prices have made coal uncompetitive. 
Rose Dickinson, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “This is a significant victory for local residents and the climate, it means an important step forward has been taken in ending the era of fossil fuels.”
Explaining Javid’s decision, officials said: “He concludes that overall the scheme would have an adverse effect on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change of very substantial significance, which he gives very considerable weight in the planning balance.”
The communities secretary said the impact on global warming, together with harm to the local landscape, outweighed the economic benefits of the mine.
Banks Mining, which submitted its planning application in 2015 and had argued the project would bring substantial investment to the local area, hit out at what it branded a “perverse decision”.
Gavin Styles, the company’s managing director, said: “It has been made for purely political reasons and is totally contrary to the principles of local decision-making that previously appeared so important to Mr Javid.” The company said it had not yet decided whether to appeal.
The use of coal for electricity generation has plummeted in the face of carbon taxes and competition from gas, but the Highthorn site is not the UK’s only proposed new coal mine.
West Cumbria Mining wants to build a £200m mine at Woodhouse in Cumbria, south of Kendal, which would be the UK’s first deep coal mine in several decades. The company plans to extract metallurgical coal for steel-making rather than power generation.
Cumbria county council has so far postponed meetings on the project, and late May is understood to be the earliest it will decide whether to approve or reject the mine. Two coal power stations this year have already announced closure plans, after which the UK will have just six coal plants.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/23/minister-rejects-opencast-coal-mine-northumberland-citing-climate-change-fears

I think it would be better if people (perhaps on Earth Day, or any day) changed the provider of their electricity to a non-fossil option.

This year, the WWF, which manages the initiative, hopes to build on its growing success and says millions of actions will be taken in at least 180 countries and territories. A record 187 countries took part in the event’s record breaking 10th year.
An hour is not going to save the world – but a key message in publicising the event is that every action counts and that energised individuals can make genuine change to the way we think about human impact on the planet.
Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?
This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.

The WWF says highlights of its pushes for new legislation include the banning of all plastics in the Galapagos in 2014, planting 17 million trees in Kazakhstan and pushing new laws for the protection of seas and forests in Russia.
 Here, readers tell us how they are going further than the hour (you should switch off the lights from 8:30-9:30pm local time) with gestures such as refusing plastic, leaving the car at home and hosting events to inspire others in 2018. 
I’m making my own promise for the planet and refusing plastic cutlery when eating out, and I’m asking all the members of my 15k-strong Facebook community to join in, make their own pledges on 24 March and spread the word.
When faced with huge issues like plastic pollution and climate change, it can feel overwhelming, as if we as individuals could never hope to achieve anything meaningful, but this is so wrong! Earth Hour is a brilliant event to raise awareness of the plight of the planet and allows people to show that they care. If everybody who makes a promise carries through with it, and the changes continue beyond Earth Hour, it really will make a difference in reducing the amount of plastic and carbon overloading the planet.
I am part of a local community group called Sustainable Chard. We have organised a day of events called Earth Hour Chard, including events aimed at the younger members of our town where they can learn about upcycling, renewable energy, planting and growing. During the afternoon there will be eco talks and workshops where people can learn how to reduce their impact on the planet with topics on travel, food, the home and carbon footprints and in the evening we have assembled live bands, musicians, poets, green traders and therapists for an Earth Hour extravaganza. 
We aim to engage as many people as possible, showing that the event is more than just switching off the lights: if we are to make any impact on climate change we will need to look at every part our lifestyles.
I am not just going to turn the lights off for an hour, I want to try to live in as environmentally friendly way as possible for the day. I will tell as many people as possible at school and locally to convince them to contribute to the effort. 
At home, I’ll unplug all electrical devices and lights during Earth Hour. I’ll try to persuade my parents not to use the car and to use public transport instead. I will not buy any plastic (food in plastic wrappings, bottles etc) or meat (which I don’t do anyway, as I am a vegetarian). In the evening when it’s dark I will try to not turn on any lights and use candles for light instead. 
Our voluntary organisation Mid-Ohio Valley Climate Action has convinced Parkersburg city government, the county government and the federal buildings to turn off all the lights that they can. We’ll have a candlelit event with acoustic music at a park in the midst of dimmed downtown on the night. 
We hope to make people mindful of the need for conservation and energy efficiency and to educate on anthropogenic global climate change while encouraging environmental and climate activism and continued coalition-building. 
At the school where I teach, we all wrote promises for the planet and hung them on our “promise tree”. I made 120 vegan flapjacks so that we could have a plastic-free breaktime and the children brought wild cuddly toys to school to raise money to sponsor four endangered animals. At home I am holding a candlelit Earth Hour dinner for 12 people, for which none of the ingredients can have been packed in plastic or use unsustainable palm oil. It’s quite a challenge! 
Earth Hour is largely symbolic, but it gets people thinking about the environment and what they can do personally. My message is that if we all do something, together we can make a big difference. By making promises about what we can do ourselves, it forces us to consider our own impact on the environment and our own responsibility. Governments and big companies have the power to do more, but this does not absolve us of responsibility. By holding the dinner party and asking some of my guests to make a plastic-free pudding, we have all become more aware of how plastic surrounds almost everything we buy. I now look at my shopping in a different way and I hope that other people will do so too.
I run a Guide unit in Groomsport, County Down, and we are participating in this year’s Earth Hour by running the entire evening in the dark, with no electricity. We are doing an environmental scavenger hunt around the local area as we meet beside the sea, gathering items such as plastics and litter to clean up our village a little bit, toasting marshmallows under tealights and trying to draw pictures in the dark.
We hope to raise awareness of both Earth Hour itself and the WWF aims and values locally within our community. We want to do our bit in helping save the planet and show the Guides that you do not need to use so much electricity. We hope this event will inspire other local Guide, Brownie and Rainbow units to do the same and make this an annual event.
I run a social enterprise called the Gastro Hub in Folkestone aiming to connect people through sustainable food, cooking, conversation and communal dining experiences. Our overall mission is to reduce avoidable food waste and carbon emissions by preventing surplus food from going to landfill, through a community-led infrastructure to divert and transform this food into delicious and nutritious meals. 
For Earth Hour we are hosting a community candlelit supper serving warming soup made with surplus vegetables rescued from farms by the Gleaning Network in Kent. We are hoping to spread awareness of the individual and collective power we have to affect change on our environment. By bringing local people together in a way that demonstrates simple actions we can all take to reduce our carbon footprint, we hope that it will inspire a positive behaviour shift-change in others.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/23/its-more-than-just-turning-off-the-lights-what-else-to-do-for-earth-hour

He is giving us what should be considered front-page news and his few column inches must be expanded into a longer article that fully explains the science and mechanism behind the two unprecedented weather events of the past three weeks, when London was colder than the north pole.
Climate change, bringing Arctic meltdown, has serious global effects which mean very much more than the extinction of polar bears. Climatologists have long been warning of new atmospheric conditions which make freak events the new normal. The latest by Jennifer Francis comes in the April edition of Scientific American, which predicts massive coastal flooding within the next 20 years. In the short term, however, we should be concerned about the return of more “beast” events next month or even in May, when plant growth will be in full swing. Imagine the effect on food production.Dr Tim MegarryLondon

While as obsessive as the next researcher, I'm hardly monomaniacal when it comes to CO2 as a cause of global warming. I'm too wide ranging in my interests for that.
I saw 100 million year old osteichthyan fossils (bones only, so no indication of colour) in an area flooded by sea level rise following global warming. CO2 was involved then as was the placement of continents and other land masses around Antarctica. Tectonic removal of one such land mass leading to the development of the circum-Antarctic current and a significant drop in atmospheric CO2 led to global cooling 70 million years later; and led with the assistance of cyclic variations in Southern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation Antarctic to widespread continental glaciation on the great southern continent. Changes in Atlantic currents following the growth of the Isthmus of Panama and a decline from higher Pliocene CO2 levels led, in combination with variations in Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation (NHHLSI), to the glacial and interglacial periods of the last 2.6 million years. Each deglacial warming that transitioned from glacial to interglacial over thousands of years while initiated by NHHLSI was largely carried out by CO2. So a wide ranging view of the evidence for the causes of global warming shows that CO2 often plays a major part.
This time NHHLSI is declining and no other likely suspects have panned out; but CO2 has increased by 40% since the 19th century.

You go to some great length to make the case that there is no plan and we're making this up as we go along - this is evidently not true.The National Grid says in their last update of its Future Energy Scenarios that the UK needs to build 14.5 GWe of new nuclear capacity by 2035 or it will fail to meet the Two Degrees scenario.The report points out that national electricity demand could peak at 85 GWe by 2050, compared with around 60 GWe today.In the Two Degrees scenario nuclear supplies the largest share of electricity in 2050 - 31%, with offshore wind just behind.
The national grid are quite clear on a mix being the best way to address AGW, yet in your claim, you maintain that we could do 50% of the UK demand with onshore wind.
I don't see how.

nimbys vote conservative.
BQENDNIMBYs also prefer their fracced gas to be imported and probably wouldn't be happy covering the UK with thousands of miles of additional power pylons inherent to a low density grid, let alone WTs over our windiest landscapes which tend to be national parks
I'm not at all sure that's the sole domain of the Tories.
For example, the reason I'm happy with fraccing in the UK isn't because I'm not a Tory/NIMBY it's because I trust the scientists and geologists who say that it is fine and I trust the scientists who say that importing gas from Qatar and the Americas is considerably worse for the environment.NIMBYs need to accept that we are all on the same planet.
Similarly I believe that the Highlands of Scotland and the Cumbrian lakes and mountains are better served by not covering them in power pylons and WTs (I have no problem with them but they do not add to a bucolic landscape) - nuclear is a safe low carbon way of avoiding the blight of power lines and it requires little or no gas.That is also a good thing.

According to ONR Nugen were/are 'intending' to get a licence - they are not actually in the middle of the process- or started it.First Westinghouse Toshiba were struggling to sell and make a profit from their reactor- the company was/is in a bad shape, and the root to all of these corporate issues is the cash tried up. Debt is not a problem if you have willing investors or willing banks- westinghouse has neither.
and here is the confusion- it is Nugen who calm its investors by saying just a few months ago that Kepco was willing to step in and it was made clear they were not going to step in and build a westinghouse design.
way back in 2010 [if not before ] the UK govt had the intent to replace the old fleet [and that was supposed to happen 2023-25] and have 50% or so more nuclear by 2025.
Currently it is only EDF who are committed to building 3.2 GWthere may be plenty of intent- and plenty of serious interest.According to your ONR link it is only Anglesea that has actual paper work being processed.
and that is the state of new nuclearby 2030 the UK will have lost 9-10 GW of nuclear.will definitely have Hinkley [unless EDF really screw it up and even the EDF execs have warned this project could 'bankrupt' them- although the French govt has bailed half the industry].Anglesea looks promising with another 2.5 GW Everyone else is very interested- even very very interested with a bucketful of intentbut one of them are in the bag.On a purely business level - right or wrong- the market sees offshore wind having no problem securing investment. There are no deals going on [such as with nugen] for the government to offer cheap loans and investment guarantees.nuclear is going to the govt with a legitimate USP- low carbon 24/7 but it comes at a cost.Of course the UK's is doing the most expensive thing- having one of every design instead of 10 reactors of the same design.I suppose it made some kind of sense- not putting all the eggs in one basket.
But if the nuclear industry fails it will be because of the nuclear industry. I really don't know which way it is going to play out - but something will happen in the next decade.On a language level the objective is not to cut CO2, that is the aim- the general intent. The objective in the UK is to do it using the market, to take the risk, to do it in a way that spreads risk- i.e. one each of every reactor, and wind and ... and ...etc. To keep the voters happy, without frightening the consumer- and sadly to appear like a good AGW fighting country so as to not lose face on the global stage.The quickest and cheapest route is 50% or so of onshore wind- after that it gets tricky but it would make a massive contribution- but nimbys vote conservative.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1522078529000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'the nuclear industry', u'effect': u'it will be'}], u'author_id': u'4738374', u'in_reply_to': u'114021812', u'id': u'114028664', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'SunRoad', u'text': u'BQSTART

BQEND From the Guardian article-
BQSTART
EDF confirmed the first reactor – originally due to become operational by the end of 2025 – risked being 15 months late and might not start generating electricity until 2027. The second unit is estimated to face a nine-month delay.
BQEND
And in your imagination you think this statement is untrue and from the coal lobby?
And with the exception of Sizewell the UK fleet is 70s and 80s built AGRs- they are coming to the end of their lives- that is 7 1.2 GW reactors closing with the latest ones built being the latest to shutdown. Unlike the PWR they are dogs - advanced versions of the old Magnox reactors and their operation was extended 7 years from 2023. Torness and Heysham were completed in 1988- so at 42 years they are at the end of their lives.And here is the official EDF summary of the decommissioning process.
So that is a total of 8 GW.
EDF reckon on 2027 for the first reactor at 1.6 GW at Hinkley.unit 2 - is a year later- but a 9 month delay was announced by EDF- but perhaps it will be 2028 + 1.6
Total 3.2In the meantime 5 of the 7 AGR will have been shut- leaving 3GW or so- and Hinkley does not make up the shortfall.
And perhaps EDF have learnt their lesson in not screwing up builds- Finland = 10 years behind schedule. France= 7 years behind Schedule. China = 7 years late.
Moorside was supposed be ready by 2025- but they have changed design, and builders - no firm date or strike price has been announced.Sizewell has been put on hold to see how well Hinkley goes- this is a EDF announcement.And Anglesey - we again have no actual start time.
If they are completed before 2030-the total GW is 3.2 for Hinkley, 3 GW for Anglesea, 3.2 GW for Sellafield [windscale/ Moorside] and 1.6 for Sizewell = 11 GW as well as a 10 year extension for Sizewell B at 1.2
12 GW = and currently its about 9 now - so total addition of new nuclear = 3 GW

faboulous- it seems everything is going to plan- except Moorside is not building AP1000 given westinghouse is bankrupt-
BQEND
BQENDOkay, this is where your much vaunted expertise as a landscape gardener comes into the fore.
NuGen is 60% Toshiba, not Westinghouse and Chapter 11 protection from bankruptcy isn't bankruptcy as the UK usually sees it.fyi, I have worked for two Ch.11 companies that emerged successfully as major companies.fyi2: the AP1000 licence and design does not simply evaporate as you appear to think it should - even if Westinghouse went bankrupt in the UK sense, it is still a transferable asset.

-The UK is installing a mix of renewables and nuclear - you may not like the plan, but it is the only reason we are coming off coal by 2025. 
BQSTART
quite plainly you just can't do basic arithmetic . if you think 1.6 GW replaces 6 GW no one can help you- 2 and 2 can never equal 4 in your world
BQEND
BQENDAgain, you appear to be confused.
Firstly, coal demand in 2025 will not be the same as now - we aim to be mostly off it by 2022.
Think it through.
Secondly, yes, my OP was that we are installing a MIX of renewables and nuclear. Nuclear is currently circa 20% of our supply.
It is that MIX that enables us to come off coal and gas - obviously coal is the main one we want to come off first - as a ""baseload"" provider it is most displaced by another ""baseload"" provider such as nuclear and biomass - although I hesitate to call Biomass a green technology.
Similarly intermittent renewables complement (to a degree) gas which is a more dynamic supply.If we decided to remove it or not replace it then, like Germany we would be forced to remain using coal and gas for 'baseload' provision for an indeterminate period -possibly to 2050.
As Germany has discovered, you cannot simply swap a high availability dispatchable power source for an intermittent one.This isn't lawnmowers.
BQSTART
Meanwhile offshore wind say they are going to do it, and do it- I'm sure you would be the first to crow at any delay or budget over run.
BQENDNo, because I support a MIX of renewables and nuclear.
You and Marty have this obsessive view on a 'battle' between renewables -vs- nuclear as if they're opposing football teams.It so misses the point.
Could EDF overrun their schedule at HPC?Yes, it's entirely possible - and that would be a shame, just as much as if investment falls for renewables once the guaranteed subsidy tapers off.

this thread is not about my opinion on nuclear it is your false impression -2025 may see Hinkley unit 1 may come on line- = 1.6 GW but before then AGRs are being decommissioned- 5 of them at 1.2GW each= 6 GW, so by 2025 if the nation is lucky Hinkley unit will be running- and just because all the other EPRs are 7 years or more behind schedule - they may get it right the 5th and 6th time. and one EPR is 1.6 GW- not going to make much of dent in 6GW shut down in 2023I don't know and you don't know, no one can say for certain the other 4 will actually come on line.The other builds have not even started, you seem to mis understand what the word 'proposal' is- and one company went bankrupt in the process- so if it works out then by 2030 old nuclear is replaced- with possible a 50% expansion. But coal is on the way out- and it is not currently being replaced with nuclear.
But do carry on living in your fantasy land- AGRs will go on for decades, EDF will build on time, all these other companies are just itching to get started and do it all for £60 MWhalthough CGN has not been approved, or the Korean design- but Sizewell looks promising- if they build Hinkley.You may be convinced that it is all perfect, but your opinion hardly matters- politicians look on and wait to see what happens- EDF screw this up then there may be a lot of cynicism.Meanwhile offshore wind say they are going to do it, and do it- I'm sure you would be the first to crow at any delay or budget over run.

We now know celebrations should be put on hold. Figures for 2017 published last week show global emissions from energy have jumped back up again, to a historic high.
The data from the International Energy Agency shows we still have much to do when it comes to stopping global warming. Three years ago experts cautioned that 2015’s near standstill in emissions might be only a temporary pause before resuming the upward march as India and China developed. Those warnings were prophetic.
Global energy demand last year grew by 2.1%, more than double the rate in 2016, driven largely by Asia. The problem for the climate is that more than 70% of the growth came from fossil fuels. Gas was the fastest-growing fossil fuel. But even coal, the most carbon-intensive fuel, reversed two years of declines and was up by 1%, as coal burning in China, India and South Korea grew.
To compound matters, progress on energy efficiency slowed dramatically in the face of lower energy prices and weakening government policy. On the plus side, renewables were the fastest-growing source of new energy and had another unprecedented year. China added as much solar power in a single year as the total installed capacity across France and Germany. The US scored the steepest drop in emissions, despite Donald Trump’s first year as president, as new renewable generation bloomed.
Indeed, with renewables records being broken seemingly every week – last weekend the UK set a new high for wind power – it is easy to think the fight has been won. But the IEA’s work is a sobering reminder that stratospheric growth in renewables is not enough. Renewables put a brake on emissions but they don’t stop coal, oil and gas from being dug out of the ground.
The most sobering figure in the agency’s research is 81%: the amount of global energy that comes from fossil fuels. It’s been about the same for the past three decades.
So, if the energy sector is still nowhere near compatible with the demands of climate science, and the goals set by nearly 200 governments in Paris three years ago, what do we do?
Despair is not an option, and there are reasons for hope. One is Beijing’s self-interest in tackling air quality, which means coal plant closures and bans, and the promotion of electric cars. India, the coal industry’s last great hope, has witnessed a faster than expected rise in solar power, squeezing out coal projects. Germany’s new government finally has plans to tackle the country’s outmoded reliance on coal. Globally, coal capacity will begin shrinking in 2022 at the current rate of retirements, according to a new report.
Arguably the brightest and most promising trend is that renewables are on the brink of being economically viable without government subsidies. In the UK alone, an estimated £20bn worth of wind and solar farms could be built without subsidies between now and 2030.
This year the UN is undertaking a stocktake of countries’ climate plans and it should keep the IEA numbers at the forefront of its thinking.
But getting to the top of the carbon emission mountain and down again will not be achieved solely with more favourable economics and stronger government support.
Leaders must take the much more politically difficult decision to penalise fossil fuels. The means are many: economy-wide carbon taxes are an obvious one that many energy firms claim to support. Bans on extraction of fossil fuels are a more extreme example. We must vote for those politicians who are bold enough to do this. We must renew pressure on them to say no to dirty energy, as well as yes to clean energy. Only then do we have a hope of permanently reducing emissions.
Next boss Lord Wolfson has described 2017 as “the most challenging year we have faced for 25 years”. It was quite a statement from Wolfson, the FTSE’s second longest-serving chief executive (after WPP’s Martin Sorrell), who has a reputation for being restrained and serious-minded.
But the problems facing the high street are mounting. Last week there was a raft of bad news – New Look is closing 60 stores, axing 980 staff and cutting rent payments to landlords. Carpetright is likely to close 100 stores and also wants rent cuts. Mothercare is in talks with its banks to restructure its finances. There was a grim profits warning from Moss Bros while Conviviality – the firm behind Bargain Booze – said it needed to find £125m or was likely to go bust.
All this a few weeks after Maplin and Toys R Us collapsed into administration. Debenhams and House of Fraser also have difficulties. Each, of course, has its own problems: mountainous debts, unpaid tax bills, or merely buying the wrong stock.
But there are also major behavioural and structural issues – like the shift away from shopping towards leisure spending. Barclaycard data shows spending on women’s clothing was down 3% last year, while spending on pubs, restaurants and entertainment was up more than 10%.
Then there is the massive shift to buying online – and its impact on the bottom line. Next lost £141m of full-price high street sales last year, which resulted in lost profits of £85m. At the same time online sales rose £167m – but that generated only £32m of extra profit. So every pound lost on the high street costs the firm 60p of profit, while a pound gained online generates only 19p.
That is serious margin erosion, which many store chains and retail landlords have yet to fully acknowledge and prepare for.
As is often the case with Donald Trump, he might think his stand against Chinese “economic aggression” will add to his reputation as a wildcard US president breaking with convention to get results.
But as has been the case before in his presidency, he ought to be more careful. Trump’s latest move of economic gunboat diplomacy – to impose punitive tariffs on up to $60bn (£42bn) of annual imports from China on certain goods – could be his biggest gamble yet.
Although the plan is to protect American manufacturers from being undercut by Chinese producers, most economists reckon it could push up prices for US consumers and lead to a damaging trade war.
Should China retaliate by imposing tariffs on US imports of soya beans or aircraft parts, as has been suggested, that would also unpick any benefit Trump may derive from imposing tariffs on China. Farmers and ranchers in the south, some of his biggest supporters, would be hardest hit.
In effect, the president is starting a giant game of economic whack-a-mole: he may find a way to fix one problem only for another, potentially greater, to emerge.
Trump has legitimate cause for concern when it comes to Chinese trade practices. China’s protectionist policies and state support for industry make it hard for other countries to compete on the world stage. The US had a record $375bn trade deficit with China last year, which made up two-thirds of a global $566bn US trade gap with the rest of the world. Chinese use of western intellectual property also undercuts US firms.
But Trump’s unilateralism risks alienating European allies from whom he might have found support for taking multilateral action against China. Throwing the EU a temporary reprieve from higher steel tariffs will not be enough to secure solid support from Brussels.
Past experience suggests trade wars can have damaging consequences, while even moderate barriers erected by several nations at once could disrupt the complex global supply chains built up in recent decades.
The world should hope Trump’s latest steps follow another well-worn path of his presidency so far: tough talk followed by measures falling short of the rhetoric.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/25/renewables-good-news-heat-on-cut-fossil-fuel-use

Well the most obvious example is when the govt mandates the construction of low-carbon generation and finances it directly. As, for example, France did. It was a strategic decision to get off reliance on oil. And it is the only way any major economy has successfully decarbonised its electricity. It seems to produce a faster result than leaving it to the market.
Countries in the middle east are taking a similar approach. Although they are tendering via private companies, they are specifying the technologies that are to be deployed (nuclear and solar).

The UK having a carbon floor price has been very effective in driving coal out of our generation mix.
BQEND
But ironically it just shifts emission to elsewhere in the ETS.
If carbon pricing was working you would expect carbon prices to be going up significantly. We are, after all, at another global record high for carbon emissions.
The ETS has been running for over a decade; but we are a decade closer to catastrophe with no global reduction in emissions; and yet the ETS carbon price is still low - in fact it is trending down.
Now of course this could just be because the pricing mechanism is not designed properly: it is a market for Europe, yet the problem is global emissions. But this is one of my problems with the market-based approach - it seems impossible, or at least very difficult, to make a market that works for this problem.
My second problem is that it is fundamentally impossible to know the true price of carbon. We cannot know the true price without knowing the future. And without having transparent knowledge of the true price of carbon, the market cannot work reliably.
The third problem is that even if the market worked, its optimum solution would be to only-just avert catastrophe, and delay action as long as possible. For example, assume we have a crystal ball that unerringly tells us the optimum solution is to emit exactly X gigatons of carbon; then a perfect market would end up emitting X gigatons (any more would have extra catastrophic costs; any less wastes money on unnecessary mitigation measures).
The combination of the fact that the market must be imperfect (because we can't know the true carbon price); and the fact that it is aiming to spend the least necessary to meet the goal; sounds to me like a high risk recipe for disaster.
In summary, it seems hard to design a market that works; and even if we did, the market would be trying to do as little as necessary, when we can never be truly sure how ""little"" that is.

“Still, those renewables will comprise less than 10% of the overall energy picture, even projected 30 years out!

BQEND
You may be right that exorbitant subsidies will slow down the move to renewables.
The combined IEA and OECD estimates for fossil fuel subsidies among 76 economies totals between USD 370 and 620 billion over the period 2010-2015.As ScienceDirect reports : Estimated subsidies are $4.9 trillion worldwide in 2013 and $5.3 trillion in 2015 (6.5% of global GDP in both years). Undercharging for global warming accounts for 22% of the subsidy in 2013, air pollution 46%, broader vehicle externalities 13%, supply costs 11%, and general consumer taxes 8%. China was the biggest subsidizer in 2013 ($1.8 trillion), followed by the United States ($0.6 trillion), and Russia, the European Union, and India (each with about $0.3 trillion). Eliminating subsidies would have reduced global carbon emissions in 2013 by 21% and fossil fuel air pollution deaths 55%, while raising revenue of 4%, and social welfare by 2.2%, of global GDP.
Fossil fuel companies are benefitting from global subsidies of $5.3tn (£3.4tn) a year, equivalent to $10m a minute every day, according to a startling new estimate by the International Monetary Fund.
The IMF calls the revelation “shocking” and says the figure is an “extremely robust” estimate of the true cost of fossil fuels. The $5.3tn subsidy estimated for 2015 is greater than the total health spending of all the world’s governments.

But that's precisely the point: While the resistor is 100% efficient at CREATING heat from electricity, the heat pump isn't CREATING heat, it's merely MOVING it (pumping it) from one place to another and that doesn't require as much electricity. That's where Coefficient of Performance comes in: That number represents how much MORE heat the heat pump can move (as a multiple) than would be CREATED by the equivalent amount of electricity run through a 100% efficient resistor.
Again: Moving existing heat is cheaper than generating it.

The Uk coal generators can transfer permits to elsewhere in Europe, and the carbon is emitted there. That's the problem.

BQSTART
It just cannot be known. That is the entire problem.
BQEND
I'm not sure I agree with this. The price should be set at a level where the modelled impact on generation, transport, agriculture etc brings a downward curve on emissions that matches the need to meet the Paris commitments. And as we know, the Paris commitments are intended to be ratcheted up, so they become more and more stringent. In the same way, the price for carbon won't be constant. It should become more and more expensive so that ultimately it becomes unaffordable for any major sector to emit significant amounts of carbon. I don't believe it is impossible to devise a pricing mechanism that reflects this. It won't be perfect, but as long as it is flexible - within reasonable constraints - it can deliver on what we need.

These ARE all market mechanisms. Let's look at the first as an example. Suppose we told the automotive industry that we were going to ban all ICEs by 2040 in the UK. Oh -
we've already done it. We've sent a signal to the market about how a whole industry has to behave - with a clear time limit. Suppose we said the same to homeowners : that all oil and gas heating would become illegal from 2040. That is a massive signal to the market for ASHPs, GSHPs and hydrogen heating that there will be a market for them.....anf they will invest accordingly.

The taxpayer received the income from the public operation of the Magnox powerstations; and the early operation of AGRs. About 20% of all UK electricity for 30 years or so.

This is such hogwash. You have no concern for others' belief structures, which is made evident by your comment. You discredit anything with which you disagree by making comments such as this, vs. just saying you disagree. That is a true symptom of extremism....close-minded, unwilling to accept conversation, and assume the other individual is making up issues because they're ""out of other arguments.""
It's so obvious that extremism prevents real solutions, as is evident by this approx. 30 year debate about how to transition from fossil fuels. Extremists on both sides have seized the debate, belittled each other vs. working to compromise.

This is a rather disingenuous comment. Anyone who makes the effort will know what the lifetime CO2e figures are for renewables, nuclear, gas and coal (as the major sources). I'm sure you know perfectly well that the IPCC figures are summarised
here.
Onshore wind is lower than nuclear (taking the median figure) and offshore is the same. They are all massively lower than fossil fuels.

It also shows that lignite use continues unabated.

The two energy sources I am most interested in are wind and solar power; however, there are other sources that have great potential.
Some people doubt how much wind and solar can supply to a country’s electricity grid. This is a particularly challenging question to answer in part because both solar power and wind power fluctuate in both space and time. We all know solar panels work well during the day, when the sun shines – they don’t work so well at night. And wind turbines only send electrons when the wind is blowing. 
Fortunately, these two sources of energy fluctuate in ways that complement each other. For instance, solar power generation is highest in the summer and lowest in the winter. Wind power is greatest in the spring and fall. Wind turbines work at night when solar panels are dormant. So, can these complementing variations help balance out the power that the two technologies can provide? 
This question was addressed in a very recent paper published in the journal Energy and Environmental Science. The author list included Dr. Ken Caldeira, who is extremely well known for his years of work in environmental science and energy.
The authors analyzed 36 years of hourly weather data (1980–2015) in the US. They calculated the available wind and solar power over this time period and also included the electrical demand in the US and its variation throughout the year.
With this information, the researchers considered two scenarios. In scenario 1, they imagined wind and solar installations that would be sufficient to supply 100% of the US electrical needs. In the second scenario, the installations would be over-designed; capable of providing 150% of the total U.S. electrical need. But the authors recognize that just because a solar panel or a wind turbine can provide all our energy, it doesn’t mean that will happen in reality. It goes back to the prior discussion that sometimes the wind just doesn’t blow, and sometimes the sun isn’t shining.
With these two scenarios, the authors then considered different mixes of power, from all solar to all wind. They also included the effect of aggregation area, that is, what sized regions are used to generate power. Is your power coming from wind and solar in your neighborhood, your city, your state or your region?
The authors found that with 100% power capacity and no mechanism to store energy, a wind-heavy portfolio is best (about 75% wind, 25% solar) and using large aggregate regions is optimal. It is possible to supply about 75-80% of US electrical needs. If the system were designed with excess capacity (the 150% case), the US could meet about 90% of its needs with wind and solar power.
The authors recognized that sometimes these systems generate too much power to be used. Under this situation, you could store the energy for later use. Imagine a solar panel generating excess energy during the day and able to store that power for night use. Power can be stored in several ways, for example in batteries or by pumping water into elevated tanks and then letting the water fall at night and turn a turbine. 
The authors modified their study to allow up to 12 hours of US energy storage. They then found that the 100% capacity system fared even better (about 90% of the country’s energy) and the optimal balance was now more solar (approximately 70% solar and 30% wind). For the over-capacity system, the authors found that virtually all the country’s power needs could be met with wind, solar, and storage.
This study considered only wind and solar. If other sources, such as hydroelectricity, biofuels, or even nuclear power were added, it would be relatively straightforward to reach 100% clean energy. Furthermore, people are learning to use energy more wisely, either by using more efficient products or purchasing electricity during off-peak hours. These behavioral changes can also help us reach a 100% clean energy target.
The point is, the use of clean energy to power an entire country (or a group of countries) is achievable. It’s no longer viable to say “we can’t.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/26/study-wind-and-solar-can-power-most-of-the-united-states

But the state is losing land to the seas at such a gallop that even its seemingly impregnable landmarks are now threatened.
The home of Tabasco, the now ubiquitous but uniquely branded condiment controlled by the same family since Edmund McIlhenny first stumbled across a pepper plant growing by a chicken coop on Avery Island, is under threat. An unimaginable plight just a few years ago, the advancing tides are menacing its perimeter. 
“It does worry us, and we are working hard to minimise the land loss,” said Tony Simmons, the seventh consecutive McIlhenny family member to lead the company. “We want to protect the marsh because the marsh protects us.” 
I mean, we could make Tabasco somewhere else. But this is more than a business,​ this is our home
Simmons allows a silent pause as he mulls a situation where Tabasco is forced off the island. “We don’t think it will come to that, but we are working to do everything we can to make sure it won’t happen to us,” he said. “I mean, we could make Tabasco somewhere else. But this is more than a business: this is our home.” 
A geologic oddity, Avery Island rises to 163ft above sea level, making it a towering giant amid the supine flatness of Louisiana’s coast. The 2,200-acre island – more accurately a hill of buried salt surrounded by bayou and marsh a couple of miles inland from Vermilion Bay, an inlet of the Gulf of Mexico – has long provided a sturdy home to Tabasco but now faces the danger of being marooned.
The Avery Island marshes are retreating by around 30ft a year as salt water seeps in, ushered in by canals dug by the oil and gas industry and the level of the land itself, which is gradually sinking by around a third of an inch a year. The salty brine kills off vegetation, loosens soils and accelerates erosion. 
Fierce storms clatter into what’s left of the marsh, which is also being slowly drowned by a warming ocean that’s rising faster than almost anywhere else in the world. A further sea level increase of 2ft, almost certain given the warming that’s already occurred, will leave only the lofty core of Avery Island dry, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
 “The marsh stands between us and Vermilion Bay, and we don’t want to be right on the bay,” Simmons said. “We have to be very aggressive about dealing with the land loss. We almost can’t work fast enough.”
 The threat posed to Tabasco is replicated along much of Louisiana’s coast, where a football field of land is lost every 100 minutes. Around 2,000 sq miles of land, roughly the size of Delaware, has vanished from the state since the 1930s due to a cocktail of maladies and self-inflicted wounds, stemming from the overdevelopment of the Mississippi river and an unquestioning embrace of extractive drilling, topped off by the wrenching global consequences of climate change. 
 The US has already been stripped of half of its wetlands since Europeans arrived and Louisiana, which accounts for a bulk of these losses, is on course to lose all of its wetland within two more centuries, according to the US Geological Survey. 
 A master plan set out by the state government last year forecast a further 2,250 sq miles of Louisiana could be lost over the next 50 years, forcing 27,000 buildings to be flood-proofed, elevated or bought out.
 The plan sets out billions of dollars in work building protective seawalls, restoring marshland and increasing the amount of nourishing sediment carried to wetlands by the Mississippi, which hasn’t been left to meander naturally since New Orleans was established 300 years ago. Thousands of people still face being relocated, but while state authorities have acknowledged this fate they have yet to grapple with the vast cost and emotional whiplash it will entail. 
 “You go to Plaquemines parish and people will say they are already flood-proofed because they can pull their boat up to their door,” said Rudy Simoneaux, an engineer at the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority. “It asks a lot of a shrimper or a crabber to relocate inland to Baton Rouge. They depend on the water. People are prepared to just rebuild and rebuild.”
 The western half of Louisiana, where Avery Island sits, is particularly vulnerable as it is starved of the wetland-creating sediment dispersed by the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers. There “aren’t many options” for the region under the master plan, Simoneaux conceded.
 “The area doesn’t have the materials to build wetlands – it has been torn to pieces by canals and pipelines and it has no natural barriers, so hurricanes come pounding in unobstructed,” said Oliver Houck, an expert in land loss at Tulane University.
 “It is a ripped-up rug. It would take decades to put it back together, even without sea level rise. Avery Island is going to become an actual island, there won’t be much left. The state has decided to put all its eggs into restoring the eastern part of the state. I hate to use the words ‘written off’, but those coastal communities are on their own.”
 Unlike nearby residents who have resorted to rudimentary house elevations to stay above the foaming surf, the McIlhenny company has financial muscle to swing at its relentless foe. After Hurricane Rita turned much of the Tabasco production area into a pond in 2005, the company erected a 17ft earth levee, complete with pump system, to wrap the red brick factory in a protective hug. 
 It has thrown itself into the task of wetland restoration by planting hardy cord grasses, refilling canals and erecting weirs that halt the advance of salt water. Wildlife, such as black bears, alligators and snowy egrets, have a protected area to roam on the island. 
Climate change has cast a shadow over several everyday staples, menacing the production of chocolate, the harvesting of hops for beer, the growing of coffee beans. Tabasco has no plans to join this list, with the company insisting the production of its peppers isn’t at risk and that its ancestral home can be safeguarded. 
 “We worry about anything that impacts our land,” said Simmons, a craggy, genial man who wears pressed trousers and slathers Tabasco sauce on virtually any food bar his morning cereal. Paintings of peppers are displayed alongside the wooden ducks that sprout from his shooting trophies. “That’s why we are working so hard on this.” 
Pepper plants used to blanket the slopes of Avery Island until the 1960s, when the property switched to seed cultivation and shifted the bulk-growing and mashing of peppers to various South American countries. The pulped peppers return to Avery Island and are aged for three years in stacked oak barrels towering in a pungent, cobwebbed warehouse before salt and vinegar is added in huge vats.
 Today, this company that was born shortly after the death of slavery pushes 750,000 bottles of product off its rattling production line each day, levered into cardboard boxes by mechanical arms and sent to more than 185 countries – the Japanese are particularly voracious consumers, dousing pizzas and spaghetti. 
 Throngs of tourists visit a museum and shop that plays off this heritage. Many of them come straight from the other attraction two hours’ drive to the east, New Orleans, which itself faces an existential crisis despite its huge investment in protective levees after Hurricane Katrina crunched into the city in 2005.
 The problem is apparent from the air, with much of the wetland that would buffer New Orleans from another Katrina in a state of decay, rotting and curling up like chewed cloth, dotted by boats and trucks that were swept away by the huge storm and never salvaged.
 “We’ve had 300 years of bad decisions,” said David Muth, director of Gulf restoration at the National Wildlife Federation. The lower reaches of the Mississippi have long been aggressively channeled via levees and other barriers, with this process accelerating in the 1930s after a major flood prompted Congress to authorise further intervention. Distributaries were severed and wetlands were drained or cut apart for farming, cypress logging and oil and gas drilling. 
The result has been the choking off of sediment carried by the river to the marshes, causing the delta peat, grass and shrubs to dissolve away to open water in places. 
 Meanwhile, New Orleans drained swamps for housing developments that now sit below sea level behind levees. 
 “This area has been neglected for so long,” said Happy Johnson, head of a community sustainability group in the Lower Ninth Ward neighborhood, worst damaged by the hurricane. He is concerned about lack of consultation locally.
“There is very little trust in the government because there isn’t consistent engagement with communities of colour. New Orleans is 60% black. How can you restore the wetlands and not have black and brown people involved? You can’t save a place with half the people.”
 There are signs of hope, at least environmentally. Recent diversions of sediment have provided a jolt of growth to patches of the delta, a restoration that would be further bolstered by the master plan’s projects. 
The branching wetlands, with white pelicans soaring overhead, remain an ecological wonder, persisting despite the scars of pipelines and the ongoing plight of its native communities, such as Isle de Jean Charles, that will be among the first climate change refugees in the US.

For the first time, the Anglo Dutch firm, which is facing calls by activist shareholders to take stronger action on global warming, has mapped out how the world could hit the Paris climate deal’s target of keeping temperature rises below 2C.
While development of hydrogen cars has stalled in the face of rapid growth in battery-electric vehicles, Shell believes the gas could account for 10% of global energy consumption by the end of the century.
The company’s Sky scenario, published on Monday, envisages that as fossil fuel use declines, old oil and gas facilities will be repurposed for hydrogen storage and transport.
Shell has no large scale hydrogen production but is a major player in natural gas, from which hydrogen can be made. The company launched its first hydrogen refuelling point in the UK last year and on Tuesday will open a second at a service station in Buckinghamshire.
The scenario envisages the first intercontinental hydrogen flight in 2040. By 2070, the majority of trucks will be powered by hydrogen or batteries, as Tesla is planning.
Shell sees oil demand stagnating in the 2020s, followed by gas demand falling rapidly from 2040 as competition from renewables bites. 
Many power grids will be forced by legislation to become entirely run off solar, wind and hydro power by 2040. But the biggest impact from governments will come from carbon taxes or prices put in place by 2030 across rich countries and China.

There is a backlash in Wales after a World Wide Fund for Nature report placed lamb cawl top of a list of British dishes ranked by carbon footprint.
A single bowl of the traditional meat and veg affair produces 5.9 kilos of CO2 emissions, equivalent to 71 plastic bottles, 65 days of an LED lightbulb being switched on, 258 kettle boils, 31 miles in a car, or 722 smartphone charges – and way more than the other dishes the study looked at (fish and chips, chicken tikka masala and a ploughman’s).
The big problem in the cawl is, sure enough, the lamb, which the report says accounts for more than three-quarters of the dish’s impact, largely due to farting sheep (hello methane). The National Farmers’ Union Cymru said it was “astonished” at the findings, claiming the report makes unfair comparisons.
While that row simmers, what are the dishes we can eat safe in the knowledge of their baby-sized carbon footprints? The WWF study offers some general guidance, including a call for eating less meat. Lamb and beef are the worst offenders, thanks to their methane emissions and high demands on land. So more plants, and alternative sources of proteins such as peas, beans and nuts. “It’s basically about eating less processed food, less meat, and more local food,” says Tony Juniper, head of campaigns at WWF. “We’re not trying to preach but to lay out the facts and explain our choices.”
There is no definitive ranking of the dishes with the lightest footprint, but Bon Appetit, an American chain of sustainable cafes, worked with the Ecotrust charity to suggest dishes based on assessments of the impacts of their ingredients over their life cycles (including the energy used in production and transportation, as well as fertiliser use).
The results, available at the Eat Low Carbon website, are as wholesome as you might imagine. Top of the list: a three bean soup, with CO2 emissions of just 54 grams per portion. Then comes lentil soup, homemade crisps and – a rare meat appearance – grilled wild salmon (locally sourced, naturally). Falafel, steamed veg and hummus also feature.

His book The Population Bomb predicted starvation in the 1970s, something that was avoided by the “green revolution” in intensive agriculture. The green revolution was the point at which farmers turned away from natural techniques (eg mixed farms and crop rotation) and instead started using chemical fertilisers and pesticides along with hybrid plants whose seeds could often not be harvested for re-use. This led to higher yields at first, but then to exhausted and polluted soil and increasing debt to suppliers.
The role of the green revolution was to “delay the calamity”. But at a great cost to nature. So what was humankind’s reaction to these developments? Instead of stopping to take stock, we became addicted to the consumerist traits of “cheap and abundant” with no thought for the real cost and inherent risk.
The world is now moving into further “revolutions” involving GM crops, the establishment of mega-farms and digitalisation. For me these are newer, more aggressive techniques for “overdrawing our account” with the natural world. And everyone knows that a surefire way to ultimate calamity is to try to pay a debt by taking on more debt.
Hats off to Paul Ehrlich but shame on the human race.Alan MitchamCologne, Germany
• It is depressing to see the Guardian recycling Paul Ehrlich’s discredited views. The key fact of contemporary population trends is that the birth rate in the developing world is now lower than it was in rich countries a few decades ago. There are no good estimates of the population-carrying capacity of our planet, but it is almost certainly well above the likely peak of population that will be reached in the second half of this century. Reducing the vast global inequalities in energy consumption will do far more for the environment than the ultimately racist idea that the poor have too many children.Prof John MacInnesCentre for Population Change, University of Edinburgh
• Paul Ehrlich’s prediction of half a century ago – of the end of civilisation in a decade or two – may be the most obvious aspect of his theory, but it is not the most fundamental. Far more important is his failure to recognise that what he calls the “perpetual growth of human enterprise” is linked not to human activities as such, but to the economic system of capitalism whose raison d’etre is profit making. Every time goods or services are sold, profit is made which is then reinvested to start another cycle of profit making.
This process takes place regardless of whether the profit is directly reinvested to make more commodities, or indirectly by passing it on to others to invest by purchasing their goods or services or by depositing it into a bank which lends it to others to invest. It follows that economic growth and its complementary growth in consumption, what he calls overconsumption, are byproducts of profit making and if they are to be unnecessary, then we have to do away with profit making altogether.Fawzi IbrahimAuthor, Capitalism Versus Planet Earth
• Paul Ehrlich’s views on population are understandable although such concerns go back millennia. The elephant in the room is that human numbers will only fall if deaths exceed births; we can all complain about other people’s kids but contemplating our own obituary is less popular.
A further concern is squeezing the same population into less space. Climate change is now being fuelled by emissions from melting ice sheets and their knock-on effects; these could easily outweigh reductions from human emissions. Huge numbers of climate refugees may need rehousing in decades to come, to say nothing of food, clothing and the jobs required to afford decent lifestyles. Given the current attitudes to migrants, how keen will richer countries be to take people or to fund moving them to less populous but still habitable areas?Iain ClimieWhitchurch, Shropshire 
• The issue of overstretched cities is an important one (The 100 million city: is 21st century urbanisation out of control? on 1, 19 March). But it is vital not to take “extreme scenarios” as fact or as a call to drastically limit urban growth. Cities do not simply continue to grow along the lines predicted by past trends, but are affected by economic, development and ecological pressures. Urban growth can also help manage total population growth. The evidence shows that as people move into cities they have fewer children because of economic and social pressures.
The implication that African cities are exploding can have damaging consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people. It can result in governments clearing or cracking down on shanty towns and slums as an excuse to curb population growth. If Africa’s governments see urban growth as an opportunity to provide decent housing and livelihoods for their current populations, rather than panicking about what these may be in the years to come, then an urban future can be created that benefits all and ensures that no one will be left behind as cities grow.

A sharp flight from fossil fuels investments after the Paris agreement was reversed last year with a return to energy sources dubbed “extreme” because of their contribution to global emissions. This included an 11% hike in funding for carbon-heavy tar sands, as well as Arctic and ultra-deepwater oil and coal.
US and Canadian banks led a race back into the unconventional energy sector following Trump’s promise to withdraw from Paris, with JPMorgan Chase increasing its coal funding by a factor of 21, and quadrupling its tar sands assets.
Chase’s $5.6bn surge in tar sands holdings added to nearly $47bn of gains for the industry last year, according to the report by NGOs including BankTrack, the Sierra Club and Rainforest Action Network (RAN).
RAN spokeswoman, Alison Kirsch, accused banks such as JPMorgan Chase of “moving backwards in lockstep with their wrongheaded political leaders”.
“If we are to have any chance of halting catastrophic climate change, there must be an end of expansion and complete phase-out of these dangerous energy sources,” she said. “Banks need to be accountable and implement policies guarding against extreme fossil fuel funding.”
JPMorgan Chase has asked the US securities and exchanges commission for support in its bid to block a shareholder resolution calling for a bank report on financial and climate risks associated with tar sands projects.
Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto Dominion remain the biggest tar sands backers, with $38bn of holdings between them.
Kelly Martin, a campaign director at Sierra Club, said: “Tar sands and other fossil fuel projects threaten our climate, public health, and communities, and until they stop supporting them financially, major banks … are complicit in this destruction.”
The bulk of new “extreme” investments came in a doubling of loans and bonds to Canada’s government-backed tar sands industry, even though its success would be disastrous for climate mitigation efforts, according to the former Nasa chief James Hansen.
Bank funding for tar sands production and pipelines more than doubled last year – compared to the 2015-16 period, when then-US president Barack Obama nixed the Keystone pipeline project, which Trump subsequently reapproved.
Support for coal among the 36 banks surveyed was also up by 6% in 2017 after a 38% plunge in 2016. Large Chinese banks actually reduced these investments last year and in Europe, BNP Paribas and ING moved to limit their exposure to fossil fuel assets.
However, 14 European banks collectively increased their coal financing by more than $2bn last year, with HSBC the worst performer by far.
“Europe’s top banks have got to stop their coal-focused assault on the Paris agreement,” said Johan Frijns, the director of BankTrack. “It is now vital that they move to stamp out their financial support for companies developing new coal-fired power plants around the world.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/28/extreme-fossil-fuel-investments-have-surged-under-donald-trump-report-reveals

The original legislation guaranteed a grid connection, preferential dispatch, and a government-set feed-in tariff for 20 years, dependant on the technology and size of project. The scheme was funded by a surcharge on electricity consumers, with electricity-intensive manufacturers and the railways later being required to contribute as little as 0.05 ¢/kWh. For 2017, the unabated EEG surcharge is 6.88 ¢/kWh.[4] In a study in 2011[5], the average retail price of electricity in Germany , which incidentally was among the highest in the world, stood at around 35 ¢/kWh.

The transformation is placing a heavy burden on its citizens. Germany spent 25 billion euros ($26 billion) on renewable energy in 2016, most of which—23 billion euros—consumers paid through a surcharge on their electricity bills. The rise in that surcharge is the single biggest reason that the amount the average German household spent on electricity rose to 1,060 euros in 2016, up 50% from 2007.

So if you're serious about cutting emissions, and getting a start on it now, that leaves you with renewables (including hydro, geothermal, etc).

Related to this though is this idea of getting to 50% (of renewables, or CO₂ emissions reduction instead is moot), and I have no objection to rolling out renewables in regions where the current levels are trivial. The faster we get to the levels of renewables in the mix where they can't simply free ride off other sources for things like reliability, then the better it is, since those people who need to learn things in an ""experiential"" way might actually grasp some of the things they are being told today. So that's my basic motivation. I don't want these people wailing 10, 20 years down the track over ""why didn't anyone tell us this?"", when it doesn't end up working (relying totally on renewables to solve this that is). It's important for those people to know that it isn't just dumb RWNJs clinging on to climate change denial that are opposed to their equally silly ideas. Long before we get to 80% or 50% for that matter, we will need to worry about & do something on the part that isn't renewables for dealing with climate change. Given it is important, the sooner we start on that other part the better it will be. But as I've made clear, not holding my breath on that one.

Renewables coupled with storage will make coal redundant.
BQEND
What happens in a scenario where wind power runs at half or a third average for 2 weeks? Such a situation is common. You need about a week's electricity storage to make up the difference. 
If you are expecting 25 GW of wind power, and get 12 GW average over 2 weeks, you need 4.4 TWH of storage to make up the difference. That's about 34,000 batteries the size of the one Tesla recently installed in South Australia. That battery costs somewhere between $50 million and $100 million. That works out at $1.7 - $3.4 trillion.
You could try to replace batteries with pumped hydro. That's much cheaper. Snowy 2 would add 350 GWH of storage, so you'd only need about 12.5 of those, at about $5 billion each. That's ""only"" $63 billion. But that assumes there are a dozen places you could build something the size of Snowy 2, and of course there aren't. You'd end up with a lot of smaller sites and the price would be much higher.
The cheapest site identified in the UK for a future large pumped hydro scheme is Coire Glas. That would provide 30 GWH for £800 million. Australia would need 147 of them, costing £118 billion.
And then you'd face the problem of what happens if wind speeds remain low for 3 or 4 weeks instead of 2, which happens much less often, but still needs to be accounted for.
There isn't a single significantly sized country in the world running on a mix of intermittent renewables and storage. Even the places that have tried, like El Hierro in the Canary Islands, still rely on fossil fuel backup. Germany, for all the money it's spent building wind and solar, still relies on coal and lignite for firm power capacity.
If you look at the ACOLA report into a high renewables scenario for Australia it still relies on fossil fuel backup providing about 25% of supply over the year. You cannot replace reliable supply with systemically unreliable sources like wind and solar, because the cost of storage to make it work is prohibitive.
Sadly the thrust of the argument amongst renewable supporters, egged on by the anti-nuclear brigade like the Guardian, is to build wind and solar and wait until batteries become cheap enough before we get rid of coal and gas. But batteries aren't going to become cheap enough, and a mixed wind/solar/gas scenario results in emissions being far higher than required.
If you look at the countries of Europe, only 3 meet future emissions targets. Norway, which is almost entirely conventional dammed hydro, Sweden, which is a mix of conventional hydro and nuclear, and France, which is mainly nuclear. Germany, despite all the investment in intermittent renewables, has emissions roughly 10 times higher than France.
The choice is simple. To meet emissions targets you build a lot of nuclear power. That's the only technology that can currently get emissions low enough. Building wind and solar cannot, and will leave emissions 3 times higher than safe levels.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1522314724000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'the cost of storage to make it work is prohibitive', u'effect': u'you can not replace reliable supply with systemically unreliable sources like wind and solar'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'emissions'}], u'author_id': u'3522873', u'in_reply_to': u'114133815', u'id': u'114143506', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ArtistFrmlyKnwnAs', u'text': u'BQSTART

NZ for example relies mainly on oil and has just 2 coal powered stations it does still however export coal.Belgium has mainly nuclear power, and no coal power plants.California (which by the way is not a country) has only 1 coal plant.Sweden has no coal plants but a lot of nuclear.France has just 2 the rest of the power is a mix of nuclear, thermal (including a wood burning).Denmark has no coal power plants.Costa Rica no coal plants.Austria relies on 10% power from coal.Portugal has only 3 out of 27 power plants.Italy has 8 coal plans it is currently phasing out, less than 5% off their current power plants.UK have only 6 currently operating coal plants.
With the exception of Alberta in Canada which it will be interesting see if they can in fact become coal free in 12 years time since they currently rely on coal for approx. , the other countries or provinces who have signed up to this group are none reliant on coal.
Where is China, USA, India, Japan, South Africa, Poland, . What about all the other countries currently building new coal power plants, Indonesia, Vietnam, Germany, Asia, Kazakhstan , Mongolia ,Hong Kong , Botswana .e countries are reliant on coal and could never phase it out by 2030, maybe not by 2080.
Another interesting point with a number of countries and provinces who are saying they want coal phased out is they are for the most part still exporting coal, Canada, NZ, The Netherlands, all showing a complete and utter hypocrisy on them signing up to a populist organisation.
The Australian Institute is again being the propaganda arm of the ALP ,however even in Australia where we currently rely on 61% of coal plants for our power needs.
Even where there are renewables the coal power is part of the mix when the renewables do not provide stable energy needs required.

BQSTART
In the NEM, wholesale costs are generally  increasing from 2016/17 to 2017/18 and decreasing in 2018/19 and 2019/20. 
The increase from 2016/17 to 2017/18 is due to increasing gas prices or reduced supply from the following synchronous generators:
• The retirement of Northern coal power station (546 MW) in May 2016 and the Hazelwood coal power station (1,600 MW) in March 2017, which were large base load generators with low operating costs. The Smithfield gas power station (171 MW) is also expected to close in 2017/18.
• Pelican Point gas-fired power station (239 MW) was mothballed in 2016/17 and was returned to service in 2017/18 although the increased gas prices increase its operating costs.
• The withdrawal of the Tamar Valley gas power station (208 MW) in 2016/17. 
The decrease in wholesale costs in the NEM in 2018/19 and 2019/20 is due to:
• Approximately 4,100 MW of new committed and expected (modelled) generation entering the NEM in 2018/19 and 2019/20, the majority of which is renewable generation (3,900 MW).
• The return to service of the Swanbank E gas power station (385 MW) in early 2018.
• Reduced short-run costs for South Australian gas plants in 2019/20 due to the pass through of certificate revenue related to the Energy Security Target.
Of the 5,300 MW of new generation that is committed or expected (modelled) to enter the NEM over the period 2016/17 to 2019/20, the majority (4,900 MW) is renewable generation.
In 2019/20, this 4,900 MW of new renewable generation is expected to represent around 10 per cent of generation capacity and 8 per cent of energy output in the NEM.

The research funded by the Australia Institute says 60% of a sample of 1,417 Australians surveyed by online market research firm Research Now supported Australia joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance to phase out coal power by 2030.
The Powering Past Coal Alliance – spearheaded by the UK and Canada – was unveiled at the COP23 climate talks in Bonn. The agreement is not legally binding, and the membership does not include Australia or other major coal exporters and users.
The survey suggests there is a core level of support across Australia’s partisan divide for signing on, with 50% of Coalition voters supportive as well as 67% of ALP voters. The significant dissenters were One Nation voters, with only 36% supportive.
A majority of Australians also supported increasing ambition on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, with 58% support, including 47% of Coalition voters in the sample.
“The strong majority support for phasing out coal power shows how far the community is ahead of the government on climate change,” said the Australia Institute’s deputy director, Ebony Bennett.
She said the Turnbull government’s approach on climate and energy policy meant Australia was at risk of missing out on jobs and investment associated with a global boom in renewable energy, and was out of step with public sentiment.
The research follows a declaration on Wednesday at the National Press Club by the resources minister Matt Canavan that he was not interested in contemplating a discussion about a just transition for workers displaced by any phase out of coal consistent with Australia’s international climate obligations.
Canavan said workers suffered when industries shut down or were phased out so euphemisms like “just transitions” were best avoided. “I don’t like the term transition, let’s be frank, if you want to shutdown the coal industry, say it – that’s what will happen.”
The resources minister said expanding the coal industry was “not inconsistent with the obligations we’ve got to reduce carbon emissions”.
He said countries were increasing investment in high-efficiency coal plants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the Paris accord. Canavan did not mention that some countries, such as Japan, are increasing investment in high-efficiency coal because of a phase-out of nuclear power.
Canavan also declared in response to a question about balancing his portfolio responsibilities to boost the resources sector with his responsibilities to the Queenslanders who elected him that he had been elected to parliament “on a platform that is unashamedly pro-coal”.
While Canavan was elected because he was given a winnable position on the LNP’s Queensland Senate ticket, the resources minister said: “I got elected on the basis I will support the resources sector.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/29/majority-of-australians-support-phasing-out-coal-power-by-2030-survey-finds

The other documents is decidedly from a Social liberal tradition far different in it's conception of liberty.

The coalition coal rat pack are at it... again? 
BQSTART
A group of Coalition MPs are so intent on propping up AGL's ailing Liddell power station they are calling on the Turnbull government to forcibly acquire the coal-fired power plant.
BQEND Oh for gods sake not again.
BQSTART
The charge for intervention is being led by Nationals MP George Christensen, but other MPs are said to have a degree of support for the idea, including former prime minister Tony Abbott and former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce.
BQEND Now that only says ""said to have a degree of support""
BQSTART
Mr Abbott and Mr Joyce raised questions during a party room meeting this week as to why the government wasn't doing more to facilitate the sale of Liddell to a buyer who would keep it open. It prompted a terse response from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who reminded the room that Liddell was an asset of a private company. Mr Abbott declined to comment to Fairfax Media. Mr Joyce said this week he would do ""everything in my power"" to make sure the government did ""something"" to ensure Liddell stayed open.
BQEND So far only George...
BQSTART
A Liberal MP on that committee, Craig Kelly, said a compulsory acquisition of Liddell was a ""very, very large step""
BQEND Add one more...
BQSTART
Conservative Liberal senator Eric Abetz was quoted by The Australian saying AGL should sell Liddell to a willing buyer or ""the government should take it over"". LNP Luke Howarth, also on the energy committee, said he would support that ""if it means it's going to help lower power prices"". Resources Minister Matt Canavan declined to endorse a takeover.
BQEND George, Craig, Eric and Luke with some weasel words by Joyce and Abbott and a slap from Turnbull.
So not quite Canavan, Abbott, Joyce... they must think they still have a shot in the next election or a leadership spill vote and that was a dig at ""do nothing"" Turnbull.

More than anything else, higher network charges caused the skyrocketing electricity prices that all households have noticed. NSW’s independent pricing regulator, IPART, estimated that NSW network charges increased by more than 90% in real terms for the five years to 2012-13. The largest part of these regulated network charges is the company’s rate of return. The AER decides on this rate, taking into account things such as proposed investment...Many theoretical reasons are given for privatisation leading to greater efficiency. But there is little, and contrary, evidence to prove the impact of ownership type...The evidence is not clear-cut that private electricity companies are more efficient.

While the Turnbull government has made much of the need for storage to increase security and reliability in the national power grid, the new report from the Australian Council of Learned Academies (Acola) says at an aggregated national level, 50% renewables is possible without major investments in storage for reliability purposes...It also warns that Australia risks missing out on the benefits of participating in global supply chains because of ongoing uncertainty over energy policy...Finkel, the chief scientist, and the man who led the review of the national electricity grid, says Australia should grab a major new export industry by developing our technical capacity. 
“Given our natural resources and our technical expertise, energy storage could represent a major new export industry for our nation,” Finkel says.“Energy storage is an opportunity to capitalise on our research strengths, culture of innovation and abundant natural resources.“We have great advantages in the rapidly expanding field of lithium production and the emerging field of renewable hydrogen with export opportunities to Asia.”

Even including land clearing, overall emissions show a continued rising trend, which began in about 2011, putting Australia’s commitment under the Paris agreement further out of reach.
The rising greenhouse gas pollution comes despite continued decline in emissions from the electricity sector, following increased renewable energy generation and the closure of Australia’s dirtiest coal power station, Hazelwood.
NDEVR replicates the federal government’s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGGI) quarterly reports, but releases them months ahead of the official data. Previous NDEVR reports’ figures have been within 1% of the official figures when they are eventually released.
The latest NDEVR figures include the last three months of 2017, allowing a comparison of calendar-year figures since records began in 2002, revealing 2017 had the highest emissions on record, when those from land-use change are excluded.
Even including the unreliable land-use figures, overall emissions continued their overall upward trend, taking Australia further from the commitments it made in Paris to help keep global warming under 2C. It is even making its current target (a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels by 2030), which experts agree is not yet strong enough to comply with the Paris agreement, seem increasingly out of reach.
In 2017, Australia’s total emissions from all sectors excluding land-use change came to 556.11m tonnes of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gases, according to NDEVR’s projections. That surpassed the last record, set in just 2016, by 7.21m tonnes.
Overall emissions including land-use change – which involves activities such as land clearing and forestry – were the highest since 2011, indicating a clear upward trend since that time, reversing years of declining emissions starting in 2007.
Emissions from the electricity sector in the last three months of 2017 were the lowest they’ve been in the data set, going back to 2001. And in the full year, they were the second lowest, pipped only by 2013.
But that reduction was overwhelmed by increases in other sectors. Emissions from transport were at a record high in the last three months of 2017, continuing a steady rise since the records began in 2001. Fugitive emissions, which include emissions from the production, processing, transport, storage, transmission and distribution of fossil fuels, were also projected to be the highest on record.
Stationary energy, which includes energy produced for industrial processes such as the growing LNG industry, was also projected to be at the equal highest on record, matching the previous quarter from July to September 2017.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/29/australias-emissions-rise-again-in-2017-putting-paris-targets-in-doubt

I have not deformed what you said as you just used the activist and I, not unreasonably, assumed you were using the term in its normally accepted meaning.
""Those who are scientists and also activists tend to confuse the issue because they would claim special knowledge, in going beyond what science would tell us."" 
In my activist role as a scientist studying Queensland dinosaurs in the 80s, I did have special knowledge of the detailed location of fossil sites which did go beyond what scientists had published.

Dennis, the point is, notwithstanding any wishful thinking left wing pseudo legal arguments, the fact of the matter is that 1) No President can issue an executive orders immune from rescission by a follow on President. The very idea is laughable. 2) Only Congress can raise and appropriate money. The Paris Accord has funding provisions that are simply not within the Constitutional authority of the President.

Wrong! The President can sign lots of things that are binding. And they remain binding for as long as the chief executive says so and so long as they are issued within his authority.

The range of uncertainty for the warming along the current emissions path is wide enough to encompass massively disruptive consequences to societies and ecosystems: as global temperatures rise, there is a real risk, however small, that one or more critical parts of the Earth’s climate system will experience abrupt, unpredictable and potentially irreversible changes.

First, osmosis is not a heat transfer mechanism. 
The currents in the oceans actually move very slow and there is no place where a large change will occur over such a short period such as the false analogy of pouring hot water into a tank. 
Ocean temperatures change slowly due to the specific heat of water being very high. As a result, the number of temperature measurements over an area need not be very large—actually much less than land measurements. The currents move slowly and weather buoys and other methods (such as ship intake data) actually sample large portions of the ocean to high accuracy. This is why place like the cold blob off Greenland can be accurately identified…something you have indicated as not possible. 
There is no better example how accurate temperature data is then the El Nino/La Nina oscillation. The standard for measuring temperature in that section of Pacific Ocean define the bands needed to identify the ocean temperatures for each phenomenon. See link

Yes - ""the story goes that Einstein ""overturned"" Newton. This is a stock misunderstanding wheeled out by some people who think that climate science is going to be 'overturned'.

Many other climate scientists were skeptical of this result, and the journal recently published a critique from a team led by the University of Edinburgh’s Andrew Schurer.
The debate lies in exactly how the Paris climate target is defined and measured, which has not been precisely established. Millar’s team used the UK Met Office and Hadley Centre global surface temperature dataset called HadCRUT4, which begins in 1850 and estimates global surface temperatures have warmed about 0.9°C since that time. The team thus calculated the remaining carbon budget that will lead to an additional 0.6°C warming.
But HadCRUT4 has some significant flaws. First, it only covers 84% of Earth’s surface. There are large gaps in its coverage, mainly in the Arctic, Antarctica, and Africa, where temperature monitoring stations are relatively scarce. And the Arctic is the fastest-warming part of the planet, which means that HadCRUT4 somewhat underestimates global warming.
A second issue is that over the oceans, HadCRUT4 uses sea surface temperatures, which haven’t warmed quite as fast as air temperatures directly above the ocean surface. There’s also a third issue – what’s the start date from which we want to stay below 1.5 or 2°C warming? The starting point in HadCRUT4 is 1850, but another recent study led by Schurer found that starting even earlier would add up to 0.2°C to the warming we’ve already caused, and thus shrink the remaining carbon budget.
Taken all together, these three issues could mean that we’ve already warmed 0.2–0.3°C more than estimated in the Millar study, which would mean a significantly smaller carbon budget. Each additional 0.1°C warming shrinks the remaining 2°C carbon budget by about 20%, so in that sense even one-tenth of a degree is important in answering this question about our chances of meeting the Paris targets.
Ultimately, climate scientists are asking for a more specific definition of the Paris climate target. The agreement says we want to limit global warming to no more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels (preferably closer to 1.5°C), but when is the post-industrial start date, and which temperature measurement is the target based on?
However, the 2°C target itself is somewhat arbitrary. It’s based on two factors: science and politics. On the scientific side, we can probably accept and adapt to the adverse climate change consequences at that degree of climate change. On the political side, transitioning away from a fossil fuel-based global economy is a tremendous undertaking. From a practical standpoint, it will take everything we’ve got just to stay below 2°C. That’s why the 1.5°C target in the Paris agreement is ‘aspirational.’ The latest IPCC report considered 116 potential scenarios for staying below 2°C, and 101 of those scenarios (87%) included negative emissions in the form of carbon capture and storage. In other words, it’s difficult to envision meeting the Paris target by cutting carbon pollution alone.
The 2°C target is simply a nice round number that represents what the international community considers an acceptable amount of climate change risk and is also a practically achievable (although daunting) goal.
Tackling climate change boils down to risk management. Global temperatures are likely already hotter than at any time in the history of human civilization, and warming at a rate 20 to 50 times faster than Earth’s fastest natural climate changes. Climate contrarians like Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt often ask what’s Earth’s ideal temperature – the answer is that an ideal climate is a stable one. Rapid climate changes like the one humans are currently causing create problems that are difficult for species to adapt to. We need to shift away from dangerously rapid climate change to a stable climate as soon as possible.
The ideal Paris target would thus have simply been “cut carbon pollution as much as possible, as fast as possible.” However, governments need a concrete target on which to base their climate policies. “As much and as fast as possible” is vague and subjective, while “an 80% carbon pollution cut by 2050” is concrete, specific, and translates into policy.
The scientific debate over these few tenths of a degree of warming is in some ways important and in other ways unimportant. It’s unimportant because climate scientists are trying to assess our chances of meeting the Paris targets, but the 2°C itself is somewhat arbitrary. However, the Paris targets are important because they provide a concrete goal that governments and policies can aim for. And each additional tenth of a degree represents a greater risk that we’ll trigger a dangerous climate feedback, like a large release of methane from beneath the permafrost or oceans, or the collapse of a major ice shelf.
Thanks Chris. Policy implications not so big, imho. Whoever is right, in either case we need to hit the brakes on CO2 emissions as fast as we can. If the optimist study is right we might stop warming at 1.5 °C, if not the best we can hope for is ~2 °C, and coral reefs are gone.
The one point to take away from this debate is that no matter who’s right, we still need to cut carbon pollution as much as possible, as fast as possible. Using the choices in the Millar paper would suggest that we have a better chance of successfully meeting the Paris target, but even if the international community decides they like those choices best, it will still take everything we’ve got to stay below that definition of 2°C warming. 
If governments decide that based on the Millar paper they have a larger carbon budget and can thus afford to act less quickly, that would be an incorrect and dangerous interpretation. Climate policies need to keep progressing and improving at full steam ahead.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/28/climate-scientists-debate-a-flaw-in-the-paris-climate-agreement

An autonomous taxi will do a lot of miles, perhaps 100k per year. An ICE is generally good for about 150-200k miles before the engine/drivetrain maintenance will be too costly.
Current EV's should be good for 500k miles, possibly 1m miles soon.
So the capital cost of the taxi journey will hopefully be reduced by about 2/3rds.
So let's say the cost breakdown is 50% driver, 30% mileage costs (fuel, wear and tear/ maintenance), and 20% capital cost. Eliminate the driver, save 50%, reduce mileage cost by 90% v's an ICE, save 27%, and the investment (car) last 3x longer, save 13%.
Total saving approx 90% of old taxi fare.

BUT the heat into the column is governed by its operation and the composition of the crude oil. Bear in mind around 40% of most crudes are bitumen and used on roads as well as further processed.
HOWEVER the thing about the gas oil taken off to be blended into diesel is that to remove the H2S and other impurities to make Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel is that ALL the gas oil stream is vaporised and put throught a Desulphur unit, then condensed. But most of the heat is recovered (depending on losses and efficiencies) so not really a consideration.
Reference filters, fine if they work and will collect a portion not 100% and NOx removal by Adblue may not be effective 100% e.g. when engine is cold.

Petrol v diesel cars is often presented as a trade-off between health-harming air pollution and climate-harmful CO2. Diesel cars do more miles to the litre than petrol, but this exaggerates the difference in CO2 emissions since one litre of diesel contains more energy and more carbon than one litre of petrol. If fuel were taxed on energy and carbon, rather than volume, then the tax on diesel would be 10 to 14% greater than that on petrol.
The International Council on Clean Transportation points out that petrol engines and petrol-hybrids have improved faster than diesel and will continue to do so. They conclude that a decline in diesel cars from around 56% to 15% would not jeopardise EU CO2 targets. Instead, it would make the targets cheaper to achieve since petrol engines cost less to make and have simpler exhaust clean-up.

The email, issued by the EPA’s Office of Public Affairs (OPA) and sent out to communications directors and regional public affairs directors, was forwarded to others and shared throughout the agency. The email acknowledges that communities face “challenges” in dealing with the consequences of climate change.
However, the email, obtained by HuffPost, also sets out ambiguous talking points favoured by Pruitt, such as: “Human activity impacts our changing climate in some manner. The ability to measure with precision the degree and extent of that impact, and what to do about it, are subject to continuing debate and dialogue.”
The email adds that “while there has been extensive research and a host of published reports on climate change, clear gaps remain including our understanding of the role of human activity and what we can do about it”.
Joel Scheraga, senior climate adaptation adviser to the agency administrator, Scott Pruitt, was one person to forward the email, which states Pruitt encourages an “open, transparent debate on climate science”.
An EPA spokeswoman said the points were “developed by the office of public affairs. The agency’s work on climate adaptation continues under the leadership of Dr Scheraga.”
Since becoming EPA head under Donald Trump, Pruitt has erroneously denied that carbon dioxide is a “primary contributor” to warming that has seen the Earth’s average temperature increase by about 1C (1.8F) over the past century. Pruitt has also said industrialization has warmed the planet “to a certain degree” but that “humans have most flourished during times of warming trends”.
During his tenure, the EPA has removed information on its website about climate change, scrapped a climate adaptation program and advocated the need for “regulatory certainty” by loosening emissions regulations for vehicles and the fossil fuels industry. A televised “red team, blue team” debate between climate scientists and those who reject the science has also been mulled. 
Pruitt was a vocal supporter of Trump’s decision to remove the US from the Paris climate agreement and is busy dismantling the Obama administration’s clean power plan, which Pruitt fought in court when attorney general of Oklahoma.
Scientists have pointed out that while the exact ramifications of climate change are yet to play out, the science behind it is well established and points directly to human culpability. A major report released by government scientists last year reiterated that humans are the “dominant” driver of global warming, with it being “highly likely” that the release of greenhouse gas emissions has caused more than half of all warming since 1951.
The email forwarded by Scheraga is “literally true but carefully crafted to mislead”, according to Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M University.
“There is uncertainty in climate science, but the uncertainty spans the range of climate change being somewhat serious to extremely serious,” he said. 
Dessler said any gaps on scientists’ understanding are not big enough to declare climate change a “non-problem”. He added: “And what we can do about it is quite clear: to stabilize the climate, we need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to near zero.”
Kerry Emanuel, a meteorologist and climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: “If confronting serious risks depended on first converting risks to certainties, no one would get flu shots, there would be no attempt to reduce stockpiles of nuclear weapons and businesses would fail at a high rate, having made no efforts to mitigate their risks.
“Mr Pruitt is engaged in a disingenuous effort to stall measures to mitigate climate risk under the false pretext of concern about uncertainty.”
The leak comes as it was revealed that Pruitt, already under fire over his use of first class air travel, lived last year in a Washington DC house co-owned by the wife of a leading energy lobbyist.
Property records obtained by ABC News show that Pruitt lived in a townhouse partly owned by Vicki Hart, the wife of Steven Hart, chief executive of lobbying firm Williams and Jensen. Hart’s clients include the NRA and gas company Cheniere Energy.

Then why do you assume it will be 50% gas...
BQEND
It's a safe guesstimate - no coal, non-hydro renewables pegged at the ~30% level (which is what would be expected in a closed system
as per this well known analysis).

BQSTART
…when the article in question is quoting a detailed study which says 80% renewables is perfectly feasible?
BQEND
Remember the Caldeira et al paper makes a point of noting that in an 80% renewables system, you still need to keep a backup system of non-renewables capable of handling peak demand (where worst case is the renewable capacity is operating at say 10% nameplate). This naturally isn't viable economically in the real world. And this point is important, since both technical *and* economic limitations need to be taken into account simultaneously. Whatever the lowest bound is (which Finkel didn't take into account), as defined by either of those criteria will be what governs the level of renewables long term - and ends up roughly matching whatever the capacity factor is i.e. ~30%. Which obviously isn't enough decarbonisation. I would definitely be keeping an eye out for when this upcoming paper becomes public:
""Least cost final zero carbon mixes in my forthcoming study rarely close to 80% wind/solar.""
It isn't incredulity on my part, simply non-facile rational analysis. I'm not wedded to technologies like nuclear, but some understanding of the technology involved in making electricity, with some economics added in (esp. game theory) and by eliminating the implausible options, you are generally left with tech like nuclear being indispensable to any workable solution.
As far as nuclear is concerned in Australia, there is minimal chance it will be adopted any time soon.

Ultimately, the question I asked Canavan wasn’t about whether he was intrinsically opposed to the future, but about who takes responsibility for it.
BQEND
Well it seems that the Coalition government want to take some responsibility for propping up coal-fired power stations. Christensen and others are demanding the government compulsorily acquire the Liddell power-station. Faced with the prospect that the government may not have the authority to do so, George wants laws changed so the government can buy it and run it. If our government won't run it, then he'd be happy to see it owned by Chinese business.
BQSTART
A group of Coalition MPs are so intent on propping up AGL's ailing Liddell power station they are calling on the Turnbull government to forcibly acquire the coal-fired power plant. 
But Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg all but ruled out the idea on Thursday, insisting the federal government was not going to start nationalising assets.
The charge for intervention is being led by Nationals MP George Christensen, but other MPs are said to have a degree of support for the idea, including former prime minister Tony Abbott and former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce.
Mr Christensen told Fairfax Media a compulsory land acquisition would mean the government could run Liddell itself or, if necessary, sell it to interested Chinese giant Shandong Ruyi.
""I don't know whether we have the head of power to actually compulsorily acquire it, but I think it should be absolutely explored. And if we need legislation then that should be considered,"" he said.
Mr Christensen said he had raised the issue with ministers and was told the intervention would require new laws. ""I would encourage that, particularly if the only other option is we lose a coal-fired power station,"" Mr Christensen said.
He stressed he wanted the federal government to operate the power plant, but selling it to a Chinese buyer was palatable.
BQEND
Not all devotees of coal power are keen to buy Liddell, but would like to see the government build a brand new station of its own. Andrew Broad is one. 
BQSTART
Nationals MP Andrew Broad, who chairs the House of Representatives' Environment and Energy committee, said a compulsory acquisition was not the way to go, but the government could get involved in building an entirely new coal-fired facility
BQEND
Funny how so many of the mob who pray at the alter of the free-market are now falling over themselves in their haste to spend tax-payer dollars on buying something no-one else seems to want, or build new infrastructure that the private sector isn't willing to put cash into.

The major problem with Liberals in general is their desire to drag Australia back to the torpor of the Menzies era, when the people were told what was good for them. They continue to deny Whitlam's achievements & are still trying to remove or ""modify"" them out of existence.
The RWNJs aren't even satisfied with that - nothing short of a return to mediaeval feudalism & ""church rule"" will appease them. In their world, the masses must NOT be educated, kept healthy, encouraged or supported, but instead know their place & accept their fate quietly, ""comforted"" by the scriptures. RWNJ World has no room for democracy & science - such concepts must be anathematised. 
I'm a little bit older than you, still fuelled by the awakening idealism of the 60s & early 70s - sadly, my generation let that movement slowly die & instead became the most selfish bastards this planet has witnessed. Still, I had hoped that Climate Change would have been dealt with in much the same manner as the CFC Ozone Hole crisis some thirty years ago - acceptance of scientific data, followed by a relatively swift global response with minimal controversy. Sadly, the world has changed - evidence produced by scientists is now disputed by cranks & nutters, whose opinions are given equal time & gravitas by a compliant media. 
I'm encouraged by the recent words & actions of younger people, propelled by the latest school shooting in the US, but almost certainly activated by the rise of vile creatures like Trump. It seems that interest in political activities is on the rise - for too long, we have been stumbling along in ""nothing I can do about it"" mode, too lazy/comfortable to get off our arses & DO something!
As for the Victorian Liberals, WTF indeed! Bernie Finn has form - in fact, he has similar ""rank"" (in all senses of the word) in State politics to that of Ian Macdonald in the Senate. After begging & praying in Parliament to be paired because of their religious beliefs, they were granted leave. Finn had come up with ""Even when my birthday falls on Good Friday, I do not celebrate it on Good Friday"" & Craig Ondarchie offered ""This is the day that my Lord was crucified. I do not want to be here"".
Yet both returned to vote after Labor had sent two MPs home. This is one of the most hypocritical acts of bastardry ever witnessed in Australian politics!
When you consider Hodgman’s claimed ""mandate"" for 200 policies not revealed during the Tasmanian election campaign & the dubious pre-vote activities of Steven Marshall in SA, it is frightening to consider how low the Liberal Party will stoop to maintain/gain power.

One of my concerns about Snowy 2.0 arises out of the Tasmanian experience when an extended drought left water levels low and production of hydro power was adversely impacted. In coming decades, who can be sure that the Snowy won't be similarly affected by drought from time to time? Yet huge funding is going into this one project. 
Because climate change could throw up all sorts of extreme weather events, it makes sense not to place all our energy eggs into one basket. Families and communities need to be more self-reliant. Industry and public transport must not depend on one energy source. And at the same time we MUST address climate change as a matter of extreme urgency. 
And then there is a question of fairness. After the loss of so many Australian manufacturing jobs, Turnbull needs to try harder than to pander only to his home state.

They live in their delusional, half-fake world of money, statistics and focus groups. Their contact with real people, outside election periods, is minimal. Their public face is largely mediated via the mendacious propaganda of the TV networks, or photo opportunities that don’t address issues of inequality and environment of which matters to voters the most. They declined to step down and talk to the people whose worlds they have destroyed. They tend towards paranoia, treating any serious national discussion as disloyalty, and now grow increasingly dependent on spin doctors and fake news to propagandise their policies.
All these have been exacerbated by the now ubiquitous ‘Commercial in Confidence’ principal that has crept into public life from the Howard years until now, denies the community this right, and for no legitimate reason. 
The ‘Commercial in Confidence’ doctrine formalises a shift in the relationship between three of the community’s stakeholders; the government, the community and the corporate sector. The government and the corporate sector are doing deals with each other from which the community - which is paying the bills - is excluded. The community is being sidelined, even treated with contempt.
‘Commercial in Confidence’ rests on the extraordinary premises that private companies have a greater right to know what is happening with the public’s money than the public itself. There is totally no reason why prices of commercial services provided to the public under a government contract should be concealed, any more than the price of bread at the local supermarket should be concealed. What the government is saying when it cites ‘Commercial in Confidence’ is that it owes a sacred duty to protect the interests of business ahead of its obligations to the constituents it is being paid good money to represent.
‘Commercial in Confidence’ culture not only interposes a veil of secrecy between the government and its constituents, it also hides the activity of one part of government from another part of government. Once information is put on the restricted list, it becomes less accessible to anyone and everyone, whether the public at large, civil servants in the bureaucracy or even ministers themselves. A culture of secrecy is installed that throws up barriers everywhere. Bureaucrats can maintain their ministers in the dark the same way that Sir Appleby kept Minister Hacker in the dark in the TV series, ‘Yes Minister’.
Increasing use of the ‘Commercial in Confidence’ principles, raises the inevitable question, if the government has nothing to hide, why go to the trouble of trying to hide it?

Who knows what the actual percentage of gas will be in the end?
BQENDThen why do you assume it will be 50% gas, when the article in question is quoting a detailed study which says 80% renewables is perfectly feasible? Incidentally, Finkel also came to the same conclusion via his own investigations into the Australian grid, as have several other groups in several places.
You seem to have some fixed opinions based on personal incredulity, and use these to pull out whichever figure you like best. This makes you apparently no more rational than the people you are criticising.
I quite understand the necessity for an all-options solution to decarbonisation, and I quite understand that replacing nuclear with gas or coal will be a step backwards in terms of CO2 emissions, as well as being a step backwards in terms of other greenhouse gases like methane. As long as any nuclear plant is on good operating order, and in a stable location, it makes sense to keep using it to reduce emissions.
The current US market, like ours, is unrealistic in that it does not include a price on carbon. This is something we really need to implement as soon as possible, preferably on a consistent international basis.

He admits that changes the parameters somewhat, although he also says it is ""not a panacea"". I assume by that he means storage is not free and cannot be pulled out of a hat, which is obviously true. Still, it does exist and it is usable. I don't think anyone these days is seriously suggesting renewables without storage.
There's no reason why some storage could not be owned by the companies who are generating power via renewables. In fact that is looking like it will become common, which would mean that the duck curve should be less problematic for company revenues. I'd also expect widespread use of domestic solar plus battery storage, given how it's taking off already, and given that prices for both panels and batteries are still decreasing.
The Jenkins tweet you linked to, and its mention of his upcoming study, says ""Least cost final zero carbon mixes in my forthcoming study rarely close to 80% wind/solar"". That's interesting, in that he is saying that in some cases 80% wind+solar is the least cost option. He's not saying what those cases are, but apparently they do exist, so as you say is should be a good read.
What is economically viable in the real word depends to some extent on what result we want. It's common to put in place requirements that increase cost if the benefits are seen to be worthwhile. A price on carbon is an obvious example. It makes sense for any decarbonisation policy, but in terms of present day business it is just another cost. It's justified on the basis of its long term benefits to others.
This is going to become a big factor later this century. All the IPCC pathways to <2 degrees C require large (bloody huge) negative emissions in the latter part of the century. That is going to require rolling out some large scale CCS technology, and that is going to cost a lot of money, and pretty obviously it will be funded/incentivised by a high carbon price.. Apparently it has to happen anyway, so in that sense that cost is not relevant. If there's no alternative, you just pay up.
 I also have to say that the privatisation of power generation in this country really does not seem to have been an outstanding success. The Queensland government had to intervene to stop its own subsidiary rorting the spot power market and driving prices sky high, and similar rorting was the reason the SA government wanted control of some of the output from the Hornsdale/Tesla battery. This rorting was perfectly legal under power market rules, and provided better returns for shareholders, but curtailing it was in the public interest even if it wasn't ""business-friendly"". Power is an essential service, and there are good arguments for not privatising essential services.
Anyway, Jenkins' article says there is no real problem with up to 50% grid-scale wind+solar, even without storage. So, Labor's policy of 50% renewables by 2030 seems perfectly sound as a starting point, particularly when storage is added to the mix. On top of that we have an extra 7% from hydroelectricity (although there are some doubts as to its long term reliability under difficult rainfall patterns). I expect there will also be minor generation from geothermal and biogas (there is some already) so that should bring us close to 60% renewables.
Given that nuclear is not currently feasible in this country, for a variety of reasons, I think Labor's current policy is looking like an excellent place to start. If we need to re-assess things as 2030 gets closer then we (and Jenkins) can do that with the benefit of the better information that will be available by then.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1522630262000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'17605685', u'in_reply_to': u'114241204', u'id': u'114262837', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'RossHosking', u'text': u'The pope is a catholic.

The Nationals senator and federal minister for resources worked at the Productivity Commission before he entered politics, first as a staffer for his colleague and friend Barnaby Joyce, before being elected to the Senate himself.
The economic pointy head backstory makes Canavan an unconventional National, a fact that doesn’t go unnoticed among his party room colleagues. It also makes some of his public commentary this week just that bit harder to get your head around.
In a busy week, where the government prosecuted but lost an attempt to steer its big business tax cut through the Senate, where Tony Abbott was so desperate for a “look at me” moment he launched Pauline Hanson’s new book, where the nation roiled inconsolably about the behaviour of our cricketers – Canavan fronted the National Press Club to try and generate a couple of headlines of his own.
Canavan, like every other resources minister I’ve seen before him, is an unabashed champion of the mining sector. Boosterism comes with the territory, and the current occupant of the portfolio doesn’t disappoint.
Given every major business sector in the country is pursuing a “please like me” soft advertising campaign of some type – the Business Council of Australia launched one this week, BHP urges us on high rotation to Think Big, the banks have ads specifically to tell customers they aren’t that awful – it was unsurprising to hear Canavan flagging (among other things) efforts to “bolster the community support for the resources sector” including through an “ongoing campaign” to inform people of its benefits.
All just as you’d expect, right down to Stop Adani protesters bursting into the room to puncture his remarks. Where things took an unexpected turn was in the questions, when Canavan raised a balled fist of protest against the future.
Asked whether as federal resources minister (as well as a democratically elected parliamentarian in a representative democracy) he felt an obligation to help Australian communities face up to the inevitability of a carbon-constrained future – Canavan suggested the world needed to stay as it is.
It was “objectionable” he said, to talk about people losing their livelihoods. He said concepts like “just transitions” were a con. “I don’t like the term transition, let’s be frank. If you want to shut down the coal industry and cost people jobs, say it. Have the guts to say it.”
Canavan advised the questioner (which, full disclosure, happened to be me) to take a trip to northern Tasmania to see what a transition really looked like. “Real poverty,” he noted. “House prices halve, people get locked in to an environment they can’t get out of and their lives are destroyed.
“Utter heartbreak.”
You might need to remind yourself at this point of the recount that this is a former Productivity Commission economist talking. If Productivity Commission economists are a foreign species to you, think about people mildly obsessed with transformation, structural adjustment, economic efficiency – that sort of thing.
They are the folks who have been saying for decades in the politest possible way: suck it up soldier, your economy needs you to understand that things change, and the way to get through these adjustments is to pursue evidence-based policy.
Couple of things.
Canavan’s empathy for the coal and power workers – while doubtless sincere at a personal level – is a bit hard to square with his service for a government that shuttered the Australian car industry with barely a backward glance.
I really don’t remember much outward concern for falling house prices, or destroyed lives or “utter heartbreak” in Adelaide. Perhaps some displaced workers are more equal than others.
Then there’s the inconvenient fact that it is his own government’s policy driving the transformation he says shouldn’t happen.
Canavan was part of a government that signed the Paris climate agreement – a set of commitments that make decarbonisation not optional, or hypothetical, but inevitable. Nobody held a gun to the government’s head and made it sign an international agreement to reduce emissions. Abbott might have grumbled at the time, and he engages in active revisionism now, but the fact is he signed Australia up, voluntarily.
If Canavan thinks there should be no adjustment for coal communities, then he’s actually arguing that Australia should quit the Paris agreement – except of course he doesn’t argue that, because that would be problematic for Liberals trying to hold urban seats.
The resources minister attempts to tip-toe through the obvious contradictions by arguing that high-efficiency coal will help reduce reduce emissions and help Australia meet its Paris target. In this happy story, we can reduce our emissions and boost the coal industry too.
But is this happy story true?
While it is self-evidently correct that “clean” coal plants are better in terms of emissions than ageing dirty ones, the minister omits several relevant points. “Clean coal will help us meet Paris” ignores the fact the technology is incredibly expensive; that taxpayers would bear significant risks because clean coal plants are not financeable in Australia unless the government agrees to indemnify projects against the future risk of a carbon price being introduced, and against the cost of delays prompted by likely community protest action. And the electricity grid in Australia is moving inexorably in the opposite direction – towards decentralisation.
There’s one more point that we can make about who should bear the transition. If Canavan thinks coal communities shouldn’t be made to adjust, but it’s OK for Australia to remain in the Paris deal, then he should be arguing in public and around the cabinet table for other sectors of the economy to do their fair share of heavy lifting.
The government is trying to pass off the as-yet-unfinished national energy guarantee as a settled climate and energy policy, which it most decidedly isn’t. Assuming they can land it, this is not mission accomplished. The national energy guarantee is a policy for only one sector of the economy – electricity – and a sector of the economy where emissions are already falling.
Thus far, the government has produced no plans for other sectors of the economy – say transport, or agriculture, where emissions are currently rising – presumably because the Coalition can’t ever have a rational conversation about emissions reduction without someone having a brain explosion.
So what are the facts?
If Australia remains in the Paris agreement, and we honour the undertakings we have made (and the government keeps saying we will do both those things), then a transition is coming.
The transition can’t be avoided. It is already under way.
Ultimately, the question I asked Canavan wasn’t about whether he was intrinsically opposed to the future, but about who takes responsibility for it.
This government, and future Australian governments, will determine whether the transition associated with decarbonisation is fair and orderly and structured, or whether it is chaotic and ugly and deeply unfair to the regional communities the resources minister says he cares about. 
Empathy is fine from politicians, welcome in fact, but truth is better, because these communities aren’t stupid, and they won’t be bought off by facile storytelling that suggests coal magic means everyone wins, and no one has to pick up the tab.
They want to know that someone in elected office is thinking about a new pipeline of blue-collar jobs.
These communities need a plan, and they need political representation with the foresight to give them one, and to do that, our elected representatives have to be very clear about why they are in public life, and who it is they actually represent.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/31/sorry-matt-canavan-no-one-believes-coal-magic-means-everyone-wins

...errr excuse me?
1) Where does it say a lasting solution is not required?? (Have a read of the points made again perhaps)
2) You seriously / honestly believe that there is some ECONOMIC case to be made for keeping business as usual re the foulled up state of motor-plagued London??Deliberately perverse, or are you perhaps genuinely unaware of the long lust of negative impacts wrought by motor vehicles upon the urban (and FYI) the rural environment??
The article above is about (protest with regard to) air pollution (perhaps read through that as well - it's useful to be informed before proffering opinions).
Air pollution FYI represents just one item of a list of external impacts imposed by excessive motor usage upon everyone.This list includes the obvious, such as physical road violence wrought by motor vehicles upon pedestrians and cyclists alike.It also includes conditions like heart disease, diabetes, cancer and an array of mental illnesses such as alzheimers.The impact on the NHS form these is vast.The benefits of getting people out of their cars is widely known amongst health professionals and leading reresenattives of the scientific establishment.
Not mentioned above are even broader impacts starting to be felt with catastrophic climate breakdown (conveniently otherwise termed climate change or global warming - we don't want anybody to be alarmed do we!)

I’m worried about the pollution in the water, the pollution in the ground, and the pollution in the air from the busy arterial roads and airports. It’s affecting me and it will affect the crops on my allotment. I have a bike, but in order to go out on a bike now I have to wear a mask which, with my asthma, makes it difficult. When I was arrested last week for spraying “air pollution is criminal” on City Hall, the mayor of London’s office, I was singing “maybe it’s because I’m a Londoner” – I don’t believe Londoners should have to suffer these conditions any longer.
I am taking visible action, and risking time in prison, to pressure our politicians into acting now
People need to be made aware of the issues of air pollution and climate change and start communicating with each other about them. I’m taking this visible action because I want to give people something to talk about; we are calling on the mayor to sit down with community groups and discuss solutions to air pollution. There are already thousands of people in this country and across the world standing up to say now is the time to act on the climate. I am standing up with them, and risking time in prison, to pressure our politicians into acting now.
Along with other clean air defenders, we sprayed “air pollution is criminal” on the walls of City Hall five times last week and were arrested every time. At the police station, the police officers were respectful to us in spite of clearly being overworked and understaffed. In some cases there was even genuine understanding of our action for clean air, even if they did not approve of the methods.
Taking action in the way we did, a kind of “art drama” politics, is a rollercoaster of emotions. Part of me says why bother, why not just enjoy the rest of my life, but my awareness of the danger and future damage won’t let me. I have not given up on provoking people to act on what is happening, to work to cut air pollution and avert climate breakdown. For instance, so far a dozen London community groups have started working in coalition to put increasing pressure on Sadiq Khan to take urgent action. The London Coalition for Clean Air is holding an open introductory meeting on 17 April and I hope that more people and groups will get involved with it. If that happens, then our actions last week will have been worth it.
The mayor should be providing ways for people to get involved and excited about fixing our air pollution crisis – something that is so crucial to the health of all citizens. Money needs to be used to spur people to be creative around technology and to change our cities so we have room for all people to move through them without these deadly health risks. Room for disabled people, room for cyclists, space for people who go slow or fast. I want to see lots of trees, and every house using alternative energy, with plants growing everywhere. Open the parks, don’t close them.
We must get rid of pollution. We need to keep the fossil fuels in the ground. We need an urgent transition; we should all be demanding it and encouraging others to do so too, whether that is through acts of protest, writing to our politicians or talking to our neighbours. This pollution is causing more than 9,000 Londoners to die prematurely every year. Stop killing Londoners.

The “Time to Choose” rally, which began at Martin Place, marched to Prince Alfred Park in the city’s south stretching almost 2km along a partially closed Elizabeth Street. 
Neha Madhok, from rally organiser 350.org Australia, said people had come from across NSW “to put the state government on notice”.
“We want the state government and the opposition to know that over the next year we are not going to stop talking about climate change, about coal and gas. We want to repower NSW, we want a renewable energy-powered NSW.”
The state government approved 10 industrial solar farms in 2017 – twice as many as the previous year, and has committed to an ambitious zero emissions target by 2050 as part of its climate change policy framework.
However, legislation has threatened to weaken environmental protections, and several proposed or operating mining ventures have been the targets of long-running community opposition, as well as several applications for extensions.
#time2choose hooray for the farmers pic.twitter.com/hdCkeS10G8
Organisers pointed to the proposed CSG mining in Narribri, open cut coal mining in the Bylong valley, the Southern Highlands Hume Coal project, and Shenhua Mining’s attempts in the Liverpool plains as among the threats to the state’s environment and communities.
“There is no safe place for coal seam gas in NSW. It threatens communities, precious groundwater aquifers and farmland, and the climate, wherever it goes,” said Naomi Hodgson of the Wilderness Alliance.
Glenn Morris, who made headlines in 2016 after riding his horse Hombre across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to raise awareness about climate change, was one of the 25 farmers on horseback.
“There is devastation because of climate change all across NSW,” the Inverell farmer said. “We can’t afford to destroy any more healthy land.”
Bob Clarke came from Wollar, a small village near Mudgee, where he said the open-cut Wilpinjong mine was destroying the region. 
The Peabody mining company was granted an extension last year, but it has been challenged in the land and environment court.
Clarke, who has lived in Wollar for 30 years, said Peabody had recently started buying nearby land, and the exodus of people had “broken the community”.
“There’s only four of us left there now,” he said. “We’re not going nowhere, we’re still hanging in there.”
Bill Ryan, in his 90s, said he wanted governments to realise citizens wanted renewable energy now.
“They’ve got to take into consideration that this is what the people want. So we’ve got to get out and let them know they can’t get away with backing the mining sector all the time. They have to listen to the citizens.”
The Greens MLA David Shoebridge praised the size and breadth of the turnout at the rally.
“We have First Nations peoples, farming communities, inner city environmental and activist groups, all coming together under the same banner.”
Shoebridge said people wanted to put the environment and climate change on the agenda.
“The community is concerned. They’re talking about renewable energy and a fresh way forward that doesn’t involve coal. It’s a concern the parliament is almost entirely deaf to.”
He said there needed to be a “just transition plan” into renewables to support people and communities that relied on industries that had closed.
“We know for a fact that jobs in the coal industry are drying up. Conditions for those workers are getting more and more severe. Meanwhile there is a wonderful opportunity for ongoing solid employment in the renewable energy sector.”

One of the more interesting stories of climate science denial in Australia also involves Noah's Ark in a way not usually expected. In 1985 self styled US archeologist Ron Wyatt and US marine salvage operator David Fosold using a gadget advertised in treasure hunting magazines an ark shaped structure complete with metal nails on Mt Tendurek in eastern Turkey, 18 km south of Mt Ararat.
In 1985 after completing a survey of Cretaceous tetrapod fossil sites in Queensland, I commenced post graduate studies at the University of Queensland in paleontology and evolution. At the time Queensland was under an undemocratic extreme right wing regime and US creationists were providing hundreds of thousands of dollars per annum finance to local creationists to set up a base here. I went with my supervisor and Ian Lowe to a number of creationist talks to provide some scientific balance. Ian later became President of the Australian Conservation Foundation and an early communicator of the reality uncovered by climate science. 
In 1988 David Fosold returned to Mt Tendurek accompanied by Australian geologist and concluded that the boat shaped structure was a natural geological phenomenon. Ian Pilmer had became a campaigner against creationists some time after me.
In the late noughties Ian Pilmer criticised the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for being unscientific and was quoted by then Opposition Leader Tony Abbott to that effect. In 2010 he toured with Christopher Monkton as a support act in Australia.
In late 2010 I attended the Woodford Folk Festival with My daughter and her not yet one year old son where as Minister for Climate Change she was delivering a talk with Ian Lowe on climate change and global warming. While my duties were mainly toddler focused, I met Ian and reminded him of our encounters with creationists and he of course mentioned the similaries both in personnel, organisations and techniques of both groups.

I see you are sticking to your script. Bring it all back to a binary about whether or not there is climate change. 
The real question is about where climate ranks in the level of priority we should be allocating, compared with other issues facing us.
A crowd, or even the entire population, of climate scientists is not better placed to make this evaluation than the average well informed layperson.

So, just to be clear, does that mean you accept the IPCC summary of climate change science? We're warming, there's no cheating in the homogenisation (without which surface temperatures would be thought to be rising faster), human CO2 emissions and other impacts are about 100% responsible over the last 50 years and probably a bit more, and that droughts and floods have already begun to increase as expected (the last bit is post-IPCC5 peer-reviewed literature - IPCC5 is out of date but it'll be in the next one).
That you're not the science denier you appear to be, but you accept the science and just disagree about the policy response?

One of the consequences of the increase in the number of heat waves and very hot days due to global warming in the tropical and subtropical parts of the world has been an increase in evaporation hastening the onset of drought by speeding up the depletion of soil moisture. This occurs even in neutral ENSO phase middling years. Global warming is also increasing the frequency of extreme El Ninos years which bring drought to the Horn of Africa.

You also claim that ""Climate science is faith based."" I understand that as a noun faith has two meanings:a) complete trust or confidence in someone or something, andb) strong belief in the doctrines of a religion based on spiritual conviction rather than proof.
So one meaning is about trust while the other is about belief. Trust in the methodologies of science as a practice and profession, may warrant the use of the term ""faith"" but I doubt that trust is complete in the provisional world of science.
Religion also has two meanings:a) the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power especially a personal God or gods, andb) a pursuit or interest followed with great devotion.
As science can be a pursuit or interest followed with great devotion it could be described as a religion in much the same way as Australian Rules Football is described as such. This meaning of ""religion"" is not to be confused with that of the god botherers.
So climate science is not faith based as the confidence of scientists in the methodologies of science is not sufficiently complete; and climate science is not a religion in the sense of bothering with god things.

All honey from everywhere in the world now apparently contains traces of neonicotinoids. Patterns of water use in places such as California see inappropriate commercial crop choices conflicting directly with domestic use to an extent that periodically puts people at risk. Mass economic migration has been occurring for some time and shows no sign of abating, resulting in tens of thousands losing their lives in fruitless attempts to reach better lives. The Guardian now reports that the four richest people in the USA owns more wealth than the poorest 50% of the population. Greed and stupidity is resulting in increasing numbers of people being put at risk as a result of a combination of construction in unsuitable areas and modification to catchments that advantage landholders but result in damaging increases in uncontrolled runoff and flash flooding. Population increase in places such as the Horn of Africa has put the environment under such pressure that anything other than a really good year now results in famine and starvation. Changes in technology mean that declining employment will result in potentially very damaging social disruption. And so on.

Scientific enquiry is only possible if we have a 'model' in which the measurements made by instruments are actually related to things in the real world via a workable model. This is in the same way that the expansion or contraction of mercury is a 'proxy' for temperature. Research requires lots of work and replication and backtracking to produce reliable results, but it is perfectly possible. Everything is a work in progress. There is a naive view that there is some kind of raw data lying around waiting to be discovered - 'Hey I'm a piece of data, so discover me.' A naive belief in 'data' which doesn't have to be processed in some way seems to underlie the complaint that 'climate science is just models', 'they tweaked the data' etc. The inherent uncertainty in scientific enquiry is treated with suspicion rather than respect by those who prefer the bold certainties of other areas of publicly available debate.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1521667746000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'4154310', u'in_reply_to': u'113848008', u'id': u'113856392', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'TTauriStellarbody', u'text': u'BQSTART

I see you are sticking to your script. Bring it all back to a binary about whether or not there is climate change. 
The real question is about where climate ranks in the level of priority we should be allocating, compared with other issues facing us. 
A crowd, or even the entire population, of climate scientists is not better placed to make this evaluation than the average well informed layperson. 
Indeed, the priorities being pushed by a special interest group should be treated with caution, specifically because of their particular focus and lack of overall objectivity. 
Which is, of course, why you all put such effort into trying to create Alarm in order to get your favourite a higher priority than it objectively warrants.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1521664655000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'their particular focus and lack of overall objectivity', u'effect': u'should be treated with caution'}], u'author_id': u'13022945', u'in_reply_to': u'113830283', u'id': u'113854936', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'AvMichelCroz', u'text': u'“The crowd has spoken.

In an amusing poll a few years ago, it was reported that more than 80% of British “preferred the queen”. Only reading the small print showed that the alternatives included Elton John. 
So people worry about climate change. As they should. No surprise. A proper analysis would have reviewed a range of current issues and compared the extent to which people considered them to be of concern (immediacy and seriousness).

First- he compiles a selection of US climate data that all show the 1930s heatwave to be a peak in warming- with cooling following. Example after after example.
What conclusions can be drawn? that a small part of 2% of the globes surface has seen some reduced heatwave activity. And this is important- he only focuses on one data point- i.e. hot days.Global warming is the entire globe- so an area with less heatwave days tells you little, and AGW was not only predicted to push up averages but for the Arctic to have more warming, as well warmers winters [globally] and warmer nights.Next- Al Gore and James Hansen get it wrong.Al Gore is not a climate scientist so his opinion is irrelevant.James Hansen did science in studies- not in newspaper articles-But one prediction made to a journalist about the Westside Highway being under water sometime in the coming years [2008 is the supposed quoted time the prediction was for]came true in 2012.Next - NOAA is altering data - true, but they make no secret of it, and they explain why and there is no serious scientific concern, no outrage, not even an attempt by anyone to challenge it .We then have a conspiracy theory of how climate scientists have turned cooling into warming.The next piece of 'evidence' is 1970s temperature records that show the cooling of global dimming that occurred after the 1940s- associate with global economic growth and sulphur pollution.Climate scientists found cooling in the N.Hemisphere - Goddard accepts this and.... what does this mean? NASA NOAA erased this cooling trend.Except they didn't- it is still there but when the entire global temperature is taken into account the northern hemisphere is warmed up by the southern hemisphere.
Either Goddard is an idiot for not spotting this or he thinks everyone else can be fooled with such flawed arguments. [i wonder if he needs a bridge?]Then 'hide the decline' really if you are so desperate to recycle myths then he can't be too confident in the explosive nature of uncovering the great global warming conspiracy by the world's climate scientists. 
Antarctic cooling, whatever, but what is this? Goddard now trusts the very same organisations that are corrupt when they do mention something he likes?!?This of course does not last when he reveals they make cooling - warming?
But how far does the rabbit hole go?SLR has also been adjusted to be faster by the evil corrupt NASA/NOAA.

Models can be science - I'm very interested in modelling petroleum reservoirs, & I am only too well aware that a reservoir of a few cubic miles is impossible to model
BQEND
And yet oil companies all over the world use such models to plan and develop oilfields, and don't go bust. They even use it to support their SEC Reserves submissions (Exxon Mobil didn't used to - don't know about now - but the SEC accepts the model-based reserves from the others). And you can go to jail for mis-stating SEC Reserves.
Funny that.
Seems like your interest in petroleum models doesn't extend to actually learning something about them. Whereas I've used them and built them. 
They're really just the same as climate models you know. Gridding, finite-difference solvers, temperature and pressure changes, fluid flow, conservation of physical properties, upscaling, downscaling, pseudoization (= parameterisation), forward prediction ((= projection), history matching, 1D, 2D and 3D analytical (= ""toy"") models to refine parameters or to sense-check processes, fine-scale models which capture the small-scale physics to aid pseudoization or parameterisation, coarse models plugged into a well-pipework-market network (analogous to climate models with economics etc. bolted on).
Perhaps you could start by learning about petroleum models because you won't be put off by ""trigger words"". 
However first you should learn the basics because without that models can lead you astray.

As discussed in Chapters 1 (Section 1.4) and 12 (Section 12.2), climate projections are subject to several sources of uncertainty. Here three main sources are distinguished. The first arises from natural internal variability, which is intrinsic to the climate system, and includes phenomena such as variability in the mid-latitude storm tracks and the ENSO. The existence of internal variability places fundamental limits on the precision with which future climate variables can be projected. The second is uncertainty concerning the past, present and future forcing of the climate system by natural and anthropogenic forcing agents such as GHGs, aerosols, solar forcing and land use change. Forcing agents may be specified in various ways, for example, as emissions or as concentrations (see Section 12.2). The third is uncertainty related to the response of the climate system to the specified forcing agents.

Over the past decade, we have been collaborating with Ben Santer at LLNL (along with numerous other investigators) to compare our tropospheric results with the predictions of climate models. Our results can be summarized as follows: 
 Over the past 35 years, the troposphere has warmed significantly. The global average temperature has risen at an average rate of about 0.18 degrees Kelvin per decade (0.32 degrees F per decade). Climate models cannot explain this warming if human-caused increases in greenhouse gases are not included as input to the model simulation. The spatial pattern of warming is consistent with human-induced warming. See Santer et al 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012 for more about the detection and attribution of human induced changes in atmospheric temperature using MSU/AMSU data.
 
But....
 The troposphere has not warmed quite as fast as most climate models predict. Note that this problem has been reduced by the large 2015-2106 El Nino Event, and the updated version of the RSS tropospheric datasets.
BQEND
BQSTART
One possible explanation is an error in the fundamental physics used by the climate models. In addition to this possibility, there are at least three other plausible explanations for the warming rate differences. There are errors in the forcings used as input to the model simulations (these include forcings due to anthropogenic gases and aerosols, volcanic aerosols, solar input, and changes in ozone), errors in the satellite observations (partially addressed by the use of the uncertainty ensemble), and sequences of internal climate variability in the simulations that are difference from what occurred in the real world. We call to these four explanations “model physics errors”, “model input errors”, “observational errors”, and “different variability sequences”. They are not mutually exclusive. In fact, t here is hard scientific evidence that all four of these factors contribute to the discrepancy, and that most of it can be explained without resorting to model physics errors.  For a detailed discussion of all these reasons, see the post on the Skeptical Science blog by Ben Santer and Carl Mears, and the recent paper in Nature Geoscience by Santer et al.

Zeke Hausfather has an explanation of what the paper found at Carbon Brief. 
The technical element I would like to emphasis is this one.
BQSTART
However, the bands measured by the satellite instruments cannot easily provide the temperature of a specific layer of the atmosphere. Researchers have identified particular sets of bands that correspond to the temperature of the lower troposphere (TLT) spanning roughly 0 to 10 km, the middle troposphere (TMT) spanning around 0 to 20 km and the lower stratosphere (TLS) spanning 10 to 30 km. 
 Unfortunately, these bands tend to overlap a bit. For example, TMT estimates will include part of the lower stratosphere, while TLT estimates will include some surface temperature. These overlaps matter because different parts of the atmosphere are expected to react very differently to climate change.
 Because the tropospheric temperature estimates from satellites overlap with part of the stratosphere, they end up combining a bit of stratospheric cooling with tropospheric warming and can underestimate the true rate of warming. To avoid this issue, the new study applies a correction to remove some of the stratospheric cooling from the TMT series. The approach they use for this is described in a previous paper published in the Journal of Climate.

BQENDEach of these sweeps is picking up an enormous lump of atmosphere with many things happening in it. The tropopause (where the tropsophere changes to the stratosphere can vary in altitude from about 17 to about 9km, that means that these layers will including differing parts of the atmosphere at differing latitudes.
I think it is useful trying to get a mental picture of the tropopause changing over the distance from the equator to the Arctic\Antarctic circles then think of the difficulties in inferring temperature trends from this giant chunk of sky across the whole planet.
Its a tough bit of science but useful in backing up the surface record.

So what are the corrections made by the RSS team? As I mentioned earlier, the orbits of the satellites change over time which means that locations where measurements are made at a given time of the day change (it drifts). To account for these changes, RSS used a combination of satellite comparisons, climate models, and something called climate reanalysis to estimate changes in the temperature with time. They included measurements from other instruments as a check, such as weather balloons. RSS also identified bad data – when multiple measurements were made and one of the measurements disagreed substantially with the others, it was suspect. They also caught a calibration error that lead to changes in warming rate. 
BQEND
0nly 15 instruments over 38 years. the instrument itself has calibration issues in that once it flies it has a hard time ensuring they get the degredation of the instrument right.
But this correction was dropping the satellites that had the most orbital drift.
I think they dropped NOAA18 completely, NOAA 15 after 2011 and AQUA after 2009.
I think (from Z Hausfather) the satellite data now shows warming 5% faster than the surface records from 1979.
A cat among the pigeons to be sure.

Or a journalist.
And have you read the book? According to the blurb it distinguishes situations where WOTC works and where it doesn't. I'm betting it works with stuff everyone understands, like guessing how many beans there are in a jar, but not where hardly anyone understands it. Then you ask a crowd of experts, not the general public. Care to take that bet, Av?
And actually even if we do go with the general public. Oh, look. Gallup have very kindly asked the question already. Of a crowd.

Global Warming Concern at Three-Decade High in U.S.

BQSTART
Forty-five percent of Americans now say they worry ""a great deal"" about global warming, up from 37% a year ago and well above the recent low point of 25% in 2011. The previous high was 41%, recorded in 2007. Another 21% currently say they worry ""a fair amount"" about global warming, while 18% worry ""only a little"" and 16% worry ""not at all.""

In 2009, the EPA completed its review of the climate science literature and correctly concluded in its Endangerment Finding that carbon pollution poses such a threat via climate change. That document is the foundation for all government climate policies, including the Obama Administration’s Clean Power Plan. Climate deniers have thus long had their sights set on revoking the Endangerment Finding.
That’s a tall order, since the scientific literature is crystal clear on this question. House Republicans first tried to simply rewrite the Clean Air Act to state the greenhouse gases aren’t pollutants, but they failed to get nearly enough support to pass that legislation. Next they proposed setting up a ‘Red Team’ of climate deniers to debate the mainstream climate science ‘Blue Team.’ But Trump’s chief of staff John Kelly worried that having this prominent debate on the record would be a distraction and potentially expose the administration to litigation, so he killed the idea. 
However, E&amp;E News reports that Pruitt has a safer Plan B: take public comments on petitions asking EPA to revisit the Endangerment Finding. This would appease the deniers by allowing them to officially make their case, but the EPA wouldn’t be under any obligation to take action. It’s a fight Pruitt knows he would lose in court, because the science is not on the deniers’ side, so he would prefer to simply weaken the Clean Power Plan, eliminate as many other federal climate policies as possible, and delay all US climate action until the clock runs out on the Trump administration.
There have been two petitions filed against the Endangerment Finding. The first was submitted by a group of climate contrarians who failed to understand basic climate science. I discussed the fundamental mistakes in their arguments last year.
The second petition was submitted by two fossil fuel-funded think tanks: the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Science and Environmental Policy Project. It tried to refute the Endangerment Finding’s three lines of evidence supporting human-caused global warming: 
1) Scientists’ basic physical understanding of factors that impact the climate system like the increasing greenhouse effect and natural influences.
2) Scientific evidence that global warming over the last several decades is ‘unusual.’
3) The use of climate models to simulate the patterns resulting from natural and human-caused climate change.
To refute the first point, the petition claimed that there’s been “the absence of any strong warming trend.” To support this argument, the deniers considered only atmospheric temperature estimates from satellite data, which have much larger uncertainty than data collected by thousands of thermometers at Earth’s surface. Even the satellite data best estimates is that the lower atmosphere has warmed 0.15–0.3°C over the past 20 years, depending on which data set we use.
But atmospheric temperatures are just a small part of the global warming story. Surface temperatures have warmed about 0.35°C during that time. 2014, 2015, and 2016 each broke the record, and 2017 was the hottest year on record at Earth’s surface without an El Niño event. Moreover, the oceans have continued to break heat records and natural thermometers like melting ice and earlier seasons have also continued to show signs of rapid global warming.
And the petition didn’t even dispute the Endangerment Finding’s point that climate scientists understand the factors like the greenhouse effect that impact global temperatures. So their effort to refute this point failed on every possible level. Instead of successfully refuting the Endangerment Finding’s basis, they basically just denied the very existence of global warming once again.
To refute the Endangerment Finding’s second point that recent global warming is unusual, the petition argued that global temperatures have been both hotter and colder in the past, so we’re “within the bounds of natural variability.” This fails to address the point that global temperatures are now warming 20 to 50 times faster than during Earth’s fastest natural climate changes. The petition then again went off-topic, arguing that recent warming is due to solar activity (which has had a cooling effect over the past 60 years) and natural cycles (which don’t cause long-term temperature trends).
And to refute the Endangerment Finding’s third point, the petition argued that climate models are inaccurate. To make this argument, the deniers relied on an error-riddled chart produced by John Christy, which was refuted by a peer-reviewed study last year (which the petition neglects to mention). And again, the chart only considered atmospheric temperature estimates from satellite data; the petition ignored the remarkable accuracy of climate models in simulating global surface temperatures and other climate change patterns.
The evidence supporting human-caused global warming is overwhelming, which is why there’s a 97% expert consensus on the subject. To argue the contrary, or at least that global warming is overblown, deniers are forced to resort to cherry picking data. And even their cherry-picked data confirms global warming.
Deniers have already lost this debate in the peer-reviewed literature. John Kelly is right to fear the distraction and potential liability of associating the Trump administration with these terrible arguments. Kelly is a military man, and the military doesn’t have the luxury of denying the threats posed by climate change. 
But if they can appease the deniers by allowing them to make these bogus arguments in comments that the EPA can largely ignore, Pruitt and Kelly will view it as a win-win outcome. As long as the Endangerment Finding stands so that the next administration can use it to implement climate policies, it’s a win for all of us.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/19/john-kelly-shut-down-pruitts-climate-denial-red-team-but-they-have-a-plan-b

I am aware of these ""artist expeditions"" - and I have much hope for them. Because we scientists tend to report back the changes we observe - and thus forget (or with few exceptions, are not able) to report the magnificence which is up there. To be lost. 
I do not quite know how to say the next. We got report for another tourist cruice - ending up with the killing of a polar bear. 
In a way I wish everyone the chance to go and see the beauty of pristine nature - even as it decays under our human actions. But on the other hand, the ""last chance to see"" tourism is also the excess lives we live that is a major reason for the polar bears now having to hunt on land instead on the sea-ice based seal hunting they adapted to. 
It is a double slam that we first melt the sea-ice due to our consumption at home, then see the potential for cruise-ship holidays on the recently de-iced Ocean (polar bear hunting ground) - then taking the light boats to shore - just to be attacked by starving land-locked polar bear - ending with shooting it to death to defend ourselves from the dangers of nature. 
If there is a heart-breaking story - it is this one. Also because it is so universal. 
I would also like to say that after the good walk-through of the history (up to mining) - Svalbard is now a international hub for Arctic research and education. Not only on ground monitoring, but also for global remote sensing data. 
And as architect, I would have liked to read about your take on the classical methods used even for modern buildings (like the University building) - with wood (not concrete) driven down into the permafrost as the most stable fundament). 
And the fact that the little town of Spitsbergen now has pretty much it's entire planning regime being rewritten. 
... Just having written this I notice my own professional bias and genes kicking in, and pretty much destroying what I opened with. 
Us scientists do not report how beautiful it is. We report on the losses and changes we observe. 
That is the reason I am so supportive of these ""artistic expedions"". Someone must remind us how amazing this planet is. This other perspective.

Still inflated, it clings to its spherical dignity, while the ropes that connect it to its upended basket describe elegant catenaries. It is a dark silhouette against a horizonless surround, in which the white ice of the foreground grades into a lightly greying sky.
The two men posing by the basket and the one behind the camera don’t have long to live. They will make it across the ice back to land but, with inadequate provisions and equipment, will die there. It will take some decades before their remains and their camera are found. Such was the fate of the 1897 expedition, brave to the point of idiocy, in which the Swede SA Andrée tried to fly to the north pole. He used a steering system that was almost certain not to work, and he set off in his newly made balloon without final checks for leaks.
Andrée was driven by national pride, a desire to prove the virility of Sweden. In this he was not alone. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, urged on by excitable press coverage, explorers risked their lives to prove their own and their nations’ superiority. Two different Americans, Frederick Cook in 1908 and Robert Peary in 1909, said they were the first to reach the pole, and in 1926 another, Richard Byrd, claimed he was the first to fly there. All their claims have since been cast in doubt. In the 1920s Mussolini used the airship exploits of the Italian Umberto Nobile to promote his regime. When Nobile went missing in 1928 the great Norwegian Roald Amundsen, although he didn’t care for fascism, would die in the internationally publicised race to find him.
The Arctic can have this effect on people: its function in the imagination of the world is as a place to test or define, to look for some truth about existence by viewing it from its limit. The challenge of its otherness might explain why Mary Shelley chose to open Frankenstein in the Arctic wastes, and why the Soviets built the showcase coalmining town of Pyramiden more grandly and formally than its function required. Now the significance of the Arctic is above all about climate change, its effects there being particularly visible, significant and dangerous.
What if we couldn’t stand each other, on this vessel alone on icy seas? Agatha Christie would have loved the scenario
The belief that the Arctic has something to tell us motivates the Arctic Circle residency, a programme whereby artists, scientists and writers can, for half the actual cost, take part in expeditions aboard a tall sailing ship, around the coasts and islands of Svalbard. Feeling the need for new perspectives on life, I applied – and in early June joined 28 other participants, plus guides and crew, on the three-masted barquentine Antigua. Two weeks without night or internet, ignorant of World Cup results and the latest Trump eruptions, voyaging between 78 and 81 degrees north, going where the wind suggested, marvelling at glaciers in shades of blue beyond the power of words or cameras to capture – cobalt? cerulean? sapphire? “Are you going to find yourself,” teased a friend, “under an iceberg?”
There is an element of the mythical about Svalbard. Its mention can draw blank looks, except from readers of Philip Pullman who know it as the land of armoured bears but who still don’t know much about the nonfictional version. It is better known as Spitsbergen, the name given by the Dutch navigator Willem Barents when he discovered it in 1596, more than a century after Columbus reached America. Norwegian patriotism led to its renaming in the 20th century: through the optimistic reading of an ambiguous medieval account, it was decided that the Vikings had got there first and called it Svalbard. It is, in any case, an archipelago far north of Norway, a bit smaller than Scotland, the last bit of Europe before the north pole. The name Spitsbergen is still applied to its largest island.
Svalbard’s shape on a map, a splat of kelp upon a rock, may be the least familiar in Europe. It occupies the zone where Mercator’s and other projections dissolve into absurdity, with Svalbard becoming either nonsensically big or weirdly distorted, sometimes getting left out altogether. On globes it can disappear beneath the black plastic cap that holds the object in place. An azimuthal projection, the kind that puts the north pole at the centre of concentric circles of latitude, reveals it to have more to do with the cold family of Arctic lands – Greenland, the islands of north Russia and Canada – than with the European mainland.
Human history has a shallow grip on Svalbard. Before Barents (or those Vikings) arrived, there were no indigenous populations, no equivalent of Inuit in north America, nobody at all. It wasn’t until the 20th century that people started living there permanently, and such life has been extreme, framed by tales of endurance and danger: explorers stuck in the ice through long winters, stranded travellers surviving in snow holes for months, whalers taking insane risks in pursuit of profit, the appalling working conditions and mortality rates of miners.
Animal and plant life, too, looks like something that could easily be scraped off the surface of the land. Springy moss, purple and yellow saxifrage, and a type of buttercup stay within centimetres of the ground. There are no trees, except for low, flat willow and birch that take decades to reach the size of dinner plates. There are no butterflies or bees. Whereas the polar sea is abundant in life, vertebrate species on land are few, if memorable: polar bears, arctic fox, reindeer, ptarmigan.
Instead there is naked geology, exemplary sedimentary mountains whose layers were formed by hundreds of millions of years of shifting land and sea, back to a time when what is now Svalbard was located south of the equator. On one edge, where plate movements pressed it against what is now Greenland, they twist and buckle. Elsewhere equally exemplary igneous rocks, formed in intense heat and pressure in the earlier history of the planet, create the hard, spiky skylines that gave Spitsbergen (“pointed mountains”) its name.
Formations that in other lands would be worth a journey by themselves are here commonplace. They are unforgiving, even tedious, in their sterile magnificence. Animation comes from the clarity, luminosity and subtle alterations of the famous Arctic light. Because the light reflects in all directions off snow and ice, and because sunshine comes (especially around midnight) at a low angle, you are suspended in it. At the same hour, when the shadows deepen and when a light meter would register a lowering of levels but all still looks dazzling, there is a bright-dark quality comparable to that of a solar eclipse.
Along with rock and light, the landscape is made of four other elements – ice, snow, cloud and water – all, of course, variants of the same substance. Their changes and interactions are infinite. You know them underfoot, hard or collapsing, as well as by sight. Above all, there are the glaciers, one after another, covering much of Svalbard, crackling and growling with their internal forces, crumbling into pillars and pinnacles with the unsteady and unlikely beauty of the about-to-collapse. One in particular, the currently surging glacier of Wahlenbergbreen, resembles an army of orks, ranks of ugly upright giants marching to their collapse into the sea, where they will turn into glistening floating ornaments, whose cute technical name is “bergy bits”.
You see clearly that everything is in inorganic motion, if at different speeds – waves, ice, strata, continental plates, weather. There are similarities of patterns: a field of moss looks like a mountain range, ice floes drift like clouds, glacier ice behaves like rock, only speeded up. All landscapes are temporary, as the architect Cedric Price said of buildings, but some are more temporary than others.
The Arctic’s absence of measures like trees and houses makes it hard to read the scale of a glacier – 100ft high? 400ft? More? Dry haze-less air makes distance inscrutable, removing the aerial perspective that helps us read depth. The sun’s 24-hour, 360-degree path messes with time and orientation. It is otherworldly. It is a sketch of another planet. It is not greatly bothered about human presence, even though human presence has the potential to be devastating: whatever the poltroons who deny it might say, this ice is indeed retreating and, quite apart from its effects when it turns up in melted form in a town or field near you, a world of beauty will be destroyed.
So there we were, a group of strangers collectively categorised as creative, industriously trying to make sense of it all. We were mostly from the anglosphere – Canadians, Americans, British, Australians – with a Peruvian and a Norwegian. The guides and crew, some of them artists and writers themselves, some former participants in the residency who liked Svalbard so much that they came back, were part of the collective exploratory society.
“Don’t get eaten by a polar bear” was common advice before I left, but Other People were scarier. What if we couldn’t stand each other, on this vessel alone on icy seas? Agatha Christie would have loved the scenario: a confined space, multiple personal histories, several ways to die. It didn’t seem auspicious that my allocated cabin-mate greeted me with a box of earplugs and the warning that he snores. But I slept, partly by imagining that his occasional rumblings were the sounds of glaciers or walruses. Collectively we participants got along well, not only because it was clearly dumb not to, but also because this was a group of likable and dedicated people. There were irritations, to be sure, and occasional outbreaks of what might be considered madness, but the overwhelming experience was the pleasure of encountering people we wouldn’t have met otherwise, and making lasting friendships.
We were conscious of a precedent – in 2005 a group called Cape Farewell organised a residency in Svalbard that included Ian McEwan and Antony Gormley, that formed the basis of McEwan’s novel Solar. We were a less starry bunch but possibly we had a better time, not least because they went in the harsh month of March. It helped that we were lucky with wildlife – two blue whales within an hour of leaving port, six bears in three sightings, an extended viewing of an ugly of walruses, plus seals, arctic fox, reindeer and an array of birds. (And, yes, according to some contested sources an “ugly” is a collective noun for those large brown sea beasts.)
If it would be nice to tell daring tales of narrow escapes but the truth is that dangerous places have to be highly managed. On land, you can’t leave the protection of the guides, who are armed with rifles as a last resort against polar bears (although there was a mildly alarming moment involving a grounded boat and a curious bear). You could swim in the extremely cold water or go up the ship’s foremast in a safety harness, but these are hardly epic adventures.
Rather, we busied ourselves with our personal attempts to respond to the Arctic. Two artists, Adam Kuby from Portland Oregon and Shohei Katayama from Pittsburg, collaborated on filling a crack in ice with gold-coloured fabric and photographed it. Emma Hoette, one of the crew, who is currently studying at the Laban centre in London, reprised a performance where she sits on a cold rock, naked but for a woollen neck warmer that she slowly unravels. Philip Kanwischer, from Calgary, made a digitally altered photograph of our anxieties: that curious bear multiplied several times over. All had to observe the same rule: you may leave nothing behind on the islands and beaches and take nothing away. Any manmade objects that might be older than 1946 – barrel hoops, shoes, broken bottles — are designated as cultural artefacts and must not be touched.
The Arctic doesn’t give a damn about us. If it could have a preference, it would want us dead
Writers took notes for future poems and essays. I read an account of the 1873 expedition of the explorer Benjamin Leigh Smith, who happens to have been my great-great-great uncle, and traced the intersections of his routes with ours. In Mosselbukta, where he found a Swedish expedition that had spent the Arctic winter trapped by ice, I saw the ruins of a flatpacked house these pre-Ikea Swedes had built. It later collapsed; its timbers are miraculously preserved by the dry, cold air.
As a writer on architecture, I had imagined that the appeal of the Arctic would include its lack of my usual subject matter, but there are buildings there too, all the more poignant for their survival in hostile places. There are the structures of coalmining, mineheads perched on near-cliffs and long-legged conveyor systems that recall the inventions of HG Wells or the Walking Cities of the 1960s architectural group Archigram. There are trappers’ huts, researchers’ cabins and tiny refuges for travellers, all solitary specks in the vast landscape. There is the steel mast from which in 1926 Raoul Amundsen and Umberto Nobile, at that point collaborating with each other, flew in an airship to the north pole.
These structures are to the point. They waste no energy. They combine flimsy-looking tarpaper with oversized driftwood because that is what is to hand. It would be lost effort to cut up the wood into more proportionate pieces. Decorated at most with reindeer antlers or a bear’s jawbone, they have the striking aesthetic of buildings that don’t have time for aesthetics, their unusual asymmetries of lightness and mass being responses to unusual conditions.
The same cannot be said of Pyramiden, a piece of the Soviet Union on foreign soil, made possible by international treaty that gives certain countries additional to Norway rights to Svalbard. It is now a frigid modern Pompeii, where guided tours can visit the dead 1990s house plants, the idle kitchen equipment, the northernmost grand piano and the increasingly quaint office machines that were left behind when, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and with it the withdrawal of the town’s state support, Pyramiden was abandoned. The black coal fields, striking after all that pure ice, are apocalyptic.
In its 1970s heyday it was an exhibition town, a sought-after posting for Soviet citizens, with model apartment buildings and the world’s northernmost bust of Lenin gazing down an avenue nicknamed the Champs Élysées. It has the only turf in Svalbard, imported from the Ukraine, on which the only dandelions sometimes flower. It has a shed where strawberries were grown. Its buildings are higher than anywhere else in the archipelago, and its mining structures more elaborate and massive – as much to make them impressive as out of necessity. As an exercise in pitting man against nature, with the associated effects of hubris, it has something in common with the Swedish balloon.
Svalbard architecture exposes with special lucidity the heroism and foibles of human life, which is what the Arctic does more generally. It doesn’t give a damn about us. If it could have a preference, it would want us dead. But its very implacability makes us want to read ourselves in it and enables us to do so. The message of those sedimentary mountains is that, over a scale of tens of millions of years, nature will probably shrug off whatever monstrosities we inflict on it, as it has previous catastrophes like meteorites and volcanic explosions, but that will be much too late for us. This realisation makes climate change more urgent, not less. We made this problem and it is down to us to fix it. There is no one and nothing else to help us.
It’s a little preposterous to seek the meaning of the Arctic, but if it has one it’s in what it reflects. One of the strangest sights was, after 10 days’ sailing, of a man we hadn’t met before. Wonders included the rediscovery, over a return via Oslo airport to Britain, of crowds, summer warmth, trees, trucks, streetlamps, passwords, football results and new Trump eruptions much like the old ones, of a snail trail and a mulberry bush in the garden. Some of these things seemed inconsequential, some repulsive, some precious. A possibly obvious truth was vividly reinforced, which is that there is no fundamental reason why any of them are here. We’d miss them, some of them, if they weren’t.

… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for humanity and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute. Thank you.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/28/svalbard-expedition-arctic-trip-artists-and-writers-rowan-moore

There are several equipments used to filter and retain PM - Particulate Material and/or Gases generated by industries that use iron ore, coal, oil, gas, waste and others feedstock in their industrial processes.
With the combined use of 2 of the equipments mentioned below, now there is solution to eliminate much of this pollution.
A) ESP: Electrostatic Precipitator.
B) ESP-SS: Electrostatic Precipitator with Selective Switching.
C) ACI: Activated Carbon Injection or DSI: Dry Sorbent Injection.
D) ESP-SS/ACI/DSI: which is the combination of equipments B and C.
E) Post-treatment equipment: Scrubber, Bag Filter, or other.
The new technology SS, mentioned in item B) was developed inside the Federal University of ES - UFES in Vitória/Brasil, and is capable of retaining 60% of the Pollution released into atmosphere through the chimneys by thousands of industries worldwide.
The diagram below summarizes the uses of this equipments:
It is known that iron ore and/or fossil fuels and waste used as feedstock in base industry and/or thermoelectric power plants have many organic and metallic components in their structure, therefore:
• They generate millions of tons of Particulate Material and Gases, not retained by industrial filters, and release them into the atmosphere.
Even gas and oil, used by Thermoelectric, which release small amounts of ash, release large quantities of gases with many toxins, as well as mercury, arsenic, lead, radio isotopes, and others.
• The big challenge is to capture these gaseous components.
• Now, with ESP-SS/ACI/DSI this capture will be done, because the activated carbon ou sorbents to be injected into the ESP-SS/ACI/DSI will aggregate these gases in their surface area, allowing the capture and retention.
• Injection of activated carbon and/or sorbents is already done in some Thermoelectric in the USA that use ESP without SS technology, and thus only manage to aggregate and retain small amounts of Gases.
• Studies show that when granulation of the activated carbon ir sorbent currently used in the present ESP, of 19 μm in diameter, could be substituted for others with super fine diameter, a very large increase in the retention of these gases will occur. Currently activated carbon or sorbent of 19 μm is used because current ESP does not have technical capacity to retain PMs with smaller diameter.
• The ESP-SS, already is the solution to capture 60% of all the particulate material currently emitted into the atmosphere, and when become a ESP-SS/ACI/DSI using activated carbon and / or sorbent of PM size 0.1 up to 1.0 μm, will capture a very large percentage of the gases. This is possible because ESP-SS has the technical capacity to retain all the PMs greater than PM 0.1 μm.
• The ESP-SS/ACI/DSI, in the 2º step, that will be available in 3 years, when it is ready the new version of Relay LP 100 KV, fundamental piece of the Technology SS, produced in the UNITED STATES under license of TCS Ltda, will be able to retain over 95% of PMs and Gases today released into the atmosphere, and then the use of any post -treatment equipment, mentioned in item E), will no longer be necessary.
• The TCS Company, owner of the World Patent of SS technology, is negotiating the sale of the aforementioned Patent to an American or a Chinese Group, and hopes to start the manufacturing the first ESP-SS/ACI/DSI equipment still during 2018.

let’s define our terms: the concept of a wicked problem dates to the 1970s, when two researchers used it to describe problems with no obvious or clear solution. Today, they’re also thought of as problems for which time to find a solution is running out.
BQENDA more complete definition (courtesy of
wickedproblems.com) is:

a social or cultural problem that is difficult or impossible to solve for as many as four reasons: incomplete or contradictory knowledge, the number of people and opinions involved, the large economic burden, and the interconnected nature of these problems with other problems.
And the real issue, the one that makes so many modern-world problems resistant to solution is that interconnectedness. We successfully ""solved"" the ozone depletion problem because it was straight froward: CFCs destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere - ban CFCs and the problem goes away.
But climate change is not so clear cut. Not, as the media likes to think, because ignorant people still don't believe it exists - almost everybody, including every single scientist who isn't being paid directly by energy companies in the USA, readily acknowledges it is real. But it is hard because it doesn't have a single solution. Energy use is closely linked to economic development. The use of highly polluting sources: coal, oil, even wood-burning, is a phase that societies go through before they can afford to adopt large-scale renewable or nuclear solutions. Ones that don't pollute the atmosphere.
The question then gets complicated as western countries can be accused of ""pulling up the ladder"". Since we have the wealth to use non-polluting energy sources, the complaint is that our climate change protocols are preventing less developed parts of the world from attaining the same quality of life, longevity and breadth of choices that we enjoy. Have we got the right to tell them they can't do the things that we used to do?
And it is that interconnected web of issues: western privilege, aspirations of the poor, economic pressure, cost and lack of technology. All of which makes tackling climate change so difficult. Merely assuming that the solution to climate change that works for the world's wealthiest countries is easily transferable to those a rung or two down the ladder is false. That is the first problem that has to be addressed. Only then can we start to properly and sustainably tackle the central issue of CO2 emissions and climate change.
And only by applying the same broad vision: that one solution does not fit all, can we address all the other issues regarding education, equality, repression, religion, food and water supply, plastic pollution and wars.', u'recommendation_count': u'5', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1530541819000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'it was straight froward', u'effect': u'we successfully solved the problem'}, {u'cause': u""ignorant people still do n't believe it exists"", u'effect': u'as the media likes to think'}, {u'cause': u""it does n't have a single solution"", u'effect': u'but it is hard'}], u'author_id': u'4109931', u'id': u'117710109', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Northforce', u'text': u'This comment was removed by a moderator because it didn't abide by our

The battle against climate change action is in reality an economic war to maintain the status quo. Corporate interests and political interests have deliberately thrown up smoke screens to prevent any action being taken in order continue their own enrichment. We know that the most vulnerable; the poor, women and children; will be the major victims. 
It took 2 world wars to change the social order, through the empowerment of women, the working class and colonised peoples. But climate change is not a war that can be ended with a peace treaty. It's not a war that will empower the underdog. it's a war that will destroy society rather than change it.

But these are exactly the kinds of problems that researchers everywhere can help with – especially if we use methods that include and draw attention to the communities most affected by them.
First, let’s define our terms: the concept of a wicked problem dates to the 1970s, when two researchers used it to describe problems with no obvious or clear solution. Today, they’re also thought of as problems for which time to find a solution is running out.
A good example of a “wicked problem” is climate change, but there arenumerous others: lack of access to healthcare and clean water, to agriculturalland, sovereignty and self-determination, and the prevalence of poverty andviolence.In the case of climate change, the bulk of evidence supports the findings of the US Climate Science Special Report, which states that it is “extremely likely” that human activities have caused warming since the mid-20th century. The report reviewed thousands of scientific studies from around the world that documented changes in surface, atmospheric, and oceanic temperatures; melting glaciers; diminishing snow cover; shrinking sea ice; rising sea levels; ocean acidification; and increasing atmospheric water vapour.
Yet even with this large body of research-based evidence, we see thecontinuation of practices that are destructive to the environment – often in the name of economic development and job creation. A wicked problem seems a pretty apt description to my mind.
If the world seems to be ignoring the evidence produced and presented byresearchers, why should we have a key role to play? The answer lies in the methods we use and how these can strengthen the credibility of evidence.
We need to understand the history and not treat our participants like animals in the zoo that we have come to observe
First, our research needs to be transformative, by which I mean it needs to acknowledge that many of the problems we are facing are systemic – based in a system that is unjust, discriminatory and oppressive.
Thirty years of working with marginalised groups, including the deaf community, indigenous people, women, disabled people and members of minority ethnic groups has taught me that many of them don’t think researchers are accurately capturing their experiences. What they tell me is that researchers come, take data and leave – and they see no substantive change.Researchers can change this by being culturally respectful and responsive, and by working with people to create a platform for a change that they see as valuable for themselves and their communities.We can do this by not assuming that we understand the nature of a problemand the nature of the solution. We also need to accept and take into accountthat there are different perspectives on the same issue.In the case of climate change, for example, there are two versions ofthe same reality. One version is that climate change does not exist. Anotherversion is that a community where dozens of trucks drive over a bridge everyday has the highest rates of asthma, heart disease and cancer.
To move forward we have to make both versions visible, examine theconsequences of both and ask ourselves who suffers and who benefits.When we set out on our research, we must ask who needs to be included,how we build relationships with people and work with them, how we can be transparent and understand that things may need to be flexible and change. 
We need to understand the history and not treat our participants like animals in the zoo that we have come to observe.Unless we put the systemic nature of the world’s wicked problems out on thetable, we will not come up with solutions and our research will simply helpreinforce and perpetuate the status quo.Researchers stand at an important point in history. They can be frozen intheir tracks, continuing to do research “on people”: collecting, analysing andreporting and moving on. Or they can work in a more inclusive way that stands a better chance of solving some of the world’s wicked problems – and helping achieve economic and social justice.

A leading energy market analyst has warned that parts of the economy other than electricity will bear the brunt of Australia’s emissions reduction effort under the Paris agreement – a development that will inevitably drive up the costs of abatement for high-emitting energy, materials and industrial companies.
The warning comes as Tony Abbott has escalated his efforts to scuttle the national energy guarantee despite failing during the last parliamentary sitting fortnight to trip up Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg before a critical meeting of state energy ministers in August.
Abbott declared on Tuesday night that Australia should pull out of the Paris agreement, despite being the prime minister who signed Australia up to the agreement before being deposed from the Liberal leadership by Malcolm Turnbull in 2015.
When he signed Australia up to the Paris agreement in 2015, Abbott said there was a “definite commitment” to reduce emissions by 26% “but we believe under the policies that we’ve got, with the circumstances that we think will apply, that we can go up to 28%”.
On Tuesday night, the former prime minister told a climate sceptics group his government would have never signed up to the treaty had it known Donald Trump would pull the US out. 
“Absent America, my government would not have signed up to the Paris treaty, certainly not with the current target,” Abbott said. “Knowing what we know now, we would not have made the Paris agreement. But if we wouldn’t have done it, had we known; we shouldn’t be in it, now that we do.”
While Trump has signalled his intention to withdraw, the US cannot actually pull out until November 2020, which is close to the time of the next presidential election.
Abbott has been positioning this week to attempt to make the Neg a leadership flashpoint, suggesting on 2GB it was possible he could return to lead the Liberal party if drafted, noting “let’s just see how things work out”.
He also used an interview with News Corp before his speech to declare the Liberal party had come full circle on climate change, and was now “back to where we were in late 2009, with Malcolm Turnbull trying to do a deal with the Labor party on emissions reduction”.
Abbott unseated Turnbull from the party leadership in 2009 using his support for emissions trading as a trigger. The former prime minister also declared climate and energy policy was “not a circle you can square with the Labor party … it is a fight that has to be won”.
Abbott is attempting to rally the party base and exploit divisions within the government on the Neg with his various forays. The policy divides the National party and some Liberal conservatives, including Abbott, have held out the possibility of crossing the floor.
But his efforts to stir dissent have been met internally by a show of force.
Turnbull has declared it is time to move on from the hyper-partisanship of the decade-long climate and energy wars, and a number of Liberals and Nationals have also rallied publicly in support of the policy.
Privately, there is considerable frustration from many government MPs about Abbott’s behaviour.
With Abbott again on the warpath, the respected advisory firm RepuTex has issued new guidance saying the Neg, if implemented, will only deliver 10% of the national emissions reduction effort.
The firm says the emissions reduction target for electricity under the Neg of 26% on 2005 levels by 2030 translates to cutting national emissions by 10%, leaving a shortfall across the rest of the economy of close to 500m tonnes of carbon pollution.
The government is yet to spell out any roadmap for emissions reduction in the rest of the economy.
RepuTex says, assuming emissions will need to be reduced across the economy to conform with the Paris agreement, that will double the price of carbon to $35 per tonne by 2030 “with industry – notably high-emitting energy, materials and industrial companies – bearing the brunt of the higher abatement cost”.
“With the electricity sector locked into the Neg, other sectors – particularly large energy, materials and industrials facilities – will be called on to fill the gap to 2030”, the firm’s executive director, Hugh Grossman, says.
“As this occurs, we expect carbon contract prices to rise to $35/t in 2030 – more than double current levels – behind the need for more expensive abatement from industry.”
Grossman says abatement is cheaper in the electricity sector than elsewhere in the economy: “Abatement is far more expensive for large energy, materials and industrials facilities.”
He says the firm’s advice to clients is prices will increase considerably from 2020 “in line with the need for more expensive abatement to be triggered, and greater demand for offset buying”.
“This will lead to a higher sustained price path over time, with industry expected to contribute around half of all emissions reductions to 2030”.
While consumers are beginning to see a reduction in their energy costs due to a recent fall in wholesale prices, the latest Guardian Essential poll also shows the Turnbull government has not yet convinced voters the Neg will lower power prices.
The latest fortnightly survey of 1,030 voters shows only 15% think the Neg will help reduce energy bills, 22% think it will increase them and 38% believe it will make no difference.

Sea levels could also rise by six metres or more even if the world does meet the 2 degree target of the Paris accord.
The findings, published last week in Nature Geoscience, were based on observations of evidence from three warm periods in the past 3.5m years in which global temperatures were 0.5-2 degrees above the pre-industrial temperatures of the 19th century. 
The researchers say they increase the urgency with which countries need to address their emissions. 
The scientists used a range of measurements to piece together the impacts of past climatic changes to examine how a warmer earth would appear once the climate has stabilised.
They found sustained warming of one to two degrees had been accompanied by substantial reductions of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and sea level rises of at least six metres – several metres higher than what current climate models predict could occur by 2100.
“During that time, the temperatures were much warmer than what our models are predicting and the sea levels were much higher,” said Katrin Meissner from the University of New South Wales’s Climate Change Research Centre and one of the study’s lead authors.
She said the effects today would mean populous urban areas around the world and entire countries in the Pacific would be underwater.
“Two degrees can seem very benign when you see it on paper but the consequences are quite bad and ecosystems change dramatically.”
Meissner said potential changes even at two degrees of warming were underestimated in climate models that focused on the near term.
“Climate models appear to be trustworthy for small changes, such as for low-emission scenarios over short periods, say over the next few decades out to 2100,” she said. “But as the change gets larger or more persistent ... it appears they underestimate climate change.”
The researchers looked at three documented warm periods, the Holocene thermal maximum, which occurred 5,000 to 9,000 years ago, the last interglacial, which occurred 116,000 to 129,000 years ago, and the mid-Pliocene warm period, which occurred 3m to 3.3 m years ago.
In the case of the first two periods examined, the climate changes were caused by changes in the earth’s orbit. The mid-Pliocene event was the result of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations that were at similar levels to what they are today.
In each case, the planet had warmed at a much slower rate than it is warming at today as a result of rising greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans. 
“Observations of past warming periods suggest that a number of amplifying mechanisms, which are poorly represented in climate models, increase long-term warming beyond climate model projections,” Prof Hubertus Fischer of the University of Bern, one of the study’s lead authors.
“This suggests the carbon budget to avoid 2°C of global warming may be far smaller than estimated, leaving very little margin for error to meet the Paris targets.”
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.

Sinking it into the ground is going to mean a 35 metre excavation then waterproofing, insulation and so on. Roughly, the equivalent of adding another 8-10 floors of basement. That's not a £1.5 million job. It's tens of times thaas at asasas at as t.
And I've no idea how you've been taught to do a payback calculation, but no business school would recognise is. The cost of capital on commercial buildings is a minimum of 5% (I can buy ten year fixed income bonds at that); more realistically 8% or so.
So, before we start, and using your £1.5 million, I'm paying £120K a year on financial charges. O&M is usually reckoned about 3%, so another £45K on top of that.
They're not buying electricity at £78/MWh - they're buying gas at most 3.5p/kWh (£35/MWh). Remember, this is about heat storage, not electricity.
OK, lets assume an average load of about half peak (2MW) over the year - that's 8000MWh. Or gas costing £280,000. Assume half of that saved, and we're at £140,000. I'm not on a 30 year payback - I'm on a net £25,000 per year loss. At minimum.

It sounds like spinning straw into gold: suck carbon dioxide from the air where it's contributing to climate change and turn it into fuel for cars, trucks and jets. 
A British Columbia company says in newly published research that it's doing just that — and for less than one-third the cost of other companies working on the same technology.
""This isn't a PowerPoint presentation,"" said Steve Oldham of Carbon Engineering. ""It's real.""...
It costs Climeworks about US$600 a tonne to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Carbon Engineering says it can do the job for between US$94 and US$232 a tonne because it uses technology and components that are well understood and commercially available.
""We're tapping into existing industrial equipment and then defining a new process and applying some unique chemistry to it,"" said Oldham.
Carbon Engineering's plant in Squamish, B.C., currently pulls about one tonne of carbon a day from the air and produces about two barrels of fuel. Since its components are off the rack, it should be easy to scale up, Oldham said.

“The sewage is entering at 17.8 degrees Celsius,” Lowry said. “The sewage is leaving at 16.4 degrees Celsius. We haven’t dropped the temperature of that sewage very much at all to get 400 percent efficiency, right? Now if you look at the hot water, the hot water is 52 or 53 degrees Celsius coming in, and the hot water is leaving at 63 degrees Celsius. So, we’re at a 10-degree rise in temperature from this, from only a one-degree drop in sewage temperature.” 
Also, added Lowry, the system is five times more efficient than a regular natural gas boiler.

This isn't breaking any scientific laws as the heat pump doesn't make the heat so much as it 'steals' it from the source, such as air, or ground, or water. So the 1kWh of leccy runs the compressor to extract heat from a huge quantity of air.
Also, GCH = gas central heating,PV = solar panels (photo voltaic),air con = air conditioner, most modern air cons are now heat pumps so the can move the heat into, or out of the house depending on whether you want to be warmer or cooler.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1531153425000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'11150889', u'in_reply_to': u'117990322', u'id': u'118027007', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'PatLogan', u'text': u'OK, I'll stand corrected.

UK average COP is 2.9 for ASHP (higher for GSHP I believe, and about 4-5 for WSHP(?)) which reflects our weather and temps.
A COP of 3 is as you say questionable on cost grounds against daytime leccy prices, but bear in mind the boiler efficiency and a 4:1 ratio of heat versus a 1:4 ratio of cost doesn't look to bad, especially if carbon taxes push up the gas element.
From a CO2 point of view (where I came into the discussion on getting a small ASHP a few years ago) you will get approx 1.6-1.8kWh thermal from 2kWh's of gas, but if the gas is used to generate 1kWh of leccy, and that leccy gives you 2.9kWh(t) thanks to the COP, then you've gotten more heat for your carbon cost.
Obviously not all leccy is gas, but the marginal gas from extra demand from an additional heat pump, will most likely be gas.
My personal stats are harder to quantify as I'm not matching like for like as I'm heating just two rooms* not the whole house, but initial figures from gas/leccy meters and an inverter that monitors import and export suggest the following approx results from the first 12 months of use:
Gas consumption down 10%, about 800kWh's, whilst other folk on forums, or neighbours noted an approx 20-30% increase last year (cold winter). So possible gas reduction of 2,400-3,200kWh's.
Leccy import increase of just short of 200kWh's, and a guesstimate of approx 400kWh's of PV consumption.
Roughly 600kWh leccy v's 2,400kWhs+ of gas.
*Most of the time the living room door was left wide open to allow heat to escape into hallway and upstairs as there was more than enough PV excess to meet ASHP needs. Effectively, we were using the thermal mass of the house as a PV battery. Hope that makes sense.
Cost was just over £1k installed, but DIY versions are available for half that.
Additional benefits are a secondary heat source if the GCH fails, helping to avoid the need to pay for emergency call out fees, and of course air con in the hot months, which I genuinely thought would only get a day or so's use pa, but this year has been running hard for about 3 weeks now ..... really cool!', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1531152986000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'11150889', u'in_reply_to': u'117992997', u'id': u'118026420', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Darach Seaton', u'text': u'Sorry, we don't want Trump's hot air in Canada.

So, I've looked up what the power output of that is - 260kW peak. And an average of something less than half that (114kW). Plus it's intermittent - generating nothing for significant periods, so needing other plant available. It's about 1/40th the size of the Reading scheme I was using as an example.
OH, as as for cost - £1.3 million for 114kW average output. £11,000/kW.
Hinkley is £18 billion for 2,900,000 kW average output. £6,000/kW.
So let's talk about how many of these it'd take to equal a Hinkley. Again, on an average output basis, about 25,500 of 'em.

Ley's give you an example. Let's say I want to get a heady 5MW out of the Thames at Reading.
 Let's build the dam at Mapledurham, just upstream. The weir is about 25 metres across. Upsteam flow is about a half a metre a second, and we'll estimate an average depth of around 3 metres.
So I've got about 25 x 3 x 0.5 cubic metres (1000kg) coming past per second = 37.5m3.
If I want 10MW, I need a fall of about 13 metres.
Mapledurham itself has a fall of about 2 metres. Whitchurch lock the next upstream is about 1 metre. Goring Lock has 1.8 metres. Benson, Cleeve and Day's locks, the next three above total 4.5 metres or so (and we're now at 9.3 metres). I have to go on another two locks, to Culham to get to 12.7 metres, which we'll call close enough.
I'm now 23 miles upstream from Mapledurham.
I'm not sure flooding 23 miles of the Thames valley for 5MW is worth it...

The Environment Agency explored turning them into wildlife paradises. 
Now campaigners are targeting London’s lost rivers, water courses that have been gradually buried over the centuries, as a source of fossil fuel-free heat.
Rivers better known by the streets named after them – such the Fleet and the Strand – offer an inspiring way of cutting the capital’s emissions, the climate charity 10:10 and the social enterprise Scene said.
The refurbishment of Buckingham Palace, which includes plans for a new heating system and boilers, could be given a low-carbon boost by tapping the nearby Tyburn, according to an analysis by the groups.
The river could provide more heat than the palace uses even on the coldest day, they said.
The art deco Brockwell Lido in south London, meanwhile, could harness the heat in the adjacent river Effra. Extracting just a tenth of its energy would keep the pool – which dips to 2C in winter – warm all year round.
Another possibility highlighted by the groups is a new future-proofed heat network for four housing estates at Somers Town, north London, which could potentially one day draw heat from the river Fleet.
Leo Murray, the director of campaigns at 10:10, said: “The mayor has set ambitious targets for phasing out gas burning in London over the coming years and we are going to need every bit of low-carbon heat we can get our hands on to meet these goals.” 
Water-source heat pumps, which in effect work as a reverse refrigerator, would be used to extract the heat.
This could in turn be sent to housing estates and large buildings via heat networks, which the government has been backing as a way to decarbonise heating.
However, the study made no assessment of whether the pumps would be financially viable for projects and they are yet to be used at scale in the UK. 
The royal borough of Greenwich has been exploring the possibility of using water-source heat pumps to provide green heating for 100 homes at the refurbishment of the Ernest Dence estate but is still finalising its plans.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

But Betts has a point about the lists being political. As the article says, the focus is on the 'denier' side, because that is where the meaningful political damage is being done. The excuse of time seems a touch disingenuous - there isn't time because you don't see it as significant, and it isn't significant because of the lack of political impact.
Plus, of course, the fact that policy lags mainstream Science, means that (on a binary action/ inaction view) alarmism is at least pulling in the right direction, even if from the wrong position.
But there are 2 other points to consider. The first is that alarmism fuels denial - Wadhams may be one of the most cited scientists on denial blogs. Or look at the ongoing interest in Himalayan glaciers from one minor paragraph in an old IPCC report, or a handful of cooling predictions in the 70s. A public demonstration that these are fringe positions - at the time - makes mainstream science more robust. There is real value to calling them out.
Second, if we focus only on deniers, then they are dictating the terms. Of course they must be called out and corrected, and I'm grateful for those doing this. But equally they should not influence our thinking - even to the extent of turning a blind eye to fringe errors because they are 'on our side'. It shouldn't be about sides. Denialists have made it so. Okay it's only a blog, but is it impossible for the attitude to percolate out? Political impartiality to errors both adds to perceived credibility and to actual robustness.
Granted it's all volunteers, and you can do what you want. But maybe basing your responses on the prominence, rather than the 'politics', of the flawed argument is all that's needed.

Models are a way of abstracting the complex real world into a mathematically description than can be used to produce estimates of future behaviour of isolated systems in the physical world.
For example Newtonian physics' famous F=m*a is nothing but a model used to describe the behaviour of a particle under a force. 
What we know is that some models are better at describing the world than others. The models of the ocean\atmosphere system that use CO2 as a greenhouse gas have had success in predicting the long term changes in temperature. These models also predict

Not only are the models broadly right in long term temperature, they get where it will get warm very correct as well.

You can if you do it by exhaling the CO2 from the food you have metabolised which you should remember was what you were talking about.
All the CO2 exhaled by you and the 7.4 billion other people in this world (just to put you in perspective) can be added to the atmosphere without increasing the CO2 in the atmosphere as homeothermic animals such as you metabolise at the same rate all year round and the CO2 they exhale was turned into the food they metabolise but months to a year before. There is a balance between plants absorbing CO2 to produce homeothermic animal food and those animals metabolising and exhaling CO2. Plants can only absorb so much CO2 and produce so much homeothermic animal food. As there is only so much homeothermic animal food for them to metabolise, those animals can only exhale so much CO2 - hence the balance resulting in no net increase in CO2 in the atmosphere from the exhalations of homeothermic animals such as you.
""Can I also, therefore, 'subtract CO2 from the atmosphere' without decreasing ""CO2 in the atmosphere'? 
As a homeothermic animal you cannot absorb or subtract CO2 from the atmosphere. However, you can plant a tree which will absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. If you and the 7.4 other people on the Earth planted many more trees and preserved the wood they produced as building material on a very large scale you and the other 7.4 billion people could absorb enough CO2 to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere provide it wasn't being added by other means and provided the wood was not burnt, allowed to rot or be eaten by termites. Once the wood rots, burns or is eaten by termites and metabolised there is no net decrease in the CO2 in the atmosphere.
The reality at present though is that CO2 is being added to the atmosphere by the combustion of fossil fuels in amounts far greater than the ability of plants to absorb that CO2, resulting in a net increase in atmospheric CO2.
Fossil fuels are the CO2 that was absorbed years ago by forests and preserved by burial. This process still goes on today in what's left of swampland, peatland and subsiding deltas. But we're digging it up or extracting it faster than it is being produced. We're burning it and producing CO2 from it faster than our Earth can absorb and sequester that CO2, resulting in a large net increase in atmospheric CO2 of more than 40% over the last 150 years.

Returning to Erik's OP - he makes the case that those who write the studies should also be listened to when they speak more casually [i.e. in interviews or opeds]- not the either / or position you seem to be claiming.
The issue I was focusing on is science communication- most people are not equipped to disseminate peer reviewed literature, no because they are stupid but simply unskilled in the same way physicists may get the builders in for an extension or glaciologists rely on the dentist for tooth care.Even scientists are not equipped to venture to far outside their own areas of study given the level specialisation.Communication is a challenge, now you may say that should not matter- that we simply have process of science- policy [divised by policy makers] - politics -action. fine for non democratic states, but we have that tricky thing called freedom.On the one hand we have those challenging mainstream AGW science to influence public opinion and then politics and therefore policy on action and on the other policy makers and politicians telling the public to trust them on this. As recent popularist politics has demonstrated- 'the public has had enough of experts' which is disturbing.just as scientists are not trained to be dentists or builders so they are not trained as public figures or journalists. Some do break into the public sphere like Carl Sagan, Neil deGrasse Tyson [who stopped doing science in the 90s to move across to more public engagement] Brian Cox and James Hansen. Stephen Hawking even appeared in popular tv such as Big Bang and Star Trek.
These science communicators rely on peer reviewed science but they don't just read it out straight from the text books. The problem with science papers is that they will not communicate what it means to people on a personal, cultural and societal level. When Jim Hansen and other scientists write about the need for nuclear power and the inadequacies of renewables they are coming with an opinion outside of their field- but one they have thought about- and as such it is open for debate. When Mackay wrote 'without hot air' it was for public digestion, it was not a peer reviewed science paper- and it opened up debate. Those on the pro nuclear side will use the authority of the 'quoters'/'quotes' as an argument, just as AGW denial will use the quotes from retired physicists.i suppose it comes down to what healthy debate [on opinions] is, get it right and it is good for democracy - but if it is heavily influenced by bias in any extreme then it needs fixing.AGW outcomes are huge and vary from one extreme to the other- although likelihood diminishes at those extremes, and as a species we are not very good at being logical as to what it means.There may be some who prefer quotes/opinions over the scientific consensus but as long as that derives from the consensus it is not for you to be thread monitor or BTL police.And if you want to stay pure to 'message' no one is criticising you for that.

We’re flooded with such a constant deluge of climate myths, where should we focus our efforts? Climate misinformation is propagated via congressional climate hearings, conservative media outlets, denial blogs, and even from some genuine climate alarmists. 
Specifically, there has recently been a debate as to whether Skeptical Science – a website with a database of climate myths and scientific debunkings, to which I’m a primary contributor – would be more useful and effective if it called out misinformation from ‘alarmists,’ and if it eliminated or revised its Climate Misinformers page.
I describe the SkS lists as political because their 'misinformer' lists don't include those on the 'climate action' side who actively deny science &amp; espouse conspiracy ideation eg. https://t.co/OTkhEiKmzv or who unjustifiably talk-up doomsday stories https://t.co/faGCDQCevx
There is some validity to these critiques, and in response, Skeptical Science is renaming the page ‘Climate misinformation by source.’ But the site is run entirely by a team of international volunteers, and as such, opportunity costs must be considered. Time devoted to refuting alarmists is time not devoted to debunking the constant deluge of climate denial.
Climate deniers are obviously incredibly influential. Despite their lack of supporting evidence or facts, not only do 28% of Americans continue to believe that global warming is natural and 14% that it’s not even happening, but deniers also dictate Republican Party policy. Republican policymakers constantly invite deniers to testify in congressional hearings, including many of those featured on the Skeptical Science misinformers page.
There is no symmetry on the other side of the aisle. In those same congressional hearings, Democratic Party policymakers invite mainstream climate scientists to testify. Their party policy is based on the consensus of 97% of the climate science community. 
Ultimately, the issue boils down to a warped ‘Overton Window’ – the range of ideas tolerated in public discourse. In the real world, we have climate deniers on one extreme, alarmists on the other, and mainstream climate science in the middle. But the public discourse is warped – we instead have a heavy focus on climate denial among conservative media outlets and policymakers, a heavy focus on mainstream climate science among reputable media outlets and liberal policymakers, and the alarmists are largely ignored. Michael Tobis nicely diagrammed this in the climate Overton Window:
That being said, there are a few reasonably well-known individuals who could be accurately described as climate alarmists. The most prominent is Guy McPherson, who decided in 2002 that climate change would likely drive humans to extinction by 2030. Sixteen years later, we’re now more than halfway to 2030 and the global human population has grown from 6.3 bn to 7.6 bn. It’s quite safe to say we won’t go extinct in the next few decades.
McPherson’s case basically boils down to arguing that feedbacks like large methane releases will soon kick in, causing a rapid spike in global warming that will lead to global extinctions. One of his primary pieces of supporting evidence is that Earth System Sensitivity – which describes how sensitive the climate is to the increased greenhouse effect over millennia – is higher than the shorter-term climate sensitivity.
That was essentially the gist of a recent study profiled here in the Guardian. Over millennia, global temperatures and sea level rise will continue to rise beyond what climate models predict will happen over the next couple of centuries. But these are slow feedbacks, and as such won’t kick in within the next few decades. Scott Johnson did a very deep dive into McPherson’s flawed arguments, for those who want to learn about them in greater detail.
As another example, Peter Wadhams predicted in 2012 that the Arctic would be ice-free in the summer by 2016. In fact, the summer of 2012 saw a dramatic decline in year-to-year Arctic sea ice extent (down to 3.6 million square km), which Wadhams believed would become the norm. That hasn’t yet been the case – there were 4.7 million square km of Arctic sea ice in the summer of 2016.
It’s worth noting that Wadhams gets most of the climate science right. There is absolutely a long-term decline in Arctic sea ice, which is in the midst of what many have described as a ‘death spiral.’ And Arctic sea ice is thinning rapidly. The Arctic will eventually be ice-free in the summer, but not within the next few years. According to Met Office Chief Scientist Julia Slingo, 2025–2030 would be the earliest date for an ice-free Arctic summer, and 2040–2060 is more likely. Wadhams also believes that there may soon be a large methane release from the Arctic, but a review of the relevant research suggests this isn’t a near-term concern:
There is no evidence that methane will run out of control and initiate any sudden, catastrophic effects. There’s certainly no runaway greenhouse. Instead, chronic methane releases will supplement the primary role of CO2. 
Wadhams has received some mainstream media attention, including in the Guardian, but his more alarmist warnings are largely ignored. There certainly isn’t a powerful political party basing its climate policies on his inaccurate predictions. 
And that’s really the key point. While there are people on ‘both sides’ who spread misinformation, there are far more on the denier than the alarmist side, who are generally far wronger, and the deniers also have a far greater influence over policymakers. 
There’s certainly nothing wrong with debunking overly alarmist claims – in fact, it’s a worthwhile endeavor, and some groups like Climate Feedback do just that. But debunking uninfluential alarmism comes at a cost. It diverts resources away from addressing the never-ending flood of misinformation coming from climate deniers who currently control the climate policy platform of the party in charge of one of the most powerful countries on Earth.

A long-running survey of American attitudes to climate change has found that 73% of people now think there is solid evidence of global warming. A further 60% believe that this warming is due, at least in some part, to human influences.
Both of these findings are record highs in a twice-yearly survey that has been conducted by the University of Michigan and Muhlenberg College since 2008. The latest poll was conducted during May, which was hotter than any May recorded in the contiguous US in 124 years of record keeping, according to the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, eclipsing the 1930s during the Dust Bowl era. 
“There’s lots of evidence that contemporary weather is a contributing factor to belief in climate change,” said Chris Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. “But there are other factors. People are telling us they are experiencing a climate that isn’t what they remember in the past and the evidence itself, such as declining polar ice, is having an effect. Americans are moving to a lot more confident space on this.”
But there remains a yawning ideological divide when it comes to climate change in the US. The survey found that while 90% of Democrats accept there is solid evidence of climate change, only 50% of Republicans feel the same. 
However, Borick said that messaging from those who deny or obfuscate climate science has shifted away from outright rejection of temperature data. While Donald Trump has previously called climate change “bullshit” and a Chinese-inspired hoax, he has rarely spoken of the issue while president apart from framing action to address it as economically costly. 
“The talking points have turned more to the cost to mitigate climate change rather than deny its existence,” Borick said. “That said, if you want one factor that influences your view on climate change, it’s party affiliation. Age, race and gender don’t even come close.”
The hot temperatures have persisted in much of the country since the May survey, with Los Angeles hitting a monthly overnight record of 79F (26.1C) on 7 July. Chino, near Los Angeles, saw a record temperature of 120F (48.9C), while Death Valley in California reached 125.6F (52C) on 8 July.
About 80 million Americans have been placed under heat warnings in recent weeks, with cities such as Denver, Colorado and Cheyenne, Wyoming, both experiencing record temperatures. 
The heat has been fierce on the US east coast and Canada, too. About 70 deaths have been blamed upon a punishing heatwave experienced in and around Montreal, with further deaths recorded in New York and Pennsylvania due to the high temperatures.
A string of warm days in New York City helped trigger a return to smog-like conditions on 2 July, when the temperature in the city reached 95F (35C).
Researchers who flew a light aircraft taking measurements over a hazy New York were astonished to find that the ozone concentration was 150 parts per billion. This far exceeds the Environmental Protection Agency’s eight-hour average ozone health standard of 70 parts per billion. The high ozone readings have continued, with preliminary data for Tuesday showing 85 parts per billion in New York.
Ground-level ozone is created when pollutants react to intense sunlight, potentially causing haze or smog. This can cause serious health problems and even death for people who are elderly, sick or who have respiratory conditions.
“This is a disturbingly high level, we were very surprised at the results,” said Russell Dickerson, a professor at the University of Maryland’s department of atmospheric and oceanic science. “The sky was very gray. It reminded me of Beijing. It was like what New York used to be like, before it cleaned itself up.”
Overall air quality in the US has improved markedly in recent decades following the introduction of federal clean air rules. Ozone levels have remained stubbornly high in New York, however.
“We are trying to work out why this is but the recent high level could well be because of the hot, stagnant weather, with weak winds,” Dickerson said. “It’s a public health concern. I’d certainly advise people to stay indoors during the hottest part of the day.”

But instead of moving far out into the country, we need more skilled growers and farmers to stay in or around conurbations and produce food there, where it will be consumed.
The land around cities is usually very fertile - this is often why the city sprung up there in the first place. This is where our fresh food should be produced.
There is definitely an unequal concentration of too much land in too few hands in this country and its getting worse with consolidation of farms.
The aggro biz model is broken in so many ways - economically - ecologically - and socially - it doesn't produce healthy nourishment - it mainly produces cheap calories which have deleterious effect...
Oh and some big ol profits for supermarket, suppliers of enormous machinery, and agrochemical suppliers .
Many conventional farmers barely break even - they are chasing diminishing returns - and once they are operating in a global marketplace - and their area payment (EU money ) is taken away - they will be truly stuffed - this is not the fault of the farmer -its the system that they are in. 
All this needs to be reversed with intelligent policies around access to land, and incentives, or at least more opportunities for new entrants to sustainable farming and growing.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1531637504000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'15698018', u'in_reply_to': u'118282173', u'id': u'118289069', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'John Samuel', u'text': u'So you agree you are a climate denier, by the Oxford dictionary.

Total nonsense.
One of the key sources on medieval Greenland is ""The Saga of the Greenlanders"" which tells how it was discovered by Erik the Red.
He called the land which he had found Greenland, because, quoth he, ""people will be attracted thither, if the land has a good name.""
(As you see, the translation isn't exactly in modern style.)
The Saga confirms that Greenland at that time was not especially green, in fact it says -in Greenland are said to be very high ice hills.

Last weekend, Chinese scientists released a separate report that said the surface area of glaciers on Mount Everest, which straddles the Tibet-Nepal border, have shrunk nearly 30 percent in the last 40 years.
Vanishing glaciers raise urgent concerns beyond Tibet and China.
By one estimate, the 46,000 glaciers of the Third Pole region help sustain 1.5 billion people in 10 countries — its waters flowing to places as distant as the tropical Mekong Delta of Vietnam, the hills of eastern Myanmar and the southern plains of Bangladesh. Scattered across nearly two million square miles, these glaciers are receding at an ever-quickening pace, producing a rise in levels of rivers and lakes in the short term and threatening Asia’s water supply in the long run.
A paper published this year by The Journal of Glaciology said the retreat of Asian glaciers was emblematic of a “historically unprecedented global glacier decline.”
“I would say that climatologically, we are in unfamiliar territory, and the world’s ice cover is responding dramatically,” said Lonnie G. Thompson, a glaciologist at Ohio State University who helped found a project to study climate change on the Tibetan Plateau.

The Met Office is grateful for this opportunity to clarify its position regarding the doubts expressed in the preceding paper, and in Part 1, published in the August issue, over the temperature recorded on 10 August 2003 at Faversham. As noted in the paper, there are in fact good grounds for accepting the value of 38.5 C on 10 August in that: (i) the Faversham site and equipment are maintained to accepted standards; the reading was made independently by two trained observers; and (iii) after the event the maximum thermometer was demonstrated to be accurate to within 0.1 degc. In addition, the synoptic situation over southern England that day favoured the highest temperatures being achieved inland over and to the east of London. A further factor is that whilst Faversham was Table 1 Maximum temperatures recorded during August 2003 Date Faversham East Wye Difference Difference ( C) Malling ( C) Faversham Faversham ( C) East Malling Wye (degc) (degc) warmer than its inland neighbours (East Malling and Wye) on the 10th, this was not a systematic difference on the other heatwave days (see Table 1). The varying differences recorded during the heatwave are typical of hot days over the previous 40 years and attributable to a variety of circumstances, as noted in the paper. Study of possible contributing mesoscale factors, such as the effect of the North Downs in a southerly airstream, might provide a reason for the differences on this occasion. One of the things that makes the UK weather so fascinating is that it can occasionally produce extremes that might seem unlikely, yet nevertheless have been recorded carefully under standard conditions. Rejection of an observed value, particularly one that indicates an unusual or extreme event, should only happen when there are good reasons to believe that the measurement was erroneous or made in non-standard conditions. The evidence is that the Faversham maximum temperature on 10 August 2003 was recorded correctly, in a favourable synoptic situation, and so should continue to be regarded as the current UK record.

That was Britain’s hottest ever day, the day the current British air temperature record was set: it leapt from the old record of 37.1C, set on 3 August 1990, to the new figure of 38.5C.
Those bare numbers may not mean much to you, though they may well appear more meaningful if you convert them to fahrenheit. For the old record was 98.8F,but the new one was 101.3F, and that meant that the 100F barrier had been broken in Britain for the first time ever. It seemed to me then, as it does now, that this was a hugely symbolic crossing of an environmental threshold; yet the population instantly forgot all about it.
The current heatwave bids fair to be the longest period of sustained hot weather since the fabled summer of 1976. But will it actually be the hottest? Might we actually see a new British record air temperature? Local records are already being broken and there was a brief flurry of excitement 10 days ago when it appeared that the Scottish national record had been smashed with a temperature of 33.2C (91.7F) recorded in Motherwell, but now the Met Office has rejected the claim because a vehicle with its engine running was too close to the thermometer.
It seems a new British record is certainly possible this summer that, if achieved, would give considerable force to the suggestion that the very high temperatures that have been in evidence all over the northern hemisphere this summer are at least partly the product of global warming, rather than just natural variation.
For anyone interested in following and watching out for this, I have a suggestion: keep your eye on the fahrenheit as well as the celsius measurement it will mean more. I say this as a baby boomer who grew up with F rather than C; it was not until 1962 that the Met Office adopted celsius, and in my early childhood I acquired the instinctive feel that everybody then had (and people still have in the US), which told you that, in fahrenheit terms, 60 was pleasantly warm, and 70 was really lovely weather, and 80 was seriously hot, while 90 represented the sort of heatwave that was a major event. Anything approaching 90 would result in front-page headlines in the Daily Express proclaiming: “88 … 89 … 90! Phew! What a scorcher!”
That was the point about the 100 figure. It was off the map. It had never been recorded in meteorological history, in the daily temperature records that go back to 1772. But it had no place in cultural history either. There was no reference point for it: no stories, no memories, no jokes, no newspaper headlines. In our native land of showers and cool summers, 100 degrees fahrenheit represented an unknown country.
The round number certainly helped. In celsius terms, 100F is 37.8C, and of course 37.8C as such isn’t any sort of figure the mind will register, any sort of boldly marked frontier whose breaching will seem significant. But once you represent it in fahrenheit, the move up from two digits to three has a symbolical significance of real power.
That’s what I thought, anyway, in the years I spent writing about climate change and being something of a temperature nerd, waiting for the 100 mark to be hit, for “the ton to be up”. When the 100F threshold is broken, I thought, everyone will see at once that we are in new territory in terms of climate; everyone will perceive the reality of global warming, in an instinctive way. And in August 2003 the day finally came, and I remember vividly how hot it was; and the day went; and people carried on with their business just as before, and have forgotten it completely.
Yet my own view is that we did indeed enter new territory that day; and if we have waited 15 years to get back there (and maybe we will wait still longer), it merely illustrates what we know, that climate change proceeds in a non-linear way, in irregular jumps rather than a smooth ascent. But watch out for it, this sweltering summer (probably in the first week of August); watch out for it on the old-fashioned fahrenheit scale as well as on the modern celsius. And if you see that the ton is up, and 100F is exceeded, be assured that even if a new outright temperature record is not set, the world is changing in the profoundest of ways.

… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

The past month has seen power shortages in California as record heat forced a surge of demand for air conditioners. Algeria has experienced the hottest temperature ever reliably registered in Africa. Britain, meanwhile, has experienced its third longest heatwave, melting the roof of a science building in Glasgow and exposing ancient hill forts in Wales. 
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said the rising temperatures were at odds with a global cyclical climate phenomenon known as La Niña, which is usually associated with cooling.

“The first six months of the year have made it the hottest La Niña year to date on record,” said Clare Nullis of the WMO.
Taiwan is the most recent place to report a new high with a temperature of 40.3C in Tianxiang on Monday. This followed a flurry of other anomalies.
Last week, a weather station at Ouargla in Algeria’s Sahara Desert, reported a maximum temperature of 51.3C on 5 July, the highest temperature reliably recorded in Africa. 
Even when the sun goes down, night is not providing the cooling relief it once did in many parts of the world. At Quriyat, on the coast of Oman, overnight temperatures remained above 42.6C, which is believed to be the highest “low” temperature ever recorded in the world. Downtown Los Angeles also saw a new monthly July minimum overnight record of 26.1C on 7 July.
Globally, the warmest year on record was in 2016, boosted by the natural climate cycle El Niño. Last year, temperatures hit the highest level without that amplifying phenomenon. This year, at the other cooling end of the cycle, is continuing the overall upward trend.
Swathes of the northern hemisphere have seen unusually persistent warmth due to strong, persistent high pressure systems that have created a “heat dome” over much of Eurasia.
“What’s unusual is the hemispheric scale of the heatwave,” said Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. “It’s not just the magnitude in any one location but that high temperatures are being seen over such a large area.”
Northern Russia’s exceptionally sunny weather – seen on TV by billions thanks to the World Cup – has caused wildfires that affected 80,000 hectares of forest near the Krasnoyarsk region, which reported daily anomalies of 7C above average. The Western Siberian Hydromet Center has issued storm warnings after temperatures of more than 30C for five days. Climate watchers fear this will accelerate the melting of permafrost, releasing methane – a far more potent greenhouse gas than CO2.
In California, daytime records were also set last week at Chino (48.9C), Burbank airport (45.6C) and Van Nuys airport (47.2C). In Canada, at least 54 deaths have been attributed to the prolonged heatwave and high humidity in Quebec. Montreal saw a new record high temperature of 36.6C on 2 July.
In Europe, the WMO has warned of droughts, wildfires and harvest losses after the second hottest June on record. Over the past two weeks, records have been set in Tbilisi (40.5C), Shannon (32C), and Belfast (29.5C) 
Britain has cooled slightly in the past two days, after 17 days of temperatures over 28C. This was the third longest heatwave on record, following the record 19-day run in 2013 and the famous summer of 1976, when there were two prolonged spells of 18 days and 15 days. Dean Hall of the UK’s Met Office said Britain’s temperatures were forecast to rise again over the coming week.
The concern is that weather fronts – hot and cold – are being blocked more frequently due to climate change. This causes droughts and storms to linger, amplifying the damage they cause. This was a factor in the recent devastating floods in Japan, where at least 150 people died after rainfall up to four times the normal level.
Paolo Ruti of the WMO said it was difficult to ascribe any one weather event to climate change, but that recent high temperatures, intense rains and slow-moving fronts were in line with forecasts of how rising emissions will affect the climate.
“Recent analysis suggests that anthropogenic forcing might indeed affect the characteristics of summer blocking events in the Euro-Asia sector, in particular leading to longer blocking episodes,” he said. 
Extreme weather events have buffeted much of the world over the past 12months, from the “Day Zero” drought in Cape Town to the abnormally powerful hurricanes Harvey and Irma that buffeted the east coast of the US and Caribbean. 
 Underscoring the link, a new report from scientists at the World Weather Attribution group indicates that manmade climate change and its effect on rainfall made the recent Cape Town drought three times more likely.
… we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute. Thank you.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/13/heatwave-sees-record-high-temperatures-set-around-world-this-week

Climate change will take a while to affect much of humanity but the first people to suffer will be the poor. Firstly, there will be large regions of Africa, India and the Middle East, as well as Central America and parts of Asia that will become uninhabitable for ordinary folk.
The solution for these people is simple, and we even see that solution today. Migration. They will move to cooler climes. 
So, expect mass migration on an unprecedented scale into places like Northern Europe, northern China, Central Asia.
But here’s the good bit. Rich people don’t suffer from mass migration. In crime ridden cities they have homes in fenced off areas, police forces and private security to protect them. Meanwhile, there are lots of places in the countryside where economic activity is low but where rich people live, so there’s little crime in those areas.
Some good friends of mine have started using their bonuses and profit they’ve made on their London properties to buy second homes. Currently they rent these out but the idea is that one day their infant children will be able to move into them.
London might be overwhelmed with people from the Third World in a couple of decades time, but my friends’ children will by then be well set up young adults with homes of their own and bright futures ahead of them.
So, just get rich and your child will be able to ward off the effects of climate change probably for life.', u'recommendation_count': u'4', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1531587627000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'17480038', u'in_reply_to': u'118274403', u'id': u'118274906', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'dholliday', u'text': u'BQSTART

As we watch CO2 accumulating faster and faster in the atmosphere we might ask where we are now, long before feeling the full effects of a rise in temperature of just over 1 degree C, due to lags in the system.
We’ve been seeing numerous impacts catching many scientists by surprise with how soon they are occurring. In 2014 two independent teams of scientists reported that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is likely irreversibly retreating. 3.3 meters of sea level rise equivalent of ice there is being destabilized by warming oceans and energy is going into the net melting of ice all over the planet. 
The paleoclimate record shows that increasing global temperature by just 1.5-2 degrees C above preindustrial temperature commits the system to an eventual 6-9m of sea level rise, a large fraction of which could arrive within the next 100 years.
Corals may not survive this century of warming and acidifying oceans, and droughts and floods linked to global warming—and conflict linked to those droughts—have already caused four countries to face famine.
Because of the decades to millennial long lag between a climate forcing and our feeling the effect, due to the thermal inertia of the ocean and response time of the ice sheets, the effects we are feeling now are largely just the beginning of the result of emissions from the 20th century. And emissions have been increasing steadily for decades.
We are also seeing numerous amplifying feedbacks: loss of albedo (heat reflectivity) from ice melt, permafrost melt, methane release and massive wildfires; the Earth is starting to wrest any possible further human control of the climate away.

A review of climate change literature between 1965 and 1979, undertaken in 2008, found that 44 papers ""predicted, implied, or provided supporting evidence"" for global warming, while only seven did so for global cooling. 
""Global cooling was never more than a minor aspect of the scientific climate change literature of the era, let alone the scientific consensus..."" the reviewers remarked.

When we came last year, to the same place in the same week, the steep banks of the lanes grew thick with wild roses, fuchsia and foxgloves; now the vegetation looked limper and dustier, the roses drier, the foxgloves solitary and stooped. But a poorer foreground view had its compensation in the background, where the lack of drizzle, cloud and mist revealed a rolling landscape of hills and woods that was unexpectedly Tuscan in its clarity. By four in the afternoon, the airless main streets of the small towns felt like ovens.
On the coast east of Skibbereen we found a delightful cove, of the sort that in my experience rarely exists outside children’s fiction: perfect in its firm sand, its protective reefs of smooth black rock, and its warren of caves that ran back into the cliffs, invaded every day by the tide, and entirely free of plastic flotsam. The sea was calm and clear, and changed its shade of blue according to the depth and composition of the seabed. Moreover, it wasn’t chill. In 60-odd years swimming off the British coastline, I’ve rarely known water as welcoming or as hard to leave: even after 40 minutes, it seemed a shame to get out.
Newspaper reports said the prolonged heatwave had raised sea temperatures in other places to over 20C, which sounded impossibly warm, almost like a heated swimming pool. In that temperature, there would surely be no dallying in the shallows, no theatrical shivering when the water reached crotch level, no complaining that the cold was unbearable, no need to stand there uncertainly while your companion, already swimming briskly, urged you to “get in and get it over with”. Instead immersion would be a swift, Mediterranean experience – a run or brisk walk into the sea and then a splash as you struck out for the diving platform.
Temperatures in the Firth of Forth never made getting into the water so easy. To be consistently tempting, the estuary needed exceptional conditions – and the summer of 1955 provided them. The sun shone for weeks, and day after day my friends and I made the 10-minute walk to the beach – not a Blue Flag candidate, if Blue Flags had existed then, because a pipe ran right down the middle of it that carried sewage to the sea from the army barracks to the rear.
Looking back, it seems odd that people made no fuss about this, or about another more torrential outlet not far upstream, where the sewage turned the sea pink with its infusions of potassium permanganate. But it was a beach, all the same, with a sandbank that appeared at low tide and a hut at the far end that opened on especially busy days to sell crisps and lemonade; and by the second week, I had taught myself to swim.
All kinds of things happened in 1955: Anthony Eden won the general election; Princess Margaret announced that she didn’t intend to marry RAF Group Captain Peter Townsend; Ruth Ellis became the last woman to be hanged in the UK. I remember none of them. For me, it was the year I was turned brown by the sun.
A family snapshot, one of our first in colour, shows me in swimming trunks, staring across a shiny flat sea towards a visiting American battleship, the USS Wisconsin, which lay anchored in the firth. My back is unselfconsciously brown – there had been no lying on towels and striving for this effect – which tells a story of capering about on the beach with no recourse to the plastic macs and sweaters that in most years the visitor to the Scottish seaside was wise to bring. (As the actor and comedian Stanley Baxter remembers, returned Glaswegian holidaymakers when questioned about the weather might reply stoically, “Well, it never kept us in.”)
The strong sunlight gave everything a memorable clarity, just as it did in Ireland last week, so that certain scenes of no particular emotional importance remain fixed, when in other years they would have faded: the sight of a spoil tip near an old mine or ironworks – abandoned even in 1955 – that revealed an interior of bright red cinders where a jagged crack had split its grassy surface. It makes no sense to remember it, and yet there it is through the window of the Glasgow bus, under a bright blue sky.
Unclothed adults at the seaside were then hardly visible, other than in newspaper pictures of crowded beaches at sophisticated resorts such as Ayr or Blackpool. When my grandfathers came to the beach, they retained their flat caps and waistcoats. My mother never owned a swimsuit. My father had trunks – as a boy he’d liked to swim – but I only once saw him wear them. None of this was very exceptional. I can’t think of any adult in our street who went to the beach and did much more than roll up a trouser leg.
Nobody could have complained, as the aesthete James Lees-Milne did in his diary in July 1976: “Heatwave continuing. Whole country parched, and trees dying. Found E naked but for a pair of long blue shorts, with white skin, smarmed hair (for he had just had a bath), flabby muscles, pendulous breasts, looking like Picasso aged 90. How can aesthetic persons bear to be seen in this condition at 74 even by their intimates?”
The great summers of my lifetime have been 1955, 1976 and now this one. With each, a little more innocence has been shed as well as clothes. Prolonged sunshine now seems ominous – a portent as well as a pleasure. Ireland, for instance, has a rural economy that largely depends on grass, and in a drought grass fails to thrive. That has huge consequences for every cattle farmer, but posterity may see it as no more than a little local difficulty, one of the negligible effects of a global temperature change that melts glaciers and ice caps. Carpe diem, then, in a cove near Skibbereen.
• Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist
… in the fight to protect the environment. By keeping the Guardian’s environmental coverage open and accessible, we can report on the changes needed to avoid climate and natural catastrophe. The choices made by individuals are important, but we need to work together for the systemic transformation that will make a real difference. As well as reporting the facts about what is happening now, we investigate the causes and talk to the people trying to make the future better. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism.

Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. Limiting climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together with adaptation, can limit climate change risks. Cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond.

In sum, in the last 120 years, the amount of carbon dioxide (and methane) in the air has increased, with most of the increase having come in recent decades. During that time, the median temperature of Earth has increased 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. Glaciers around the world have been shrinking. Ice sheets over Greenland and Antarctica have been melting. The sea level has risen by about seven centimeters since 1993 (about seven to eight inches since 1900). As our globe warms and the seas rise, coastal lands in Oakland and San Francisco will, without erection of seawalls and other infrastructure, eventually become submerged by the navigable waters of the United States

This is not an argument. You are not even pretending to engage.
BQEND it would have helped if you had engaged in changing my mind- i don't have a problem to being corrected, you joined in with my initial point and have offered no constructive criticism.
To reiterate-
ERoRI with fossil fuels is decline [although gas less so- although it is only a limited replacement for oil] , you keep telling me it is peak oil twaddle and then acknowledge that it is in decline- and I don't know what you are saying- if you reject decline then you are going against consensus.
To cover up for this decline easy debt is the solution- and that extends to massive amount of debt personally and nationally. And economists point out that this is not sustainable- it either has to be slowly payed off or it crashes, the problem with fossil fuels is that AGW mitigation means much of potential income is left in the ground and there are no hidden easy oil fields. fracking only survived in the US because it concentrated on richer seams and avoid marginal ones- as those rich seams/fields deplete what is left is the marginal ones.
The consequence is either a crash happens, recession leads to reduced demand- or the government sees fossil fuels as too big to fail- and that is the OP, that BAU will lead to corporate socialism particularly in fossil fuels.Carbon tax therefore is free market- and with renewables now coming of age the continued support of fossil fuels is going against the free market.
and going back to my link on slavery that the capitalist system that supported it did not help the South to develop manufacturing and an economy that could compete with the North. slavery hampered 'growth' and may have also reduced the fertility of the land leading to lower output.I am offering a point - for people to disagree with or develop- that clinging to fossil fuels is bad for the free market and like slavery can hold a nation back.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1532006687000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'it concentrated on richer seams and avoid marginal ones- as those rich seams fields deplete', u'effect': u'fracking only survived in the us'}, {u'cause': u'bau', u'effect': u'corporate socialism'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'lower output'}], u'author_id': u'4738374', u'in_reply_to': u'118482796', u'id': u'118487406', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'JulesBywaterLees', u'text': u'BQSTART
This reads like cheap debt is a subsidy but is money taken out of the system.
BQEND
No, I'm not and not said that [although fossil fuels are subsidised indirectly and have economics built around their extraction].
But if there is a debt crash then the bailing out and economic cost will be met by the state, just as the property bubble and subprime market took money out of the economy [locking it away in assets rather than going into activity] it also became a black hole when it crashed.
This will be bad for the economy- a tax on the otherhand may help to avert that economic crisis and also circulate cash in the economy allowing it to grow.
Remember that the basis of a carbon tax is something agreed upon- the consequences of not acting to the economy [and climate] is also beyond dispute, we are discussing the detail of how such action is framed- your OP.

Here is what I was responding too.

BQSTART
Yet we have a system that not only allows fossil fuels to pollute freely but one that is currently supported directly and indirectly by the state financially,
BQENDYou were not pointing out the high cost of fossil fuels but stating they were ""allowed to pollute freely"". I simply pointed out a counter example where one of many countries had imposed a tax on fossil fuels.
Your broad strokes over cooked again.
BQSTART
especially the use of supporting cheap debt
BQENDThis is nonsense. You are butchering of basic economics into slogans. ""Cheap"" debt is not a subsidy for fossil fuels but a consequence of other macroeconomic forces that makes debt ""cheap"" to all market participants. Since renewables have much higher initial capital outlay it could be seen as favouring them, debt servicing being an ongoing cost for renewables, an industry known for its high initial capital cost and low running costs.

Its a very unscientific data set, but I think it is a straw in the wind of how a ""redistributive"" ""carbon tax"" will go down with a large section of US population, perhaps including swing voters. It rubs them up the wrong way and rubs core ideas up the wrong way. Here in the UK when trying to discredit a government policy on housing subsidies the left rebranded a cutting of subsidy as ""bedroom tax"". This proved lethal, there is little point self inflicting this from the outset. Others with more creativity might have a go (so none of our regulars <-< ) but something like the ""carbon harm subsidy reduction"" might give it a slightly easier passage.And it needs to be more cross cutting in its goals. Handing out unearned free cash is not really a little R Republican vote winner. Perhaps ringfence the cash to go the Veterans Administration ""carbon cuts for war heroes"", again creatives with a better ear for the small R Republicans can do better here. Which would also add a layer of insulation to the project. ""Oh big oil wants to cut money for our vetertans does it""? Or perhaps to fund Medicare of some sort. Anyhow I am not sure the deeply tribalised world of US politics is quite ready for our base case above.

Even though alternative energy is increasingly cost-competitive and storage technology holds great promise, alternative energy systems alone will not be capable of meeting the baseload generation needs of a developed economy for the foreseeable future.

Amidst all the attention seeking waffle you could have written that in a little touch extra and nailed it.

Oil and coal [not so much gas] were cheap and abundant- if you were a wiildcat driller back in the 60s you could put $1 in to get $100 back but like all good things that didn't last. Luckily technology helped- and bit by bit we used energy better and needed less of it, but for every $1 in a little bit less came out.Now for US oil production $1 buys you just $11 of oil. Corn ethanol is even worse all that harvesting and processing is $1 in and $1-$2 out.Back in 2008 the oil companies tried to sell the oil at the price it used to cost which was $140 a barrel- but the economy was not happy about that, across the world the economy was built on $40 a barrel oil.After the oil crash a couple of years back the frackers avoided marginal fields and cut costs, and in the wider economy made a lot of efficacy savings particularly delivering things from the factory- but these were one off savings: The smart wildcatters got better at spotting better locations and the only route for the economy to make savings is to cut down on the fuel bill [with cheaper electricity for transport] and to swap workers for robots.And oil [and coal] will continue to get a little bit more expensive each time it is drilled for.The fix is the same fix that business used to get poorer workers who had their jobs exported to China to continue buying products, and the same fix that people use when their wages go down..... cheap easy debt.Back in the 70s debt was a means to expand- something that produced assets, now it is an almost permanent situation. For the oil industry it is constant [the big oil companies have some leeway and raise cash].The government is actively keeping debt cheap and Trump is actively making a law to make utilities buy coal. Not very free market.If interest rates go up- which is good for the lenders [and savers] then fracking oil businesses will go down, an if they go down their importance means that some of the economy followers them. Your taxes already prop up US coal- your taxes pay for mines to be cleaned up, for miners medicare to be met, for the cost of pollution- and at some point US oil will be uneconomic - not because it is not useful but simply because the economy cannot pay its true cost of $140 a barrel.
And that does not include the cost of AGW [which you don't accept]- now you may join with the government and believe that oil and coal are of national importance like the military and like the military should be funded with tax payers money. But this all sounds very left wing like Venezuela and its nationalised oil.You may want oil and coal to last forever but it won't- it could last much longer if the economy was prepared to pay far more for it, but it can't.Alternative energy is now as good as fossil fuels- and it will get cheaper, where as oil and coal can only get more expensive. Alternative energy is the free market choice in a perfectly free market [but not when they are being bailed by government and the banks who will come to the govt to get bailed out].
So if it were Blockbuster hanging on and Netflixs was on the rise the smart thing would have been for Blockbuster to switch its business model- not to borrow more money and for the government to actively make DVD rental cheaper than streaming.A carbon [dioxide] tax is a smart way to make the free market more free [and not give fossil fuels an upper hand] and a means to make sure that the economy is not wreaked and that the switch is smooth.If you have a better idea do say.', u'recommendation_count': u'6', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1531992617000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'simply the economy can not pay its true cost of $ 140 a barrel', u'effect': u'because it is not useful but'}, {u'cause': u'it is not useful but simply because the economy can not pay its true cost of $ 140 a barrel', u'effect': u'at some point us oil will be uneconomic not'}], u'author_id': u'4738374', u'in_reply_to': u'118445985', u'id': u'118473300', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'TTauriStellarbody', u'text': u'And the post I was responding too.

The studies included “revenue recycling,” in which the funds generated from a carbon tax are returned to taxpayers either through regular household rebate checks (similar to the Citizens’ Climate Lobby [CCL] and Climate Leadership Council [CLC] proposals) or by offsetting income taxes (similar to the approach in British Columbia).
Among the eleven modeling teams the key findings were consistent. First, a carbon tax is effective at reducing carbon pollution, although the structure of the tax (the price and the rate at which it rises) are important. Second, this type of revenue-neutral carbon tax would have a very modest impact on the economy in terms of gross domestic product (GDP). In all likelihood it would slightly slow economic growth, but by an amount that would be more than offset by the benefits of cutting pollution and slowing global warming.
Meanwhile, House Republicans are again on the verge of introducing a Resolution denouncing a carbon tax as “detrimental to American families and businesses, and is not in the best interest of the United States.”
The modeling teams examined four carbon tax scenarios, with starting prices of $25 or $50 per ton of carbon dioxide, rising at 1% or 5% per year. These are somewhat modest policy scenarios; CCL proposes a starting tax of $15 per ton rising at $10 per year, and the CLC proposes $40 per ton rising around 4% per year. The most aggressive policy considered by the Stanford EMF teams ($50 per ton rising 5% per year) falls in between these two proposals.
The modeling studies consistently found that for all four carbon tax policies considered, whether the revenue is returned via rebate checks or by offsetting income taxes, the direct economic impact is minimal:
in every policy scenario, in every model, the U.S. economy continues to grow at or near its long-term average baseline rate, deviating from reference growth by no more than about 0.1% points. We find robust evidence that even the most ambitious carbon tax is consistent with long-term positive economic growth, near baseline rates, not even counting the growth benefits of a less-disrupted climate or lower ambient air pollution
The last sentence is critical. The analyses consistently found that coal power plants would be the biggest losers if a carbon tax were implemented, and the costs associated with health impacts from other pollutants released by burning coal (e.g. soot and mercury) are substantial. Phasing out coal power plants results in significant health and economic benefits to society. 
So does slowing global warming, of course. A working paper recently published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond concluded that US economic growth would slow by an extra 0.2–0.5% per year if we stay on our current climate path (3–3.5°C global warming) than if we meet the 2°C Paris target. This compares favorably to a less than 0.1% per year slowing of the US economic growth rate under the carbon tax scenarios.
In short, climate change will slow American economic growth. If we don’t curb global warming, the economic impact will be larger. If we implement a carbon tax to help meet the Paris climate targets, the economic impact will be negligible, and will be offset by the benefits of phasing out dirty coal power plants.
The Stanford EMF studies also consistently concluded that a carbon tax is an effective way to curb carbon pollution, especially in the power sector:
carbon price scenarios lead to significant reductions in CO2 emissions, with the vast majority of the reductions occurring in the electricity sector and disproportionately through reductions in coal … Expected economic costs (not accounting for any of the benefits of GHG and conventional pollutant mitigation), in terms of either GDP or welfare, are modest
The analyses also found that the rate of increase of the carbon tax was more important than the starting price. For example, a tax of $50 per ton of carbon dioxide rising by 5% per year would cut carbon pollution 33–56% by 2040. A tax of $25 per ton rising 5% per year cuts it by 25–50% by 2040. However, the policies including a tax increasing at just 1% per year would result in a short-term cut (of about 20–40%), but carbon pollution would remain stable at those levels. 
These results suggest that the most effective carbon tax might start relatively low to give taxpayers time to adjust, but increase rapidly over time, similar to the CCL proposal, which a separate report projected to cut carbon pollution 52% by 2040. The Stanford EMF studies also found that returning the tax revenue by offsetting income taxes was slightly more beneficial for the economy than using dividend checks as the rebate mechanism, but the former is a regressive policy and the latter is progressive.
Real-world examples demonstrate that pricing carbon pollution is smart. British Columbia’s emissions have fallen as its economy has continued to grow. California’s carbon cap and trade system has helped the state meet its climate targets 4 years ahead of schedule, while its economy has flourished.

Economic analyses consistently show that cutting carbon pollution will benefit the economy, and that a revenue-neutral carbon tax is an efficient way of accomplishing that goal. That’s why there’s a 95% consensus among economists that the US government should commit to cutting carbon pollution, with 81% favoring a market-based solution like a carbon tax.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

Of course the Guardian has covered the subject before but if you really want to save the environment on the planet so that us humans curb the damage they are creating in the Anthropocene, then we have to start reducing our human numbers. 
The growth in humanity is the issue that effects all environmental issues. Until we reduce our numbers we will not solve the issues around environmental damage which effects us and other species. 
More worrying is that it might be too late as we are slow to change our ways as a species and with ice caps melting the release of CO2 into the ozone will create temperature rises that the majority of life on earth won't be able to survive.

Titled Cornered by Protected Areas and co-authored with the US-based NGO Rights and Resources Initiative (RRI), the report is an explicit condemnation of “fortress conservation.”
What exactly is meant by that? It is “the idea that to protect forests and biodiversity, ecosystems need to function in isolation, devoid of people,” the Rapporteur told the Guardian. “This model - favoured by governments for over a century - ignores the growing body of evidence that forests thrive when Indigenous Peoples remain on their customary lands and have legally recognised rights to manage and protect them.”
The report effectively consists of an open letter by the Rapporteur, a brief by her and two former RRI employees, and five case-studies on India, Indonesia, Panama, Peru and the Republic of the Congo written by other researchers. It was made public during the recent Oslo Tropical Forest Forum. Here are 10 of the most fascinating take-aways:
1 Vast areas. The global network of “protected areas” such as national parks expanded by 80% between 1970 and 1985 - the majority in so-called “developing” countries - and today they cover 15% of global land surface excluding Antarctica. Expanding the network is integral to meeting the aims of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Such areas are seen as a fundamental way of combatting anthropomorphic climate change and protecting the world’s forests, biodiversity and ecosystems.
2 Devastating impacts. Huge areas of indigenous peoples’ and other local communities’ land have been overlapped by “protected areas”, according to the Rapporteur, and the impacts are alleged to have been devastating. They include an estimated 250,000 people forcibly evicted from their homes and land between 1990 and 2014 according to one study, houses burnt down, access to land and important sites denied, extrajudicial killings, social conflict, access to justice obstructed, and food sovereignty eroded by bans on subsistence hunting and the “vilification” and “criminalisation” of “slash-and-burn” agriculture. “Protected areas” have caused - and continue to cause - “chronic patterns of abuse” and “large-scale human rights violations.”
3 Lots of words, little action. Despite commitments by “the world’s most influential conservation organisations” to respect indigenous peoples and other local communities’ rights, it is argued that “little has changed” in practice over the last 14 years. Which conservation organisations exactly? The Rapporteur doesn’t say, but she footnotes a 2014 report summarising commitments made by Birdlife, Conservation International, Fauna and Flora International, International Union for the Conservation of Nature, The Nature Conservancy, the Wildlife Conservation Society and the World Wide Fund for Nature.
4 Local peoples’ contributions. Indigenous peoples and other local communities are described as “effective biodiversity and conservation managers”, and the “primary custodians of most of the world’s remaining tropical forests and biodiversity hotspots.” Tree cover loss is reported to be less than half on land that is indigenous- and/or community-run when compared to elsewhere, and when rights to own their land are legally recognised “the difference is even greater.”
5 Not enough rights or money. Despite such contributions, the Rapporteur argues that there has been “no or limited recognition of rights” and that indigenous peoples and local communities receive “only a small percentage” of official “protected areas” funding, which is roughly estimated at $6-6.5 billion a year and called “consistently inadequate.” However, indigenous peoples and other local communities themselves are reported to be “substantial investors”, and represent better value for money than official conservation funding by achieving “at least equal results with a fraction of the budget.”
6 Tigers v tribes. The India case-study focuses on tiger reserves - reportedly comprising 50 of 617 “protected areas’” but capturing 70% of the national conservation budget - and one in particular now called the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve. Many people - mostly Soliga adivasi - have been forcibly relocated, denied access to land and important sites, and banned from hunting, “shifting cultivation” agriculture and traditional forest management using controlled burning. There was some good news in 2011 when 32 Soliga settlements were granted rights under the 2006 Forest Rights Act - reportedly India’s first case of rights being given to a community in a protected area under that law - and another 10 communities were granted rights earlier this year, but financial and state support for community-run conservation “has not been forthcoming.” Some settlements still face relocation.
7 Indigenous peoples in “isolation.” The Peru case-study focuses on the Manu National Park in the Amazon where the situation is made even more complicated by the presence of indigenous peoples living in “isolation” or “initial contact.” Despite some advances, a system to protect them is reportedly “yet to be developed”, while four “stable” - effectively “contacted” - indigenous communities remain without title to their land and have had their collective rights “infringed upon.” The park was established “on the basis it would be inviolable and free of human interference”, but the heart of it was - and remains - indigenous territory.
8 Connection to nature. One point emerging from the report is the importance of their land to indigenous peoples and other local communities. This is emphasised in the case-studies on Indonesia, which describes forests as “forming the basis” of indigenous peoples’ “existence and identities”, and India, which describes the landscape in the tiger reserve as “alive with meaning and connection” for the Soliga - “none of which is recognised by protectionist conservation.” The Rapporteur puts it like this: “In indigenous worldviews people are seen largely as intrinsic parts of nature rather than as distinct and separate from it,” and “many share an ethical interconnection with nature through their languages, beliefs, and practices” which reflects “a commitment to respecting and caring for the natural world.”
9 Culture clash. Another point that emerges is how indigenous peoples’ and other local communities’ worldviews differ to that of governments and the global conservation movement. The India case-study reports that the Soliga think a “good” forest means an “open-canopy savanna woodland”, but for the government and conservationists the “ideal condition” is a “closed forest.” In the Indonesia case-study, one Kasepuhan leader is quoted as saying: “conservation has different meanings for people with or without education. For local people, we are doing conservation, we are taking responsibility for what is alive and what has died. But for people with education, conservation means that we do not do anything: when forest is green, people can only look at it.”
10 What to do - now and urgently. All the case-studies make country-specific recommendations, but the Rapporteur’s brief issues a rallying-cry to “take down the wall of fortress conservation” and calls for a “new approach” to conservation in general. It lists four things that urgently need doing now: 1) create a global “monitoring and grievance mechanism; 2) establish national “accountability and reparation mechanisms”; 3) ensure the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is fully integrated into all future conservation and climate change mitigation measures; and 4) spend more conservation finance on “community-run conservation initiatives” based around an “emerging suite of approaches such as co-management, indigenous-managed protected areas, and indigenous territorial governance.”
… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for humanity and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

1. The low-hanging fruit is that around 20-30% of all power consumed on a chip has to do with the clock pulse. With smarter software tools, clock synchronization can be eliminated. We already know how to do this. What's stopping this is 100% business considerations (like lack of demand and how do you market something that doesn't have a GHz rating) and nothing to do with technology. Appropriately high carbon taxation of data centers would put this technology on the front burner again.
2. A lot of the remaining power consumption has to do with memory architecture and ""bus"" access (both on and off the chip). Blurring the lines between memory and processor (to the point where computers don't have processors per se) has the potential to reduce this inefficiency to near zero while massively increasing parallel compute power. Instead of measuring computers in GHz and processors, it would be measured in something closer to digital neurons, each of which has pervasive and highly localized storage and compute power. This is likely closer to how the brain works. What we're doing right now is basically insane if heat is an issue.
I really do see no reason that more than 90% of the power currently consumed by chips can't be eliminated. The upper bound is probably closer to 99% as it seems likely that 99% of the distance that electrons travel on a chip right now is pure waste due to our limited intellectual ability to organize chips. Don't get me wrong, von Neumann was one of the great geniuses of all time, but his ideas are rapidly running out of steam.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1532035823000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'our limited intellectual ability to organize chips', u'effect': u'that 99 % of the distance that electrons travel on a chip right now is pure waste'}], u'author_id': u'17811466', u'in_reply_to': u'118503821', u'id': u'118504135', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Ethan Hawkins', u'text': u'One huge difference between information and aviation is that, based on the laws of physics, aviation is always going to consume massive amounts of power. This is not necessarily true of data technologies. Looking back, the power consumption of Eniac was absolutely massive on a per-bit basis, but vacuum tubes gave way to integrated circuits, which gave way to photolithography, which will eventually give way to 3D storage and clockless chips. In the not very distant future, we can eventually expect entire server farms consuming megawatts to disappear into volumes smaller than a laptop and with similar power consumption. The main reason this hasn't happened already is not technological. So, yes, this is a problem, for now. But it's not going to remain a problem forever and we can address this issue in ways that the aviation industry simply could never. Furthermore, the power going into shipping bits around partly comes out of the power that WAS used to ship the equivalent paper (or people!) around. It's not at all clear that this digital world is less efficient. It seems to me that it's quite probably a lot MORE efficient than the way we used to do things in a great many cases (a Skype call versus a plane trip, an Amazon order fulfilled by a central warehouse versus driving to six different stores). Before we get all upset about this, I think someone would need to do a really detailed analysis of the pros and cons.

And yes, a huge amount of research is going into making processing more efficient. Not always because engineers think about energy use, but because they think a lot about heat. Having worked with supercomputers (via net) i had a guided tour once. From an engineering point of view, a lot of the problem with computing powerhouses is how to get rid of heat on a massive scale. Thermal efficiency is a big thing on this planet. And a combustion car run on 30 percent efficiency on a good day. A coal power plant top 50 percent. Something with an electric motor and electronics often top 90 percent efficiency. 
To point at digital transfer as problem for agw is to bark up the wrong tree. 
Just a few examples. In science we have bandwidth now that allows the transfer of terabyte files from models or even remote sensing images. In 1990 when I started university, these data were still so big that it was faster to send a person across the Atlantic and bring the substantial mass of hard drives back home. Measured in gigabytes. 
So imagine that, 200 gigabyte would need a flight. Now that would cause a bit of emission. 
I remember the first global digital elevation model of the planet with a 1x1km resolution coming to university in 1993. It was fantastic - it came packed on 20 (?) CDs. By air-mail. Around 15 gbytes. Imagine if we did that still - I have no idea how many jumbo jets we would have flying with information. 
It is also worth to remember that when I finished my Cand. SC in 1997, it was high-tech that I could fill in a form for required climate data on the WWW, that then came sent to me as print outs from a server, so I could sit at the computer day in and day out and punch it into my computer (with big chance from manual mistakes). My office needs energy too, as does my computer. Heck, we used digitizing software until resent ly, to digitize graphs of data. It may not sound very scientific - but it was reality until very recent. In finishing my PhD it came back in mail in text format. Now it is just waiting to be taken down in grd formats. 
Finally, I see that USA want to make the net less neutral. That is way more scary than the internet emissions for agw. 
Information takes ""power"" with many meanings. Politically and physically. To the extent that låt Stephen Hawkins spent a lot of his intellect trying to resolve the paradox of black holes - pondering the problem of information being destroyed, that violate quite a number of ideas we have about ""signals"" (or information). To spend energy on information transfer is maybe the best we have used energy for. And it includes both jodeling and bagpipes. It takes energy both to send and receive. No different with this post. 
UK invented the train (by steam). There are better and faster and more efficient trains to move the information of my brain now. It is never zero.

Half a watt for an hour is 0.5 kWh. Triple it to 1.5 kWh to include the data centre. About 75 kWh per year.
A medium fridge (500 l) typically uses about 500 kWh per year. About 10 kWh per week. Someone can't do his sums.
Say your house has ten 100 W bulbs running for 5 hours a day (averaged over summer and winter). 5 kWh per day, 35 kWh per week, almost 2,000 kWh per year.

I was on a train home from Paddington station, and the carriage’s air-conditioning was just about fighting off the heat outside. Most people seemed to be staring at their phones – in many cases, they were trying to stream a World Cup match, as the 4G signal came and went, and Great Western Railway’s onboard wifi proved to be maddeningly erratic. The trebly chatter of headphone leakage was constant. And thousands of miles and a few time zones away in Loudoun County, Virginia, one of the world’s largest concentrations of computing power was playing its part in keeping everything I saw ticking over, as data from around the world passed back and forth from its vast buildings.
Most of us communicate with this small and wealthy corner of the US every day. Thanks to a combination of factors – its proximity to Washington DC, competitive electricity prices, and its low susceptibility to natural disasters – the county is the home of data centres used by about 3,000 tech companies: huge agglomerations of circuitry, cables and cooling systems that sit in corners of the world most of us rarely see, but that are now at the core of how we live. About 70% of the world’s online traffic is reckoned to pass through Loudoun County.
But there is a big problem, centred on a power company called Dominion, which supplies the vast majority of Loudoun County’s electricity. According to a 2017 Greenpeace report, only 1% of Dominion’s total electricity comes from credibly renewable sources: 2% originates in hydroelectric plants, and the rest is split evenly between coal, gas and nuclear power. Dominion is also in the middle of a huge regional controversy about a proposed pipeline that will carry fracked gas to its power plants, which it says is partly driven by data centres’ insatiable appetite for electricity. Clearly, then, the video streams, digital photographs and messaging that pour out of all those servers come with a price.
I was reminded of all this by the recently published book New Dark Age, by the British writer James Bridle. He cites a study in Japan that suggests that by 2030, the power requirements of digital services will outstrip the nation’s entire current generation capacity. He quotes an American report from 2013 – ironically enough, commissioned by coal industry lobbyists – that pointed out that using either a tablet or smartphone to wirelessly watch an hour of video a week used roughly the same amount of electricity (largely consumed at the data-centre end of the process) as two new domestic fridges.
If you worry about climate change and a cause celebre such as the expansion of Heathrow airport, it is worth considering that data centres are set to soon have a bigger carbon footprint than the entire aviation industry. Yet as Bridle points out, even that statistic doesn’t quite do justice to some huge potential problems. He mentions the vast amounts of electricity consumed by the operations of the online currency Bitcoin – which, at the height of the speculative frenzies earlier this year, was set to produce an annual amount of carbon dioxide equivalent to 1m transatlantic flights. And he’s anxious about what will happen next: “In response to vast increases in data storage and computational capacity in the last decade, the amount of energy used by data centres has doubled every four years, and is expected to triple in the next 10 years.”
These changes are partly being driven by the so-called internet of things: the increasing array of everyday devices – from TVs, through domestic security devices, to lighting systems, and countless modes of transport – that constantly emit and receive data. If driverless cars ever arrive in our lives, those same flows will increase hugely. At the same time, the accelerating rollout of the internet and its associated technologies in the developing world will add to the load. 
About a decade ago, we were being told to fight climate change by switching off our TVs and stereos. If the battle is now even more urgent, how does it fit with a world in which router lights constantly flicker, and all the devices we own will be in constant, energy-intensive communication with distant mega-computers?
But some good news. Whatever its other ethical contortions, Silicon Valley has an environmental conscience. Facebook has pledged to, sooner or later, power its operations using “100% clean and renewable energy”. Google says it has already achieved that goal. So does Apple. Yet even if you factor in efficiency improvements, beneath many of these claims lies a reality in which the vast and constant demand for power means such companies inevitably use energy generated by fossil fuels, and then atone for it using the often questionable practice of carbon offsetting.
And among the big tech corporations, there is one big focus of worry: Amazon, whose ever-expanding cloud computing wing, Amazon Web Services, offers “the on-demand delivery of computer power, database storage … and other IT resources” and provides most of the computing power behind Netflix. This sits at the heart of data centres’ relentless expansion. Green campaigners bemoan the fact that the details of AWS’s electricity consumption and its carbon footprint remain under wraps; on its corporate website, the story of its use of renewable energy suddenly stops in 2016.
Besides, for all their power, even the most enlightened US giants obviously command only part of a global industry. To quote from that Greenpeace report: “Among emerging Chinese internet giants such as Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba, the silence on energy performance still remains. Neither the public nor customers are able to obtain any information about their electricity use and CO2 target.” Irrespective of the good work carried out by some tech giants, and whether or not you take seriously projections that the entire communication technology industry could account for up to 14% of carbon emissions by 2040, one stark fact remains: the vast majority of electricity used in the world’s data centres comes from non-renewable sources, and as their numbers rapidly increase, there are no guarantees that this will change.
On the fringes of the industry, a few voices have been heard describing the kind of future at which most of us – expecting everything streamed as a right – would balk. They talk about eventually rationing internet use, insisting that people send black and white images, or forcibly pushing them away from binge-streaming videos. Their basic point, it seems, chimes with those occasions when the smartphone in your pocket starts to suddenly heat up: a metaphor for our warming planet, and the fact that even the most well-intentioned corporations may yet find that their supposedly unlimited digital delights are, in the dictionary definition of the term, unsustainable.

… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point.

The temporary use ban being imposed by United Utilities from 5 August has led to calls for water firms to do more to tackle leakage on their networks.
United Utilities is second only to Thames Water for the amount of water lost en route to households, at 133 litres per property per day, well above the sector’s average of 121 litres.
The amount of water wasted through leaking pipes is almost identical to regional average daily use, which stands at 132 litres per customer.
The company is also the industry’s third-worst performer on the other main measurement, cubic metres of water leaked per kilometre per day.
Tony Juniper, the executive director for advocacy and campaigns at WWF-UK, said: “In the short-term one would hope the water companies, all of them, would be putting more effort into leakage reduction, the promotion of water efficient appliances from dishwashers to showers, and about communicating to consumers.”
He added the hosepipe ban was “another reminder that on climate change we’ve entered the era of consequences”.
United Utilities said it took water wastage seriously, and had 160 inspectors looking for leaks, as well as sniffer dogs and satellites.
“Reducing leaks is a top priority. We have cut leakage by half since the 1990s and are working hard to do even more,” a spokesperson said. The company met its leakage targets for 2016-17.
Around 2,900m litres a day, or 20% of all public water supply, is lost through leaks on suppliers’ networks.
The government was recently told by its infrastructure advisers to set a target for firms to halve leakage by 2050. The National Infrastructure Commission pointed out that reductions had largely stalled over the past decade and households needed to be encouraged to conserve more.
The average use per person nationally is 141 litres per day, down from 150 litres in 2000, but still well behind Europe’s best-performers, the Belgians and the Danes, who use about 115 litres per day.
One of United Utilities’ customers, the fracking firm Cuadrilla, has said residents would not be left short at its Lancashire operations, at a site between Blackpool and Preston. 
The water industry has warned shale firms they could face a shortage of water supplies in some areas.
Cuadrilla said that fracking the two wells at Preston New Road, which is now expected to take place in late August or early September, would use up to 32,500 litres of water.
A company spokesperson said: “It is highly unlikely that our operations would be affected by a water shortage, however estimates of predicted water demands have been supplied to United Utilities to allow them to assess their existing systems and any impacts on their wider network.”
Reservoir levels in the north-west fell 10-15% in June. The region has been more seriously affected by the warm, dry weather than other parts of the country, which were cushioned by a wet spring.

The worst affected country, Sweden, has called for emergency assistance from its partners in the European Union to help fight the blazes, which have broken out across a wide range of its territory and prompted the evacuations of four communities.
Tens of thousands of people have been warned to remain inside and close windows and vents to avoid smoke inhalation. Rail services have been disrupted.
The Copernicus Earth observation programme, which gives daily updates of fires in Europe, shows more than 60 fires burning across Sweden, with sites also ablaze in Norway, Finland and Russia, including in the Arctic Circle.
Norway has sent six fire-fighting helicopters in response to its neighbour’s request for assistance. Italy is sending two Canadair CL-415s – which can dump 6,000 litres of water on each run – to Örebro in central southern Sweden.
 In western Sweden, fire-fighting operations were temporarily halted near an artillery training range near Älvdalen forest due to concerns that unexploded ordnance might be detonated by the extreme heat. 
Residents in Uppsala said they could see the plumes of smoke and have been banned from barbecuing in national parks, after 18 consecutive days without rain.
“This is definitely the worst year in recent times for forest fires. Whilst we get them every year, 2018 is shaping up to be excessive,” said Mike Peacock, a university researcher and local resident. 
There have been huge fires in the past in Sweden, but not over such a wide area. This appears to be a trend as more and bigger blazes are reported in other far northern regions like Greenland, Alaska, Siberia and Canada.
The sparks come from a variety of sources: BBQs, cigarettes and increasingly lightning, which is becoming more frequent as the planet warms.
Swedish authorities say the risk of more fires in the days ahead is “extremely high” due to temperatures forecast in excess of 30C. Much of the northern hemisphere has sweltered in unusually hot weather in recent weeks, breaking records from Algeria to California and causing fires from Siberia to Yorkshire. Ukraine has been hit especially hard by wildfires.
The European Forest Fire Information System warned fire danger conditions were likely to be extreme across much of central and northern Europe in the coming weeks.
EU officials said many of this year’s fires are outside the traditional European fire zone of the Mediterranean, and are increasingly taking place at unexpected times of year. 2017 was the worst fire year in Europe’s history, causing destruction to thousands of hectares of forest and cropland in Portugal, Spain and Italy, as late as November. “There are clear trends of longer fire seasons and frequent critical periods in Europe that are leading to dangerous fire situations,” said a European commission official.
Climate scientists said the Arctic and other areas that were once relatively fire-free are likely to become more vulnerable.
“What we’re seeing with this global heatwave is that these areas of fire susceptibility are now broadening, with the moors in north-west England and now these Swedish fires a consequence of that,” said Vincent Gauci, professor of global change ecology at the Open University. 
“Both these areas are typically mild and wet which allows forests and peatlands to develop quite large carbon stores,” he added. “When such carbon-dense ecosystems experience aridity and heat and there is a source of ignition – lightning or people – fires will happen.”

Using satellite imagery, researchers catalogued more than 1,700 glaciers in northern Ellesmere Island and traced how they had changed between 1999 and 2015. 
The results offered a glimpse into how warming temperatures may be affecting ice in the region, from glaciers that sprawl across the land to the 200-metre thick ice shelves, said Adrienne White, a glaciologist at the University of Ottawa.
“It’s an area that’s very difficult to study,” said White. “Logistically it’s very hard to get to and even with satellite imagery – for the longest time Google Earth didn’t even have complete imagery – it was kind of the forgotten place.” 
White’s study, published last month in the Journal of Glaciology, found that the glaciers had shrank by more than 1,700 sq km of over a 16-year period, representing a loss of about 6%. 
A previous study of glaciers in the region – which used air photos and did not include ice shelves – showed a loss of 927 sq km between 1959 and 2000, hinting that the pace of loss may be increasing.
Of the 1,773 glaciers tracked by White, 1,353 were found to have shrunk significantly. A handful had disappeared altogether: “What we found is a loss of three complete ice shelves,” she said. “In terms of glaciers that terminate on land, we’ve lost three small ice caps.” 
None of the glaciers in the study showed any signs of growing. 
The findings echo the changes White has observed during her years of visiting the island. “We see a lot more icebergs,” said White. “Where there was one continuous ice shelf, we now see individual icebergs broken up, we see a lot more crevasses.” 
She attributed the findings to an increase in temperatures. Canada’s Arctic – one of the world’s most glaciated regions – is warming at one of the fastest rates of anywhere on Earth. 
In northern Ellesmere Island, the annual average temperature in the region increased by 3.6C between 1948 and 2016. 
In particular, “there seemed to be a shift in the mid-90s,” she said, describing it as a “sudden increase in warming,” that saw temperatures increase at about 0.78C per decade between 1995 and 2016.
“These increases were greatest in autumn and winter,” she said. “So what you end up with is a lot more melt.” 
While the most direct impact is rising sea levels, the melting ice also risks wiping out the region’s unique ecosystems, such as the freshwater lakes that form when the water flowing off a glacier is trapped by a floating ice shelf. 
“When these glaciers break away, all of a sudden there’s nothing holding back these ecosystems that have been growing and developing for thousands of years,” said White. “And they’re gone before we even have the chance to study them.” 
Extrapolating from research done on glaciers from a neighbouring island, White’s study suggested that many of the glaciers on northern Ellesmere Island may not be high enough to accumulate enough snow to counter the pace at which they are melting. “Without growth, that glacier is just in a state of loss,” she said. “It will disappear if climates don’t change.”

A prediction of climate change :""Multiple lines of evidence indicate a strong, consistent, almost linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and projected global temperature change to the year 2100 in both the RCPs and the wider set of mitigation scenarios analysed in WGIII (Figure SPM.5b).

unless you can come up with a study it is impossible to measure the impact of a single input. is that clear?
Basic science works on eliminating inputs - when CO2 was first discovered to be a GHG the gases in air were separated and the experiment was carried out on each.
There has been a [positive] result, attributing that wholly to single factor without evidence would be foolish.
Carbon tax is a tool- and it is noteworthy that tobacco duty was also used as tool to reduce the habit, yet despite paying more than other countries smoking in the UK persisted- however smoking has been reduced.But other factors include public awareness of the science and the health implications.The reduction in advertising particularly to the young.The banning of smoking in public spaces and work.Changes in social and cultural opinion on smoking.Development of medical alternatives like gum and patches.Active health campaigns and support.
however personally it was the new technology of vaping - the conversion from combustion to electricity that has had the biggest impact.
Vaping is considerably healthier and cheaper as it does not carry the tax- so even this switch can be attributed in part to a tobacco tax, but attributing all reductions to the tax is impossible to determine [or at least very difficult] and unlikely.

The Resolution was introduced by Steve Scalise (R-LA) with essentially the same language as he introduced in 2013 and 2016.
On those past versions, every Republican House member voted against carbon taxes. This time, six Republicans rejected the Resolution and one abstained, voting ‘Present.’ However, 97% of the House Republicans on the floor voted against carbon taxes.
House Democrats have been fairly consistent in their votes on these Resolutions as well. In 2013, 94% voted against the Resolution, and in 2016 and 2018, 96% voted ‘Nay,’ with six to seven pro-fossil fuel Democrats voting ‘Yes.’
The text of the Resolution claims that carbon taxes are necessarily bad for America:
Expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy … [and] to American families and businesses, and is not in the best interest of the United States.
This week’s Resolution ironically came right on the heels of a comprehensive study showing that a carbon tax whose revenues were returned to taxpayers either via rebate checks or by offsetting income taxes would have a negligible impact on the economy – significantly less than the cost of unchecked global warming. In fact, research has shown that it’s global warming that will seriously slow economic growth.
We already pay a ""carbon tax"". It's the extra money we pay on electricity to run our air conditioners; it's the price increases due to agricultural impacts of heat and precip. changes; it's the cost of sea level rise; 1/2 https://t.co/D6OyvPmXeY
Simply put, the only way to protect the economy is to stop global warming. Accomplishing that will require that virtually every world country implement climate policies aimed at curbing carbon pollution. That was the purpose of the Paris climate accords. Disgracefully, the Trump administration made America the only country in the world whose leadership rejects that international climate agreement. But a carbon tax would be one of the most effective and efficient ways to cut America’s carbon pollution. 
The text of the Resolution has it exactly backwards – a carbon tax would help protect the American economy by slowing global warming and its detrimental effects on economic growth.
Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL) Executive Director Mark Reynolds characterized yesterday’s vote as progress, saying:
The fact that six Republicans voted ‘no’ on an anti-carbon tax resolution is an indication that there are cracks in the wall separating Democrats and Republicans on climate change.
At the CCL blog, Flannery Winchester also noted that the number of co-sponsors on Scalise’s Resolutions dropped from 155 in 2013, to 82 in 2016, to just 48 in 2018. That’s a nearly 70% decline over five years and an encouraging sign that the number of vehement anti-carbon tax members of Congress is dwindling.
Given that the share of the Republican vote against carbon taxes only dropped from 100% in 2016 to 97% in 2018, the cracks are still small, but a crack is better than an unyielding wall of denial. Nevertheless, it’s frustrating that just four of the 43 Republican members of the Climate Solutions Caucus voted against the Resolution (with one more abstaining by voting ‘Present’). Especially given the conditions under which yesterday’s vote happened:
It really should have been an easy ‘Nay’ vote, and yet only a handful of Republicans voted the right way. Climate Solutions Caucus member Darrell Issa (R-CA) explained his ‘Yes’ vote, saying a “carbon tax isn’t the solution” and that the Caucus should focus on policies that can generate bipartisan support, like energy efficiency programs and keeping nuclear power plants open. 
Those are indeed valid climate policies. They’re also wholly insufficient to tackle global warming, and if Republicans can only support inadequate climate policies, they’re unbefitting the role of governance.
The cracks in the wall should be much bigger by now. A new study by Robert Brulle identified why the CCL volunteer lobbying on this Resolution was relatively ineffective:
Professional lobbying organizations are a permanent presence on Capitol Hill. Thus, the vast expenditures and continuous presence of professional lobbyists limit the impact of volunteer climate advocates.
Brulle found that over $2bn has been spent lobbying Congress on climate change legislation since 2000 (an average of $125m per year). And an analysis by the Center for American Progress found that in 2009–2010 leading up to a vote on a cap and trade bill, the fossil fuel industry spent over $500m lobbying against it. In Washington DC, money talks, as Brulle noted:
We seem to have a public opinion fetish where if we get public opinion to be supportive of climate change legislation, then it’ll happen. My answer to that is, gee, well, we should have gun control legislation then.
Fortunately, Americans have an opportunity to remedy this problem in less than four months, when every House member will be up for election in the 2018 midterms. 
If we agree that climate change poses an existential threat (it does), that this should have been an easy ‘Nay’ vote, and that Republican members of Congress are beholden to the fossil fuel industry rather than voter preferences, then the answer is simple. In November, Americans should replace all members of Congress who voted in favor of the Resolution and who face opponents that aren’t in bed with the fossil fuel industry.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for humanity and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account.

But what’s the cause?,article,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/22/heatwave-northen-hemisphere-uk-algeria-canada-sweden-whats-the-cause,2940,"Last week, authorities in Sweden took an unusual step. They issued an appeal for international aid to help them tackle an epidemic of wildfires that has spread across the nation over the past few days.
After months without rain, followed by weeks of soaring temperatures, the nation’s forests had become tinderboxes.
The result was inevitable. Wildfires broke out and, by the end of last week, more than 50 forest blazes – a dozen inside the Arctic circle – had spread across Sweden.
A nation famous for its cold and snow found itself unable to cope with the conflagrations taking place within its border and so made its appeal for international help, a request that has already been answered by Norway and Italy who have both sent airborne firefighting teams to help battle Sweden’s blazes.
Nor is the nation’s fiery fate particularly unusual at present. Across much of the northern hemisphere, intense and prolonged heatwaves have triggered disruption and devastation as North America, the Arctic, northern Europe and Africa have sweltered in record-breaking temperatures. In Africa, a weather station at Ouargla, Algeria, in the Sahara desert, recorded a temperature of 51.3C, the highest reliable temperature ever recorded in Africa. In Japan, where temperatures have reached more than 40C, people were last week urged to take precautions after the death toll reached 30 with thousands more having sought hospital treatment for heat-related conditions. And in California increased use of air conditioning units, switched on to counter the scorching conditions there, has led to power shortages.
But perhaps the strangest impact of the intense heat has been felt in Canada. It too has been gripped by ferocious heat, with Toronto recording temperatures that have exceeded 30C on 18 days so far this year. This figure compares with only nine such days all last summer.
Dozens have died in the withering heat – with startling and grim consequences. Montreal’s morgue has been swamped with the bodies of those who have died because of the heat, and many corpses have had to be stored elsewhere in the city. Montreal coroner Jean Brochu said it was first time the city’s morgue had been overwhelmed this way.
Britain’s scorching weather – which has melted the roof of Glasgow’s Science Centre and parched the lawns of the nation’s historic homes – may have made regular UK headlines. However, it has been relatively mild in impact compared to those experienced in many other parts of the world.
Far from being a parochial problem, the current heatwave is clearly an issue that affects vast stretches of our planet: a global concern not a local one.
But why is so much of our world currently being afflicted with blisteringly hot weather? What is driving the wildfires, the soaring temperatures and those melting rooftops? These are tricky questions to answer, such is the complex nature of the planet’s weather systems. Most scientists point to a number of factors with global warming being the most obvious candidate. Others warn that it would be wrong to overstate its role in the current heatwaves, however.
“Yes, it is hard not to believe that climate change has to be playing a part in what is going on round the globe at present,” said Dann Mitchell of Bristol University. “There have been some remarkable extremes recorded in the past few weeks, after all. However, we should take care about overstating climate change’s influence for it is equally clear there are also other influences at work.”
One of those other factors is the jet stream – a core of strong winds around five to seven miles above the Earth’s surface that blow from west to east and which steer weather around the globe. Sometimes, when they are intense, they bring storms. On other occasions, when they are weak, they bring very calm and settled days. And that is what is occurring at present.
“The jet stream we are currently experiencing is extremely weak and, as a result, areas of atmospheric high pressure are lingering for long periods over the same place,” added Mitchell.
Other factors involved in creating the meteorological conditions that have brought such heat to the northern hemisphere include substantial changes to sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. “These are part of a phenomenon known as the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation,” said Professor Adam Scaife, of the Met Office.
“In fact, the situation is very like the one we had in 1976, when we had similar ocean temperatures in the Atlantic and an unchanging jet stream that left great areas of high pressure over many areas for long periods,” said Scaife.
“And of course, that year we had one of the driest, sunniest and warmest summers in the UK in the 20th century.”
However, there is one crucial difference between 1976 and today, added Professor Tim Osborn, director of research at the Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia. “The baseline on which these effects operated is very different today. Since 1976 we have had several decades of global warming – caused by rising carbon emissions – which has raised baseline global temperatures significantly.”
As a result, any phenomenon such as the weakening of the jet stream is going to have a more pronounced effect than it did 40 years ago.
And as global carbon emissions continue to rise and predictions suggest the world will be unable to hold global temperature rises this century to below 2C above pre-industrial levels, widespread heatwaves are very likely to get worse and become more frequent, scientists warn.
Nor is the problem of increasingly severe heatwaves confined to the land. “We have marine heatwaves as well – all over the globe,” said Michael Burrows, of the Scottish Marine Institute, Oban. “For example, there was a major marine heatwave that struck the coast of Australia last year. It devastated vast swathes of the Great Barrier Reef. More to the point, marine heatwaves are also becoming more and more frequent and intense, like those on land, and that is something else that we should be very worried about.”

As a result, the Earth Overshoot Day – which marks the point at which consumption exceeds the capacity of nature to regenerate – has moved forward two days to 1 August, the earliest date ever recorded.
To maintain our current appetite for resources, we would need the equivalent of 1.7 Earths, according to Global Footprint Network, an international research organisation that makes an annual assessment of how far humankind is falling into ecological debt.
The overshoot began in the 1970s, when rising populations and increasing average demands pushed consumption beyond a sustainable level. Since then, the day at which humanity has busted its annual planetary budget has moved forward.
Thirty years ago, the overshoot was on 15 October. Twenty years ago, 30 September. Ten years ago, 15 August. There was a brief slowdown, but the pace has picked back up in the past two years. On current trends, next year could mark the first time, the planet’s budget is busted in July.
While ever greater food production, mineral extraction, forest clearance and fossil-fuel burning bring short-term (and unequally distributed) lifestyle gains, the long-term consequences are increasingly apparent in terms of soil erosion, water shortages and climate disruption.
The day of reckoning is moving nearer, according to Mathis Wackernagel, chief executive and co-founder of Global Footprint Network.
“Our current economies are running a Ponzi scheme with our planet,” he said. “We are borrowing the Earth’s future resources to operate our economies in the present. Like any Ponzi scheme, this works for some time. But as nations, companies, or households dig themselves deeper and deeper into debt, they eventually fall apart.”
The situation is reversible. Research by the group indicates political action is far more effective than individual choices. It notes, for example, that replacing 50% of meat consumption with a vegetarian diet would push back the overshoot date by five days. Efficiency improvements in building and industry could make a difference of three weeks, and a 50% reduction of the carbon component of the footprint would give an extra three months of breathing space. 
 In the past, economic slowdowns – which tend to reduce energy consumption – have also shifted the ecological budget in a positive direction. The 2007-08 financial crisis saw the date push back by five days. Recessions in the 90s and 80s also lifted some of the pressure, as did the oil shock of the mid 1970s. 
But the overall trend is of costs increasingly being paid by planetary support systems. 
Separate scientific studies over the past year has revealed a third of land is now acutely degraded, while tropical forests have become a source rather than a sink of carbon. Scientists have also raised the alarm about increasingly erratic weather, particularly in the Arctic, and worrying declines in populations of bees and other insect pollinators, which are essential for crops. 
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.

The researchers warn that the impact of climate change on suicides may be as significant as economic recessions, which are known to increase rates of self-harm.
The links between mental health and global warming have not been widely researched but the new work analysed temperature and suicides across the US and Mexico in recent decades. It found that the rate of suicide rose by 0.7% in the US and by 2.1% in Mexico when the average monthly temperature rose by 1C.
The analysis was done at county level and took into account seasonal variation, levels of poverty and even the news of celebrity suicides that can lead to more deaths. The scientists found that hotter periods resulted in more suicides irrespective of wealth and the usual climate of the area.
“Determining whether or not the rate of suicide responds to climatic conditions is important, as suicide alone causes more deaths globally than all forms of violence combined and is among the top 10–15 causes of death globally,” said Prof Marshall Burke, at Stanford University in the US, and his colleagues, who published their research in the journal Nature Climate Change.
“Even modest changes in suicide rates due to climate change could [lead to] large changes in the associated global health burden, particularly in wealthier countries where current suicide rates are relatively high,” the researchers said. Record high temperatures have been recorded around the world in recent weeks and are likely to have been driven by climate change.
This kind of study cannot prove a causal link between rising temperature and more suicides. But the results show “remarkable consistency” over time and in many different places, according to the scientists. It is also supported by recent research that linked climate change to 60,000 suicides in India in the last three decades. 
The researchers also analysed more than 600m messages on Twitter and found that the use of depressive words, such as alone, bleak, lonely and trapped, increased as temperatures rose. “This further suggests that mental wellbeing deteriorates during warmer periods,” said the scientists. One possible way in which this might happen is that when the body cools itself during warmer conditions, the blood flow to the brain is altered.
If current carbon emissions are not curbed, the scientists estimated that between 9,000 and 40,000 additional suicides could be expected by 2050 in the US and Canada due to climate change. That number of deaths is significantly more than would be expected from a 1% rise in unemployment due to an economic recession, the researchers said. Other research has already clearly shown that rising heat increases violence between people.
• In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. Hotlines in other countries can be found here.

Carlos Curbelo of Florida, considered a moderate GOP member of Congress, said a carbon tax would avoid “saddling young Americans with a crushing environmental debt” and expressed his belief that “this bill or legislation similar to it” will become law one day.
Curbelo’s bill has virtually no chance of becoming law, however, due to the serried ranks of Republicans in Congress who instinctively reject any sort of government intervention, particularly taxes, to help stem the increasing heatwaves, floods, fierce storms and social upheaval caused by a warming planet.
Last week, the Republican-led House of Representatives passed a resolution denouncing the idea of a carbon tax as “detrimental to the United States economy”. Of the 43 Republicans who are members of the Climate Solutions Caucus – a bipartisan group formed to help craft climate policy – only six voted against the motion. 
Curbelo, one of the six Republicans to vote with Democrats in favor of a carbon tax, has now unveiled his own proposal. Curbelo represents a district that takes in the southern tip of Florida – an area extremely vulnerable to sea level rise – and faces an uphill battle in this year’s midterm elections.
His plan would tax industrial carbon dioxide emissions $24 a ton from 2020. It would also scrap federal excise taxes on gasoline and diesel fuels, as well as kill off the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era strategy to limit emissions from coal-fired power plants. 
According to Columbia University, Curbelo’s plan would cut the US’s greenhouse gas emissions by up to a third by 2025, putting it on course to meet its commitments made in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. It would also raise at least $57bn in 2020, growing to at least $63bn by 2030 as the tax increases. Curbelo wants to use this cash to upgrade infrastructure, particularly roads.
“While there are still some deniers out there, most Americans today understand that climate change caused by human activity is a reality that must be addressed,” he said. 
“I remind my conservative colleagues who often decry our nation’s growing debt; saddling young Americans with a crushing environmental debt – meaning an unhealthy planet where life is less viable – is at least as immoral as leaving behind an unsustainable fiscal debt.”
Republican hostility to any sort of action on climate change has hardened over the past decade, despite increasingly urgent warnings from scientists. Donald Trump, who has called global warming “bullshit” and a Chinese-inspired hoax, has taken an axe to various climate regulations and said the US will withdraw from the Paris climate accords.
Curbelo’s plan has received a mixed reaction from environmentalists. Some green groups have derided it as an empty re-election gesture that could actually increase emissions in a major sector – transportation – by funneling money into road construction and slashing fuel taxes.
Others, though, see it as a sign the American political conversation around climate change is slowly evolving, given a backdrop of increasing public confidence in climate science.
“It’s a breakthrough to see a serious Republican proposal take aim at the central environmental threat of our time,” said David Doniger, senior strategic director of the climate and clan energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
“But this carbon tax plan is only a conversation starter. It falls far short of what’s needed to protect our climate. We must deploy all available tools, not limit them as this bill does, to head off the worst damages from climate change.” 
Cities and states have sought to fill the void left by Trump’s retreat from climate change, with several attempting to sue major oil companies for damages. 
Last week, a judge tossed out New York City’s claim against five oil giants, stating that the issue should be dealt with by legislation. Similar climate legal action has been launched in recent weeks by Rhode Island and Baltimore.
… in the fight to protect the environment. By keeping the Guardian’s environmental coverage open and accessible, we can report on the changes needed to avoid climate and natural catastrophe. The choices made by individuals are important, but we need to work together for the systemic transformation that will make a real difference. As well as reporting the facts about what is happening now, we investigate the causes and talk to the people trying to make the future better. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.

No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account.

Perhaps more revolutionary still, the new initiative is light-hearted in tone, optimistic in outlook and presents positive stories in what the originators hope will be seen as a fun way.
Called Mothers of Invention, the initiative will kick off with a series of podcasts showcasing the work of grassroots climate activists at a local level, as well as globally resonant initiatives such as the legal challenges under way in numerous jurisdictions to force governments to adhere to the Paris agreement goals. Scientists and politicians feature alongside farmers and indigenous community leaders from Europe, the US and Australia to India, Kenya, South Africa and Peru.
The podcast is a first for Robinson, who has focused on climate justice for the last 15 years through her charity, the Mary Robinson Foundation – Climate Justice, and as one of the Elders group, after seeing at first-hand as UN commissioner for human rights the danger that global warming presents to women whose lives are already precarious.
“Climate change is a manmade problem that requires a feminist solution,” she said ahead of the podcast launch. “What we are hoping to do is create a movement. Climate change is not gender-neutral – it affects women far more. So this is not about climate change, it is about climate justice.”
The movement, she added, would grow organically from the women who feature and the women who join in: “It will be happening in an unstructured way, which is all the better, because we are not prescribing what a feminist solution should look like, we are listening – we want women to tell us what they want. That to me is more interesting.”
Robinson has paired with Maeve Higgins, an Irish-born comedian based in New York and self-styled “sidekick”. They jointly introduce their female guests through a series of informal conversations larded with backchat and jokes – an unusual way of presenting the often gloomy subject of climate damage, Higgins admits, but one she hopes will reach people more effectively than the standard models of climate communication and male-dominated discourse.
“There is a lot of doom and gloom – this is not like that,” Higgins said. “This is for people like myself who feel stuck, knowing there are actions they should be taking but paralysed by despondency. The capitalist patriarchy is not going to solve this. We need to.”
The internet provides the means to reach women all over the world, she said: “This is democratic, this is available to as many people as possible.”
The series will bring in issues of colonialism, racism, poverty, migration and social justice and how these are bound up with feminism and the effects of climate change, and will include related environmental issues such as plastic pollution.
Podcasts are new departure for Robinson. “This is taking me way beyond my comfort zone,” she said. But “I’m willing to go there – I am so urgent about the fact that we need to do more.”
The first five episodes in the series, which is funded by philanthropic foundations, focus on women, but Robinson promised the initiative would not exclude men’s voices. “We will include men in the future,” she said, “but we have started with women, who have found it hard to be heard. A feminist solution to climate change involves everyone.”
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.

You're confusing a first-principles argument with a zero principles argument.
When a biomass process starts from scratch, additional CO₂ is released until the the CO₂ level reaches a steady-state asymptotic plateau of additional CO₂.
There are two points here:
1) The steady-state asymptotic plateau takes over a century to reach, whereas policy requirements for CO₂ reduction require much shorter timescales.
2) The asymptotic level of additional CO₂ is always - always - greater than zero.
 In his paper, Jacobson puts it as clearly as it is possible to put it:
BQSTART
biomass burning always results in CO₂ accumulation
BQEND
but you still can't understand it.
Jacobson runs through all this, in detail, in his paper. But you can't be bothered to read it, and think you've got a ""clever"" first principles argument, when all you've got is pseudoscientific drivel.

supposed benefits of biochar in increasing ecosystem carbon storage may be overstated, at least for boreal forest soils. The effect of biochar on the loss of carbon already in the soil needs to be better understood before it can be effectively applied as a tool to mitigate human-induced increases in carbon-based greenhouse gases.

Increased plant growth caused by rising atmospheric carbon dioxide is associated with higher rates of carbon dioxide release from soil. If rising carbon dioxide enhances soil carbon storage at all, the effect will be small. Soil carbon may not be as stable as previously thought, and soil microbes exert more direct control on carbon buildup than global climate models represent.

Both biochars had substantial impacts on microbial community composition in both soils, but only increased microbial biomass in Yolo soil. In the coarser textured Vina soil, neither biochar had an effect on aggregation and the subsequent lack of soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization in macroaggregates was associated with a significant loss of soil C in both biochar treatments over the course of the incubation.

It's true that the pro-nuclear lobby is always the group to fall back on the personal, on vitriol, on argument. And when this is pointed out, they bring out the nuclear weapon ""Tone troll!""
It's also true that many interesting and constructive contributors to these energy pages seem to have abandoned. I guess they think this is pointless.

And
here is Clack's response to that response. It amounts to - ""you didn't actually respond to any of our criticisms"". I've read Jacobson's response. I am not impressed. For instance, he claims that his approach is not an outlier, but the studies he quotes as evidence of this come from a small group of people (including himself!) and on inspection most do not match his approach at all - they use large amounts of biomass, or are for countries with plentiful hydro, or don't actually go past 80%. Its this kind of bullshit that pisses people off.

BQSTART
In addition: Clacks has published a paper the intent of which is to show Jacobson's 100% WWS solution is not possible. This is where the mistake lies.

'cook' any hydrocarbon and hydrogen and carbon monoxide are released [as well as tars that have some commercial value]- so there is opportunity to think of more flexible means of releasing the gas- perhaps even introducing it into the gas grid [with the CO diverted].
wood and biomass still make up a huge sector of global energy, particularly in rural China, India and Africa where it is used for cooking and heating.

BQEND
They are not a word game- they have specific meaning in the context of the science paper you linked to.
here is an Australian policy paper-
Carbon sequestration in Australian grasslands: policy and technical issues which is a direct response to Australia's carbon cap and trade following Kyoto. it deals with the uncertainties and the accounting of this policy that was thought to be beneficial ,
the Jacobson deals with specific issue of in situ burning- pointing out that was not approved in the Kyoto agreement.
It is specific in its study- it defines what it means by biomass burning.
BQSTART
Major anthropogenic sources of climate change are fossil-fuel combustion, biomass burning, biofuel burning, land-use change, and anthropogenically induced biological activity. Biomass burning is the burning of evergreen forests, deciduous forests, woodlands, grassland, and agricultural land, either to clear land for other use, to stimulate grass growth, for forest management, or as a ritual.
BQEND
therefore it is paper not relevant to biofuel in the context of agricultural and forestry waste and residue .
BQSTART
a tonne of grass emits the same CO₂ whether you burn it in a field or in a power station.
BQEND and rotting down a tonne of grass will also produce other GHG like methane and the same amount of CO2.
It is as useful an argument for AGW denial that human caused CO2 each year is just 3% with 97% being natural of which most is part of the natural carbon cycle that fluctuates - 8 ppm between october and june.
The short term cooling effect of particulates of field burning is difference where as biomass as a biofuel should control temperature and flue gases.
The argument for biomass burning is that the nutrients and carbon are stored in the soil so therefore a negative of CO2, but it appears rotting, burning or burning for generation are all similar with destruction of environment and forest loss contributing to more CO2 as the land quality and use changes.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1532623218000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'human', u'effect': u'co2'}], u'author_id': u'4738374', u'in_reply_to': u'118759441', u'id': u'118760972', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'riveness', u'text': u'And because you are being deliberately ignorant, I again ask for about 200 or so examples.

The Short-Term Cooling but Long-Term Global Warming Due to Biomass Burning Mark Z. Jacobson, Journal of Climate, V. 17 No. 15, 2909–2926, Aug. 2004 
AbstractBiomass burning releases gases (e.g., CO₂, CO, CH₄, NOₓ, SO₂, C₂H₆, C₂H₄, C₃H₈, C₃H₆) and aerosol particle components (e.g., black carbon, organic matter, K⁺, Na⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, H⁺, Cl⁻, H₂SO₄, , ). To date, the global-scale climate response of controlling emission of these constituents together has not been examined. Here 10-yr global simulations of the climate response of biomass-burning aerosols and short-lived gases are coupled with numerical calculations of the long-term effect of controlling biomass-burning CO₂ and CH₄ to estimate the net effect of controlling burning over 100 yr. Whereas eliminating biomass-burning particles is calculated to warm temperatures in the short term, this warming may be more than offset after several decades by cooling due to eliminating long-lived CO₂, particularly from permanent deforestation. It is also shown analytically that biomass burning always results in CO₂ accumulation, even when regrowth fluxes equal emission fluxes and in the presence of fertilization. Further, because burning grassland and cropland yearly, as opposed to every several years, increases CO₂, biofuel burning, considered a “renewable” energy source, is only partially renewable, and biomass burning elevates CO₂ until it is stopped.

As I have already stated, using the article as the basis (in other words responsive to the argument presented at hand), we have a city that has large hydro resources and large biomass sources. Even under this scenario, this city cannot get 100% renewable electricity as evident by the gas use at the co fired biomass facility, aligned with the fact that it is primarily using virgin wood, and not waste wood, to fire this facility. 
In the case of most, if not all USA cities, having access to even one baseload facility is a rarity. So no, most cities will not.

These whole trees are not just standing in their own forest, happily growing- they are among the other trees- the standard practise is to remove every other row, so as to allow the other trees room to grow. You can find neglected plantations in the UK, which have not been thinned and will see the whole forest suffers and the total mass of timber is greatly reduced.
And this plantation residue can be made into fibre board but generally there simply is not the market for it- left alone it will produce methane and CO2, creating the same issue- but no energy.

To add to that, we, on these volcanic energy threads, spend huge amounts of time arguing about electrical power generation whilst this is (stop me, I'm repeating myself!) only about 25% of power usage.
The difference might be simply ""Ok then, continue discussing energy but just add the fact that it needs to be increased by 400%"" As you say, a rapid nuclear build using seventies technology could be proposed as part of the solution. 
That solution as you say is subject to problems with the current nuclear climate: the questions of developing ""next generation cleaner cheaper"" solutions, which increase cost, and increase build times, as ably shown by Barthélémy which I keep on quoting., and as demonstrated by lack of a nuclear revival as predicted a decade or so ago. That paper might summarise nuclear development as ""la fuite en avant"", the forwards flight: chasing new solutions which are constantly over the horizon, because all those one catches up with have new problems which need new solutions which are .. over the horizon.

Now the city’s successful switch to 100% renewable electricity is spurring US mayors to fill the gaping void on climate change action left by the Trump administration.
Burlington didn’t make a fuss when it switched on a new hydropower plant in late 2014 and became the first US city to run entirely on clean power. “We didn’t have parades. I don’t know why in retrospect we didn’t make more of it,” says Miro Weinberger, the wire-haired mayor of Burlington.
The job of every elected official in this country changed the day Donald Trump was elected
The achievement has since been thrown into sharp relief by the election of Donald Trump, who has attempted to squash any sort of national response to climate change. The Paris climate agreement has been disavowed, policies to lower emissions from coal plants and vehicles have been wound back, adaption to the rising seas has been binned.
Amid this national crisis, dozens of US cities, states and businesses have strained to ameliorate the president’s agenda. More than 60 cities have now pledged to shift their electricity generation from fossil fuels to cleaner sources such as solar, wind and hydro. Burlington, a progressive bastion of 42,000 people an hour’s drive to the Canadian border, represents the vanguard.
“The job of every elected official in this country changed the day Donald Trump was elected,” says Weinberger, a liberal Democrat who has held the office since 2012. Weinberger drives an electric car – a Nissan Leaf – but is fresh from a bike ride when we meet. 
“It’s not acceptable that America has completely retreated from the climate change conversation,” he says. “I think leaders realised that we are going to have to make progress on this even when the federal government has checked out.”
Burlington keeps the lights on thanks to: the McNeil Generating Station, a hulking woodchip processor and furnace; a hydro plant situated next to an old wool factory that has its turbines spun by the Winooski River; a small array of wind turbines perched on nearby Georgia Mountain; and a bank of solar panels at Burlington airport. 
The city managed the transition to fossil fuel-free electricity within just a decade, but the roots of its transformation go back further. A coal plant that now lies derelict was shuttered in 1986 amid local concerns over pollution and its reputation as an eyesore on the shoreline of Lake Champlain. 
The McNeil plant was opened two years before – a plaque marking the occasion bears the name of one Bernard Sanders, the then mayor. It has since carried much of the burden, supplying around half of Burlington’s electricity needs by burning around 400,000 tonnes of waste wood a year that’s purchased from businesses in the region. 
Burlingtonians also bring their own unwanted crates, pallets and tree branches to the plant, where they are diced, stored in huge piles of woodchips, placed on conveyor belts and fed into a Hades-like furnace that reaches around 2,000C. The resulting steam turns a huge turbine that generates the electricity. 
“We have to shift the woodchip piles around so they don’t get overheated and self combust,” says Dave MacDonnell, power generation manager of the plant. “There was a small fire on one of the piles when we first opened. That was a PR nightmare.”
The path to 100% renewable energy was smoothed by an engaged, progressive populace concerned about diminishing snow on nearby ski runs and heatwaves triggering algal blooms on Lake Champlain. Crucially, the city owns the local utility – the Burlington Electric Department, whose logo looks like it belongs on a 1950s-themed diner – and has managed to keep rates steady over the past decade for bill-payers.
The city council began to shift to reflect a progressive point of view and they brought along the private sector
“Bernie started getting more people involved and out of the woodwork came ideas,” says Will Raap, who moved to Burlington from California in the 1980s and set up a not-for-profit organization that facilitates local food growing. 
“The city council began to shift to reflect a progressive point of view and they brought along the private sector. Now Burlington is the most sustainable city around and the national government has got its head up its butt. Cities are where it is happening.”
Other, larger cities are also looking to push ahead. Last year Atlanta became the largest city in the south to pledge 100% renewable energy by 2035. San Francisco hopes to achieve this feat five years before that. The skiing playground of Aspen, Colorado, has already got there.
Some Republican-led cities such as San Diego have also thrown their weight behind the goal. Carmel, in Indiana, has installed 116 roundabouts, a rarity in the US, in recent years in order to improve safety and also cut emissions from cars idling at traffic light intersections.
“We had to have a lot of public education at the start – some people complained,” says James Brainard, a Republican who has been Carmel’s mayor since 1996. “But now people are proud and we have fights over where we are going to have the next one. Climate is a big part of that.”
Cities can make major progress in cutting emissions, according to Stanford academic Mark Jacobson, who has devised a roadmap for US cities to go 100% renewable. “The only obstacle really is knowledge,” he says,. But even if the political will and resources are there, the contours of ambition are still influenced by states and the federal government.
Recent research suggests the US is struggling to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the level it promised in the Paris agreement, at precisely a time when it and other countries would have to accelerate cuts in order to avoid punishing sea level rises, storms, heatwaves and societal unrest. Cities can only do so much to quicken the pace. 
“When you can only set policy within a 15 sq mile area, it’s much harder to move the needle,” says Weinberger. 
“It takes leadership and political will in thousands of jurisdictions when the federal government isn’t doing its job. It can be frustrating but I think it’s still worth doing. It’s a lot better than doing nothing.”
In Burlington, the next stage of the masterplan to become fully carbon-free is to electrify its transport, a trickier proposition as the city doesn’t fully control this area. The regional transport authority will run four electric buses by the end of the year, while the city is offering rebates of up to $1,800 (£1,363) for anyone wishing to buy an electric car. So far, 44 residents have done so.
“The irony is for many years we were inviting people to leave the grid because it wasn’t clean,” says Jennifer Green, Burlington’s sustainability chief. “Now that it’s clean we want people back.”

On average, a person in China consumes less than half of the emissions of a person in the US (7.2 tonnes per capita annually compared with 16.5 tonnes). So why all the finger-wagging at China? There’s a blatant mistake recurring in carbon politics. Yes, as a nation, China emits the most carbon dioxide, but an astronomical volume of these emissions are to manufacture our goods in the west. Is it fair to maintain a voracious level of consumption in the US and UK while blaming China for producing the goods that we’re consuming? Don’t look at emissions in isolation. Look at them in tandem with consumption, and then we’ll see where to place the burden of blame. Also, China’s investments in renewables have caused the costs to plummet, from which the entire world can now benefit. China invests more than $100bn in domestic renewables every year – more than twice the level of the US, and more than the US and the EU combined.Marcus NieldClimate Change Adaptation Unit, UN Environment, Nairobi, Kenya
• Your article (23 July) accurately sums up the excellent work done by the Global Footprint Network regarding our depletion of the planet’s ability to support us. What, unlike GFN themselves, the article did not acknowledge is that the number of people consuming those resources is a critical, if not the critical, driver of the unfolding crisis. In 1970, our global population was less than half of the 7.6 billion we have presently. In 1970, Earth Overshoot Day fell on the 29 December: in 2018, on 1 August. Can anyone credibly claim that those two changes are not linked?
Population is a solvable problem – family planning, lifting people out of poverty, education, empowering women and challenging cultural norms opposing small family size are vital, positive mechanisms to bring our human footprint back in line with with what our only home can sustainably provide.

There ere contingency supply plans arranged for the three-day week and fuel crisis;we now have government ministers planning the same in case of a no-deal Brexit,which is not universally popular in a divided referendum vote which narrowly voted for leave,and is as much a national humiliation and disgrace now as it was over four decades ago.Neoliberalism is now straining at the edges,with Labour and not the Tories this time offering a clear alternative as Thatcher did then,with Corbyn actually offering Nordic-style social democracy on Keynesian lines as Attlee did after the war in 1945,although the far-right press and Brextremist Tory MP's inevitably will compare it to Marxism or worse,as their ideology has become so extreme as even moderate Conservatives are berated and abused viciously in the press as virtual socialist dogmatists.

in order to prevent massive inflation as the natural consequence of printing a load of pocket money you have to have huge tax rates to rake it all back in again.
BQEND
The limitation is always the availability of real resources, not fiat money. The Weimar hyperinflation was the result of a catastrophic collapse in productive capacity due to the war and a vast foreign currency debt obligation also due to war reparations. There was little availability of real goods & services to purchase with the newly created Mark currency and so hyperinflation followed. (Ditto for Zimbabwe).
Neither of these factors apply to a developed economy in peace time (e.g. Britain) which is a monopoly fiat currency issuer and so has no need to rack up foreign currency debt obligations. These nations are also economic entities with massive productive capacity and more capacity lying idle (e.g labour) which can be easily activated if the necessary money was made available. The mainstream narrative uses Weimar, Zimbabwe, Venezuela etc. as the economic equivalent of the bogeyman used to scare bold children up to bed.
There is no simple cause and effect relationship between monetary expansion and inflation or Fx depreciation. Damaging levels of inflation will only occur when there is chronic excess demand relative to the real capacity of the economy to produce output or import to meet that demand. This is rarely a concern in a modern economy which produces or can import an excess of virtually all essential goods & services relative to demand. In other words there is no inflation risk in the creation of new money once there is sufficient real wealth of goods and services and productive capacity to absorb the demand that the additional money will stimulate as clearly borne out in the data: “Based on our examination of countries that together constitute 91 percent of world GDP, we suggest that high inflation has infrequently followed rapid money supply growth, and in contrast to this, high inflation has occurred often when it has not been preceded by rapid money supply growth”
http://evonomics.com/moneysupply/
In fact most of the monetary expansion is now the result of commercial bank lending rather than via currency issuing governments. While the commercial banks have no role in controlling inflation or Fx rates. Each new loan creates new money in the form of a bank deposit. Since the 1980s the global money supply across all the major currencies has increased almost exponentially as the deregulated commercial banks massively increased their loan books and expanded the money supply (The money is extinguished as the loans are repaid but at a much slower pace). And yet there has been no hyperinflation that the monetarists continually hyperventilate about.
http://positivemoney.org/how-money-works/how-much-money-have-banks-created/
You see the capitalist elite have no issue with vast levels of money creation once its purpose is to enrich the financial sector through commercial bank lending to fuel property bubbles or via QE for example or to protect the 1% in the colossal bailout of the delinquent banking sector in 2008 or even to engage in illegal wars in Iraq. But money creation to serve the interests of the majority such as properly funding the NHS, social housing, transport systems or cladding tall buildings in fireproof panels is considered to be economic heresy.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1532525488000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'war reparations', u'effect': u'the weimar hyperinflation was the result of a catastrophic collapse in productive capacity due to the war and a vast foreign currency debt obligation also'}, {u'cause': u'the war and a vast foreign currency debt obligation', u'effect': u'a catastrophic collapse in productive capacity'}], u'author_id': u'17748976', u'in_reply_to': u'118708589', u'id': u'118709735', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Stu365', u'text': u'So you're saying that in the 70s tattoos weren't fashionable, food was more scarce, and mobile phones for the mass consumer hadn't been invented yet?

During the spring and early summer, as the sun began to hammer down and the usual rain failed to fall, and the reservoirs began to shrink, the pound was lurching downwards on the markets. For almost three years, under Tory and Labour governments, the economy had been shrivelling alarmingly. Just as since the Brexit vote, a conviction had been building like a thundercloud among financial traders and business leaders, economists and commentators, in Britain and beyond, that the country was about to slip to a lower, less elite level, and stay there. “Goodbye, Great Britain,” said a much-read editorial in the Wall Street Journal in 1975, “it was nice knowing you.”
If you remember the British summer of 1976 we'd like to hear from you. What do you remember? How does it compare to this year?

To some pessimists about Britain’s prospects, the drought the following summer, which brought forest fires, crop failures, hosepipe bans enforced by policemen and vigilantes, and standpipes on street corners instead of mains water, was a further sign of crisis. In 1976, with impeccable timing, the American writer Paul Theroux published The Family Arsenal, a bleakly satirical novel about terrorists on the loose in a sweaty, rundown mid-70s London, its “decay pushing towards ruin”. Some sort of apocalypse, predicted one of the characters, was “certainly coming”.
But the Labour chancellor, Denis Healey, was not one of the worriers. In the summer of 1976, after several exhausting months trying to defend his economic policies and the value of the pound, he went on holiday for most of August. He left sticky London behind and drove unhurriedly through England and Wales and up to north-west Scotland. “Not a drop of rain,” he wrote in his memoirs, “even in the Highlands.” In the hidden away lochside town of Ullapool, Healey checked into a hotel on the quayside and began to relax.
That night, he was repeatedly woken by phone calls from Whitehall. In the US currency markets, the pound was collapsing again. The hotel had only one phone, so the chancellor stood in a hallway with a coat over his pyjamas, authorising the Bank of England to spend “up to $150m” (about £750m now) to buy sterling. The intervention worked: the pound stopped falling. Healey went back to bed, and then continued with his holiday.
Hot weather does contradictory things to British politics. In parliament, with its stuffy rooms and sweaty dress codes, it traditionally sparks revolts, plots, panics and flashes of temper – a sense that things are coming to a head – as it has this summer. Yet away from Westminster, a heatwave can make politicians, and even more so voters, worry less than usual about the state of the nation. In an overcast country, sunshine often means contentment and escapism – and procrastination. During July and August 1976, despite the state of the economy and a widespread disillusionment with centre-left politics (which had been deepening since the late 60s), the Labour government pulled level with the Conservatives in the polls. Healey was generally seen as a tough, capable chancellor. The prime minister, Jim Callaghan, had an avuncular, calming manner that seemed appropriate to the summer lull. Voters called him Sunny Jim.
Theresa May has none of Callaghan’s sly charm. But her situation this summer is similar in some ways. As in 1976, a divided government in a weak parliamentary position, wedded to increasingly contested ideas – for Callaghan, postwar social democracy, for May, austerity and the free market – has somehow made it to the welcome shade of the recess, despite many predictions to the contrary. The main opposition party remains ominously strong, but it has an intensely divisive leader whom many voters see as odd and extremist: in this sense, Margaret Thatcher was the Jeremy Corbyn of the mid-70s.
And, just as Callaghan did, May has managed to put off the most difficult political question of her government until the autumn. In 1976, this was whether Britain could afford to continue with its postwar levels of state spending; now it is how to do Brexit. Yet during what might be a once-in-a-generation summer – as the sun keeps shining, day after day, and the parks are full of impromptu skivers, the pubs are full of workers having cheeky afternoon lagers, and even supposedly earnest protest marches feel more like carnivals – such national dilemmas can feel very distant.
In the summer of 1976, the sense of ease was not a total delusion. Twenty-eight years later, the respected New Economics Foundation created a measure for overall economic, social and environmental wellbeing, and concluded that 1976 was the best year in modern British history.
In late August the heatwave finally disintegrated in a mess of thunderstorms. A soaking, grey autumn followed
For those invested in the idea that the 70s were a nadir for Britain – pro-Thatcher historians, and hipper archivists of the punk rebellion against the mid-70s status quo – the summer of 1976 has always been an awkward piece of counter-evidence. Yet as Jon Savage pointed out in his 1991 book England’s Dreaming, still the best, most nuanced study of punk and its political and social context, the heatwave actually helped the movement. After dark, the rare warmth gave the first British punks a sense of possibility, and a freedom, as they roamed between squats and nightclubs. In a normal British summer, it would have been hard to stay out all night in punk outfits full of holes.
The summer of 2018 feels less carefree. We know more about climate change and skin cancer now. This week, forecast to be the hottest of the season, the Met Office is advising people to stay out of the sun. And the world beyond Britain feels more genuinely apocalyptic, and harder to ignore. We face Trump and a Europe increasingly controlled by far-right populists; in the summer of 1976, the continent was dominated by centrists, and the insurgent shaking up US politics was a mild, almost meek Democrat, Jimmy Carter. Even the cold war seemed to be abating, thanks to the disarmament treaties and subtle diplomacy of detente.
But we shouldn’t idealise the summer of 1976 too much. Away from its unexpected pleasures, pressures were still building in Britain. In August the guitarist Eric Clapton near the peak of his fame, used a concert in Birmingham to make a speech defending the anti-immigrant prejudices of Enoch Powell. At the end of the month, the Notting Hill carnival in London turned into a battle between the police and black youths, a prefiguring of the many riots in the decade to come.
Also in late August the heatwave finally disintegrated in a mess of thunderstorms. A soaking, grey autumn followed. The pound resumed its decline, the government’s finances deteriorated further, Whitehall panicked – or, some say, exploited the situation – and the government ended up drastically cutting its spending, and accepting a loan from the IMF. The reputations of Healey and Callaghan, their government, and postwar social democracy, never quite recovered.
Once the summer interlude of 1976 was over, Britain changed very fast – and in many ways not for the good. Perhaps that’s something for Theresa May, and the rest of us, to ponder while we enjoy the sun.

My only problem here is that you have clipped a single thread from a complex scientific fabric. In the context of a clipped fragment without the associated scientific qualifiers, sure this represents a strong scientific consensus. As long as the intent is to discuss just this statement, fine. If however the intent is to clip this thread to support a faith-based belief system, then it is not scientifically valid to use just this one fragment for this purpose.
EXAMPLE: Water vapor is a more powerful greenhouse gas than is CO2. The cited source takes this into account of course but the single thread snipped from this valid scientific work does not.

So, for years I thought I had climate change figured out. I had read the books and articles, and watched the documentaries and videos.
However, I still had my reservations
1) Historically, the bulk of warming seems to have been driven by methane. So why are we so concerned about CO2? 
2) In the past, we have had up to 4000ppm carbon dioxide. So why should we care if it goes up another 280ppm, or even triples?
Basically, after reading James Hansens book 'Storms of our Grandchildren', I was able to put the pieces together. 
Carbon dioxide is the trigger for methane releases, which really cause the most damage. Methane is released from thawing permafrost, and ice within the ocean.
The reason we had higher levels of CO2 in the past is that the sun will die in 7.6 billion years. Many of the extinction events in Earths history happened 100s if not thousands of millions of years ago. This means that the sun was about 1-2% dimmer. The cumulative effect of 1-2% of suns energy on the planet is profound.
The planet has been very, very good at maintaining an atmospheric balance of elements such that temperatures rarely reach life-threatening extremes. This is because things have happened over geological timescales in the past, and life has found a way to fill in the gaps and if not correct itself, to bring the planet back from one extreme or another.
Unfortunately, things are happening much faster now.

The ruling required the government to immediately take more effective action on climate change. 
The case, which was brought on behalf of 886 Dutch citizens, made climate change a major political and social issue in the Netherlands and transformed domestic climate change policy. It inspired climate change cases in Belgium, New Zealand, Ireland, the UK, Switzerland and the US.

The UK has one of the best records of decarbonising Electricity generation of any country in the world
BQEND
Much of that was achieved by switching from coal to gas. To make the next step it needs to replace gas by renewable sources but unfortunately it seems intent on doing the opposite. It is supporting fracking of all things which will open up a new source of fossil fuel that, in practice, is little better than coal. Methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas so, although burning methane produces less CO2 than burning coal,any leakage of methane from the fracking sites will quickly cancel out any benefits. It also means that gas fired power stations will remain in operation for far longer.
We should instead be increasing the rate we deploy wind farms, solar generation and HVDC interconnector links to other countries. We have so much potential for renewable energy generation we could once again become a net exporter of energy if we so choose.

BQEND
No, I identify the Climate Change deniers as idiots. When you look across the spectrum of climate change deniers they overwhelmingly have other Right Wing views. Show me a climate change denier and I will show you someone who is more likely to vote for a right wing party.
Here we get to the crux of the matter. These people are more likely to be anti Global Warming because it contradicts their ideology. Anyone who is willing to forgo science for an ideology deserves ridicule and obviously lacks any kind objectivity. Anyone will to defend and vote with such people are putting our collective futures at risk. As I said before, this subject is far too important to be left in the hands of a Left/Right debate. The fact that the Right Wing press have been successful in reducing this to a Left wing debate is rather depressing, though not surprising. Normally, when the powerful try to supress science for ideology, the results are fairly benign. It does matter to your average farmer cares a jot whether the Sun goes around the Earth or vice versa. Denying the link to smoking and cancer is far more serious and Climate Change is the grand daddy. I wonder how much money the Tory Party have received in donations from deniers?
I will give you the benefit of the doubt by suggesting you have been duped into believing this idea that that the Left are equally culpable in turning this into a Left or Right debate, when clearly that process has been a one way street, especially in America. However, no problem can be solved until we fully understand the enormity of the task. There is a solid group of politically motivated people who seek to prevent and frustrate action on Climate Change. We need to recognise that. There is little point in trying to educate people who are ideologically opposed to the actions required to rectify the problem.
The thing is. Climate change is an easy one. The science points one way, the scientists are united and the implications of failure are profound. Yet the Right have contrived to get this wrong.

...you have not indicated that overpopulation of the planet by human beings is the root cause.
BQEND
That's because it isn't the root cause. Consider these facts about the global population:- 10% of the world's population live in extreme poverty, defined as existing on £1.90 or less (approx 700 million people)- Approximately 40% of the global population (3 billion people) live on less than $2.50 a day
So one might ask a simple question; for people living on so little, who cannot afford heat, aircon, clean water, sanitation, health care or education, how much fossil fuel do you think they are burning, directly (as in cars they don't have) or indirectly, as in grid-level electricity supplies, which they also don't have.
To consider the same issue another way, bear in mind that 10% of the world's population output 50% of all greenhouse gases, while 50% are responsible for 95% of all emissions. The other half of the world's population emit only 5% of all GHGs, so blaming population growth for exascerbating climate change is both ill-informed, and very misleading. 
It is also very convenient for people in developed countries to blame overpopulation, since virtually all population growth above 2% per annum (58 countries) is occurring in developing nations, with African nations predominating. (Source: World Bank).
The claim that population growth is the principle cause of climate change is also to suggest it's a problem that someone else - usually with a different skin colour - have to sort out, because us 'educated' people are not having so many babies.', u'recommendation_count': u'11', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1532847759000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u""it is n't the root cause"", u'effect': u""that 's""}, {u'cause': u'us educated people are not having so many babies', u'effect': u'that someone else have to sort out'}], u'author_id': u'2947466', u'in_reply_to': u'118843164', u'id': u'118850319', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'DennisHorne', u'text': u'Widespread heatwaves and fires.

This one sentence exposes everything.
Because here, in this one sentence, you incorrectly suggested that the Conservative party has a problem with climate change science, when in fact, the overwhelming majority of the party accepts climate change as a real issue.
And this is exactly what my point is (the point which hasn't clicked with you yet).
You incorrectly identified the conservatives as a climate change-denial party because they are right wing. You're supposed to identify whether someone is left or right based on their policies, not identify their policies based on whether they are right or left. Don't put the cart before the horse!

It's more common among the left wing than it should be, and it's an example of science denial being motivated by political beliefs.

Those who absolutely despise the idea of mothers being with their children at all are going to play down the benefits of breast-feeding.

Authorities in Greece are dealing with the aftermath of devastating wildfires that killed at least 85 people, while efforts to control blazes in Sweden and in California continue. In Japan, 23,000 people have been taken to hospital in the past week and the weather described by officials as a “disaster”. In Algeria, a new African record has been set of 51.3C.
Weather systems are highly complex and scientists are cautious about assigning specific causes to one-off events. But experts are already pointing to global warming as a driver for the current heatwave, with a study based on computer models and temperature data due to be published by scientists at Oxford University on Friday. Meanwhile, a new report from the environmental audit committee points to the likelihood of more frequent heatwaves in future, and the UK government’s failure to prepare adequately for them.
There’s nothing wrong with enjoying the heatwave, as many people are. Such a long spell of warm weather is extraordinary and, for sun lovers, a treat. No doubt many are hoping it doesn’t break before they take their holidays. But whether or not any more records are broken, or wildfires ignited in the coming weeks, the claim that rising temperatures have nothing to do with the global state of extreme weather must not go unchallenged.
When the former US environment secretary Scott Pruitt was asked about climate change following Hurricane Harvey last year, he said that it was not the right time to talk about it. The opposite case is that the aftermath of an extreme event, when the atmospheric conditions have become the news, rather than the backdrop to the news, can be a “teachable moment”, when different kinds of conversations become possible.
One of those conversations is the one about adaptation. Since some effects of climate change are now inevitable, we must deal with them. As this week’s committee report says, building regulations must be altered to ensure heat resilience, and new measures must be brought in to improve drainage and water efficiency.
The public information campaign that the committee calls for is even more urgent. The 2008 Climate Change Act commits the UK government to reducing emissions by 80% of their 1990 levels by 2050. The latest British Social Attitudes survey showed that more than 90% of British people accept that climate change is happening. But only around a quarter describe themselves as very worried about this. Politicians, along with journalists, scientists and others, have a responsibility to make sure that people know what to expect and can make informed decisions – for example, about how to heat and insulate their own homes.
Treating the symptoms of climate change makes no sense if the causes are not tackled at the same time. British laws – as well as the Paris agreement – commit the UK government to doing this, meaning decarbonisation of the electricity supply, heating and transport. These measures have cross-party support, but commitment by politicians is inconsistent. Just a few weeks ago, parliament approved a new runway at Heathrow, a decision that now faces a legal challenge. This week, the government gave approval for fracking in Lancashire, enraging all those who fear that this is proof – combined with slashed solar subsidies, the de facto ban on new onshore wind farms, and the rejection of the Swansea bay tidal scheme – that the government is unenthusiastic about renewables.
Enjoy the sun if you can. We only live once and in countries with temperate climates such as the UK not all of the effects of climate change are necessarily harmful. Domestic tourism could even benefit. But don’t lose sight of the suffering caused by higher temperatures. In all our hands rests the future of life on earth.

Climate change has long been predicted to increase extreme weather incidents, and scientists are now confident these predictions are coming true. Scientists say the global warming has contributed to the scorching temperatures that have baked the UK and northern Europe for weeks.
The hot spell was made more than twice as likely by climate change, a new analysis found, demonstrating an “unambiguous” link. 
Extreme weather has struck across Europe, from the Arctic Circle to Greece, and across the world, from North America to Japan. “This is the face of climate change,” said Prof Michael Mann, at Penn State University, and one the world’s most eminent climate scientists. “We literally would not have seen these extremes in the absence of climate change.”
“The impacts of climate change are no longer subtle,” he told the Guardian. “We are seeing them play out in real time and what is happening this summer is a perfect example of that.”
“We are seeing our predictions come true,” he said. “As a scientist that is reassuring, but as a citizen of planet Earth, it is very distressing to see that as it means we have not taken the necessary action.”
The rapid scientific assessment of the northern European heatwave was done by Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and also colleagues in the World Weather Attribution (WWA) consortium. “We can see the fingerprints of climate change on local extremes,” he said.
The current heatwave has been caused by an extraordinary stalling of the jet stream wind, which usually funnels cool Atlantic weather over the continent. This has left hot, dry air in place for two months – far longer than usual. The stalling of the northern hemisphere jet stream is being increasingly firmly linked to global warming, in particular to the rapid heating of the Arctic and resulting loss of sea ice.
Prof Mann said that asking if climate change “causes” specific events is the wrong question: “The relevant question is: ‘Is climate change impacting these events and making them more extreme?’, and we can say with great confidence that it is.”
Mann points out that the link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer is a statistical one, which does not prove every cancer was caused by smoking, but epidemiologists know that smoking greatly increases the risk. “That is enough to say that, for all practical purposes, there is a causal connection between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer and it is the same with climate change,” Mann said.
Other senior scientists agree the link is clear. Serious climate change is “unfolding before our eyes”, said Prof Rowan Sutton, at the University of Reading. “No one should be in the slightest surprised that we are seeing very serious heatwaves and associated impacts in many parts of the world.”
It is not too late to make the significant cuts needed in greenhouse gas emissions, said Mann, because the impacts progressively worsen as global warming increases. 
“It is not going off a cliff, it is like walking out into a minefield,” he said. “So the argument it is too late to do something would be like saying: ‘I’m just going to keep walking’. That would be absurd – you reverse course and get off that minefield as quick as you can. It is really a question of how bad it is going to get.”

A more cynical view is that politicians only want to focus on decisions that have a quick payback for them, preferably within their own term of office, or within a 5 year time frame.
Global warming does not fit with this short termi view, raising the very serious question about whether democratic structures can really deliver with the urgency we need?

It's a real shame because the basic physics of CO2 as a greenhouse were twice and independently confirmed in the late 19th C and reconfirmed twice again in the early to mid 1900s. It's not like we haven't been warned. It was in 1986 that Hansen gave his now famous address to Congress and spoke of 99.9% confidence that the global climate was changing, that it was largely due to CO2, with other GHG, and almost entirely due to human activity. To this we can qualify this as 'human economic activity'.
This is clearly stated in the recent permissions granted for fracking in Lancs. Not only does it promote the use of gas (a fossil fuel), it also uses up humungous volumes of water, discharges chemical toxins into the local area, and is a practice that has been associated with earthquakes.
There are as many (potential) solutions as there are people, especially those living in the industrialised world and generate the largest collective footprint of the global population. Many of these will need to be driven by leaders (so that wouldn't include the current administration in either the UK nor the US), and the media have a role to play too. Perhaps even challenging politicians lack of action; perhaps challenging corporate practices that makes it cheaper to pay the fine than it is to limit the practice even though the impacts on the local and wider areas may last for decades with unknown human suffering. Perhaps, using 'nudge theory', the barriers to full-scale roll out of an integrated strategy can be removed, and to invest in a national green engineering and infrastructure project ... making the UK be newsworthy for reasons about which we can be proud, rather than embarrassed on the world stage.
Will it happen? I sure hope so, but I think that humans are not well attuned to perceiving slow moving (temporal distance) and supra-scale changes, and therefore are not likely to respond meaningfully to AGW and CC until it is right on our doorstep - even while it is happening elsewhere, these changes are still distant from our perspective, because we are not used to thinking in terms of systems, scales and speeds. For many politicians, corporate leaders, and the popular media (who are the levers of potential change at the scale required), AGW and CC are still spoken about in terms of ""belief"", as if there is something that we are having faith, that is a matter of belief rather than a physical experiment that demonstrates the same outcome reliably over and again: CO2 is a greenhouse gas of significant influence.
Nor is it a belief insofar as it is actually happening? How did people think CC was going to happen? It will, and already has begun to change the weather patterns towards what has been anticipated in various scenarios modelled by a host of scientists, reported in academic and policy papers since the early 1990s, at least. Of course, the climate has always changed. In itself, that's not the point. What is the crux of the concern is the speed or rate of change. In human lifespan terms, it may not seem immediate, or critical, but in planetary times, this is happening fast!

It implies that if we had an effect one way, then it must be possible for us to have the reverse effect. Hence we can manipulate everything the way we want it. Dream on.
BQEND
Of course it doesn’t. To reverse the effects of global warming requires negative emissions technologies, of which BECCS is the only feasible technology which requires vast amounts of land to be dedicated to growing biofuels and copious storage for the sequestered carbon and places a burden on generations to come for thousands of years to maintain that sequester carbon. Reversing the global warming we have already caused is completely unviable - but it is physically possible.
As it is, integrated assessment modelling (IAMs) suggests that NETs are required for any reasonable attempt at keeping below 2degC, so keeping to the Paris accord will require us to do “the reverse effect” anyway. If not - an given the current INDCs countries supplied to Paris, we are on course for a global temperature rise of ~3degC - uncomfortable close to the figure of 4C which is widely viewed as “incompatible with a global human civilisation”.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1532859959000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'we', u'effect': None}], u'author_id': u'3791246', u'in_reply_to': u'118859771', u'id': u'118860723', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'UtterTosh', u'text': u'Heatwave in Japan = good too apparently... 20,000 people admitted to hospital.... https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/24/unprecedented-japan-heatwave-kills-65-people-week', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1532859938000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'3578538', u'in_reply_to': u'118856492', u'id': u'118860703', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'bassireland', u'text': u'Your evidence for the apocalyptic 10-15-20 year timescale please.

So just when you really need cooling air, you can’t have it. One to be filed under: you couldn’t make it up.
This is not uncommon. The offices, factories, homes, roads and railways of Britain were designed on the assumption that it is a country of blessedly temperate conditions, immune to extremes of heat and cold. When people say that Britain is not built to withstand a sizzling summer, this is more literally true than they may know.
We can avoid thinking about what this intense heatwave could mean for the future of the planet by taking careless refuge in the consolation that others are having it much worse. The devastating wildfires in Greece have killed at least 87 people and ignited national fury about the state’s inadequate response. Japan has declared a national disaster after more than 20,000 people were taken to hospital in a week. Algeria has reported the highest temperature ever reliably recorded in Africa: 51.3C. That’s hot. Forests are blazing within the Arctic Circle. That’s not usual.
Scientists tell us to expect weird weather to become more familiar. The fiery conditions we have seen this summer are the result of the jet stream stalling, an effect caused when the poles heat up more than the equator does. There is further broad and deep scientific consensus that climate change is at the heart of it. The jet stream has been hinky in the past. The consequences are more severe this time because global warming has raised baseline global temperatures.
This is a glimpse into a frazzled future, a warning every inhabitant of the third rock from the sun would be wise to heed. Extreme weather events – ferocious heatwaves, epic floods and violent storms – are going to happen with increasing frequency. The most catastrophic consequences will be felt by other, often much poorer countries, but Britain won’t be unscathed. You can’t run from climate change and you can’t hide. Not absent the ability to get to another planet suitable for human life. The question then becomes a political one: what, if anything, are we going to do about it?
There is a school of thought that contends that politics is fundamentally incapable of addressing this challenge. It is just too overwhelming for politicians and electorates to handle. The problem is so complex and so global that it induces fatalism in the leaders and the led. I find this view to be self-defeating and self-harming. There are things that governments can do and they have even managed to achieve some of them. There are now days when Britain meets all its energy needs without burning any coal, something that hasn’t happened since before the Industrial Revolution and a development that would have astonished earlier generations. We produced more electricity from renewable and nuclear energy in 2017 than from gas and coal, making it the first year that low-carbon resources met most of the country’s demand for power. 
That is a legacy of good decisions made by earlier governments. This is progress. It is not sufficient progress, but it does demonstrate that there are things that can be done to mitigate climate change and there are smarter responses to this threat than burying your overheated head in your sweaty hands.
Political engagement has fluxed depending upon who is in charge, how much pressure there is from the public and what else is happening. It was on the agenda of Labour governments after 1997. David Cameron then positioned the Tories as a party that liked the planet. He once campaigned with the slogan “vote blue, go green”, which rather gave away that rebranding his party was his primary motive. More voters and opinion-shapers have become engaged. Witness the pressure to do something about plastics. Michael Gove’s positive response can be welcomed, even while recognising that the greening of Gove is another attempt at a rebranding, in this case of himself.
The past decade has seen a compelling accumulation of frightening data about what is happening to the planet, but the world and its politicians have been distracted by other threats that seemed more immediately menacing, especially the financial crash of 2008 and subsequent austerity. George Osborne, who was blue but never green as chancellor, strangled the budget for developing carbon capture and storage. Theresa May has never been animated enough by climate change to make a major speech about it. Her government recently scrapped the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon power scheme, dashing hopes that Britain could lead development of a new source of renewable energy. Scrubbing a planet-friendly project followed the decision to press ahead with Heathrow expansion.
The international picture has deteriorated. Global warming has been crowded out as a subject energising international leadership and the push to tackle the danger has lost momentum. The Paris climate agreement signed in 2016 was supposed to commit more than 170 countries to measures to hold the increase in the global average temperature to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels. What it lacks is any mechanism for holding the signatories to their promises and not one of the major industrialised nations has published a full and plausible strategy for meeting their targets. A growing number of the scientists of climate change fear that global warming is going to be in excess of 2C. Donald Trump, who dismisses climate change as a hoax made up by the Chinese to hurt US industry, has ripped up the commitments made by his predecessor. American withdrawal is a double disaster. The Paris agreement is much less of one without the signature of the world’s most profligate emitter of greenhouse gases. Absent a commitment from the US, other countries are likely to feel less incentive to make good on their pledges and less shame when they break them.
This disappointing international picture is something to lament, but not an excuse for Britain to do nothing. We live on a windy island inhabited by a lot of clever people and surrounded by a lot of sea. With the right levels of public investment and well-targeted incentives for the private sector, this country could be a world leader in tidal and wave power.
There are changes that will be simply forced on Britain as the heating planet has an increasing impact on the way we live and work. MPs on the environmental audit committee have just offered some useful, if largely remedial, suggestions. These include making buildings and transport systems more heat-resilient and using water more efficiently. Such recommendations are, of course, measures to relieve the symptoms of global warming. They do not address the causes.
Stronger action will require politicians ready to drive global warming up the agenda, lead public opinion and take bold decisions, many of which will be tough and some of which will not be popular with everyone. This politicians will do only if they genuinely care about climate change or are made to care because a critical mass of their voters tell them that they want something done. The most recent British Social Attitudes survey reports that more than 90% of Britons agree that climate change is a fact, but the rub is that only around a quarter describe themselves as very worried about it and only a minority feel a responsibility to reduce it. Climate change struggles to get into the top 10 of issues that voters tell pollsters that they are most bothered about and almost never reaches the top three. This means that, while most Britons appreciate that there is a threat, not enough grasp its scale or think that it ought to be a serious priority for the government.
That could change. It certainly ought to change and is more likely to change as extreme events become a more regular occurrence. Britons have been accustomed to the weather forecast coming after the news. For most of us, for most of the time, the only information we required was whether we needed to take a brolly with us. Britons may adjust their attitudes and demand a lot more leadership and action from their politicians, when the weather leads the news.

The last time scientists set foot on France’s remote Île aux Cochons – roughly half way between the tip of Africa and Antarctica – the island was blanketed by 2m of the penguins, which stand about a metre tall. 
But recent satellite images and photos taken from helicopters show the population has collapsed, with barely 200,000 remaining, according to a study published in Antarctic Science.
Why the colony on Île aux Cochons has been so decimated remains a mystery.
“It is completely unexpected, and particularly significant since this colony represented nearly one third of the king penguins in the world,” said lead author Henri Weimerskirch, an ecologist at the Centre for Biological Studies in Chize, France, who first set eyes on the colony in 1982.
Climate change may play a role. In 1997, a particularly strong El Niño weather event warmed the southern Indian Ocean, temporarily pushing the fish and squid on which king penguins depend south, beyond their foraging range.
“This resulted in population decline and poor breeding success for all the king penguin colonies in the region,” Weimerskirch said.
El Niño events are cyclical events that occur every two to seven years, but they can be amplified by global warming, which itself produces many of the same results, albeit on a longer timescale. 
Indeed, Weimerskirch and colleagues showed in an earlier study that climate change, on its current trajectory, will probably make the Crozet islands – the archipelago that contains Île aux Cochons – unviable for king penguins by mid-century.
Migration is not an option because there are no other suitable islands within striking range.
Other factors may be contributing to the decline of the Île aux Cochons colony, including overcrowding. “The larger the population, the fiercer the competition between individuals,” noted a statement from France’s National Centre for Scientific Research, which funded the study. “The repercussions of lack of food are thus amplified and can trigger an unprecedented rapid and drastic drop in numbers.”
But this so-called “density-dependent effect” can also be made worse by climate change, the study notes.
Another possible culprit is avian cholera, which has affected seabirds on nearby Marion and Amsterdam Islands, including some king penguins. But until Weimerskirch and other researchers return to Île aux Cochons – hopefully, he said, in early 2019 – they won’t know for sure.
It is also possible that invasive species such as rats, mice or cats, have found their way on to the island. The Red List of Threatened Species conservation status for king penguins is currently “least concern,” but the new data may prompt a reevaluation.
King penguins are the second-largest penguin species after the Emperor. They do not make a nest, but rather lay one egg at a time and carry it around on their feet covered with a flap of abdominal skin, called a brood patch. Parents take turns incubating the egg, switching every couple of weeks over a two-month period.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/30/worlds-largest-king-penguin-colony-has-declined-by-90

Lack of the expected steady rainfall in the winter months meant groundwater sources failed to recharge and left vegetation unable to recover fully from the high temperatures of the 2017 summer. As a result, when temperatures topping 40C hit some areas during this summer’s heatwave and drought, the conditions were already in place for wildfires to take hold.
Strong winds then fanned the flames and spread the fires widely before stretched fire-fighting teams could gain control. The fact that the fires took hold on land close to densely inhabited and resort areas was largely a matter of chance, but one that led to a death toll of more than 70 people and wrought devastation on homes.
These are widely regarded as the short-term causes of the fires, but experts are also concerned that the conditions experienced in Greece in the last two years are likely to be replicated more often in future, owing to the changing climate.
Nikos Charalambides, executive director of Greenpeace Greece, said: “As the death toll rises and the full size of the disaster is still to be recorded, it would be premature to attribute these [fires] to either climate change or the failures of the fire prevention and fire-fighting mechanisms.”
However, he said the contributing factors included drought, strong winds and unusually high temperatures, all of which are likely to be aggravated by climate change.
The current heatwave across Europe and much of the northern hemisphere could be seen as “a foretaste of what weather extremes we are threatened by as the climate crisis progresses”, said Charalambides.
Growing more trees and managing forests properly would help to make the land more resilient to droughts, heatwaves and fires, he added. Forests also act as a cooling factor on the local climate and support a range of biodiversity.
Charalambides also called for a greater focus on the prevention of fires in Greece in place of a traditional focus on boosting firefighting capacity. Alongside this, there should be more emphasis on drawing up plans for evacuation in the case of disaster, particularly in areas where pine forests are near to human habitation.
Rachel Kennerley, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “The immediate priority must be to tackle the terrible fires, and to support the people whose homes, lives and livelihoods have been put at risk or devastated.”
But she said the longer-term impacts must also be taken into account when the immediate danger has passed: “Extreme heatwaves are predicted to become more frequent as climate change takes hold, meaning drier forests and countryside, and a greater risk of fire. Politicians must wake up to the extreme weather battering the planet and take tough and urgent steps to slash the climate-wrecking pollution being pumped into our atmosphere.”
Ray Rasker of Headwaters Economics, an expert on wildfires and the built environment in California, said buildings in high-risk areas could be made more resistant to fires in future, often through relatively simple measures. He cited nonflammable roofing material and siding for houses, not using wooden decks, installing fine mesh screens on roof vents, and planting fire-resistant vegetation close to houses.
He also warned that in the aftermath of large fires there is often a temptation to waive or loosen high building standards in order to rebuild as quickly as possible, which he said would be a mistake.
The short-term Met Office forecast for Greece is for temperatures from around 26C to around 30C, with some localised thunderstorms and a small amount of rainfall in a few areas.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

Well yes and no, you can be subjective about a subject or objective, ie putting your personal views aside and empathising with the other, that is the critical flaw that most on the right do not seem to posses, empathy that doesn’t pass further than themselves, their family or their perceived view of tribalism. Being objective and trying to find the middle ground is not the current rightwing - ‘centrist’ viewpoint.
“Sorry I actually thought we were having a sensible discussion about climate change but then you started bowing down to the Glorious (but incompetent) Leader.”
Like I said above, it’s not the person; give me someone else that understands how we have got to where we are; how society has been crumbling due to the social-economic crisis and the causes to the rise of fascism; because the solution isn’t more of the same. It’s not about JC; it’s about humanity, survival of the species. Noam Chomsky, the most respected and smartest public intellectual agrees, as does many others a most other solutions come from establishment bias or those too scared to see the pyramid crumbling underneath them, so begin stuffing their mattresses and closing their eyes to our problems.
Empathy and understanding of world conflicting, working together is what will fix this mess.
“For what it’s worth Jeremy isn’t far from the centre at all. It’s just his incompetence that makes him unsuitable.”

Why has it been so hot?
What can we expect from the weekend ahead?
*But* the hot weather could return ...
That’s all for now – thanks for following. 
The liveblog will be finishing shortly, but we will post a summary of events and any latest updates before then.
The Met Office updated it’s website today, predicting that the hot weather could return in August. When describing the outlook for Wednesday 1 August 2018 to Friday 10 August 2018, it said: “Temperatures around normal in the northwest to begin with, but otherwise it is likely to become very warm with a chance of hot conditions developing again, especially across the south.”
Between 11 August and 25 August 2018 the weather pattern will change very slowly, it said, adding that it looks “likely that warmer and drier than average conditions are most probable overall”. 
“Temperatures are expected to remain widely above average for most, with further spells of very warm or hot conditions probable, and a likelihood of very hot conditions at times, especially in the south,” it added.
To add insult to heat stress-related injury, Australia is making fun of the British again.The Sydney Morning Herald put it bluntly after one recent day of record temperatures in Britain: “It was the hottest day of the year in the UK and Brits could not cope”. The Adelaide Advertiser told readers “why British people can’t handle heat — and we can”. 
A News.com.au report belittled Britain for panicking over a “pleasant” 33.3C: “It turns out their definition of ‘heatwave’ is dramatically different from ours.” Similarly sneering remarks abounded on Twitter – where News.com.au said “Poms” had “flocked … to gripe about the ‘unbearable weather’” and sleeplessness “that apparently comes with night-time temperatures in the low- to mid-20s”.Yes, Australia wants to play its traditional wintertime sport “You call that a heatwave? THIS is a heatwave”. But that’s a losing game for everyone – here’s why: 
Rainfall has hit London. The Met office predicts it will be a humid evening in the capital and for the rest of the South East of England, with outbreaks of heavy, thundery rain, locally torrential. 
Thanassis Ksaksiris, 45, a farmer and trader in Athens, spoke to Guardian Cities about the sweltering heat there. 
I work two jobs, like most of the people who sell produce at the laikes [farmers’ markets]: two days a week growing fruits and vegetables in the fields of Marathonas [a town about an hour’s drive north-east of Athens], where I live with my family, and five days selling them at different laikes across Athens. 
Working outside is always worst at the beginning of a heatwave – as it goes on, the body adapts as much as it can, and you begin to get used to it. Here in the market, working during the afternoon is bearable because we have umbrellas above each stall.
Working in the fields is much more difficult: there is no shade, you are constantly in the sun. We start working at 6am: it is light outside but not yet too hot. We rest from 11am and start work again after 4pm until it gets dark. It is also vital to dress properly for the Greek sun – light, light-coloured clothing and hats.
In Cairo people swim in the Nile and absorb the heat in their homes with sacks of rice. In Tokyo they carry parasols. Farmers in Bukhara fear for their future, while in Jordan, refugees cover themselves with wet towels.And anyone who can relies on air conditioning.Around the world, people are trying to cope with the intense and prolonged heat. As always, the most vulnerable in society – the homeless, the elderly, the poor or disenfranchised – are suffering the most.Montreal is one of the cities that has been disrupted by deadly heat. Elmer Fecteau, 66, is living in at the Old Brewery Mission, a non-profit supporting the homeless. He spoke to Guardian Cities about the recent heatwave in the city:
There have been days when I couldn’t really go out for very long. It’s always been hot in Montreal for a few weeks here and there, but now it feels like it’s double the amount of time we have intense heat.
I’m living at the Old Brewery Mission [a non-profit supporting the homeless in Montreal]. I’m also helping some kids on the street, they’re not in as good a situation as me because they don’t have AC.
The water situation is not that great. The mission give you popsicles [with electrolytes] … so that replenishes the salts and whatever you need. We dehydrate ourselves and we don’t even know it. Then all of a sudden you’re dizzy – that’s when accidents happen. You don’t have to buy water, you just have to buy one good water container and carry it with you. But we need more water fountains in the parks.
I have bronchitis and pneumonia. I go from here to Saint Denis and Sherbrooke [an intersection about 2km away]. I do it in two or three blocks at a time and I have to find an air-conditioned place and sit down and relax – or sit down and cough – because of the pollution and the heat. There’s a lot of coughing when it starts.
Try to find a friendly tree in the city and give it a hug. You have to find some AC, so shopping centres are good and large stores. People should be aware that other people need AC and water. Give them the time of day and a smile, and pass along a little water.

Thousands of train passengers face major delays due to a lightning strike that damaged signalling equipment in York. 
Trains between Leeds and York were unable to run for several hours on Friday, leading to dozens of cancellations on one of the busiest days of the year for travel as many people begin summer holidays. Below is a photograph of the disruption at Leeds training station.
The thundery showers have still to reach the east coast of Scotland, where the weather is staying warm and bright into the late afternoon. Glasgow also remains dry at the time of writing.

Meanwhile, the weekly update from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) shows that many parts of the country – including the Highlands, and the Clyde valley, areas not renowned for their lack of rainfall – are now on the highest level of alert as regards water scarcity. Sepa suggests it is “highly likely” that by the end of July Scotland will have experienced its driest six-month period since 1984.
Apparently, it will take a month of exceptional rainfall for Scotland’s water levels to return to near-normal levels. I’m happy not to test that theory though.
The Met Office has issued a warning of thunderstorms at Ascot on Friday. Read The Guardian’s article on this and a few paragraphs of the piece below:
With the Met Office having issued a warning of thunderstorms from 2pm until midnight, however, punters with an eye on the field and betting for Saturday’s King George will also be keeping a close watch on the skies above the track, in case the course suddenly receives some natural hydration of its own.
If it does, Cracksman could well line up for Saturday’s King George and would do so as a possible favourite for the Flat season’s midsummer showpiece. It could also upset plenty of calculations elsewhere on the card, which includes the 29-runner Gigaset International Handicap over the straight seven furlongs, but the range of possibilities in terms of rainfall is so wide that for now at least, it makes more sense to ponder at the Friday card and worry about Saturday when it arrives.
The Listed Valiant Stakes for fillies and mares over a mile is the feature event this afternoon and William Haggas’s Beshaayir (3.35) stands out as the likeliest winner and probably the best bet on the card..
It's going to be a hot one at #Ascot today. Be like this foal and remember to stay hydrated... 🚰 pic.twitter.com/WpxxX0zrAJ
Hi, I’m Sarah Marsh, taking over from Adam Vaughan. Back to the latest on the heatwave: the Met Office has issued an amber warning, with heavy thunderstorms expected this afternoon and evening. This is what it means.
#Thunderstorms have now broken out across parts of eastern England. Watch out for heavy downpours over the next few hours and stay #weatheraware pic.twitter.com/OTBwYyfyoy
Thanks for all your heatwave-related questions. I’m now handing the liveblog over to Sarah Marsh.
Is the government looking at flooding and drought in a coordinated fashion? asks one reader
@AdamVaughn
Is there any evidence that the UK government are finally seriously looking at plans to prepare for the current drought and flood risks in a meaningful and coordinated manner?
It seems unlikely to me as fracking was just given the go ahead in one of the only region where we have a hosepipe ban and we know what has happened in the US:
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/05/fracking-water-america-drought-oil-gas
In 1976 we had a Minister for Drought / floods, now it seems only planning for a failed Brexit gets any attention by senior government.
I asked the environment department if there were any plans to appoint a 1976-style drought minister. They couldn’t say yes or no, so I think in the absence of any previous announcement, you can probably read that as a ‘no’. 
There is a floods minister, Thérèse Coffey.
Cuadrilla claim no households will have their water supply interrupted by their fracking use. 
A meaty question on whether governments of the right can tackle climate change.
With these issues of global warming/climate change, enviromental issues etc - I am interested on how that can actually be achieved under ANY Tory or Republican/GOP Government...
If even Trump, got impeached via some scandal, ie the Cohen tapes or his illegal business empire of making profit with the Saudis/China Etc;
How will we be any better off?! I don’t like the little authoritarian rat but surely Mike Pence, John Bolton, Mike Pompeo &amp; Bloody-Gina &amp; Co is actually and ideological fundamentalist and much much more dangerous if let loose on foreign policy with the GOP Neocons &amp; Pressures on Iran/Saudi Arabia and Israeli looking to get the boot in...
Strange predicament; environmentally and geopolitically..and hard to see a positive unless the entire Government comes down
I can’t do justice to such a big question here, but I think it’s clear that leaving the problem to the free market hasn’t worked (carbon emissions have started rising again globally after stalling for a few years), so government intervention is required. 
That said, it’s not always straightforward. In the UK the Conservatives can claim to have overseen some of the fastest reductions of carbon emissions in the world, because of the phase-out of coal power. Some of that, ironically, was down to EU legislation, some of it down to a carbon tax imposed by the UK. And it’s worth noting Margaret Thatcher arguably made more important speeches on climate change than any UK prime minister has since, though others may disagree on that. 
I think the main thing is that politicians need to avoid making climate change into a partisan issue, like it has become in the US. Fortunately the UK has avoided that so far, partly thanks to having passed legislation in the form of the Climate Change Act.
David Roberts at Vox has a much better written and researched piece on this subject than I can manage here.
A question from below the line:
Hi Adam, 'twice as likely' doesn't tally with what I have read elsewhere that we could see these weather patterns every other year. Twice as likely suggests we would see this every 20 years if this is compatible to 1976. In no way am I a 'denier' but I can see how people get confused when the science is not consistent or badly reported.
The answer is that twice as likely refers to this specific heatwave in Europe, in 2018. 
Every other year is what is expected in the 2040s, as per the report by MPs on Thursday. 
Next up: should we unplug all our appliances in a thunderstorm, like those forecast for parts of the country today? 
Is it really necessary to disconnect all electrical appliances?
... On my Nan's farm we had to get up in 't middle of the night, sit fully dressed on suitcases with the most valuable clothes, documents and the bible.
And Mum-in-Law would take all cutlery from the table because 'that attracts lightning'...
The Met Office does recommend you unplug non-essential devices.
Unplug all non-essential appliances, including the television, as lightning can cause power surges.
The Energy Networks Association, the trade body for local electricity grids, doesn’t offer advice either way. However, it tells me the only real risk is if your home is hit directly by lightning, in which case you might have a bigger, more pressing problem to deal with.
If lightning hits high voltage overhead lines, the surge would travel along the line until it reached the nearest surge-arrester when it would be earthed. On the low voltage network it would likely either blow a fuse on the network or hit a surge-arrester. A surge-arrester switches the path of the electricity from the line to the ground when it hits a critical voltage.
If lightning hits a domestic property then it would naturally flow to earth through the structure and/or trip the main fuse on the board in the property. If the fuse didn’t trip in time then there could be a risk to appliances but if there was a direct lightning strike of that magnitude then the greater risk would likely be some pretty significant structural damage to the property. If a person was unlucky and their house main fuse didn’t trip in time then it’s likely that their electrics may be damaged along with appliances that were plugged in.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/blog/live/2018/jul/27/uk-heatwave-thunderstorms-ahead-after-record-hottest-day-live

But didn't you ever flick over from Grandstand about 3pm, when it was frankly getting a bit tedious, to watch the legendary Briant Cant on Play Away on BBC2? When he was over you could flick back in plenty of time to get the footie results.
Of course as you got older, and too cool for Play Away, you would be found with the other lads (and deadbeats) outside Radio Rentals watching the ticker-tape results (you did hear the phenomenal news last week that East Fife 4-Forfar 5 actually happened, albeit on penalties?), after all the bookies was closed and you needed to see if your accumulator had come up.

But though it brought relief to our yellowed fields and gardens, we didn’t need the downpour to grant us a return of sanity – because, unlike the UK, we hadn’t lost our marbles in the first place.
It’s a strange thing to look at your nearest neighbour, until a few weeks ago your home, and wonder if it’s losing it. To look at its leaders and movers and shakers and think: “Are they high?” Last week’s corker: stockpiling food on the outside chance that the catastrophically hobbled Brexit talks do not suddenly surge forwards and yield a happy ending. I’ve found myself humming The Quartermaster’s Song (“There are mice, mice, mice/ Running through the rice, at the Quartermaster’s store”) as I think of Dominic Raab counting in the boxes of hardtack and pemmican, growing ever more furious as the supermarket top brass ring to tell him they haven’t any shelf space left.
It is, of course, not funny. We can safely assume that taking back control was never supposed to mean growing our own onions in a window box and bartering scraps of ham on street corners and yet here we seem to be. Add in the latest headlines – health chiefs warning of outbreaks of super-gonorrhoea – and you begin to think that things might be going slightly awry. Ah, a nation of hungry, sun-stroked belligerents with the clap.
In all this disarray, a truly delightful moment. EastEnders residents are about to see the return of the beloved Dr Legg
Meanwhile, two developments of a more cheering, but nonetheless mildly puzzling, nature. Those of a certain vintage will recall Saturday afternoons round at your nana’s watching wrestling on the telly – Mick McManus, Jackie Pallo, Kendo Nagasaki (real name: Peter Thornley), Giant Haystacks (Martin Ruane) and Big Daddy (Shirley Crabtree). These guys had it all: the names, the costumes, the bizarre rituals (Catweazle licking a lucky toad between rounds). They were who we watched when we weren’t watching Leonard Sachs barking up the acts on The Good Old Days and the snooker programme Pot Black, even if you didn’t have a colour set. This was a time when truly sophisticated television – by which I mean Bergerac – was a rare and carefully husbanded treat.
But now, wrestling is back! As of teatime yesterday, you can watch Dave Mastiff (aka Human Hate Machine) and Grado (The Chubby Wee) slugging it out, with the addition of two female wrestlers, nicknamed Lilith and Viper. And while Mastiff’s declaration that this new incarnation of British wrestling is “like the punk rock scene used to be” might not bear close examination, I’m willing to get with the 1976 vibe. “Greetings, grapple fans!”
And today’s political scene is agreeably amenable to the retro-feel. Young people are declaring themselves communists and free-floating liberals are plotting new parties. Jeremy Corbyn, 40-odd years ago a Haringey councillor calling for free dentistry and the national ownership of everything, hasn’t even had to change his Donovan hat. On the other side of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg looks like he’s stepped off the front page of the Daily Sketch, where he jumps out of his Triumph Stag to rail against union leaders meeting behind closed Downing Street doors for beer and sandwiches.
But in all this disarray, a truly delightful moment, this time courtesy of the 1980s. In Albert Square, Walford, the home of the BBC soap opera EastEnders, residents are about to see a long-lost face, that of Dr Harold Legg, beloved GP and community stalwart. Dr Legg, who appeared in the very first episode, and who subsequently found himself at the heart of several major storylines, many of them also featuring Ethel Skinner and Dot Cotton.
What could be more bolstering than the revival of a treasured doctor? One whose fictional back story – his Jewish family driven from the East End during the rise of Oswald Mosley and the British Union of Fascists, but who himself returned to serve and nurture the community – hardly seems out of kilter with the times. The actor who plays Dr Legg, Leonard Fenton, is now 92, and has a career that encompasses such TV series as Secret Army and Shine on Harvey Moon. What a swansong.
But nostalgia, as we know, is dangerous, and although these cultural throwbacks and revivals are pleasant, they can’t displace the depth of our current troubles. As numerous experts, including the food writer Jack Monroe and the botanist James Wong, are in the process of pointing out, the potential shortage of food and medicines will have a disproportionately grave effect on those least equipped to withstand them, and even the apprehension of the instability and duress they will cause is damaging.
In the heat of the last few weeks, it seems as though people were losing their minds and were driven to ever more ingenious ways of keeping cool. One such was the idea of drenching a sheet in cold water, then wrapping it around oneself before attempting to sleep. But as the mercury dips – for now at least – the country and those gifted its governance need to be careful that a cooling swathe of linen doesn’t become a winding sheet.Put more simply: it’s time to get a grip.

You are certainly a polemicist, and I can't recall a single substantial suggestion from you about what we should do to solve the problem of excessive GHG emissions.
BQENDMy suggestions have always centered around positive re-enforcement for changes in behaviour and technological advancement, not negative re-enforcement like taxes.
I have posted this before, so it may be a little out of date for the actual numbers, however you should be able to see the concept.
BQSTART
I support policies which are reward based. Not ones that are punitive. I support funding such policies within the existing budget. Given the grave nature of climate change, I would suggest that funding for related policies should take precedence over other areas of spending. Rewards for successful innovation and practical implementation, with minimal investment in start-up. Instead of government just ""investing"" in a technology company and hoping they succeed, the goal should be to reward technology companies for reaching benchmarks. For solar for instance, a benchmark could be reaching a cost per Watt efficiency. For batteries something similar, maybe certain density levels, or recharge rates. 
What I oppose are punitive measures like taxes specifically designed to discourage a free person's behaviour. People want more of what they like, not less of what they like. Many of the policies supported by green activists seem to ignore this natural human motivation. The entire tone of these policies invokes guilt, restriction and sacrifice. Instead appeal to human nature and create policies that motivate people.
Specifically, for an American reference, say take this $294 billion, spend $100 million setting up a short listing program for auto mobile battery manufacturers. Then give each of say 9 companies a $100 million prototype grant. Now you used 1/3 of 1% to set up the program. What makes this not just the regular wasteful government spending is that the real money for these companies comes later and is tied only to success. Reward the first to reach 25% energy density when compared to gasoline with $10 billion, the first to reach recharge rates less than 10 times the energy recharge of refuelling gets $10 billion. Then give $23 billion to the first to manufacture and distribute at a cost, when combined with advanced electric motors, within 20% of an existing auto mobile drive train.
Then, of the remaining 90% of said $294 billion, use 50% to pay down US national debt and then give the remaining 40% back to tax payers, who may, if the end result of spending only 10% of this wasteful government pork is a quality product that can compete with existing auto mobiles, decide to spend some of this money buying them, thus increasing demand.

These costs can be estimated via the ‘social cost of carbon.’ It’s a difficult number to pin down, but even at the extremely conservative US federal estimate of $37 per ton of carbon dioxide pollution (some recent research pegs the value at more than five times higher), that’s about $200bn per year for America and $1.3tn globally. While direct government subsidies to the fossil fuel industry are expensive, they’re dwarfed by the costs incurred by failing to tax carbon pollution.

Similarly, you've said that you'd support nuclear in the US if it were economically feasible and outperformed all renewables instead of merely most of them.

Because if I did that I would be lying. I was familiar with numerous reports over the last decade or so in the mainstream Australian media of demand peaksoccurring during summer heatwaves, the most recent in New South Wales in February, 2017.
I never said that the AEMO Reports on future adjustments to the grid to accomodate the proposed expansion of renewable energy were the place to find such information. However such basic information can be found elsewhere.
""Peak demand is the maximum amount of energy demanded by a state, region or even a street. In order to make sure electricity is available for peak events, the grid is built to meet this capacity - even though it won't always be needed. In all Australian states, except Tasmania, peak demand occurs in summer during heatwaves. Peak demand is measured in megawatts (MW). The scorecard for peak demand events and the season in which they occurred are shown below.Queensland 9,412 MW Summer 2016-17; New South Wales 14,744 MW Summer 2010-11; Victoria 10,576 MW Summer 2008-09; South Australia 3,399 MW Summer 2010-11; Tasmania 1,790 MW Winter 2008; Western Australia 4,304 MW Summer 2015-16.""

Nonsense. For example, the premature deaths caused by burning coal are very well documented :
Switching from coal to natural gas would reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by more than 90 percent and nitrogen oxide emissions by more than 60 percent. These compounds are major causes of fine particulate pollution. Reductions on this level would lower the total cost of national annual human health damages by US$20 billion to $50 billion annually. We found that the Southeast and the Ohio Valley, where most of the coal is burned, would capture the lion’s share of these benefits.

From the Wikipedia page on ""Subsidy"" :
BQSTART
A subsidy is a form of financial aid or support extended to an economic sector (or institution, business, or individual) generally with the aim of promoting economic and social policy. Although commonly extended from government, the term subsidy can relate to any type of support – for example from NGOs or as implicit subsidies. Subsidies come in various forms including: direct (cash grants, interest-free loans) and indirect (tax breaks, insurance, low-interest loans, accelerated depreciation, rent rebates).

Margaret Thatcher was a PM with a science background and understood the science if global warming in the mid-eighties. There were also valid technical and economic reasons for phasing out coal mining in Britain. There was bipartisan support for action to address AGW or anthropogenic global warming in Australia up until 2009 when then Liberal Party MP Tony Abbott enlisted the assistance of his party's extreme right wing faction to become opposition leader.
Unlike Britain Australia still has vast reserves of high grade recoverable coal and a number of large corporations and billionaires making large amounts of money exporting both thermal and metallurgical coal. Some mines produces both types of coal. The major Australian extreme right wing think tank, the Institute for Public Affairs, is funded by coal, asbestos and iron ore billionaire and heiress Gina Reinhardt. Both she and her father before her are/were on the extreme right of politics. There is no comparable finance for the extreme left of politics.
With more that half its income coming from the export of metallurgical coal, the Australian coal mining industry has suffered no body blowseven as coal fired power stations close as they age. Recent increase in demand for export thermal coal has improved their earning from those lower grade deposits. The coal industry has money and influence and knows which politicians will do its bidding.

No. I said Australia's means of electing its executive Government is the optimum system.

The party that won office in 2013, and is still in power the federal government has not addressed the country's emissions problems. That is a political problem but last weekends series of by elections suggest that the problem won't persist.

As a lifelong technocrat whose daughter when she was Minister for Climate Change took and implemented the advice of my technocrat colleagues as part of a democratic government elected by means of a system of electorates determined by the technocrats of the Electoral Commission who ensured that all voter's votes were as near as possible of equal value under a system of preferential and compulsory voting, I have experienced a technocratic and democratic government.

Abolish them | Dana Nuccitelli,article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jul/30/america-spends-over-20bn-per-year-on-fossil-fuel-subsidies-abolish-them,,"Imagine that instead of taxing cigarettes, America subsidized the tobacco industry in order to make each pack of smokes cheaper.
A report from Oil Change International (OCI) investigated American energy industry subsidies and found that in 2015–2016, the federal government provided $14.7bn per year to the oil, gas, and coal industries, on top of $5.8bn of state-level incentives (globally, the figure is around $500bn). And the report only accounted for production subsidies, excluding consumption subsidies (support to consumers to lower the cost of fossil fuel use – another $14.5bn annually) as well as the costs of carbon and other fossil fuel pollutants.
At a time when we need to transition away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible, the federal and state governments are giving the industry tens of billions of dollars to make the production of their dirty, dangerous products more profitable.
Crucially, the OCI report noted that if we want to meet the Paris target of limiting global warming to less than 2°C (and we do!), not only does the fossil fuel industry have to stop developing new reserves, but “some already-tapped reserves must be retired early.”
This reality is incompatible with continued US government subsidization of fossil fuel industry production, including $2.5bn per year for the exploration of new fossil fuel resources ­– new resources that simply cannot be developed if we’re to meet the Paris climate target.
To achieve that goal, we instead need to replace fossil fuels with clean energy as quickly as possible. And yet, OCI notes that permanent tax breaks to the US fossil fuel industry are more than seven times larger than those for renewable energy. Some of those fossil fuel subsidies have been around for over a century. And they’re making it profitable for the oil industry to extract resources that would otherwise be left in the ground:
at current prices, the production of nearly half of all U.S. oil is not economically viable, except with federal and state subsidies.
And as David Roberts notes, federal policy is also propping up the coal industry. Were they forced to meet modern pollution standards, 98% of currently operating coal power plants would be unprofitable compared to an equivalent natural gas plant. Coal power plants only stay open through regulations allowing pollution exemptions, and by forcing taxpayers to pick up the climate change bill.
Without a price on carbon pollution, Americans are effectively subsidizing the fossil fuel industry for the costs incurred through its products’ climate change damages. For example, think about the added costs to taxpayers for worse wildfires, droughts, hurricanes, and flooding, all amplified by human-caused climate change. In the absence of a price on carbon pollution, the fossil fuel industry doesn’t pay a cent of those costs. Taxpayers pick up the whole tab.
These costs can be estimated via the ‘social cost of carbon.’ It’s a difficult number to pin down, but even at the extremely conservative US federal estimate of $37 per ton of carbon dioxide pollution (some recent research pegs the value at more than five times higher), that’s about $200bn per year for America and $1.3tn globally. While direct government subsidies to the fossil fuel industry are expensive, they’re dwarfed by the costs incurred by failing to tax carbon pollution.
The OCI report noted that the Obama administration actually proposed to eliminate 60% of federal fossil fuel industry subsidies, but that proposal went nowhere for one obvious reason:
In the 2015-2016 election cycle oil, gas, and coal companies spent $354 million in campaign contributions and lobbying and received $29.4 billion in federal subsidies in total over those same years - an 8,200% return on investment.
Of those fossil fuel industry contributions to political campaigns, 88% went to Republican politicians. As a result, 97% of House Republicans oppose taxing carbon pollution, and the Trump administration is looking into every possible scheme to further prop up the dying coal industry. The GOP might as well rebrand itself as the Grand Oil Party.
Subsidies are a way for the government to assist an industry, hypothetically for good reason. For example, wind and solar power help meet our energy needs without producing harmful pollution in the process. Because of the associated societal benefits, it’s possible to justify subsidizing clean energy. Alternatively, we could eliminate all energy subsidies and instead tax carbon and other forms of pollution. If rising energy prices are a concern, we could offset those costs by returning the pollution tax revenue to taxpayers.
There are numerous different policy options available to achieve the Paris climate target. We can avoid unacceptably risky levels of global warming while also achieving cleaner air, water, and public health without destroying whole landscapes. But continuing to funnel tens to hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies to the fossil fuel industry is perverse and counter-productive, as the OCI report noted:
Removing these highly inefficient [fossil fuel] subsidies – which waste billions of dollars propping up an industry incompatible with safe climate limits – should be the first priority of fiscally responsible climate, energy, and tax reform policies.
Perhaps the Democratic Party should add ‘abolish fossil fuel subsidies’ to its platform.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jul/30/america-spends-over-20bn-per-year-on-fossil-fuel-subsidies-abolish-them

One implication (/ inference ???) of this type of language is that if you get a heatwave of intensity ""I"" that results in ""N"" deaths, e.g. ""20K deaths for the 2003 heatwave"", then ALL subsequent heatwaves of intensity ""I"" (or higher) WILL result in (at least) ""N"" deaths AS WELL.
Combine this with a link saying that 9 out of 10 summers in the years 2080-2100 will be ""warmer than the warmest summer on record (1900-2016)"" over a large fraction of the Earth's surface, and you get the ""prediction"" that I made in my post.
My point was that it is only the FIRST time an ""unprecedented"" heatwave occurs, combined (as in France in 2003) with a whole set of other factors (most Parisians on holiday + old people not feeling thirsty when dehydrated + ...) that you get a such a high death toll.

I was responding to the ""a map of the world"" link in the post by Erik Frederiksen about Richard Alley's presentation.
That slide had the title ""Frequency of summers in 2080-2100 that are warmer than the warmest summer on record (1900-2016)"", and showed ""red areas"" where the frequency was 90-100% (9 or 10 years out of 10).
That slide assumes RCP 8.5.

BQSTART
Why is pathway is scare quotes?
BQEND
They aren't scare quotes, but I agree that they are (unfortunately for me ...) indistinguishable from them.
For the IPCC in TAR / AR3 (2001) and AR4 (2007), the inputs to the climate models used in those reports came from the SRES, or ""Special Report on Emissions Scenarios"" paper.
""Scenario"" is a word that has often been used in the past in scientific circles to denote a given set of assumptions about how things could evolve in the future, and so does not need to be ""highlighted"" with quotes to indicate that it is being used in a non-standard way (for either English speakers in general or climate scientists in particular).
In AR5 (2013) the IPCC switched to using the RCP, or ""Representative Concentration Pathways"", inputs instead.
Putting ""pathway"" in quotes here was simply an indicator that the word is being used in a non-standard way.

BQSTART
Why is it not going to happen?
BQEND
The ""8.5"" in ""RCP 8.5"" indicates that the additional radiative forcing in the year 2100 due to human activity (especially CO2 emissions) would be +8.5 Watts per square metre.
In order to reach that target (including an atmospheric CO2 abundance of 935ppm in 2100) Riahi et al (2011) decided that humanity would burn coal ... lots and lots of coal.
Several people (including Skeptical Science's Andy Skuce back in 2015) calculated that to reach the RCP 8.5 numbers we would have to burn twice the ""known reserves"" of coal between 2005 and 2100.
In 2018, despite Donald Trump, the situation in the real world includes :- The World Bank refusing to offer loans for coal power plants (solar and wind projects are greatly preferred)- A preference for solar and offshore wind projects in the developed world (at least)- The probability of future technology changes (fusion by 2060/2070 being the most obvious) eliminating the need for coal power plants at some point in the 21st century

Climate models published since 1973 have generally been quite skillful in projecting future warming. While some were too low and some too high, they all show outcomes reasonably close to what has actually occurred, especially when discrepancies between predicted and actual CO2 concentrations and other climate forcings are taken into account.

You are again assuming that people are unable to adapt.
Here in France, post 2003, any time the temperature goes above 35°C (in Paris) the TV is full of ""Alerte canicule !"" messages, telling people to ""ensure you stay hydrated"" and to ""check on your elderly neighbours"".
This is reinforced by the evening news programs leading with reports from old people's homes showing staff pushing residents to drink glasses of water ""even if you don't feel thirsty, love"" before reporting on the ""unprecedented"" temperatures.
We have actually had ""heatwaves"" similar to (but not quite as bad as) 2003 since then with no noticeable ""uptick"" in extra deaths.
NB : It's currently 35°C here (which is already ""unbearable"" for me ...), projected to reach 37°C tomorrow, with thunderstorms reducing it to 27°C (max) on Saturday.

I am aware that the ""default"" thinking on this subject will have most people concentrated on the global average number / intensity of heatwaves, but the word ""locally"" is still in there.
One idea that keeps drifting in and out of fashion amongst climate scientists is that with ""very high"" warming levels the AMOC will collapse (IIRC Stefan Rahmstorf has published several papers on the ""Conveyor Belt"" of global ocean currents and how it could react in the future).
What would the collapse of the AMOC do the likelihood of heatwaves in NW Europe ?
Here's another ""way out there"" conjecture ... at some ""threshold"" the ""Polar Vortex + Jet Stream"" system is completely rearranged, and it becomes impossible for high-pressure systems to remain ""blocked / stationary"" for more than 48 hours or so ...
""Exceptionally unlikely"" (= ""0-1%"" for the IPCC ...) I know, but that (or any of a multitude of variants of ""that"") would be one possibility of a warmer world with fewer heatwaves (in the northern hemisphere, at least).

Wrong. Every model is by definition wrong. A denier posted a quotation from an Oreskes et al 1994 paper the other day, thinking they were being very clever...
""Verification and validation of numerical models of natural systems is impossible. This is because natural systems are never closed and because model results are always nonunique. Models can be confirmed by the demonstration of agreement between observation and prediction, but confirmation is inherently partial. Complete confirmation is logically precluded by the fallacy of affirming the consequent and by incomplete access to natural phenomena. Models can only be evaluated in relative terms, and their predictive value is always open to question. The primary value of models is heuristic.""The important bit is the last sentence.
So the one thing that I am convinced of is that the model is wrong. But I remain unconvinced that it is not fit for purpose.

A bit reductionist, but that is correct.
The implication that it is never the case that problems can be detected just by looking at plots of the output data is NOT true, though.

Science can be though of as Consilience, Coherence and Consensus (credit: rockyrex).
AGW has a Consilience of evidence from thousands of lines of evidence, it has Coherence in that the different lines of evidence agree with each other and afterwards a Consensus is formed when the vast majority of publishing scientists are in agreement.
Skeptics simply refuse to acknowledge the Consilience and Coherence of climate science and irrationally demand a Consensus was reached arbitrarily. 
Skeptics have no Consilience since their arguments require ignoring most of the available evidence, no Coherence since they provide no explanation for contrary lines of evidence and no Consensus since they do not even agree amongst themselves on what is happening in the climate today.

However, it's less well known that adding GHGs cools the stratosphere, due to the fact that there's less infrared radiation to warm it.
BQEND
This point on its own highlights some serious issues on how widely the science has been communicated since:
BQSTART
"" The surplus carbon dioxide created by human activity may now be adding extra heat to the lower atmosphere or troposphere, which is simultaneously cooling the stratosphere or upper atmosphere.""
BQEND
https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/lords/1978/nov/30/atmospheric-changes-and-weather-patterns
It was a point which was made in 1978 - not in some obscure journal but the first major political speech recognising climate change.
===
BQSTART
If the stratosphere cools due to GHGs, the average altitude of the tropopause must increase.
BQEND
More directly there are some major complexities in modelling this which means that it is difficult to state exactly what the likely outcomes would be.
The problem is that while we know most circulation and atmospheric patterns to be stable for Holocene conditions, they don't necessarily result from starting conditions. So if you start with no Jet Stream you might not get it back.
For the tropopause situation there is again more than one possible outcome from the starting conditions. This can be seen starting from the simplest of models.
Consider it as three distinct layers with [1] being the atmosphere to the tropopause [2] and the atmosphere above being [3].
Take a column in equilibrium under gravity then 
P1 - P3 = m2 * g
where P is the pressure and m the mass and g is gravity and the number refers to the region.
If you change the temperature then if dp is to stay the same then the volume has to change which means that the tropause is pushed up. It also means that the thickness alters.
You allow for a bigger 'dp' then this can be solved by increasing m2. 
Before you dismiss this then you need to consider what happens if you have two columns now mass can move from one column to another.
===
The temperature drop in the stratosphere is short-term if you stop adding GHGs because eventuall conduction will warm even this from the increase in surface temperature.
However, there are a lot of unknowns which are not included in current model assumptions. Which is why comments on the Observer of recent heat wave might be weak Jet Stream not just climate change misses the point. What caused the weakning Jetstream if not climate change.
While possibly not a likely concern, this piece of science is little discussed but shows the really scary atmospheric height scenario:

There was also an emerging scientific literature determining to what extent climate change has influenced the likelihood of individual events, such as a particular observed heat wave event for example the European heatwave of 2003. What do we know now? Observations show that many extremes have continued to become more frequent and intense. Heat waves continued to increase in frequency even between 1998 and 2012, and research indicates an important interaction between dry conditions and heat waves. Since AR5, analysis of specific extreme events has continued to indicate that human influences have made many individual heat waves much more likely, and cold spells less likely.

It is very likely that the number of cold days and nights has decreased and the number of warm days and nights has increased on the global scale. It is likely that the frequency of heat waves has increased in large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia. It is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed global scale changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes since the mid-20th century. It is likely that human influence has more than doubled the prob-ability of occurrence of heat waves in some locations. There is medium confidence that the observed warming has increased heat-related human mortality and decreased cold-related human mortality in some regions. {1.4

BQSTART
Surface temperature is projected to rise over the 21st century under all assessed emission scenarios.

Slight correction, the 30+ year period definition of climate was agreed in 1934 by the IMO, the WMO's predecessor organisation. 
What the deniers and those who claim there was a pause either forget or are ignorant of, is that the climate system is not just the atmosphere. The climate system is composed of:-- Atmosphere- Biosphere- Cryosphere- Geosphere- Hydrosphere.
Now that is text book stuff from the 1950/60's !
And we know that the heat was going into the other components of the climate system not the atmosphere during the so called ""pause"", when temperatures didn't increase at quite the same rate.
That was also the reason the 30+ year period was chosen to account for short term internal variables like ENSO.

... we don't know that heatwaves are likely to get worse? Even though the IPCC’s last report stated that heatwaves are already getting worse.
BQEND
From the ""IPCC's last report"" (AR5, WG1, 2013, Chapter 2, page 212 :
BQSTART
Table 2.13 shows that there has been a likely increasing trend in the frequency of heatwaves since the middle of the 20th century in Europe and Australia and across much of Asia where there are sufficient data. However, confidence on a global scale is medium owing to lack of studies over Africa and South America but also in part owing to differences in trends depending on how heatwaves are defined (Perkins et al., 2012). Using monthly means as a proxy for heatwaves Coumou et al. (2013) and Hansen et al. (2012) indicate that record-breaking temperatures in recent decades substantially exceed what would be expected by chance but caution is required when making inferences between these studies and those that deal with multi-day events and/or use more complex definitions for heatwave events. There is also evidence in some regions that periods prior to the 1950s had more heatwaves (e.g., over the USA, the decade of the 1930s stands out and is also associated with extreme drought conditions (Peterson et al., 2013) whereas conversely in other regions heatwave trends may have been underestimated owing to poor quality and/or consistency of data (e.g., Della-Marta et al. (2007a) over Western Europe; Kuglitsch et al. (2009, 2010) over the Mediterranean). Recent available studies also suggest that the number of cold spells has reduced significantly since the 1950s (Donat et al., 2013a, 2013c).

Is there an actual concern with the data, or are you just hoping there is ? If the former, please spell it out.
BQEND
Since you asked nicely ... ;-)
This paper, like many others, has as an underlying theme the implication that ""climate models"" fed with ""estimated historical changes in human and natural external forcings"" (summarised as ""HIST+8.5"" in this case) are able to accurately reproduce the historical, empirically measured, data (in this case the satellite TMT / mid-troposphere datasets from 1/1979 to 12/2016).
Look (again ?) at Figures S3 and S4.
NB : They are both plots of (Annual Mean / Annual Cycle) temperature trends (/ rates), not ""temperature anomalies"" (and we're a long way away from being able to plot ""absolute temperatures"").
If you ""zoom in"" to the last 3 plots in each Figure you will see that the ""observational"" datasets are included (RSS, STAR and UAH). These provide the ""fingerprint"" of WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN THE REAL WORLD, and can be directly compared to what the models supposed would happen over the same time period (1979-2016).
For Figure S3, just looking for the ""top level"" (most extreme) values the ""fingerprint"" is something like :- The largest warming trend (""red"" patches) along the 90°N line (the Arctic)- A definite cooling trend (""blue"" patches) in Antarctica (60°S to 90°S lines)- A gradual, but irregular, change from ""lots of warming"" to ""some cooling"" as you go from latitude 90°N to 90°S
The STAR dataset has the highest ""contrast"" (""Max - Min"" difference), UAH has the lowest, and RSS is roughly in the middle. The above ""fingerprint"" describes all 3 though.
Of the 37 climate model plots :- NONE show ""excessive cooling"" (the ""blue patches"" for STAR are the most intense on the entire page)- I count 18 that show some cooling around Antarctica ...- ... and 19 that do NOT !- 7 models show the largest warming rate above the equator (not above the Arctic), while GFDL-CM3 and IPSL-CM5A-MR show everything from 90°N to 60°S with ""a very fast warming rate"".
While some advanced mathematics, which I've already admitted I do not possess, would be required to put a precise number on just how much ""redder"" the ""Model average"" would be than the observational data, if you make the (very !) generous assumption that ALL of the models showing cooling trends in Antarctica count as ""Roughly Correct"" then you end up with :
BQSTART
Model average = 50% ""Roughly Correct"" + 50% ""Excessive warming (rate)""
BQEND
That is enough to be able to conclude that sooner or later, depending on the date at which the models are ""calibrated / synchronised"" to have the same absolute temperature field as the observational data, you are eventually going to end up with the models ""running way too hot"".', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1532530859000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'3985037', u'in_reply_to': u'118627543', u'id': u'118714758', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Erik Frederiksen', u'text': u'BQSTART

""The greenhouse effect relies on infrared optical thickness of the atmosphere andtemperature decline with height. Real greenhouse gases do not make the atmosphere optically thick uniformly throughout the infrared spectrum. Rather, the optical thickness is concentrated in preferred gas-dependent spectral bands, and the main way the greenhouse effect gets stronger as the gas concentration increases is through the spread of the optically thick regions to every greater portions of the spectrum. There are two basic ways to get the temperature decline which is necessary to translate optical thickness into OLR reduction: radiative equilibrium in an atmosphere that is optically thick through at least part of the spectrum, or convection in an atmosphere where the radiative equilibrium is statically unstable either at the surface or internally. The tropopause height determines the blend of the two mechanisms in force. Both mechanisms canyield a surface temperature very much in excess of the no-atmosphere blackbody temperature, but a radiatively-dominated atmosphere is a very different place from a convectively-dominated atmosphere, since the latter has vigorous vertical mixing that can give rise to a stew of small scale turbulent phenomena.

It used to be that “climate change” mostly referred to increasing temperatures near the Earth’s surface, but increasingly, climate change has come to mean so much more. It means warming oceans, melting ice, changing weather patterns, increased storms, and warming in other places.
A recent study has just been published that finds ‘fingerprints’ of human-caused warming someplace most of us don’t think about – in the higher atmosphere. Not only that, but these scientists have found changes to the seasonal climate – how much the temperature varies from winter to summer to winter – and the changes they found matched expectations. 
The paper was authored by a top group of scientists including Benjamin Santer, Stephen Po-Chedley, Mark Zelinka, Ivana Cvijanovic, Celine Bonfils and Paul Durack from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Carl Mears and Frank Wentz from Remote Sensing Systems; Qiang Fu from the University of Washington; Jeffrey Kiehl from the University of California, Santa Cruz; Susan Solomon from MIT; and Cheng-Zhi Zou from the University of Maryland. These are literally the best of the best climate scientists studying Earth’s atmosphere.
So, how did the scientists carry out their research? First of all, temperature measurements were made throughout the atmosphere using satellites. These satellites fly across the skies and take continuous measurements, so we get a picture of the whole planet. This is different from using a weather balloon that measures temperature only where the balloon flies. Satellites give a nearly continuous picture of what is happening everywhere.
While all that is great, satellites are prone to errors that have to be accounted for. For instance, their orbits change over time, which affects the accuracy of the measurements. They also have issues with a process called calibration. Finally, whenever a new satellite is launched, it may not behave the same as the satellite it replaced. While all of these issues can be dealt with, it’s a challenge to do so. But regardless, satellites are a very useful tool for understanding global changes in climate.
The authors compared these satellite temperature measurements with the “human influence” fingerprint patterns from computer models of the climate system. The fingerprints were based on computer calculations made with human-caused changes in greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere. 
The “human influence” fingerprints were also compared with results from “no human influence” calculations, which did not have any year-to-year changes in human factors. Comparing these two sets of calculations allowed the researchers to determine whether the “human influence” fingerprint matched the satellite data, and whether such a fingerprint match could be due to natural climate variability alone. 
In particular, the researchers wanted to know whether they could detect a human fingerprint in the seasonal cycle of temperature changes in the atmosphere (as the atmosphere heats and cools during different seasons of the year). 
They discovered that in the lower part of the atmosphere (the troposphere), the fingerprint of global warming can be found in the satellite measurements of the changing seasonal cycles of temperature. The “human influence” fingerprint matched the satellite patterns of seasonal cycle change. The match was significant – it couldn’t be explained by natural climate variability. 
They discovered that in the Northern Hemisphere, the warming during the summertime is larger than the wintertime warming. So, in the north (between about 30 and 60 N), the seasonal temperature variations is increasing. In the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, there is similar behavior, but the seasonal differences in warming are smaller. The reason the north and south behave differently is because north of the equator there is a lot more land and a lot less ocean compared to the Southern Hemisphere. Just take out a globe, find the equator, you will see for yourself. 
But as you continue further toward the poles, say north or south of 60 degrees latitude, the trend reverses. The reversal is particularly evident in the north. The range of seasonal temperatures is becoming smaller. The main reason for this is the loss of ice. As the planet warms, ice melts and exposes more water and changes the reflectivity of the planet. 
Much of the fingerprint work that has been done over the last 30 years looks at broad-brush changes in annual climate. The focus on climate fingerprinting with the changing seasons is relatively new and makes this paper a significant contribution. 
The authors close with an excellent summary statement: 
For tropospheric temperature, a human-caused signal is now evident in the seasonal cycle itself.
The study is getting a lot of coverage, for good reason. I encourage readers to check it out.

Several of the state’s branches have endorsed the LNP push for the federal government to build “high energy, low emissions coal-fired power stations and the orderly closing down of older technology coal-fired power stations in order to drive down electricity prices, reduce emissions and promote economic growth”.
While the coal push favours government intervention, separate proposals on renewable energy call for the state and federal governments “to apply policies which affirm the LNP’s commitment to the free market provision of least-cost, secure and reliable energy supplies from all technologies where their use is economically viable and technically feasible”.
Nuclear power will also be back on the agenda at the LNP conference, with the Fairfax branch pushing for the consideration of “the feasibility of nuclear power generation in Australia”.
The weekend motions come as Tony Abbott has attempted this week to exploit internal divisions within the Turnbull government over the Neg in an effort to torpedo the policy.
Abbott used a speech to a forum of climate sceptics to declare Australia should withdraw from the Paris agreement – a treaty he joined Australia to while prime minister – as a precursor for dumping the Neg.
The government’s energy policy is supported by a majority of Liberals and some Nationals, and there is internal frustration about Abbott’s antics. 
Some Nationals want Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg to agree to provide transitional assistance for the coal sector, either through subsidies for coal stations or bankrolling retrofitting to extend the life of existing plants while lowering emissions.
That internal push is being driven out of Queensland. Labor has earmarked at least 10 of the government’s Queensland seats as vulnerable, making the state the potential election swinger, and support for a coal-inclusive energy future is gaining traction with MPs in marginal seats.
With pro-coal forces in the government on the march, during the last parliamentary sitting fortnight before the winter recess the Coalition voted with One Nation in the Senate, backing a motion calling on the government “to facilitate the building of new coal-fired power stations and the retrofitting of existing baseload power stations”.
While it is clear that agreeing to some assistance for coal would help smooth over the government’s internal divisions on the policy, a coal side deal would create problems with Labor states and territories who have to sign off on the policy in early August.
Some Labor states and the ACT will be highly attentive to any deal the Turnbull government strikes internally to prolong the life of coal-fired power plants, given some of them are already of the view the emissions reduction in the Neg is nowhere near ambitious enough for Australia to meet its Paris commitments.
Any one of the states or the ACT could scuttle the policy because implementing it requires agreement across participants in the national electricity market.
A coal side deal could also derail bipartisan consensus on the Neg with Labor in Canberra. The Turnbull government will need Labor’s support to get the policy through the parliament.
The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has already warned the government that new subsidies for coal as part of any internal settlement on the Neg will scuttle the chances of securing peace after 10 years of warring over climate and energy policy.
Butler said in late June: “We’re not going to agree to a model that seeks to fly in the face of all of the expert advice, from industry and stakeholders, that building new coal-fired power stations would mean there is no way of achieving our commitments under the Paris agreement and also would deliver higher priced electricity to households and businesses.”

Although the hot dry weather is clearly to blame, so too is damage over the years from drainage that dried out the peat and turned it into a powder keg.
Peatlands may not look glamorous but they are a hugely important national treasure. They help prevent floods by soaking up rain like a sponge, and can hold about 20 times their own weight in water. And more than 70% of Britain’s drinking water comes from peatlands, feeding into supplies for 28 million people.
The plants in peatlands absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, locking away staggering amounts of carbon – about 5.5bn tonnes, more than half the country’s entire carbon storage – and that helps curb climate change. In comparison, British forests store only 150m tonnes of carbon. However, damaged moorlands do the opposite, releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases, made even worse when smoke particulates enter the atmosphere.
Britain has some of the finest peatlands in the world, but they need protection. They need to be kept wet and prevented from being drained for farming or development, or dug up for garden compost.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

The resulting lack of oxygen not only curtails habitats for creatures that live on the seafloor, but also affects fish stocks and can lead to blooms of toxic cyanobacteria.
But it is not a problem confined to the Baltic. Earlier this year a study revealed that ocean dead zones have quadrupled in size since the 1950s, and are found the world over in coastal regions of high population, from Europe to North America and China. 
Researchers behind the latest study say that while nations are taking action to help waters rebound, individuals can help.
 “In terms of the general public, one of the main things to do in the future may be to reduce the proportion of meat in the diet. Livestock agriculture generates higher nutrient losses per kilogram of food produced,” said Sami Jokinen, a PhD student at the University of Turku, and Tom Jilbert, an assistant professor of the University of Helsinki, who are co-authors of the research.
At present, the Baltic Sea dead zone extends across 70,000 km2 – an area almost twice the size of Denmark, Jokinen says. The team say the lack of oxygen in the waters at the bottom is seasonal, related to layering of the water resulting from summer heating of the surface.
 While previous studies have revealed that oxygen depletion has occurred in the central Baltic at various points in time in the past several thousand years, the latest study looks at how oxygen levels have changed in coastal waters.
Writing in the journal Biogeosciences, the team, from Finland and Germany, describe how they probed the issue by removing two four-metre-long cores from a site between the coasts of Sweden and Finland. 
The team used a host of measures to analyse one of the cores, including looking at the grain sizes of the sediment layers and ratios of different types of elements. They also used both cores to hunt for trace fossil burrows from organisms that lived in the sediment. 
Among the findings, they found clear layers of sediment dating back to just over 100 years, suggesting that animals including bivalves and annelids disappeared from the bottom of the sea from this point.
The upshot was that the researchers were able to reconstruct how oxygen levels at the seafloor have changed over the past 1,500 years, revealing that while the degree of oxygen depletion in coastal areas has varied over the period – largely due to changes in the climate – there has been a marked depletion in the past 100 years or so.
The researchers say they were surprised to find that the steep drop in oxygen levels began before the postwar peak in urbanisation and intensive agriculture in the region in the 1950s. They say a combination of factors is likely to blame, including an uplift of the Baltic area as well as human activity – the latter a factor that appears to have become increasingly important.
“Our evidence of deoxygenation at the beginning of the 20th century suggests that the human influence was felt earlier – in other words, that the system is more sensitive than we thought previously,” Jokinen and Jilbert told the Guardian.
The pair note that since 2007, coastal nations around the Baltic Sea have attempted to improve the situation with an action plan to reduce nutrients flowing into the waters, and that oxygen levels are on the rise in waters off Stockholm. But, they add, global warming might be hindering progress, with no evidence of recovery seen in the regions examined.
 “It is likely delaying the recovery process, because oxygen dissolves less easily in warm water,” they said. 
Callum Roberts, professor of marine conservation at the University of York, who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study.
“Its great strengths are the fine-scale resolution of the timing of changes in conditions, and its ability to take us back all the way to Europe in the dark ages, long before the industrial revolution and modern population growth,” he said. “By doing so, the researchers can separate human from environmental forces shaping the Baltic, to show that Baltic dead zones are the responsibility of those who live along its shores.”
But, he said, the study also raised concerns.
“One troubling finding is that recent efforts to reduce pollution have not yet led to recovery,” said Roberts. “The Baltic is stuck in a vicious cycle in which low oxygen at the seabed releases nutrients trapped in bottom sediments to fuel yet more plankton bloom and bust that causes the dead zones to get bigger.”

Francis made the appeal at a Vatican conference marking the third anniversary of his landmark environmental encyclical “Praise Be.” The document, meant to spur action at the 2015 Paris climate conference, called for a paradigm shift in humanity’s relationship with Mother Nature.
In his remarks, Francis urged governments to honor their Paris commitments and said institutions such as the IMF and World Bank had important roles to play in encouraging reforms promoting sustainable development.
“There is a real danger that we will leave future generations only rubble, deserts and refuse,” he warned.
The Paris accord, reached by 195 countries, seeks to avoid some of the worst effects of climate change by curbing global greenhouse gas emissions via individual, non-binding national plans. President Donald Trump has said the US will pull out of the accord negotiated by his predecessor unless he can get a better deal.
Friday’s conference was the latest in a series of Vatican initiatives meant to impress a sense of urgency about global warming and the threat it poses in particular to the world’s poorest and most marginalised people.
Recently, Francis invited oil executives and investors to the Vatican for a closed-door conference where he urged them to find alternatives to fossil fuels. He warned climate change was a challenge of “epochal proportions”.
Next year, Francis has called a three-week synod, or meeting of bishops, specifically to address the church’s response to the ecological crisis in the Amazon, where deforestation threatens what he has called the “lung” of the planet and the indigenous peoples who live there
On Friday, Francis also thanked aid groups that rescue and care for migrants and denounced the “sterile hypocrisy” of those who turn a blind eye to the world’s poor seeking security and a dignified life.
Francis celebrated a mass for migrants and those who care for them in St Peter’s Basilica, calling attention to their plight as Europe, the US and other countries increasingly closing their doors, ports and borders to them.
The intimate service marked the fifth anniversary of Francis’ landmark visit to Lampedusa, the Sicilian island that for years was the primary destination of migrants smuggled from Libya to Europe. During that trip, Francis’ first outside Rome after his 2013 election, he denounced the “globalisation of indifference” that the world showed migrants fleeing war, poverty and climate-induced natural disasters.
Speaking in his native Spanish, Francis thanked the representatives of aid groups in the pews for embodying the Good Samaritan “who stopped to save the life of the poor man beaten by bandits”.
“He didn’t ask where he was from, his reasons for travelling or his documents. he simply decided to care for him and save his life,” the pope said.

The report sees the essential causes of high electricity prices in recent years as market-dominant companies (including via vertical integration), an inadequate regulatory framework that has been gamed by participants, and product ranges and information designed to hinder rather than help consumer choice. To these structural problems have been added more recent, sector-specific issues: the lack of a coherent climate action policy for the last decade (due to the climate denialism of the Liberal and National parties, but the ACCC doesn’t say that), the age of existing coal-fired power assets, gas exports and flawed subsidies for household solar. 
None of this is a staggeringly novel insight.

First, big, old, low-cost, coal-ﬁred power stations closed (Northern in South Australia in 2016 and Hazelwood in Victoria in 2017). Although they were low-cost to operate, they faced big maintenance bills that weren’t worth paying given low market prices as a result of historic oversupply. Their closure reduced supply and so pushed prices up. This accounts for about 60 per cent, or $6 billion, of the increase in the value of electricity traded annually in the NEM between 2015 and 2017. 
Second, the price of key inputs, especially gas and black coal, rose just when the plants they fuel were needed more often, pushing prices up still further. This accounts for nearly 40 per cent of the increase. In both cases, the market responded efﬁciently and appropriately to the changing circumstances.
The third issue is that major electricity generators ‘game’ the system: they use their power in concentrated markets to create artificial scarcity of supply and so force prices up. Gaming has mainly occurred in Queensland and South Australia, but there are signs of it in Victoria since the closure of Hazelwood, and it could emerge in NSW as supply tightens with the scheduled closure of the Liddell coal-fired power station in 2022.

“The analysis confirmed what the networks and their investors have known for many years – that Australia’s monopoly electricity networks are achieving many multiples of the returns being achieved by Australia’s best performing ASX 50 companies.”
Successive Australian governments have gifted the energy distribution and transmission industries a return on investment which Asian billionaires dream about; stable, heady profits without peer in domestic markets, and indeed internationally.
Just how peerless are these profits? 
Hugh Grant lays them out , detailing the returns for Powerlink, Queensland’s electricity transmission network, over 15 years.
They have attacked the regulator’s ruling, saying their spending was efficient and they should be allowed to pass the cost on to consumers.
Underlying the whole issue is a messy set of problems and half fixes: 
a market that’s not really a market; 
a regulator that can have its rulings picked over by networks and challenged in very selective ways; and 
a legal process that benefits parties with more resources – and 
the networks out-resource both the regulator and consumers.
Endeavour Energy, Essential Energy and Ausgrid challenged the decision.
Australia's retail energy markets have a multitude of private players but the big three are AGL Energy, Origin Energy and EnergyAustralia, which dominate southern and eastern Australia.
The trio jointly supply more than 70 per cent of small electricity customers and more than 80 per cent of small gas customers, as of June 30, 2015.

The ACCC report criticises the current state of the electricity market as “unacceptable and unsustainable”. 
The report said that large companies engaged in both electricity generation and retail have a strong position in the market and often charge a large premium on the sale of wholesale electricity to their own retail operations.
As I've alluded to in posts below.
The ACCC recommended that there should be a cap on any further merger or acquisition by a company with more than 20% generation market share, although building new generation would be allowed.
The report warned consumers face a “confusing and unfair” market including “misleading” discounts and on-time discounts that operate as harsh late penalties when not met. It recommended the Australian Energy Regulator set a default or benchmark rate for households and small businesses to compare discounts.

Lower prices for wholesale users in Australia ironically will benefit some of the same wholesalers who are price gouging us to death and who own aspects of the retail, generating, transmission and distribution of our nation's power supply.

“ACCC backs Northern Territory gas pipeline project to bust east coast monopoly pricing”
A shocking lie.
Yet here is Turnbull giving those already in control of the east coast monopoly further control of our gas supplies in the NT where CSG rape has been approved by NT Labor!
ACCC chairman Rod Sims backed the ugly duckling that is the NT gas industry and its plans to build a pipeline to Queensland.
Again the ACCC is bullshitting us to save their own bacon:
Northern Gas Pipeline project backed as ""new competitive force"" in east coast gas industryACCC report found widespread monopoly pricing by pipeline operators
NT ""could play significant role"" in gas industry, job creation we are told.
The $800 million Northern Gas Pipeline (NGP) project was flagged as a significant step by the ACCC, Turnbull and NT Labor to breaking monopolistic practices that are keeping east coast gas prices at unfair levels.
The ACCC has been waging its usual war of words with the gas industry and published a report earlier which found that a large number of pipeline operators have been engaging in monopoly pricing, but noting there was little regulatory pressure to stop the market abuse.
The ACCC found less than 20 per cent of the transmission pipelines on the east coast are currently subject to regulation under the National Gas Law and National Gas Rules.
The damning assessment found that the price gouging was exacerbated by tightness in the domestic market as new gas sources were primarily piped to LNG plants in Queensland for export.

Under current accounting rules, emissions generated during the manufacture and transport of agricultural inputs — such as fertilisers, herbicides, pesticides and agricultural machinery — are not counted as agricultural emissions. Emissions from the fuel used by agricultural vehicles either on-farm or in transporting produce and the fuel used to generate electricity consumed on farm is also excluded.

This means you suffer more of the ""elected dictatorship/oligarchy"" syndrome than we do (and all democracies do to a certain extent);- The UK does not have ranked choice (aka preferential aka alternate) voting. I don't know how that referendum in 2011 or 2012 failed. I thought Australia can be stupid at times, but the people of the UK rejecting it because of some stupid illogic that some people get 2 votes (they don't) really was a stupendous missed opportunity to give more power to the people and better government. There is a push to get this in the United States for obvious reasons, but it seems even the Democratic Party would rather be out of power for the next 2 generations than to allow erosion of the toxic 2 party system;- The UK does not have compulsory voting. This is contentious, but I reckon leads to far better governments than we would have otherwise. With compulsory voting, our poor and our young get a more proportionate say in the government that affects them more than any other constituency. While on principle I despise organisations like the EU (unless of course, the people sign over their sovereignty via referendum, which did not happen with Majors' signing of the Maastricht Treaty), I can promise you that if you had compulsory voting, Remain would have won.
I had other ideas to reform democracy in Australia which I posted in a recent comment in a separate article: https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jul/09/coal-deal-to-appease-coalition-mps-could-kill-energy-guarantee-act-warns#comment-117999545
But democracy is inherently dangerous and cannot fail-safe safeguard from totalitarianism. However, at least a far more proportionally representative and accountable democracy means that if totalitarianism happens via democratic means (eg Germany 1933) then the people cannot escape blame when their country is a smoking ruin (eg Germany 1945).
So in a representative and accountable democracy, I think it is too easy to blame the politicians, when it is the people who elected them should be blamed.

And that, therefore, must be bad.
Except that it is not. The Coalition’s emissions target, signed off by Abbott when he was Prime Minister, requires a reduction of just 26 per cent in electricity sector emissions from 2005 to 2030.
That target will probably be met by 2020, or soon after, thanks to all the wind and solar farms being built to meet the renewable energy target — the mechanism that the Coalition tried to kill, but couldn’t.
Turnbull has been careful not to offend Abbott and his mates any further, and while he could do nothing to stop the wind and solar investment boom and ensuing emissions reductions, he has taken care not to introduce any other policy to cut emissions in other sectors.
That leaves Australia in no position at all to get anywhere near its modest and low-ball Paris climate commitment, let alone the increased targets it will be under pressure from the international community to produce in 2019.
Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the Energy Security Board and an army of “experts” imported from the energy industry – many from the incumbents trying to defend their turf – are racing to cobble together the biggest rewrite of the National Electricity Rules since they were created two decades ago.

Senator Burston, who quit One Nation last month and now represents the rival United Australia Party set up by billionaire Clive Palmer, has sent the electoral commission a statutory declaration that raises the questions over a breach of the rules.
“It appears to me that the registration of Pauline Hanson’s One Nation has relied upon ‘members’ who are not party members,” Mr Burston wrote.
“As a member of the Senate, I am obligated to report this alleged breach of process to you, which may amount to electoral fraud.”
Senator Burston sent the authorities a statutory declaration from his twin brother, Graham Burston, who convinced people to join the party last year but now warns that some were not really members.
At issue is the way the party gathered the 750 names it needed to gain registration in NSW earlier this year, knowing it had to finish the process a full year before the state election due on March 23 in order to contest the poll.
One Nation executive secretary Rod Miles warned colleagues by email last October that members had to be “paid up” under the party’s constitution.
In his statutory declaration, signed on 22 June this year, Graham Burston says he was asked by One Nation to obtain as many declarations of party membership as he could in order to register the party in NSW.
“The request was made of me after the party had failed in its first attempt at registration,” he states.
“I collected 13 signed forms dated around the end of December 2017. To my knowledge none of the forms were signed by current members of Pauline Hanson’s One Nation Party.
“No membership fees were collected.”

Australia is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and it is in our national interest to support effective global action. The Paris agreement sets a common multilateral platform that allows for domestic flexibility to make contributions to emissions reductions acknowledging the scale of the challenge is greater than any one country’s capacity to act.
Critically, the rules are being written and formalised this year into a rulebook guiding how the Paris agreement will be implemented. Australia needs to have a seat at the table if we are to ensure the interests of our energy intensive, export-orientated economy are represented.
Without active engagement in the process to negotiate and implement the Paris rulebook, Australia will suffer the consequences of not being able to optimise our national interest around how markets, technology, trade and finance flows develop in the transition to a low carbon economy. For example, the rules being negotiated around article 6 of the agreement involve how transfers and trade in emissions will occur between parties. 
As our domestic policy settings will inevitably tighten, Australia’s large-emitting businesses will want access to international permits and conversely our world class domestic offset market will want to export credits to a world short in supply. Accelerated clean energy and technology transfer and climate finance will also be part of expanded trade-related rules stemming from the Paris rulebook.
Despite the mis-truths espoused regularly by some conservative politicians and parts of the Australian media, rapid developments are taking place in India and China to transform their economies and meet their increasingly ambitious climate change commitments. Our exports sit in the supply chain of global markets, where there is increasingly an explicit price on carbon. We don’t want to be locked out of these markets, or worse, penalised through trade and economic sanctions if Australia is seen to be out of alignment with global developments.
When President Trump announced he was leaving the Paris agreement, US businesses and state and local governments rallied and formed a “We are still in” coalition. More than 2,800 organisations have signed a commitment that they stand by the Paris agreement and are committed to its goals. The message from this powerful grouping has been loud and clear: that participation in the Paris agreement helps strengthen competitiveness, create jobs, markets and growth and reduces business risks.
Australian businesses and financial institutions are also attuned to the business risks and opportunities climate change presents. There is increasing recognition at board and executive management levels that climate change poses material financial and strategic risks. Leading businesses are starting to adopt the new framework issued by the Financial Stability Board Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), to assess and disclose the emerging risks, opportunities and financial implications climate change poses for their business. The primary driver for this initiative is to protect shareholder value. Australian companies are starting to build resilience and play their part in supporting the transition to a net-zero carbon emissions economy.
The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, should be commended for her forthright unequivocal support for maintaining commitment to the Paris agreement. She was spot on when she announced at the time of Australia’s ratification of the Paris agreement in 2016 that: “The Australian government has determined that ratifying the Paris agreement is in our national interests and will provide great opportunities for Australian businesses.” 
She went on to say, “The global low emissions economy is estimated to be worth around $6tn and is growing at some 4-5% per annum. We believe that through the use of technology and research and science and innovation, there will be many opportunities for Australian businesses, Australian jobs in a low emissions economy.”
In Australia, climate change has impacts and economic consequences across infrastructure, property, regional security, disaster management, agriculture, fisheries and forestry, tourism and importantly, but not well documented, the health and wellbeing of communities.
Any ill-informed opinion that it is in Australia’s interest to leave the Paris agreement is economically, environmentally and socially irresponsible.
As far as Australian business is concerned, “We are still in”. 
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

First off, I will say I can see why you would find it compelling if you already thought climate change was a cleverly orchestrated scam. It has selected quotes that play to that perception. It utterly fails to show how those quotes play into anything wider, or to show what actual flaws in the science result, but if you want it to be true you won't worry about that. Now bear with me while I show how it is wrong.
But before I do that, an observation: if this is your clincher, open with it. You've made dozens of comments on here - the vast majority of which are factually wrong in the most obvious way. This does not bother you, fine, but you will understand why I am less optimistic about a blog linked to by somebody who has posted a sequence of false statements than I might be by somebody who opened by saying 'climate science worries people but I read this'.
To the article. The most obvious problem is that it suggests that somehow Ravetz' model of PNS was a blueprint for how scientists globally should operate. It's maybe hard to explain how stupid this looks to anyone with any knowledge of either Ravetz or of scientists; but you can perhaps think how unlikely it is that any field of business anywhere would be determined by a few articles.
Something similar goes for Hulme. he is presented as the unguarded spokesperson for a socialist plot (from the way it uses socialist as a dirty word, I'd guess it's an American blog?). Again, this is hugely qquestion begging. Since when did all scientists share the same politics? Why does the article not consider at all whether Hulme is a fair spokesperson? If it is a socialist conspiracy, what do the socialists hope to get from it, and how much longer will they go on waiting?
It's like me claiming to prove climate change is a problem, because Monckton is so obviously an idiot. You don't disprove an argument by a character assassination of one of its proponents. The real way to disprove climate change will never be alleging that all scientists are operating to a plan drawn from a handful of social science articles. It will be to show why the objective, normal science in the journals is wrong.

Sea level rise in the past century is measured in millimeters, not meters. Global temperature rise as measured the only truly objective way, using satellites, is 0.3C. Reports of storms being deadlier can be traced solely to --- the fact that there are more people living in the affected areas, and in fact the PERCENT of people affected who actually die from storms is substantially down due to better weather reporting.
Now, before you go cry to your mummy that I'm a ""denier,"" I don't care either way about the climate science. I don't care because I've actually read the report, and if the U.N. Report on Climate Change is 100% correct then AGW is already over and nobody's going to die from it. The reason it is over has nothing to do with climate science, it is because we are on the verge of toppling oil and coal and gas as the cheapest forms of energy for most applications on most parts of the globe. EVs are predicted now by the experts to be cheaper than ICE by 2025, and solar plus batteries will be cheaper than coal by 2028. No matter what governments do or don't do, people will then start switching en-masse. Carbon emissions from fossil fuels will reach about zero by 2070 or so, and even spending trillions of tax dollars won't make it possible to change the peak global temperatures by more than 0.05C - not enough to humanly notice.

Episodes of extreme heat and precipitation are increasing as a result of climate change. Although it is not possible to attribute the individual extreme events of June and July to climate change, they are compatible with the general long-term trend due to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases.
Many recent studies have found that the probability of the extreme event has been influenced by human activity, either directly or indirectly.. Of a set of 131 studies published between 2011 and 2016 in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 65% found that the event’s probability was significantly affected by anthropogenic activities.

The devastation near Hiroshima looks like a bomb had hit. 
This could be written off as a fluke event, a combination of unusual circumstances: Such things happen every century or so. That's also what the folks in Ellicott City Maryland thought.

technically, it has been warmer.
But not with a human civilisation.
And the rate of warming is unprecedented.
Twio salient points you have ignored.
the former will imperil humanity's civilisation due to population movement, costs of moving infrastructure, problems with agriculture etc.
The later will exacerbate agricultural challenges whilst damaging the ecosystems we rely on.

That might be an extreme assumption on my part, so I want to clarify.
In the interest of efficiency, I'll explain more of my meaning before you respond.
We are ultimately talking about hypotheticals, educated guesses on what might happen in the future. The nature of which includes some amount of uncertainty. Hence the word ""may"" in my sentence ""This may end up being a net win for life on Earth as a whole.""
Now, I do not believe that the subject of this debate, climate change, will be severe enough to kill off all life on Earth. It could kill off thousands upon thousands if species, but not all life. There will be survivors.
We don't know for sure what will come of those survivors, but to me it is likely that the Earth will once again become inhabited by numerous creatures, ones we've never seen before, decendents of the survivors that are better adapted to live in this new climate.
I believe this because our climate has been ever changing. The ""desert"" I live in today was a lush forrest many millennia ago and many species of plants/animals thrived in that forrest look nothing like the plants/animals that thrive (I use that term loosely, it is a desert after all) here today.
My point is that despite all the doom and gloom we hear about climate change and the many animals it's killing off today, we forget that change is constant and think myopically about it. Species have always gone extinct and new ones form, it's the way of our planet. 
We can feel bad about all the suffering of known creatures today (which I think we do plenty of, but little else). However, we can also include species yet unknown in our thoughts that will thrive in the future environment.

",article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/09/the-guardian-view-on-climate-change-a-global-heatwave,373,"The British are parochial about weather. It is our cherished grievance, not to be shared with foreigners. Perhaps it is the fact that our weather tends to come from the west, across the Atlantic, and not from our neighbours in Europe (unless it’s a “beast from the east”) which reinforces the belief that our weather is a uniquely British problem. But though we cannot say definitively that the current heatwave is caused by carbon emissions, it fits the pattern of long-term changes that we call climate. It is part of a global phenomenon, even if not the most important part. The really significant change is happening in eastern Siberia at the moment, where a completely unprecedented heatwave is warming that Arctic coastline, with consequences that are unpredictable in detail but surely bad on a large scale.
Siberia is a vulnerable point in the global climate system for two reasons. The obvious one is the Arctic ice. The more that melts, the less remains to reflect heat back into the atmosphere. Water, being dark, absorbs heat better so there is a feedback loop set up. That is worrying, but it may be less dangerous than the feedback caused by the melting of the layer formerly known as the permafrost. This releases carbon and methane – more methane will be released from under the warming sea – and both are powerful greenhouse gases. Instability in the Arctic affects the whole of the northern hemisphere, as it increases the chances that the northern jet stream, will stick for longer than usual in a particular pattern. When that happens, the weather stops changing in the affected areas. Heatwaves are prolonged and so are cold snaps. Extremes of every sort, such as the rains in Japan which have killed more than 100 people, become more likely. What seems to be happening at the moment is that a fixation of the jet stream has produced the heatwave in Siberia as well as ours here. Again, this is yet another feedback loop. This is a heatwave which makes further, hotter heatwaves more likely in the future.
Although there is enormous uncertainty about the exact progression of climate change, the direction of travel is entirely clear. This is a problem that demands coordinated global action. The Paris accords are an effort in that direction, but they are being sabotaged. British, or English nationalism about the weather is mildly comical but the selfish and ignorant attitudes of the Trump administration are purely tragic for the whole world. Still, there is more chance of changing the climate than there is of changing the mind of Mr Trump. While the US continues to sulk on climate change and to be driven by short-term imperatives of profit, the best any British government can do is to prepare for a change in the weather here. In 20 years’ time, the heat of the last week will no longer be news. It will be routine. The effect on old people, on schools, and on hospitals will be grim. A responsible government would be planning for this perfectly foreseeable outcome. Ours, however, is otherwise  preoccupied.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

Firstly nobody will fund flood defenses until recurring flooding has actually happened that is just human nature I'm afraid.
BQEND
Flooding has already occurred ( https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/science/flooding-of-coast-caused-by-global-warming-has-already-begun.html )
And we do plan for potential future flooding, Miami is spending a fortune on pumps, based on what we currently know about the ice sheets--except places like N Carolina which passed legislation against planning for sea level rise--but the problem is we have a wide range of scenarios for future sea level rise which makes planning problematic. Do we plan for a meter of sea level rise over the next century or several?
But we don't plan enough, e.g. New Orleans and Katrina. And many places are indefensible against sea level rise. So at some point we need to plan how to most efficiently retreat from areas not worth trying to save.

secondly that they have already calculated how many low lying areas are due to flood and have estimated the amount of public protest it will generate compared against the majority of the public who will not be flooded and have calculated that it will be manageable.

No, I think it was an attempt at ""parody"" or ""caricature"". Unfortunately any communication using only the written word, e.g. anonymously posting on the Internet, risks being misunderstood if irony or sarcasm is included (Google ""Poe's Law"").
It has been known for over 2000 years that when people ""discuss"" things anyone using argumentum ad verecundiam, more commonly known as ""argument from authority"", is guilty of a logical fallacy.
Just because someone is ""a doctor"" doesn't guarantee that what they are saying is ""correct / true"".

The newly discovered increased mass loss in Wilkes Land suggests that the ocean heat flux may already be influencing ice dynamics in the marine-based sector of the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS).

Counterintuitively sea level rise is not uniform globally for many reasons such as land subsidence and lift, ocean currents and winds and even the strong gravitational field of the massive ice sheets.
The gravity from the ice sheet pulls the ocean towards it, as it loses mass the ocean relaxes away, so for example the loss of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet would cause global mean sea level rise of around 3.3m, but over 4m in the North which has a more populated coast.

1213I've lived and worked on the river since the early 70's. I have tide tables that predicted the tides from 1970 - 1974. The very highest tide in those four years was six metres. Two years ago we had a predicted seven metre tide. The highest tide we've had is 7.47m which was a storm surge.
We're half way up the channel, the river is no longer dredged, and there are fertilisers coming down from up river, the estuary is rising. There are many many contributory factors to our rising tides, isometric rebound anyone. It's odd to see my town start to defend itself. The beach was raised by a metre fifteen years ago.

The original post I reacted to was Erik's ""TODAY we’re having problems with around 4mm/yr SLR"" comment.
There are 2 different issues regarding the subject of ""The oceans and (anthropogenic) global warming / climate change"".
1) An increase in sea level (SLR), due to a combination of ""thermal expansion"" and ice-sheet melting, which as water is a fluid will be (almost) evenly distributed around the globe (to a first approximation, see this subsequent comment by Erik about 8 ""above"" this one).
2) An increase in sea surface temperatures (SST), which are widely speculated will eventually cause an increase in the frequency and/or intensity of future hurricanes / typhoons / tropical storms (though there is no supporting empirical evidence of that TODAY).
Future ""extreme weather events"" (e.g. a category 5 hurricane strike ...) will definitely exacerbate the impacts of SLR (flooding / contamination of fresh water supplies with salt water or brine / ...), but many of those problems will occur whatever ""level"" the sea has risen to when YOU ARE HIT BY A CATEGORY 5 HURRICANE (see : Puerto Rico).

How about the low lying Pacific Islands such as Kiribati?
BQEND
For any local / regional SLR discussion the local ""vertical tectonics"" must be taken into account.
The PSMSL tide gauge data for Betio (just north of Kiribati) is only available from 1994/5 and shows a strong ENSO influence (especially for 1997/8 but much less so for 2015/6, bizarrely ...).
The PSMSL Betio webpage graphs show tide levels in the range 6850-7100mm from 1994 to 2017 (excluding the 1997/8 ""dip""), but with less than 25 years worth of data it is difficult to discern an overall trend (""flat"" ??? ... only possibly !).
From the article you chose to link to :
BQSTART
It’s hardly surprising that there is a palpable sense of anxiety and fear about the future of the islands. That’s compounded by the media-fuelled speculation and sensationalism about the entire population of Kiribati becoming climate change refugees, which has driven and also feeds off this fear. 
...
There are three key factors driving this havoc upon South Tarawa.
1. The tricks of El Niño & La Niña...In 2000, a sort of natural switch flicked (this is what is called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation), and we have since seen a predominance of La Niña years, and with that, sea levels forcing upward.
...
3. Climate change is causing sea level riseAt the same time, underlying sea level rise caused by climate change, continues to push tide level higher. That contribution caused by climate change while relatively low at present, is as the graph below shows, on track to becoming significantly more devastating. It’s this concoction of forces that is wreaking serious havoc in South Tarawa and across many atoll islands But whether life on the atolls become[s] untenable depends [] on our course of action now.
...
What does the future hold for Kiribati?Scientific modelling, and history suggest that the current trend of La Niña domination is likely to continue for another 10-20 years. That means continued upward pushing of sea levels. Following that, it is likely that it would flip back into El Niño dominance for another 20 – 30 years, which would work to suppress sea levels somewhat, perhaps giving something of a reprieve from climate change forced sea level rise.

But the major issues are more to do with flooding (rising sea levels only affects the coastlines, not the far larger interior of countries - other people), high winds and more powerful storms. But those are temporary effects. Once they are gone, people will just go back to normal.
People are very adaptable, they adjust to living in the coldest places on Earth and the hottest. They also have short memories: prioritising the immediate over the important.

They are rising for two reasons. First, and perhaps most obvious, ice is melting. There is a tremendous amount of ice locked away in Greenland, Antarctica, and in glaciers. As the world warms, that ice melts and the liquid water flows to the oceans. 
The other reason why water is rising is that warmer water is less dense – it expands. This expansion causes the surface of the water to rise.
Rising oceans are a big deal. About 150 million people live within 1 meter (3 feet) of sea level. About 600 million live within 10 meters (33 feet) of sea level. As waters rise, these people will have to go somewhere. It is inevitable that climate refugees will have to move their homes and workplaces because of rising waters. 
In some places, humans will be able to build sea walls to block off the water’s rise. But, in many places, that won’t be possible. For instance, Miami, Florida has a porous base rock that allows sea water to permeate through the soils. You cannot wall that off. In other places, any sea walls would be prohibitively expensive. 
It isn’t just the inevitable march of sea level that is an issue. Rising waters make storm surges worse. A great example is Superstorm Sandy, which hit the US East Coast in 2012. It cost approximately $65 bn of damage. The cost was higher because of sea level rise caused by global warming.
Climate scientists do their best to project how much and how fast oceans will rise in the future. These projections help city planners prepare future infrastructure. My estimation is that oceans will be approximately 1 meter higher in the year 2100; that is what our infrastructure should be prepared for. What I don’t know is how much this will cost us as a society.
A very recent paper was published that looked into this issue. The authors analyzed the cost of sea level if we limit the Earth to 1.5°C or 2°C warming. They also considered the future cost using “business as usual” scenarios. 
What the authors found was fascinating. If humans take action to limit warming to 1.5°C, they estimate sea level will rise 52 cm by the year 2100. If humans hold global warming to 2°C, sea levels will rise by perhaps 63 cm by 2100.
The difference (11 cm) could cost $1.4 tn per year if no other societal adaptation is made. This is a staggering number and in itself, should motivate us to take action.
But the authors went further, they considered an even higher future temperature scenario (one that is essentially business as usual). With that future, global annual flood costs would increase to a whopping $14 tn per year. 
In the study, the authors considered which countries and regions would suffer most. It turns out upper middle income countries will be worse off, particularly China. Higher-income countries have a slightly better prognosis because of their present flood protection standards. But make no mistake about it, we will all suffer and the suffering will be very costly. 
There are four important takeaways from this study. First, while the economic costs are large, there is some range of projections. The actual costs may be lower or higher than the median predicted in the study. This is largely due to the fact that we don’t know how fast Greenland and Antarctica will melt. If they melt faster than projected, things will be worse than what I’ve described here.
Second, adaptation will help. By adaptation I mean making our societies less susceptible to sea level rise. For example, building sea walls when possible, building new infrastructure away from coasts, putting in natural breaks to limit storm surge during large storms, and making infrastructure more water-resistant.
Third, what we do now matters. If we can get off the high-emissions business as usual scenarios – if we can increase investment in clean and renewable energy – we can reduce the future costs.
Finally, while scientists often use 2100 as a benchmark year, it isn’t like oceans will stop rising then. In fact, we are committing ourselves to hundreds of years of rising oceans. The ocean has a lot of climate inertia. Once it starts rising, you cannot stop it. So, by focusing only on the year 2100, we are deluding ourselves into underestimating the long term costs. 
This research shows it’s important to connect climate science with economic science. Too often, social scientists and economists with very little climate science understanding have tried to tell us that climate change is not a problem. Whenever you hear an economist or a social scientist give you a rosy future prediction, take it with a grain of salt. Their opinion is worthless without being backed by physical understanding. And the loudest economists and social scientists often have very little of this physical understanding.

Roofs, towers and spires are threatened by strong winds and more frequent storms.
The trust saw a 26% year-on-year increase in applications for grants for urgent repairs, maintenance and development projects in 2017, its annual review says.
A total of 480 churches and chapels around the country sought financial help from the trust, which awarded 230 grants worth £1.7m – an increase of £300,000 compared with 2016.
Claire Walker, the trust’s chief executive, said many church buildings had reached a tipping point due to the combined impact of climate change, cuts to Heritage Lottery Fund grants and the end of the government-funded roof repair scheme for listed places of worship.
“The intensity of extreme weather patterns, including heavier rainfalls and storms, is putting church gutters and drains under strain, and systems designed in the past cannot cope,” she said.
“Looking to the future, the impact of climate change could have a serious impact on the UK’s historic churches. Higher levels of rainfall in the UK, such as the 20% increase seen in Scotland since the 1960s, with more cycles of wetting and drying, will cause damage to timber and stonework. Stronger winds and more frequent storms will threaten roofs, towers and spires.
“Climate change is also making the UK ever more vulnerable to invasive pests. The biggest danger for church buildings would be from termites, which are now widespread in France, with infestations being found close to the Channel coast.”
Termites can cause extensive damage to structural timber. The pests excavate it from the inside, leaving a thin skin of unharmed wood which can conceal the damage being caused.
The only colony of termites known to have become established in the UK was found in south Devon in the 1990s. It was eliminated after years of action by government agencies.
Among the churches awarded grants by the trust last year were St Botolph’s in Boston, Lincolnshire, a Grade I-listed building and the UK’s largest parish church, which received £40,000 for roof repairs.
The Grade II-listed St David’s Old Church in Llanwrtyd, Wales, which has a recorded history spanning more than 1,000 years, received £20,000 from the trust for urgent repairs to stonework and gutters.

A provocative case, it’s already generated some discussion. Here, I want to pick up a point that might be easily missed amongst fights over the role of biomedicine: the all-too-small amount of resource being put towards decarbonising energy.
As the Nesta report points out, we’ve seen changing priorities for UK research over the last 25 years. Defence-related R&amp;D fell by more than half between 1995 and 2015, to 16%. Health-related research was a key beneficiary of this ‘peace dividend’, now accounting for just under a quarter of total expenditure. In contrast, research into energy received only 2.5% of the pot in 2015.
Like Jones and Wilsdon, I don’t want to argue against health R&amp;D. It’s clearly a major priority. But decarbonising our energy system must also be another, especially in the rapidly-closing window of opportunity we have to avoid catastrophic global warming. Tackling climate change is, in all seriousness, the fight of our lives (the word “moonshot” doesn’t cover the half of it).
Of course, dealing with climate change isn’t just about R&amp;D. Indeed, it can feel silly to be talking about how the UK should invest more in low carbon innovation when there is currently a ban on something as basic as onshore wind (a British innovation of the 1880s). There were, for example, some wonderfully warm words from energy minister Claire Perry about the Q-Bot insulation robot at the Parliamentary Sustainable Energy Group conference last week. But it did also feel like a distraction from last month’s Committee on Climate Change report, which criticised the government’s “shocking” lack of action when it comes to simple and low cost options like onshore wind, home insulation and planting trees.
We also need to invest in infrastructure and public engagement with low carbon technology if we’re going to make the transition to those technologies happen, and happen fairly. We should be wary of assuming the private sector is going to be sufficient here, just as we should be wary of assuming it can pick up the bill for innovation, or regulate itself (or that crowdfunding or community energy - though powerful levers for change - are enough). 
The rise of electric cars is a good example. Like many low carbon technologies, these may well prove to be unstoppable - to use a term favoured by climate action evangelists - but it’s hard to see how the market acting alone will be anywhere near fast enough, or evenly distributed. Elon Musk fans might be one part of the puzzle, but the shiny innovation fairy - powerful as she is - shouldn’t distract us from any of the other vital work required. 
It’s a good time to start worrying about UK R&amp;D though. As Jones and Wilsdon’s timely report emphasises, how we fund UK R&amp;D is about to shift, and with that comes opportunities. Earlier this year, the PM announced the government aims to invest 2.4% of GDP in R&amp;D by 2027, up from its current level of 1.7%. We’ve also seen our cohort of research councils - currently split loosely by discipline into medicine, physics, earth science etc - brought together with Innovate UK into a new larger body, UK Research and Innovation, with a combined budget of more than £6.5 bn. It’s a shift that many people working in universities seem obsessed with - complete with its own parody twitter account - but few people outside the research bubble seem to have noticed.
If you’re interested in UK politics, you should be interested in what we spend on R&amp;D. 2.4% of our economy is no small change. There’s a hackneyed old CP Snow line about scientists having the future in their bones, but the future is far too important to leave to such a small (and, let’s admit it, rather closed) community.
So it surprises me that there isn’t more complaint from the climate movement when it comes to issues like the makeup of the UKRI board. Not only is it dominated by biomedicine, but two of its 16 members - Alice Gast and John Browne - have direct links to the fossil fuel industry. There are some impressive names on that board, but if we’re talking about people with “future in their bones”, I’m not convinced the future they are brewing is a low carbon one.
Maybe in time for the government’s “Green Great Britain” week in October we might hope to see some climate leadership coming out of UKRI?

Lord Deben, chair of the UK’s Climate Change Committee (CCC), said “anyone who read the news” could see mounting evidence of alarming trends – from melting polar ice to record heatwaves and rising sea levels. He called on politicians to “make the connections” between these events and act with more urgency.
“The thing that I want to bring home to policymakers is that this is increasingly urgent and that these things will be laid at your door if you don’t recognise that and act accordingly.”
Deben compared the threat posed by climate change to the black death, adding: “With the black death, where one in three of the population died, we did not know how it happened, how it spread, so we were not responsible. 
“With climate change we do know and so we are responsible. So it is no good saying ‘oh well, it will all work out one way or another’. We are responsible, and if we don’t take on that responsibility we are shoving it on to our children and no parent should do that in any circumstances.”
Lord Deben’s intervention comes as record high temperatures are being set across much of the world, intensifying concerns about climate change.
In the UK the heatwave has contributed to wildfires but environmentalists have expressed exasperation at the government’s environment policies – especially the decision to push ahead with Heathrow expansion and, on the same day, the cancellation of a huge tidal lagoon project in south Wales.
Critics said it revealed that much of the governing class – including those Labour MPs who supported the government’s Heathrow expansion plans – had failed to grasp of the scale of the threat posed by climate change
Lord Deben praised some politicians, including climate change minister Claire Perry, but warned there was a widespread lack of urgency.
“Anybody who has been reading the newspapers will know there is a serious issue about Arctic ice, there are serious issues about Antarctic ice … the current hot period we are experiencing in Britain at the moment does remind us that we have had most of the hottest years we have had in the past 10 to 15 years.
“If you add all that to the rising of the sea levels and what is happening to the permafrost, you put those things together – [you] can’t put down any one of them to this year’s global warming, but you can put all of them down together to climate change in general.”
The CCC’s annual report, published last month, found the UK is on track to miss its legally binding carbon budgets in 2025 and 2030, due to lack of progress in cutting emissions from buildings and transport.
It also said ministers were spurning low-cost options, such as onshore windfarms, home insulation and tree-planting, meaning people would end up paying more than needed to fight climate change.
Climate scientists have warned that there would be more wildfires like the one on Saddleworth Moor across northern Europe because of climate change.
Deben said that while no one individual weather event could be attributed to climate change the signs of a planet in crisis were undeniable.
“This is extremely urgent because these things are now happening much more often and – in aggregate – it is clearly because of climate change.”
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.

The charity Plan B Earth brought legal action against the government’s stance on the 2050 carbon target, set out under the Climate Change Act 2008.
The charity and 11 UK citizens aged nine to 79 – including the publisher Dame Carmen Callil – wanted to bring a judicial review against the business secretary, Greg Clark.
But Mr Justice Supperstone rejected Plan B Earth’s case on Friday, saying it was “unarguable”.
Lawyers for the charity previously argued the government should have, in light of the current scientific consensus, gone further than its original target of reducing carbon levels by 2050 to 80% of that present in 1990.
They said the decision not to amend the 2050 target put the UK in breach of its international obligations under the Paris agreement on climate change and was influenced by the government’s belief that a “more ambitious target was not feasible”.
At a hearing on 4 July, Jonathan Crow QC told the court: “The secretary of state’s belief that he needs to have regard to what is feasible, rather than what is necessary, betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the scheme of the 2008 act and must be quashed.
“All of the individual claimants are deeply concerned about climate change.”
The barrister argued the business secretary’s “continuing refusal” to amend the 2050 target means the UK is playing “Russian roulette with two bullets, instead of one”.
But, refusing permission for a full hearing, Mr Justice Supperstone said Plan B Earth’s arguments were based on an “incorrect interpretation” of the Paris agreement.
He said: “In my view the secretary of state was plainly entitled ... to refuse to change the 2050 target at the present time.
“I do not consider it arguable that the secretary of state’s refusal to amend the 2050 target is an unlawful exercise of his discretion.”
Tim Crosland, director of Plan B Earth, said the charity was “surprised and disappointed” by the ruling and plans to appeal.
He said: “We consider it clear and widely accepted that the current carbon target is not compatible with the Paris agreement.
“Neither the government nor the committee on climate change suggested during our correspondence with them prior to the claim that the target was compatible.
“Indeed, it was only in January of this year that the committee published a report accepting that the Paris agreement was ‘likely to require’ a more ambitious 2050 target.
“Moreover the government acknowledged in these proceedings that it was uncontroversial that the 2050 target was insufficient to meet the 1.5C target, one of the key aspects of the Paris commitment.
“In these circumstances, Plan B and the other 11 claimants continue to consider that a full hearing on an issue of such urgent and vital importance is necessary.
“As with other legal campaigns confronting powerful vested interests it takes time to break through, and time is not on our side.
“We’ll be doing everything possible to accelerate the process. Wildfires raging in the Arctic Circle must surely be a wake-up call.”

The jet stream – the west-to-east winds that play a big role in determining Europe’s weather – has been further north than usual for about two months. A stationary high-pressure weather system has left the UK and much of continental Europe sweltering. Iceland, by contrast, has been hit with clouds and storms that would normally come further south.
The jet stream’s northerly position may have been influenced by temperatures in the north of the Atlantic, which have been relatively warm in the subtropics and colder south of Greenland.
“The current hot and dry spell in the UK is partly due a combination of North Atlantic ocean temperatures, climate change and the weather,” said Len Shaffrey, a professor of climate science at the University of Reading.
The influence of climate change on the jet stream is still being explored.
The heatwaves in the northern hemisphere are undoubtedly linked to global warming, scientists say. “There’s no question human influence on climate is playing a huge role in this heatwave,” said Prof Myles Allen, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford.
On Thursday the university will publish an analysis of how much more likely climate change made Europe’s current heatwave. Similar heatwaves have happened in the past when the planet was cooler – the world was two-thirds of a degree celsius cooler in 1976, a notably hot year in the UK. But climate change made them happen more often, Allen said.
Prof Peter Stott, a science fellow at the Met Office, said global warming of 1C since the industrial revolution was clearly making extreme heat more likely. “It is increasing quite significantly the risk of such a heatwave. The temperatures of 30C (86F) and above this week have gone from being a very rare occurrence to, not a frequent occurrence, but much more likely,” he said.
The wide geographical spread of the heatwave, right across four continents, also points to global warming as the culprit. “That pattern is something we wouldn’t be seeing without climate change,” Stott said.
Britons are only somewhat worried about climate change, according to the British Social Attitudes tracker. Wildfires, such as those that have occurred recently in northern England, are one reason to be more concerned. “The moorland fires is an example of an impact that comes with such prolonged heatwaves,” Stott said.
Older people are vulnerable to extremes of heat, with 20,000 people believed to have died across Europe in the 2003 heatwave. Transport infrastructure suffers, with rail lines buckling. The other major short-term impact is on agriculture. Shaffrey said the hot, dry spell was wreaking havoc on farming. Heatwaves in other countries will probably cut yields of crops that the UK imports, pushing up prices.
Longer-term, the green and pleasant landscape of the UK may vanish if rainfall patterns change because of global warming. “People might like a Mediterranean climate but it will be very different. For wildlife, a change of that magnitude could be very traumatic because it has nowhere to go,” said Allen.
Yes. “It’s a warning of what we will have to deal with,” said Stott. Michael Mann, a US climate scientist, tweeted: “What we call an ‘extreme heatwave’ today we will simply call ‘summer’ in a matter of decades if we do not sharply reduce carbon emissions.”

Funny; Morano says it's the most important point. I agree it's not very interesting - it's perfectly obvious that the overwhelming majority of qualified experts agree on the basic points, and squabbling over the numbers seems a bit irrelevant.
And of course the consensus could still be wrong. It would only take one scientist to prove all the rest are wrong. So it's notable that nobody has done this. And that Morano doesn't choose to highlight what is wrong with the actual argument.

Why should ""polar amplification"" North of 60 degrees be caused by the Atlantic Meridional Overturning dynamics? 
Please remember that your ""solar magnetic"" force argument is a thing in models. And also that it has been falling over the last half century (so how does falling forcing cause increased warming in one case and cooling in another?) 
Thirdly, if you claim that your ""sun-magnet"" is very strong, you implicitly argue for a larger climate sensitivity than science provide. 
A good denier of climate change should try to avoid for ignorance to the end up with the logical conclusion that climate sensitivity is higher than what physics say. Because it would be counter productive. 
And when you look at global temperatures over the last 1000 years, they have not varied much globally (If science said that, we sure would live on a very scary planet with a climate sensitivity that most certainly would prevent the evolution of higher life forms). 
All your questions have been discussed over the last half century and longer. And all are explained in a introduction text book. 
Do you have any rationale at all for your ""just questions thrown around"" approach to science? 
The simple sollution to all this mess is that CO2 is a greenhouse gass. That was falling out of the sleeves of physics almost 200 years ago. 
To all ""sceptics"", critical rationalism is not equal to asking ""if the moon was a cheese, then laws of gravity must be rewritten because of spesific mass?"" 
In a sense, the question is correct. But it seems that very little evidence for the moon being made up of cheese. 
To make up the cheesy moon paradox is simple. All kids does it. To demonstrate that is scientifically relevant is harder. 
Read any IPCC ""physical science basis"" report you like and you will find in depth discussion on fingerprints (such as polar amplification), the role of AMO (and AMOC), solar variability and its effects, pre-industrial temperature variations (and their causality). 
These reports are free for download. 
I do suggest one pick up a good textbook instead though. Because the IPCC reports are extremely technical, as the mission is just to evaluate the scientific findings over the last 6-7 years.

His career began working for Rush Limbaugh, followed by a job at Cybercast News Service where he launched the ‘Swift Boat’ attacks on 2004 Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. In 2006, Morano became the director of communications for Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK), who is perhaps best known for throwing a snowball on the Senate floor and calling human-caused global warming “the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.”
Thus it’s unsurprising that in 2009, Morano began directing fossil fuel-funded think tanks designed to cast doubt on the reality of and dangers associated with human-caused global warming. As he admitted in Merchants of Doubt, Morano frequently embodies the strategy of climate denial known as ‘fake experts’:
Most recently, Morano created a short video that centers on three common climate myths and has garnered over 5m views on Facebook. 
Morano begins his video by denying the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming. Consensus denial is one of the most popular climate myths, and was the subject of the most widely-shared climate story of 2016.
Morano’s strategy is to critique two of the studies that found a 97% expert consensus. One, published in 2009 by Peter Doran and Maggie Zimmerman surveyed 3,146 Earth scientists, but fewer than 80 of the participants were actively publishing climate science research (and hence experts on the subject). Basically, the critique is that the study sample size was too small to make a conclusive determination about the level of expert consensus. 
That’s a valid point, except this was just one among many such climate consensus studies. In fact, the authors of seven separate consensus studies using a variety of approaches (some with very large sample sizes) teamed up in 2016 to publish a paper concluding that the expert consensus on human-caused global warming is between 90 and 100%. So, this critique is invalid when considering all the available consensus research.
Morano also critiques the consensus study that my colleagues and I published in 2013. He does so simply by quoting economist Richard Tol saying our 97% figure “was pulled from thin air.” Tol argued that the methodology in our study was flawed, but when we applied his critiques in a follow-up paper published in 2014, we found that the consensus was still 97 ± 1%. 
Moreover, Tol himself has said, “The consensus is of course in the high nineties” and “There is no doubt in my mind that the literature on climate change overwhelmingly supports the hypothesis that climate change is caused by humans. I have very little reason to doubt that the consensus is indeed correct.”
In short, Morano’s only evidence to dispute the expert consensus on human-caused global warming is to quote an economist who agrees the consensus is 90–100%, and that the experts are correct that humans are responsible for global warming.
Next in the video, Morano claims that we’re not actually in the midst of the hottest period on record, and that ‘hottest year’ claims are “merely political statements” because for example, he claims, scientists can’t say with 100% certainty that 2016 was hotter than 2015 due to the margin of uncertainty in the data. This claim is similar to one made on Fox News that earned a ‘Pants on Fire’ rating from Politifact based on consultation with climate scientists. 2014 through 2017 are indeed the four hottest years on record, outside the range of uncertainty.
Morano concludes the video by claiming “the most outrageous myth of all is that carbon dioxide is somehow the control knob of the climate.” Ironically, Nasa climate scientists published a paper in 2010 titled, “Atmospheric CO2: Principal Control Knob Governing Earth’s Temperature.” Morano argues that the experts are wrong because there are hundreds of factors influencing Earth’s climate, and that carbon dioxide “is one of these factors that gets essentially drowned out, and you can’t distinguish its effect from natural variability.”
That claim is entirely false, as elegantly illustrated in this graphic created by Bloomberg. Human-caused global warming now far outside the range of natural variability. In fact, we’re now warming global temperatures more than 20 times faster than Earth’s fastest natural climate changes. And of course, climate scientists have observed human fingerprints all over climate change, most recently in the atmosphere. It would be absurd to take Marc Morano’s word over the evidence published in peer-reviewed studies by climate scientists at Nasa and other scientific institutions around the world.
Lately, Facebook has struggled mightily in trying to figure out how to combat the epidemic of fake news propagated via its platform. Mark Zuckerberg made headlines last week when he defended fake news from Holocaust deniers, saying he didn’t “think that they’re intentionally getting it wrong.”
It’s virtually impossible to discern an individual’s intent, but if that person is spreading misinformation, intent is irrelevant. If Facebook wants to stop misinforming millions of its users, it needs to tackle the problem of fake news regardless of intent. So far, Facebook seems more concerned about the appearance of ‘bias’ than about making sure the content shared on its site is factually correct.
Fortunately, the exposure to Morano’s misinformation video is not as bad as it seems at first blush. Although Facebook implies the video has been viewed over 5m times, a “view” is counted after just three seconds, and videos on the site play automatically. 
Nevertheless, the video has been shared over 75,000 times, so it has certainly reached a wide audience. Facebook needs to come to terms with the fact that there is an objective reality. Even if Marc Morano sincerely believes humans aren’t causing global warming, that belief is false, and by continuing to host his myth-filled video, Facebook is misinforming tens of thousands, perhaps even millions of its users.
… in the fight to protect the environment. By keeping the Guardian’s environmental coverage open and accessible, we can report on the changes needed to avoid climate and natural catastrophe. The choices made by individuals are important, but we need to work together for the systemic transformation that will make a real difference. As well as reporting the facts about what is happening now, we investigate the causes and talk to the people trying to make the future better. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

Right. It occurs because of greenhouse gases. And most of the back-radiation is in the 15um band. Guess which gas significantly absorbs at 15um...CO2. So CO2 is a known driver of temperature - unless you question the 1st law of thermodynamics...
The lag of CO2 with temperature you try to attribute to wild conspiracies is simply explained. The earth's orbit changes in precession, tilt on a cyclic basis and in this case temperature drives CO2. But that's periodic. Human induced warning is aperiodic.

Train services had to be cancelled ahead of “Furnace Friday”. The Daily Mail is warning of a coming “plague of rats”. Channel 4 News says ice-cream factory workers have been working 12-hour shifts since April. It’s chaotic, it’s biblical. And now, to add insult to heat stress-related injury, Australia is making fun of the British again.
The Sydney Morning Herald put it bluntly after one recent day of record temperatures in Britain: “It was the hottest day of the year in the UK and Brits could not cope”. The Adelaide Advertiser told readers “why British people can’t handle heat — and we can”. A News.com.au report belittled Britain for panicking over a “pleasant” 33.3C: “It turns out their definition of ‘heatwave’ is dramatically different from ours.” Similarly sneering remarks abounded on Twitter – where News.com.au said “Poms” had “flocked … to gripe about the ‘unbearable’ weather” and sleeplessness “that apparently comes with night-time temperatures in the low- to mid-20s”.
To be fair, Britons in summer are very easy to make fun of – almost a pure comedic device, like a banana peel. The national tendency towards understatement juxtaposed with the farmers’ tans and sweaty brows, the tension between shelling out for some espadrilles or a pool float shaped like a swan and the weather’s inevitable turn for the worse, Nigella in the burkini. Comedy gold, all of it.
Three weeks ago – before we’d even got to the really hot bit, as it transpired – we were advised in these very pages to conceal bags of frozen peas beneath our clothes while riding crowded buses and trains . We’re almost making it too easy for Australia, which places more national pride on its annual game of “You call that a heatwave? THIS is a heatwave” than it does on the Ashes. (Fair enough – it finds the Ashes harder to win.)
The lengths Australia goes to to establish its celsius supremacy is bemusing when the fact that it is a very hot country seems undisputed. I lived in Sydney for two and a half years and remember I would have sweat pooling on my skin after the 20-minute walk to work – for a 7am start. I’d stay late, not just until it was cool enough to walk home, but because the office was air-conditioned. 
This past summer in Sydney (it’s winter now, remember – a nippy 21C) temperatures reached highs of 47C, and consecutive days of over 40C. Nationally it was the second-hottest summer on record. Western Australia exceeded 45C on four occasions in the last week of March. To be clear, that’s autumn.
But a heatwave in Australia is not a matter of overtime in the ice-cream industry: people die from heat-related stress or in bushfires, or in “fatal thunderstorm respiratory events”. 
What the sneering about “Poms” overlooks is that Australia is by and large built to cope. Its major cities may be sprawling outwards but its older houses, at least, were built to circulate air and minimise heat retention. Air-conditioning is ubiquitous and reliable. The vast majority of Australians can not only swim but have ready access to water, be it at a swimming pool – many of which are outdoors, in parks – or the ocean. 
By comparison, most Britons live in houses designed to trap heat at all costs, with – if they’re lucky – an old blow-up paddling pool in the garage. Then there are the trains and underground services, and the grubby feeling, a sort of spiritual death, that comes with pressing against strangers in 40C heat. 
You buy something years ago and keep it in your garage “just in case “ and then one day it is very useful #UKheatwave pic.twitter.com/iqAWnU4SA6
The “no-nonsense experts from Down Under” – whom Janet Street-Porter suggests should be sent over to sort out the Met Office and the “baby mentality” it has “carefully nurtured” in Britons over the years – may arrive to find their work cut out for them. 
London’s first heatwave this year, in April, was a cause for celebration. But now hot is becoming the new normal – and not just in the UK with devastating, deadly results – even those who seized the day when it first dawned sunny have tempered their enthusiasm to the hours before 10am and after 4pm. Work colleagues have started wishing each other “good luck out there” at the day’s end. 
Yes, Britain is struggling this summer, but it’s not a sign of weakness – it’s a sign that we’re at the start of a process that many other, hotter countries are further along with. Put another way: we’re all frogs in the pan of water, but while Australia is closing in on 100C, Britain has only just noticed the stove is on. 
How humans experience and respond to increasingly high temperatures and “the speed of perceived warming” is crucial if we are to adapt to a climate-challenged future, researchers have found. 
Of course Australia has Britain beat on heat – but it’s a losing game for everyone. Some of us have just learned to cope better than others, as I said on the tube when a soggy bag of peas fell out from under my shirt.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for our species and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

Heck, science even know why you want to sit on the lower levels of a Scandinavian sauna if the heat hits up up there at the second step. That physics work in a sauna - but not always for a planet. For very good reasons one discover in school.

As having spend 15 years as publishing scientist on the topic before giving up, I think I am right to say that what I spent time learning in the 80s and 90s and published small novelties on from the mid 90s to 2015 being right makes climate scientists the saddest living people in the world to be proved right. 
To work in climate science, in working under the synthetic regime of Popper and falsification has another strong pull - I really wished that science and own findings would be wrong. 
Realty proves what science as a cultural invention right worried about scarily fast. 
I wish I was a student of compressed carbon - or liquid carbon or even diamonds. Much more success and love to be found in those branches of physics - as ""yay we found another reservorire""
This makes climate scientists kind of exceptional. We really want to be wrong. Both on the natural and forced sensitivity and expand of consequences.

A lack of nitrogen or other nutrients does not affect agricultural plants as much as wild ones, thanks to fertilizer. Still, research shows plants “get some benefits early on from higher CO2, but that [benefit] starts to saturate” after the gas reaches a certain level, Moore says—adding, “The more CO2 you have, the less and less benefit you get.” And while rising carbon dioxide might seem like a boon for agriculture, Moore also emphasizes any potential positive effects cannot be considered in isolation, and will likely be outweighed by many drawbacks. “Even with the benefit of CO2 fertilization, when you start getting up to 1 to 2 degrees of warming, you see negative effects,” she says. “There are a lot of different pathways by which temperature can negatively affect crop yield: soil moisture deficit [or] heat directly damaging the plants and interfering with their reproductive process.” On top of all that, Moore points out increased CO2 also benefits weeds that compete with farm plants. 
Rising CO2’s effect on crops could also harm human health. “We know unequivocally that when you grow food at elevated CO2 levels in fields, it becomes less nutritious,” notes Samuel Myers, principal research scientist in environmental health at Harvard University. “[Food crops] lose significant amounts of iron and zinc—and grains [also] lose protein.” Myers and other researchers have found atmospheric CO2 levels predicted for mid-century—around 550 parts per million—could make food crops lose enough of those key nutrients to cause a protein deficiency in an estimated 150 million people and a zinc deficit in an additional 150 million to 200 million. (Both of those figures are in addition to the number of people who already have such a shortfall.) A total of 1.4 billion women of child-bearing age and young children who live in countries with a high prevalence of anemia would lose more than 3.8 percent of their dietary iron at such CO2 levels, according to Meyers.Researchers do not yet know why higher atmospheric CO2 alters crops’ nutritional content. But, Myers says, “the bottom line is, we know that rising CO2 reduces the concentration of critical nutrients around the world,” adding that these kinds of nutritional deficiencies are already significant public health threats, and will only worsen as CO2 levels go up. “The problem with [the skeptics’] argument is that it’s as if you can cherry-pick the CO2 fertilization effect from the overall effect of adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere,” Myers says. But that is not how the world—or its climate—works.

Whether it be of oceans or forests not absorbing enough C02 I cannot say, but I can say that total C02 is going up. Rapidly. To quote Ralph Keeling: “We keep burning fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide keeps building up in the air. It’s essentially as simple as that.”

Further the authors state that:
BQSTART
Several limitations should be kept in mind regarding our study. We did not disaggregate deaths into different causes, nor did we stratify by age, sex, ethnicity or economic status. Thus we were unable to assess the extent to which cold temperatures may differentially affect certain causes or population subgroups that may be more vulnerable. Also, temperatures were measured at only a single outdoor site in each city, which ignores spatial patterns of temperature exposure that might occur due to land surface characteristics including vegetation density.

In Tokyo they carry parasols. Farmers in Bukhara fear for their future, while in Jordan, refugees cover themselves with wet towels.
And anyone who can relies on air conditioning (AC).
Around the world, people are trying to cope with the intense and prolonged heat. As always, the most vulnerable in society – the homeless, the elderly, the poor or disenfranchised – are suffering the most.
Guardian Cities is investigating heat in cities for a special week of journalism next month. Tell us how heat has affected you.
 I live in a house on Waraq Island, in the Nile, with my uncles, their families and grandparents. When we were kids we used to swim in the Nile, and some of us still do to overcome the heat. 
I plan so that I can spend the day in air-conditioned offices at university or work, only returning home at night
The family saved up and bought one AC unit for the living room; now that’s where everyone spends their day – preparing food, watching TV, playing or studying. But it doesn’t always work because the electricity is very weak.
My grandmother used to put the bedsheets in the fridge or the cooler, or hold a bag of cold water against our backs. My mother used a trick from Upper Egypt: using sacks of rice and buckwheat to absorb the heat.
I plan so that I can spend the day in air-conditioned offices at university or work, only returning home at night. I take the metro every day: when it’s hot, everyone is sweaty and smells. And sometimes the metro breaks down due to the heat.

It’s much worse this summer than last year. The reflected heat off the ground has been much more intense compared with the last few years. I use a parasol but it doesn’t really help me,because the heat from the ground is so hot.
 I try to walk in the shade and also take lots of water, and then use AC in my home during the night. In past summers I used a timer to switch it off two hours after I fell asleep; now I leave it on through the night. 
When I leave the office to get lunch, I try to go somewhere nearby. On weekends I try not to go out when the sun is really high. Sometimes I try to escape from Tokyo to cooler areas, but even there it’s too hot this year.
When I was a kid I could sleep with the window open but lately I can’t. I’m concerned about temperatures getting hotter in the future due to climate change; I hope America will stay signed up to the Paris agreement. We rely on AC more and more, which uses electricity, so I think it will get hotter because of that.
Reported by Daniel Hurst in Tokyo
There have been days when I couldn’t really go out for very long. It’s always been hot in Montreal for a few weeks here and there, but now it feels like it’s double the amount of time we have intense heat.
I’m living at the Old Brewery Mission [a non-profit supporting the homeless in Montreal]. I’m also helping some kids on the street; they’re not in as good a situation as me because they don’t have AC.
The water situation is not that great. The mission give you popsicles [with electrolytes] … so that replenishes the salts and whatever you need. We dehydrate ourselves and we don’t even know it. Then all of a sudden you’re dizzy; that’s when accidents happen. You don’t have to buy water, you just have to buy one good water container and carry it with you. But we need more water fountains in the parks. 
I have bronchitis and pneumonia. I go from here to Saint Denis and Sherbrooke [an intersection about 2km away]. I do it in two or three blocks at a time and I have to find an air-conditioned place and sit down and relax – or sit down and cough – because of the pollution and the heat. There’s a lot of coughing when it starts.
Try to find a friendly tree in the city and give it a hug. You have to find some AC, so shopping centres are good and large stores. People should be aware that other people need AC and water. Give them the time of day and a smile, and pass along a little water.

The prosperity of our whole region depends on the quality of cotton that we produce. Because of the extremely dry climate, we have to keep the soil as wet as possible during the summer to get a good crop in the autumn. This becomes very complicated because the available water evaporates faster as the temperature rises. A lot of local farmers get into debt just keeping the cotton fields watered. 
Life will be really harsh if the temperature keeps rising
A new channel was created several years ago to get water to Bukhara’s fields from the Amu Darya, the river between Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. A couple of smaller rivers near Bukhara had dried out. Only 20 or 30 years ago the temperature did not rise too high, farming was easier, there was more rain in the summer.
We have to take this issue seriously now. Life will be really harsh if the temperature keeps rising.

I work two jobs, like most of the people who sell produce at the laikes [farmers’ markets]: two days a week growing fruits and vegetables in the fields of Marathonas [a town about an hour’s drive north-east of Athens], where I live with my family, and five days selling them at different laikes across Athens.
Working outside is always worst at the beginning of a heatwave – as it goes on, the body adapts as much as it can, and you begin to get used to it. Here in the market, working during the afternoon is bearable because we have umbrellas above each stall.
Working in the fields is much more difficult: there is no shade, you are constantly in the sun. We start working at 6am: it is light outside but not yet too hot. We rest from 11am and start work again after 4pm until it gets dark. It is also vital to dress properly for the Greek sun – light, light-coloured clothing and hats.

This year’s heatwave has been remarkable, coupled with rare humidity on consecutive days – like living in a sauna. A colleague recalled that, five or so years ago, he could have cooled himself down in the shade at midday on a summer’s day; now he’s soaked with sweat as soon as he steps outside, and AC is the only remedy.
As a northern city in China, Beijing typically has low rainfall and humidity. Clothes could be dried quickly after washing; this year it takes weeks. There are regular heavy downpours, I felt as if I were living in a coastal city.
In the past only record-breaking temperatures have captured public attention in China. My home city of Wuhan is famous for its melting weather in summer. But my mom could still jog even on summer days. The highest temperature in Wuhan lately has been 38C, on July 21, and it stayed around 37-38C in the following days. It’s a matter of time before it reaches 40C or higher.
Nowadays, people resort to spending their summer holidays in the mountains, where the temperature is lower. In the city, lots of concrete buildings spring up with limited ability to absorb the heat. The ecosystem possesses its own ability to adjust the temperature and to balance living conditions. We need to find a way to rebuild the ecosystem, to restore the balance.

It’s a desert area, and we’re suffering. It is summer so it’s dusty. We live in a caravan, and it’s so hot because they are made of metal.
We have different ways of coping. We wake early and soak the floor with water. Then we sprinkle water on ourselves. Most of the time we soak towels and put them on our heads. In dust storms, we can’t go outside. They are sudden and frequent. We have to close the windows, it’s suffocating. We soak the towels and try to breathe through them. We have issues with asthma. My son has respiratory infections on a regular basis.
There is limited electricity in the camp. We have power from six in the evening until four in the morning. But we need it for electric fans during the peak temperatures in the day. We used to collect water with jerry cans and had to carry it for long distances. Now, with an operational water network, things are much easier. We don’t have to fight in a long queue to get our share of water.
Reported by Oliver Holmes in Jerusalem


This summer has been extreme, we went over 40C in July, which has had an average of 30C historically. For the first time, I installed AC in my house. My wife is pregnant, we simply couldn’t survive at home with the unbearable heat. We try to avoid using it because it’s not environmentally-friendly, we tried to get by with fans but we couldn’t.
People who can afford to do so usually leave Tbilisi in August, to go to summer houses in one of the surrounding small villages. But because there was such heat, everybody tried to get out of the city earlier. There’s such smog, people don’t go out in the daytime anymore. The city feels empty.
My impression is that, for the last five years or even longer, it’s been getting hotter and hotter every year. It is worrying. The local government is trying to improve air pollution, but it’s targeted at the use of private vehicles. It’s not only about cars, it’s also about the people who live in the city. We need more awareness, but it seems that the issue of climate change is low priority. People are more worried about other things.

Forest Green Rovers, which plays in League Two, announced on Monday that it has become the world’s first UN certified carbon-neutral football club.
Based in the Gloucestershire town of Nailsworth, the club has signed up for a United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) initiative called Climate Neutral Now for the 2018-19 season.
FGR’s green credentials have been attracting attention around the world for several years. It claims to be the first vegan football club in the world after receiving the vegan trademark from the Vegan Society.
The club says it became vegan because of the “huge environmental and animal welfare impacts of livestock farming”, as well as to improve player performance and give fans healthier, tastier food on match days.
FGR is powered by 100% green energy from Ecotricity – the company founded by the club’s chairman, Dale Vince – some of which is generated by the solar panels on the stadium roof.
The team plays on an organic pitch, which is cut by a solar-powered robot lawnmower, and all rainwater that falls on the stands or on the pitch is recycled to minimise the club’s use of mains water.
FGR has electric car charging facilities at the stadium, to encourage fans to travel to games sustainably.
FGR was promoted to the Football League for the first time in the club’s 129-year history last year and will start its second season in League Two – the fourth tier of professional football in England – next month.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/30/forest-green-rovers-named-worlds-first-un-certified-carbon-neutral-football-club

The activist group GetUp has combined with Greenpeace to bankroll what it describes as hard-hitting television advertisements targeting the two Labor-held states ahead of a meeting of energy ministers in August that will make or break the Turnbull government’s signature energy policy.
Opponents of the national energy guarantee have been frustrated that the Victorian government thus far has been muted in its public criticism of the scheme, and fear the Australian Capital Territory – which has been persistently critical – won’t sink the Neg at the Coag energy council unless one of the larger states is also on board.
With the Queensland energy minister, Anthony Lynham, calling in key stakeholders on Thursday to take soundings on the policy, GetUp’s national director, Paul Oosting, told Guardian Australia the activist group “expects all states to use their veto power” in August and fight for a national energy policy that would cut pollution and assist the transition to renewables.
The Australian Conservation Foundation echoed GetUp’s stance, declaring the current policy “unsupportable” because the emissions reduction target is insufficient to see Australia meet its commitments under the Paris agreement, and the policy as drafted makes it difficult to adjust the level of ambition.
The ACF’s Gavan McFadzean said: “What every state and territory government needs to understand is that if they sign up to this Neg, they own it and its woefully inadequate 26% pollution reduction target, locked in to 2030.
“It won’t be just Malcolm Turnbull’s Neg, or Tony Abbott’s, but Daniel Andrews’ and Annastacia Palaszczuk’s as well.”
The Turnbull government needs the backing of states that are in the national electricity market to implement the Neg, with any one jurisdiction possessing the power to kill the scheme.
Business groups have lined up in support of the Neg, urging a truce in the decade-long toxic political battle over climate and energy policy. They want a settled policy mechanism to give energy market participants certainty to invest.
Privately, some business stakeholders would also be relaxed about the commonwealth legislating a scheme that would make ramping up the level of ambition in the emissions reduction target easier to achieve – understanding that could help get the Labor states over the line on the mechanism.
But adding that flexibility could sink the policy when it returns for consideration by the Coalition party room, assuming the states don’t end it first.
The energy policy fight has been complicated in recent weeks by a renewed push by some Nationals and conservative Liberals to make ongoing support for coal part of the quid pro quo for supporting the Neg.
The states are also processing a new report this week from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which recommended major changes to the electricity market, including the commonwealth underwriting new generation projects in order to get more competition into the system and lower prices for consumers.
The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, has added the new ACCC report to the agenda for discussion at the critical August meeting.
Nationals this week have attempted to front-run the debate and shape public perceptions of the report by claiming the ACCC investigation supports government backing of new coal generation, when the relevant recommendation is clearly technology-neutral.
The ACT’s climate change minister, Shane Rattenbury, told Guardian Australia the report was being used by Liberals and Nationals “shamelessly to back up each of their internal arguments about the Neg”.
He warned: “Unless the Coalition sorts out what the Neg will finally look like, it will be impossible for Coag to endorse or reject it.”
Frydenberg and the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, have both said the proposed government underwriting would apply to all technologies that met the criteria, including, potentially, coal projects, as well as gas and renewables with battery back-up.
But Turnbull has also pushed back against the Nationals. On Thursday Turnbull said: “We are not in the business of subsidising one technology or another. We’ve done enough of that. I mean, frankly, too much of that has been done.”
He said subsidies for various forms of energy were in the process of winding down “and we should simply allow the technologies to compete”.
Turnbull said the outcome the government was seeking was lower energy prices.
The shadow federal climate change minister, Mark Butler, has declared it is a “fantasy” that anyone would seek to build a new coal-fired power station underwritten by the commonwealth, and he warned government MPs against hijacking a useful investigation by Australia’s competition watchdog.
Butler said the idea of the government underwriting new market entrants with generation projects was an idea “very worthy of consideration, but unfortunately it’s already been hijacked by these ideological zealots in the Coalition party room”.
“Everyone in the industry has recognised that building new coal-fired power stations, one isn’t suitable for the nature of the market in the future; it’s not sufficiently flexible, it’s more expensive than other power options, but also there is very substantial carbon risk, regulatory risk, price risk, associated with building new, high polluting, or high emitting assets,” Butler said.
“That’s why the industry won’t go near it, investors, bankers, won’t go near it, because they understand quite how risky it is.”
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute. Thank you.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jul/13/greenpeace-and-getup-launch-campaign-to-kill-national-energy-guarantee

BQENDNo enough to change it.
BQSTART
But the fact that you think this makes any critique of this system unacceptable or illegitimate says a lot about your attitude to ideas and free-thinking. Ie, 'shut the fuck up, no-one critisises America.' Ok. Let's not discuss the systems and politics of anywhere else in the world; is that a deal? Good, that will at least save a lot of time and hot air.
BQENDYou are unhinged and your purpose here is not to carry on a rational discussion. Let me remind you how you started in this thread,
BQSTART
As you know, the electoral college system was created after the civil war as a sop to the small (mostly older) states who worried about the new, populous states having control. Funnily enough, these smaller states are largely rural and white, whilst the newer big states are more urban and black.
BQENDWith a lie. The electoral college dates from about 100 years before the civil war.
Then you go on to call the US system ""undemocratic"".
BQSTART
It's enlightening that the supposedly 'populist', 'anti-establishment' right-wingers who support Trump are so deeply supportive of the established, undemocratic system when it suits them, is it not?
BQENDOf course I'm sure that you are smart enough to understand words, so calling something undemocratic is an absolute. You did not say, somewhat short of your opinion of perfectly democratic. No, you chose to say undemocratic, which as you know, means not democratic at all. This is obviously ridiculous hyperbole. Undemocratic is a place where no one gets to vote at all.
BQSTART
But the fact that you think this makes any critique of this system unacceptable or illegitimate says a lot about your attitude to ideas and free-thinking.
BQENDYou are being treated this way because you, as I have shown above, peddle in lies and hyperbole. I explained to you why the electoral college makes sense. To maintain equity among the states, which are a founding cultural principle of America. You choose to utterly ignore this, and then, as you are wont to do, you lie and say I've given you no rational argument.
Representation by population is provided for in the House of Representatives.
Best of all though really is where you are complaining from. A place where an elitist wholly unelected system of government is in place.

In many cases, listed studies are applicable only to a very specific region and were created not to investigate the influence of humans on climate, but to understand how the climate system works in general. 
This was the case for University of Washington PhD candidate Bradley Markle, whose paper (“Global Atmospheric Teleconnections During Dansgaard-Oeschger Events”) was also included in the No Tricks Zone:
My study, and almost all I saw mentioned on the blog post, are studies of climate change in the past. My study investigates connections between different parts of the climate system during climate events that happened over 10,000 years ago. Studying climate change in the past can provide context for recent climate change. However, my study in no way investigates or tries to attribute the causes of recent climate change. It does not deal with human influences on climate at all.

But that's not true. While some new fencing has been built along the U.S.-Mexico border in the past year, it's not the concrete barrier Trump vowed because of the strings Congress put on the cash. DONALD TRUMP Fact check: Trump says his border wall is under construction. It's not. At a recent rally, Trump said supporters should chant ""continue building that wall!"" But in the past year, the government has only replaced existing fence. THE FACTS The president rooted his campaign and early presidency in the idea that the southern border needed a concrete wall to secure American borders, which he said was overrun by crime and drugs. He said over and over that Mexico would pay for it. (Mexico has so far refused.) 
The same month, legislators passed a spending bill that included $1.6 billion in border barrier funding. That's the money Trump has touted at recent rallies as a ""down payment"" on his wall. But by law, the money can only be used for the construction or repair of existing fencing designs.
That funding ""shall only be available for operationally effective designs deployed as of the date of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 ... such as the currently deployed steel bollard designs,"" the bill reads, referencing designs that were completed well before Trump's prototypes were built.
A spokesman for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said that more than seven miles of border fencing had been replaced in the past year. (The president has said the U.S. needs 700 miles of new barrier on the border, and has sought $25 billion for his wall.)Additionally, a spokesman for CBP told NBC News that the findings from prototype development and testing had been presented to leadership, but it was unclear when — or if — they would be deployed in future border barrier construction.
Trump has maintained that he still intends to make Mexico pay for the wall — in one rally he teased that that issue might come up in NAFTA negotiations — but has yet to offer any specifics.
The new president-elect of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, seems unlikely to offer fresh aid on that front. He has denounced Trump's plan to build a border wall and his latest book was titled, ""Listen, Trump!""

As part of the Paris Agreement on climate change, the international community committed in 2015 to limit rising global temperatures to “well below” 2C by the end of the 21st century and to “pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C”.
However, these global temperature targets mask a lot of regional variation that occurs as the Earth warms. For example, land warms faster than oceans, high-latitude areas faster than the tropics, and inland areas faster than coastal regions.
Furthermore, global human population is concentrated in specific regions of the planet.
Here, Carbon Brief analyses how much warming people will actually experience where they live, both today and under future warming scenarios.
The warming experienced by people is typically higher than the global average warming. In a world where warming is limited to “well below” 2C about 14% of the population will still experience warming exceeding 2C. In the worst-case scenario of continued growth in emissions, about 44% of the population experiences warming over 5C – and 7% over 6C – in 2100.
Warming is not globally uniformDifferent parts of the world respond in different ways to warming from increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. For example, ocean temperatures increase more slowly than land temperatures because the oceans lose more heat by evaporation and they have a larger heat capacity.
High-latitude regions – far north or south of the equator – warm faster than the global average due to positive feedbacks from the retreat of ice and snow. An increased transfer of heat from the tropics to the poles in a warmer world also enhances warming. This phenomenon of more rapidly warming high latitudes is known as polar amplification.
Both of these effects can be seen over the past century. The figure below shows warming measured between the start of the 20th century (1900 to 1920) and present (1998 to 2018). Grey areas represent regions where insufficient temperature records were available early in the 20th century.

The problem is that GOP policies just aren’t popular. Most Americans unsurprisingly oppose climate denial, tax cuts for the wealthy, and putting children (including toddlers) in concentration camps, for example.
The Republican Party has thus far managed to continue winning elections by creating “a coalition between racists and plutocrats,” as Paul Krugman put it. The party’s economic policies are aimed at benefitting wealthy individuals and corporations, but that’s a slim segment of the American electorate. The plutocrats can fund political campaigns, but to capture enough votes to win elections, the GOP has resorted to identity politics. Research has consistently shown that Trump won because of racial resentment among white voters.
The modern GOP is basically Steve Bannon, Steve King and Stephen Miller on one side engaged in a project to preserve and enshrine dominance for its ethnic/racial base, and Paul Ryan and John Roberts on the other who pretend they have no idea what they’re up to.
While that strategy has worked in the short-term, some Republicans recognize that it can’t work in the long-term, and they’re fighting to save their party from extinction.
Climate change is one of many issues that divides the Republican Party. Like racial resentment, climate denial is a position held mostly by old, white, male conservatives. There’s a climate change generational, ethnic, and gender gap. 61% of Republicans under the age of 50 support government climate policies, compared to just 44% of Republicans over 50. Similarly, a majority of Hispanic- and African-Americans accept human-caused global warming and 70% express concern about it, as compared to just 41% of whites who accept the scientific reality and 50% who worry about it.
But the plutocratic wing of the GOP loves fossil fuels. Republican politicians rely on campaign donations from the fossil fuel industry, and quid pro quo requires them to do the industry’s bidding. It might as well be called the Grand Oil Party. 
There is no other reason why the GOP should not unify behind a revenue-neutral carbon tax. This free market, small government climate policy – which taxes carbon pollution and returns all the revenue to American households – is indeed supported by many conservatives. A group of Republican elder statesmen created a coalition called the Climate Leadership Council to build conservative support for a revenue-neutral carbon tax. They’re now backed by Americans for Carbon Dividends (AfCD), led in part by former Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott with a renewed effort to build support for this policy.
AfCD recently released polling results showing that 55% of Americans believe US environmental policy is headed in the wrong direction (29% say it’s on the right track), 81% of likely voters including 58% of Strong Republicans agree the government should take action to limit carbon emissions, and by a 56% to 26% margin (including a 55% to 32% margin among Strong Republicans), Americans support a revenue-neutral carbon tax. 
It’s not a wildly popular policy proposal, but it does have broad bipartisan support. It’s also a smart way to curb climate change with minimal economic impact, and in fact with a massive net economic benefit compared to unchecked climate change. That’s why economists overwhelmingly support a carbon tax.
The GOP was on the wrong side of history on civil rights and gay marriage and has paid the price, having largely become the party of old, straight, white men. Climate change is a similarly critical historical issue, but one that will directly impact every single American. Some smart Republicans recognize that the party can’t afford to be on the wrong side of history again on this issue.
Donald Trump managed to win the presidency in 2016 by stoking racial resentment among white Americans, but still lost the popular vote by a margin of nearly 3 million, and Republicans have only won the presidential popular vote once in the past two decades. They’re winning elections by relying on structural advantages (gerrymandering and weighting of rural votes), voter suppression, and mobilizing older white voters.
Trump seems to be doubling down on the latter strategy ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, for example by claiming that illegal immigrants are “infesting” America and by putting immigrant children in concentration camps. While only 25% of Americans support separating immigrant children from their parents, 49% of Republicans favor the policy. It’s a recipe for turning out the racist base (who also tend to be climate deniers), but not for winning a general election. Especially over the long-term as America becomes less white and as younger, more tolerant Americans become a larger proportion of the electorate.
When asked about the child concentration camps at a press conference, Senator David Perdue (R-GA) made the connection between the GOP coalition of plutocrats and racists, telling reporters: 
we came here to talk about a crisis. Your job is to inform the American people, our job is to provide solutions. ... God help us if we don’t solve this debt crisis. This is the No. 1 topic in America today … I want to make sure that the few minutes that we have didn’t get hijacked by the current shiny object of the day. [The national debt] is the current crisis in America.
The national debt might be less of a crisis had the GOP not added well over $1tn to the deficit in order to give wealthy Americans a tax cut. But apparently, it’s now a greater crisis than the American government taking immigrant children from their parents and putting them in concentration camps, or the existential threat posed by climate change. In other words, GOP priority #1 is further enriching plutocrats, priority #2 is reducing the national debt by cutting programs that help non-plutocrats; keeping families together and preserving a livable climate fall somewhere down the list.
Outside of the Republican base, these are unpopular priorities and policies. But as Katie Arrington, who recently beat Climate Solutions Caucus member Rep. Mark Sanford (R-SC) in a primary put it, “We are the party of President Donald J. Trump.” That’s a party that can only win races that are decided by white racial resentment. It’s a party that, given demographic changes, has become an endangered species. 
Some Republicans are trying to save the party by embracing smart policies like a revenue-neutral carbon tax. But so far, the party dodos are winning.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for humanity and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

I think the alternative b) is renewables + new nuclear + less storage.
BQENDIndeed, yes I thought that was implicit.
However there is a caveat - nuclear and storage are both capital intensive.
Whilst it is often dismissed as too expensive, I suspect that using NPP for load following (as opposed to peaking) has a place in any solution and therefore has the aspects necessary to displace the need for storage and backup infrastructure.
Whilst a NPP curtailment contract may put up costs, it saves on capital spending and O&M. Plus more thermal plant means less EFR services.
There is another factor that needs to be accounted for in the mix and this one is overnight charging of EVs and DSM both of which I suspect will significantly level out demand (I don't see V2G from EVs as anything but a minor item, (if that) -possibly FFR/EFR) That is a situation that favours a larger baseload. 
The flatter the demand curve (erosion of 'off peak') that storage relies upon for arbitrage, the greater the financial stress on storage, as has happened with the German Pumped Storage sector. This moves storage from a commercial entity to a flat overhead.
All things being equal.

I did.
Your first example says that emissions rose on the taxed areas. However it does nothing to show that they would not have risen faster.
Your second example (I wonder if you actually read it ?) trashes your first example and goes on to say ""When you pass a modest policy and it has a modest effect, the policy is a success. It did what it was designed to do.""
Your third example is from a lunatic right-wing group. To give you an example of their thinking : ""The internet news is awash with doom-and-gloom articles about the climate. Scenarios predicting ever more frequent weather events, like hurricanes, droughts, catastrophic rainfalls, and more millions of migrants from impoverished countries (often termed “refugees”), or none of the above, are all blamed squarely on “climate change” supposedly caused by the 0.04% of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere..""
Your fourth example is from a left-wing publication that objects to such taxes in principle.
Your fifth example (did you read it ?) tells us that the taxes work modestly : ""The taxes contributed to a reduction in onshore emissions of only 1.5 percent and total emissions of 2.3 percent.""
Your last link (did you read it ?) laments the poorly designed tax and contrasts it with other countries' success : ""Apart from the incentive to use alternative energies, the Swedish Ministry has stated that in 1995 CO2 emissions were 15 % lower than they would have been with no tax reform and estimated the reduction for 2000 at 20–25 %.""

BQENDNo, sea water is not pumped through the engine block - a boat that sucks in water for cooling is not pumping it into the engine block so you're almost a bit right - there

Even with heavily subsidised renewables (supported well beyond the cost of gas externalities), the market is still building new gas capacity.
Solar and wind will be cheaper than part of the gas solution for sure. But the rest is filled with gas.

Again, these articles fly in the face of the anti-RE spinners who regularly claim 3 weeks storage would be needed, because wind can be low for 3 weeks in the summer - of course low wind isn't no wind, plus PV, hydro, bio, tidal, interconnectors and bio-gas reserves from P2G too if necessary.

This deep insight of the intermittophobes is usually followed up with the equally earthshaking observation that batteries do not produce electricity.
BQENDOh I can do better than that, CP has been claiming for years that storage doesn't reduce your import. He's specifically challenged my calculations that a small battery (about 4kWh useable) would reduce my import by 60%.
Figures are simple, my demand was ~3,000kWh pa, now with PV, it's ~1,500kWh pa. That small batt would reduce it a further 900kWh's down to about 600kWh's.
900 is 60% of 1,500.
But, there is some good news. After months/years of making that claim, he suddenly changed 'import' to 'net import' - I suspect he means 'consumption', and needed some face saving excuse when he realised his mistake.

Is the likely cost of: a) Renewables+storage,more or less than the likely cost of; b) Renewables+new nuclear (the direction the UK and France et al have chosen)
BQEND
While I broadly agree, I think the alternative b) is renewables + new nuclear + less storage.
We will use some storage, but the more nuclear we have the less storage we need. Obviously nuclear avoids squandering storage on baseload; but nuclear also uses storage more efficiently for load-following because it is more predictable and less sporadic than wind.
BQSTART
plus it needs a gas backup and we have failed to develop a CCS solution for gas backup.
BQEND
To be honest, I don't think CCS would be targeted at backup. It is so capital intensive that it would primarily be for baseload.
BQSTART
The problem for (b) is the significant upfront capital cost and construction time for nuclear..
BQEND
At the risk of getting back on topic, here is the rub:
Most of the cost of nuclear is the cost of financing the capital. The actual amount of capital for the volume of output is not particularly excessive; but the length of contruction mean that the cost of capital (interest or equity returns) is the major factor which determines the price of nuclear electricity.
If we go down the route of simply setting a carbon price, and letting the market determine what the private sector will build, that is unlikely to end up with cheap nuclear. Why? Because private investors want equity returns of 10%+ on a nuclear plant.
Whereas, in times of historic low interest rates, the route to cheap nuclear is to finance via 2-3% govt bonds or similar vehicles. Of course, any other technology would benefit from low financing rates, but nuclear is uniquely sensitive to the cost of capital, and it benefits the most.
If you have something with a high capital cost, long construction time, and relatively fixed output, it is hard to make a profit from it regardless of how cheap it might be in the long term.
(The point we need to remember is that the market does not select on the basis of lowest cost for the consumer. It selects on the basis of highest return for the shareholder. Obviously if you are comparing identical technologies then lower costs go hand-in-hand with higher returns. But if you are comparing radically different technologies, with different capital profiles, that is not the case.)', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1531032513000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'it is more predictable and less sporadic than wind', u'effect': u'nuclear also uses storage more efficiently for load following'}], u'author_id': u'2578657', u'in_reply_to': u'117939918', u'id': u'117947169', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'JulesBywaterLees', u'text': u'you have a point about housing- although we need to build quite a few between now and 2050 and all the time standard housing is going up so energy will be wasted in the future.however the big area is commercial buildings that tend to have quite short lifetimes and who are bigger users of energy and commercially would benefit from driving down costs.

BQENDHiya Jules, I see CP is 'blaming' me, however I got that number from
Euan Mearns site (someone not known for their support of RE) to fight fire with fire - that's to say I use a non RE supporters figure to combat the claims of other non RE supporters that we'll need 500hrs of storage ....... BS!
I suspect the 500GWh was designed to scare us, but note the date of the article, just before off-shore wind costs tumbled, and the EV disruption started.
We can now expect something like 1,500GWh of EV batts for free (free in the sense that the grid doesn't need to expend CAPEX on them), I'd also suggest something in the region of 50GWh of domestic/small business batteries as prosumers start to invest in storage. If just 1/3 of that EV fleet is plugged in at any one time to smart chargers, then you have 500GWh of storage ready to support the grid at peak demand, or ready to absorb cheap excess.
Also worth checking out the spill and gas figures from Euan's article as P2G would convert that spill to and cover the gas with bio-gas.
Adding in a broader range of RE (on and off shore wind, not just one, plus tidal, hydro, and interconnectors) will reduce the spill and gas %'s further.
Please note Euan's scenario is for a higher leccy demand future when demand is nearer a 72GW average rather than about 40GW today.

BQENDHiya. I see your point but need to point out that the alternatives don't have to cost 1-2c/kWh or less, that's not what they are competing against.
They are competing against the cost of gas generation, which would (using your figures) become 1-2c/kWh more expensive, eg 3c/kWh becomes 4-5c/kWh, giving wind and solar (and others) an additional advantage when their FF competitor gets 1-2c/kWh more expensive.
RE in the US is already closing in on gas generation, especially new gas generation, so 1-2c/kWh would probably tip the balance.

BQSTART
You appear to be arguing that because we don't already do that then we shouldn't bother. 
Have I misunderstood?
BQEND
well for a start you have plucked a conclusion from your own arse- so try reading the post again.
Let's assume- in the UK that wind will establish about 40% of annual generation, and that nuclear builds go well and supply 40% of annual supply- in the summer with nuclear refuelling [or getting clogged with jelly fish] and wind at lower output solar starts to fill in a lot of gaps and we have a 20% filler source- probably gas.So- new CCS for gas plants- but this will cost a lot without generating a single watt.or spare capacity over the winter could be converted to gas and stored in old gas fields.or cars, home and business storage create a virtual super battery- a google of storage.or any other choices.what is absolutely clear is there will be a mix and a mix of solutions.
in 2030 there may be 15 million EVs, and a million buses [as EV buses are moving at a faster pace]- that is a huge amount of storage, and the cost of £20,000 cars x 15 million is..... well lots.. £300 billion and all privately financed and if just 20% of the capacity was available to the grid [because the grid may give you free electricity for motoring in return] that is a massive amount of emergency capacity.
What you and others with very old skool outlooks fail to see is how a new economy is opening. Currently if you have a business with a backup diesel generator you can sign up for the grid to use it in emergencies- it pays well and they control it remotely- and like insurance underwriters they get paid for risk taking. But this is low risk- you may have 20% of your range lost to the grid at one point in the day- and by 2030 range will be twice as much - 500 miles.And extended it means business will install batteries to take on cheap and either use or sell on.Extremely adaptive and rolled out with low finance- yet collectively this small parts amount to a huge supply and huge cost.You could look at a train network- and you may say a supper train network as a good a cars would cost--- £ trillions, but that is trillions over decades.

There are side points to consider of course - such as carbon footprint and grid costs but even so, if one option is greater than the other then that's a reasonable indication - at least as far as one can reasonably judge from where we are.
The problem for (a) is that expected industry prices for battery storage are $375/kwh by 2025 and you can see from there graph there isn't a great deal more that can be trimmed off that, plus it needs a gas backup and we have failed to develop a CCS solution for gas backup.
The problem for (b) is the significant upfront capital cost and construction time for nuclear.. but our best estimates are that is less than storage plus we avoid a lot of grid enhancement costs and void the necessity for a big gas standby (although we still need CCS for (a) or (b) or any mix of the two.

BQEND
BQENDNo, it's the purchase and operating price.
So at 2025 prices (excluding inflation) a small 500GWh one for the UK (which separately requires a lot of gas backup) would cost $187,500,000,000 .... without generating a single watt.

reading their arguments, and others as featured in Pandora's Promise documentry, and reading George Monbiot and other previous anti nuclear environmentalists [including the 'greenpeace founder' Patrick Moore!] the basis of the argument is compelling- nuclear is relatively safe, relatively low carbon and has the capacity to run a complex power hungry civilisation.Nuclear has not caused 1000s of cancers- but of course none of this does not make nuclear accidents impossible and destructive and expensive and waste is dangerous and has to be handled with extreme care. And as seen with Japan it is essential that cost cutting and complacency must not be allowed to take hold.
Fast breeder reactors are proven [although the liquid coolent is corrosive and soluble in water so it not without operation issues]- so why is not happening?Why when China has the money, no public opposition, the need to clean its air struggle to build 50 GW over 5 years- and even with its massive rollout it will move generation up from 3% to 5%?
The argument presented is that nuclear is uniquely despatchable - yet reality speaks for itself, the build rate at the moment is 50 odd - back in the 1970s the rate was 4 times higher and 4 times cheaper, and twice as fast.
where are the 100s of reactors being built that are need to address co2 emissions?

Let me stop you there. The most expensive component is storage.
You are basing your assumption on the fantasy scenario where storage drops in cost by an order of magnitude; and nuclear never gets cheaper than HPC (which is unlikely). Note, all existing nuclear in the UK is cheaper than all existing or proposed wind.

It seems to be an important point for a lot of people. Some believe that the optimal route to decarbonisation is not 100% renewable. Others disagree.
BQENDYes that's the crucial point. I think most of us agree with the initial starting point:
RE + nuclear + storage.
For some of us, we then extract the most expensive component (nuclear) and compare it economically with the cost of RE + storage, and believe that the second option is cheaper, giving us a revised position:
RE + (RE + storage) + storage
This position is based on the current costs of RE and storage and the price reduction trends.
We can now look at nuclear's inability to reduce costs over 60yrs of subsidy support, and the opposite for RE and storage with only about 10yrs of significant support.
So nuclear gives us two gifts, a vast amount of 'approved' expenditure, and a lot of time for costs trends to continue to reduce RE/storage costs, since deployments are simpler, faster and also in some cases retrospective (as in batts being added to wind and solar sites).
We can even compare individual projects, such as HPC, which at a 35yr cost of £100/MWh v's the NAO estimated wholesale price of £50, will suck up £44bn in subsidies.
Off-shore wind at the 2023 allocation price could deliver that amount of generation for £5bn (and off-shore costs haven't stopped falling) gifting us £39bn in spare subsidy monies over 35yrs to steadily invest in storage or more generating capacity.
PV and on-shore wind are now starting to go subsidy free in some locations/situations and costs will continue to fall, and could even go sub £20/MWh by 2050.
BQSTART
For the solar industry in particular, BNEF is predicting a 17-fold increase in capacity globally and the levelised cost of electricity (LCoE) will fall a further 71% by 2050, having already fallen by 77% between 2009 and 2018. The wind industry will benefit from a sixfold increase in capacity and see its own LCoE fall a further 58%, from the 41% decrease seen over the previous decade.

Climate disruption is the leading threat to our built environment, an accelerant of armed conflict, and a leading cause of mass migration. Its effects intensify and prolong storms, droughts, wildfires, and floods — resulting in the US spending as much on disaster management in 2017 as in the three decades from 1980 to 2010.
Fiscal conservatism and national security require a smart, focused, effective solution that protects our economy and our values.
Political division between the major parties in Washington has left the burden of achieving that solution largely on Democratic administrations using regulatory measures that — for all their smart design and ambition — cannot be transformational enough to carry us through to a livable future.
Conservatives say the nation needs an insurance policy. Business leaders want to future-proof their operations and investments. Young people are demanding intervention on the scale of the Allies’ efforts to rebuild Europe after World War II. 
The International Monetary Fund — whose mission is to ensure national dysfunction doesn’t undermine the solvency of public budgets and lead to failed states — warns that nations that depend heavily on publicly subsidized fossil fuels are endangering their future solvency by investing in a way that destroys future economic resilience. Resilience intelligence requires diversification and innovation on a massive scale. 
The rapid expansion of green bonds is making clear the deep need for clean economy holdings among major banks and institutional investors. Climate-smart finance, still a new concept, is expected to be the standard for both public and private-sector actors at all levels within 10 to 20 years. 
Republican former Secretaries of the Treasury James Baker and George Shultz have called for a carbon dividends strategy, because: 
Unpaid-for pollution and climate disruption limit our personal freedom and then, by adding cost and risk to the whole economy, undermine our collective ability to defend our freedom and secure future prosperity. Even with record oil and gas production, the US still depends heavily on foreign regimes hostile to democracy that manipulate supply and undermine the efficiency of our everyday economy. 
Energy freedom means reliable, everywhere-active low-cost clean energy, answering the call of expanded Main Street economic activity.
Ask any small business owner if they would rather have higher or lower hidden business costs built into everything they buy from their suppliers. Of course, they would prefer lower hidden costs and risks, and for consumers to have more money in their pockets. 
That is how carbon dividends work. 
The result is a steady shift in new investment to practices that are more competitive on a level playing field. With the flow of dividend dollars through local economies, lawmakers can concretely leverage good policy to motivate new investment and job creation, without having to build “bridges to nowhere.”
Banks will either lead or follow, but it is certain that when investment in local economies and energy innovation are both more efficient than they are now, finance at all levels will go to work on that trend. Trillions of dollars in subsidies for the old economy will be freed up to support expansion of the new economy.
New opportunities for industrial production of clean energy devices, electric vehicle infrastructure, battery storage, smart grids and related services, will ensure under-served communities in both rural and urban areas will draw new investment and locally rooted job creation.
There is no faster way to reduce emissions while driving investment into the creation of millions of new jobs. There is no more economically efficient way to ensure the 21st century energy innovation economy reaches major cities, heavy industry, and also “the last mile,” where conventional infrastructure has always been hardest to fund. 
The shortest route to American energy freedom and climate solvency is through a clear-headed, high-efficiency carbon dividends strategy.

… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

A Syrian travel ban is perfectly sensible. Because Syrian official records are crap, at best. How are we supposed to know that Ahmed is Ahmed?
It works like this: My wife was born in Syria. As were all of her brothers and sisters. The family registered the births with the local Church. Then they registered with the government. So happens the government clerks tended to be almost entirely Sunni Muslim, who inconveniently for you tend to harbor long-standing bias against Christians. So not ONE of those family members births were officially recorded consistent with how they were recorded at the Church. Christian family shows up with baby Nuri born July 25, 1962 and the clerk records it as ""Ali"" born April 2, 1960.
Sunni clerk gets the satisfaction of having just bulked up the Sunni demographic of the nation and the perverse glee that the authorities are going to force Nuri, aka ""Ali"" of beginning his mandatory military service at age 16.

But as researchers watched, there was one species of growth that remained untouched – an ancient Syrian grass known as Aegilops tauschii.
Now those Syrian seeds, once stored in a vault outside of Aleppo, could end up saving US wheat from the menaces of climate change.
From 2000 to 2015, average temperatures in the US midwest rose from 1 to 2 degrees fahrenheit above the 20th-century average. Periods of time between rainfalls are lengthening, according to a 2016 assessment by the Environmental Protection Agency. In other words, conditions in some areas of the midwest are starting to resemble conditions in the Middle East. 
Rising temperatures are already leading to drops in midwestern crop yields, and threaten further reductions of as much as 4% per year. In the heart of US cereal and grain country, new pests and diseases are following the hot and dry conditions northward – and frequently overwhelming the ability of agricultural chemicals to battle them off. In response, scientists are seeking sources of natural resistance – and finding them in Syria, in the heart of the Fertile Crescent, the birthplace of domesticated agriculture.
One of the world’s most important seed banks used to be located about 25 miles west of Aleppo in the town of Tal Hadya, and was run by the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (Icarda). That UN-affiliated centre specialises in preserving and researching seeds in hot, dry areas – conditions now being faced by many of the Earth’s food-growing regions.
It’s also the place of origin of today’s domesticated wheat, and the seeds that were stored there benefit from genes embedded with survival strategies evolved over thousands of years. Now diseases and pests such as the Hessian fly, long familiar to Middle and Near Eastern farmers, are moving north from the southern US and Mexico and surging across Kansas and surrounding states – Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado and Nebraska and in some instances up to Illinois and the Dakotas.
Even as forces supporting the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, were bombing Aleppo in spring 2016, researchers at Kansas State University (KSU) were receiving increasingly urgent reports from US wheat farmers of devastating attacks by the Hessian fly, leading to an average 10% yield loss per year, according to the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Applied Wheat Genomics at KSU. That’s a significant bite out of the earnings of farms already operating on shaky margins.
Ming-Shun Chen, a professor of molecular entomology at KSU, says the flies’ larvae used to be killed off by the cold of winter. But that cold is coming later in the season, and the larvae survive to turn into flies. Their devouring of wheat seems drawn from science fiction: the flies don’t have teeth, so they inject a protein-based substance into the plant that transforms it into a kind of nutritious slurry they can suck up and digest. 
From November through April, Chen collaborated with the plant scientist Jesse Poland to run a sequence of experiments that unfolded in the university’s greenhouses with brutal Darwinian efficiency: they planted commercial US wheat seedlings from Kansas and surrounding states along with an assortment of wild wheat-related grasses obtained from the seed vault in Syria, as well as random other assorted plantings. The seedlings grew for two to three weeks, and then the flies were unleashed to attack. The results were clear: Syria’s Aegilops tauschii was the sole survivor.
Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?
This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.

Wheat has the most complex genome of any of the world’s major crops, one of the reasons efforts to genetically engineer wheat traits have thus far not succeeded. It also means it has multiple genetic “wild relatives”.
Over time the domesticated wheat, dependent on agrichemical boosters, lost resistance to diseases and pests. So breeders are reaching deep into the history of wheat to bring back some of those lost characteristics.
“Wild relatives are by definition hardier. They’ve survived on the margins of our pampering,” says Maywa Montenegro, a PhD in environmental science, policy and management at the University of California, Berkeley, who has spent years studying wild relatives of crops. “On a farm, the farmer does everything to favour his crops: he pulls out competitor plants, weeds, gives water. But the wild relatives haven’t been getting assistance for thousands of years. They’re dealing with drought and flooding and salt.” 
She said indigenous farmers have for millennia encouraged wild species to grow along the edges of their farms in order to encourage interbreeding between the wild and domesticated species to confer those strengths – a practice that has been long-neglected on massive industrial farms.
The indomitable Aegilops tauschii grows wild in Syria in the hills surrounding Tal Hadya and Aleppo. Poland cites a litany of diseases to which the grass is resistant, with names like a lineup of underground rock bands: barley yellow dwarf, mosaic virus, wheat rust. It also shows resistance traits to more than half a dozen common insect pests, including the Hessian fly. 
The tauschii and thousands of other seed varieties once stored at Icarda’s Tal Hadya seed bank have a dramatic recent history, intertwined with the Syrian civil war. The area around Aleppo was a rebel stronghold until 2016. The rebel commander in Tal Hadya, according to one of the veteran scientists who used to work at the Icarda facility, was himself a farmer and understood the importance of the seed bank.
The scientists and the rebels struck a deal: the rebels protected the seed bank and, equally important, ensured that the generator kept running to keep the stored seeds cool – in return for the scientists providing the rebels with food grown from the centre’s experimental fields. That lasted until spring 2016, when Assad’s military started bombarding Aleppo and the surrounding towns, including Tal Hadya. The remaining scientists loaded up the seeds in a truck and raced across the Lebanese frontier.
Other seeds emanating from Syria are helping farmers contend with climatic changes elsewhere in the midwest. In Illinois and the Dakotas, Syrian seeds seem to perform strongly when faced with the combination of increasing temperatures with brief but intense rainfalls, which leads to the spread of virulent fungus. Efforts are under way at the University of North Dakota, Bismarck, to introduce Syrian seeds into the breeding stock.
Poland says the latest round of Hessian fly experiments, completed in early April, affirmed KSU’s plan to incorporate the tough survivors of the fly onslaught into the breeding of commercial American wheat varieties. After undergoing formal certification and government approval, the Aegilops tauschii will be dispersed to US breeders to make their way into the besieged fields of the midwest.
The US has been losing diversity at an alarming rate during more than three decades of consolidation in the seed industry, and the steadily expanding size of farms. Diversity in seed varieties has dropped in almost every region of the country, most dramatically in the lower midwest. Globally, the UN has declared that three-quarters of all the world’s crop varieties that were around in the early 1900s had become extinct by 2015. 
“You may be using wild crop relatives to boost industrial agriculture, while industrial agriculture itself is one of the greatest pressures on their existence,” says Montenegro. “They’re threatened from the usual pressures – pollution, land-cover changes – but also from turning diverse fields into monoculture plantations.”

Donald Trump announced Pruitt’s departure on Twitter and said Pruitt had done an “outstanding job”. He further posted that Pruitt’s deputy Andrew Wheeler would take over as acting administrator from Monday.
...on Monday assume duties as the acting Administrator of the EPA. I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda. We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright!
Trump had repeatedly defended Pruitt following a multitude of ethics scandals.
In his resignation letter, Pruitt struck an unapologetic tone.
“It is extremely difficult for me to cease serving you in this role,” Pruitt wrote. “However, the unrelenting attacks on me personally, my family, are unprecedented and have taken a sizable toll on all of us.”
 Pruitt also infused several references to God while lavishing praise on the president.
“I believe you are serving as president today because of God’s providence,” he wrote. “I believe that same providence brought me into your service.”
Pruitt, a former attorney general of Oklahoma, had come under increasing pressure over issues including the use of public funds for travel and office improvements; for using an obscure provision of the Safe Drinking Water Act to give pay raises to two aides; and for having paid $50 a night to rent a room in a Capitol Hill townhouse from the wife of an energy industry lobbyist.
An EPA ethics official who initially said the condo deal was not inappropriate subsequently rowed back on that claim.
In April, Reuters cited an anonymous Republican aide who said the condo deal was being examined by the House oversight committee. The Associated Press detailed extensive spending on a “a 20-member full-time security detail” for Pruitt.
In recent weeks, the barrage of headlines over Pruitt’s alleged impropriety at the EPA escalated – prompting several staff members to resign.
A whistleblower revealed earlier this week that Pruitt kept a secret calendar to hide meetings with industry representatives. Staffers reportedly met in Pruitt’s office to alter or remove records of the meetings. It also emerged that Pruitt asked staffers to use their personal credit cards for his hotel bookings.
As of last month, Pruitt’s activities were the subject of at least 14 separate federal investigations.
Trump nonetheless continued to defend Pruitt following his resignation, telling reporters aboard Air Force One: “Scott Pruitt did an outstanding job inside of the EPA.”
“You know, obviously the controversies with Scott, but within the agency we were extremely happy,” he added.
Trump also said there was “no final straw” leading up to Pruitt’s departures and that the embattled EPA chief offered his own resignation.
“I think Scott felt that he was a distraction,” Trump said. “It was very much up to him.”
Even some Republicans, who had grown tired of defending Pruitt’s daily controversies, celebrated the news of his departure.
“Finally. Actually he did a horrible job,” Carlos Curbelo, a moderate Republican congressman from Florida, tweeted in response to Trump.
“He was a disaster and an embarrassment from day one, and the country is far better off without him.”
It was reported in April that the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, had urged Pruitt’s firing but was rebuffed by the president. 
Pruitt reportedly hoped to replace Jeff Sessions as attorney general if that job became vacant. 
He was an aggressive champion of Trump’s anti-regulation agenda, repealing a host of environmental protection measures, many implemented by the Obama administration.
“You know, I just left coal and energy country,” Trump said after a recent trip to West Virginia. “They feel very strongly about Scott Pruitt. And they love Scott Pruitt.”
Speaking to the Guardian before Pruitt resigned, a senior EPA official who asked not to be named said of agency management: “People are so done with these folks. We wanted and waited for some adults to show up. But the relentless tide of bullshit from Pruitt and his cronies is tough to deal with.”
Janet McCabe, a former EPA assistant administrator, said: “I think morale at the EPA is at a very low ebb. The bigger concern is the environmental mission of the agency. Substantively, what has happened in the last year is a big a threat as the agency has ever faced.”

… in the fight to protect the environment. By keeping the Guardian’s environmental coverage open and accessible, we can report on the changes needed to avoid climate and natural catastrophe.

This week, some tales of harnessing the power of nature as we tackle man-made crises: climate change and our insatiable need for energy.
Move aside, the sun – could the moon be the solution to our clean energy crisis? The power of our ocean tides, the only renewable source derived from the moon, might be able to provide huge amounts of clean, renewable electricity. Damian Carrington reports from France on the extraordinary inventions that could help to harness it.
In the meantime, the sun’s not doing a bad job: a heatwave in the UK helped break solar power-generation records, with solar briefly eclipsing gas power stations as the top source of electricity. 
Rising temperatures and dry spells in the US midwest are wreaking havoc with crop yields, as new pests and diseases emerge due to hot and arid conditions. But now an ancient Syrian grass that survived a civil war might provide salvation for stricken American farmers, as Mark Schapiro explains.
Elsewhere this week, we are celebrating the 70th birthday of the UK’s National Health Service, the world’s largest government-funded healthcare system. Haroon Siddique brings us five fascinating innovations from health services around the world that could help the NHS to break new ground over the next 70 years.
And in Gaza City, Oliver Holmes and Hazem Balousha report on the strip’s first ever coding academy, where 16 students (half male, half female), surrounded by boundaries, are breaking free online. 
 This New Yorker examination of universal basic income and this Wired tale of the French boat that’s circling the planet powered by renewables. 
All these tidal sources are important and may contribute, but the main and cheapest contribution comes from efficient use. In other words: it is not sustainable to fly to remote destinations to board a ship that is supposedly cruising to important places that we must see. It is not sustainable to board a jet plane to watch a football match. And it is not sustainable to fly in food from faraway places out of season by airplane just for the kick of strawberries in winter or lamb from down under. 
Commenter, continental cyclist, writing below the line of our piece on tidal power.
In living rooms up and down Britain, where Christian Sinabaldi, Erica Buist and Deborah Linton captured the agony, ecstasy and weird snacks that friends and families from countries competing at the World Cup shared as they watched their heroes on TV.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

Do I fly anywhere? NoDo I own a car? NoDo I waste water? No I am on a water meter and cant afford to waste anything with my income level.Do I reuse plastic bags? No I do not use them at all.Do I minimise waste? Yes but there is far too much packaging on our food products and the like. The number of items we buy like crisps, cereal and the like where the package is only around 1/3rd full is ludicrous.Do I recycle? Yes as much as possible.Do I waste energy? No again I cant afford to with my level of income.
Many of us are doing what we can to try and help towards reducing climate change.
Clearly we need more regulation to stop huge profit making companies from producing huge levels of waste. For example there should be regulations that stop corporations from using excessive packaging.
A few other thoughts.
There should also be nothing from stopping us planning our towns and cities in better ways. We could for example plan them in such a way where vast amounts of more trees are placed in our urban areas. For many of our local highstreets there is not a single plant in sight other than a few hanging baskets hanging on the outside of shops. There would be more than enough room to plant trees in the high-street if they were planned better and had pedestrianised areas.
We could also change planning regulations to ensure that gardens are fitted on roof tops for new builds.
We could do things like develop dynamos that are fitted to fans and then have them fitted to all satellite dishes and aerial's so that they spin when the wind is blowing. This kind of technology existed 40 years ago to allow cyclists to power lights from their wheels. Even if they were only small fans that only produced a small amount of energy. If there were billions of them all over the world it would end up producing a significant amount of energy as every little helps.
We could design taps and toilets with the same kinds of fans in so that they spin when we are taking water from the supply. We could design drain pipes with the same kinds of fans.
Any product that has a spinning part could be designed to harvest energy from the spinning part while it is doing the job that it is needed to do. For example washing machines, computers, tumble driers, DVD players and the like all have spinning parts. I freely admit I do not know about the technical side of this last suggestion but surely it can't be beyond the wit of man to design products in a way where the products themselves harvest energy from a spinning part and then store that energy to make them more energy efficient. It may make them more costly to buy but that cost would be offset by the saving in energy.', u'recommendation_count': u'19', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1530893903000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'10085855', u'in_reply_to': u'117892757', u'id': u'117896328', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'doctuscumlibro', u'text': u'""why isn t climate change top of the political agenda"" ?

Why do you only pick on population? What about the number of people who eat more meat than required (a big cause of habitat destruction too), or those who use cars as a convenience rather than a necessity, or watering the back garden with a hosepipe, or buying tonnes of shit we don't need. There's a lot we could all do that doesn't require culling the population.
BQEND
That's an argument I often see. The short answer is that there are many ways to ameliorate the situation but the huge underlying issue (of over population) remains and is causing stresses and massive problems which come to light on a daily basis and which means that there are more problems we can't yet see in the pipeline. 
We are very good at taking the 'hard' decisions in relation to other species. Take deer here in Scotland for instance. There are many ways to do the equivalent of not using cars, not eating meat and not using hose pipes to mitigate the effects of an exploding deer population. We could for instance build more deer fences, protect individual trees and plants, spray vegetation with a deer repellent, grow trees deer don't like to eat, stop growing trees at all! All of those would help to reduce deer damage but none of them would address the other issues that arise like starvation, and diseases relating to inbreeding and corralling. So we take steps to reduce their numbers recognising that the underlying problem is that there are simply too many deer. 
Yes, we can do the things you suggest, but those are just excuses (and worse may delay) for not tackling the real issue. Nothing can get away from the fact that our sheer numbers, never mind what we consume or what we eat, just our numbers are pushing out and killing other species. And, as Monbiot has said, species extinction is now a more serious threat to us even than climate change.', u'recommendation_count': u'6', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1530893616000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': None, u'effect': u""stresses and massive problems which come to light on a daily basis and which means that there are more problems we ca n't yet see in the pipeline""}], u'author_id': u'13675666', u'in_reply_to': u'117895303', u'id': u'117896071', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'dercius', u'text': u'Um, however, oddly enough a result of global warming could well be a sudden I've ageThe global convection current relies on a steady stream of cold water from the poles being warmed and cycled by the gulf steam In a kind of ""global heat pump""...

Actually I think we should be looking towards developing technology - possibly bio-tech that can drawn down and solidify carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It would be interesting to know what - if any - initial research has been done on this.

I long to read one day that such a technology has been developed.
The only way life on this planet will continue is if CO2 and methane is stripped out of the atmosphere.
Can this be done? Surely research is going on.
For two years since Brexit I have been protesting that the massive cost of undoing our constitution and reformulating it is, excluding all the other perfectly valid reasons one might object - the most monstrous avoidance of the reality of climate change.
To waste such huge resources, both in time and money, on Brexit when EVERY government in the world ought to be pooling resources at breakneck speed to develop frantically urgent technologies to try to clean up the atmosphere - is a terrifying dereliction of duty.
All opinion to date has been that geo-engineering will be either impossible, or have lethal unintended consequences, or not be scaleable.

Britain has to adapt to climate change, fast | Simon Lewis",article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/06/britain-heatwave-worse-to-come-water-climate-change,2665,"Much of the world is in the grip of a heatwave. Britain is so hot and dry that we have Indonesia-style peat fires raging across our moorlands. Montreal posted its highest temperature ever, with the deaths of 33 people in Quebec attributed to the scorching heat. And if you think that’s hot and dangerous, the town of Quriyat in Oman never went below a frightening 42.6C for a full 24 hours in June, almost certainly a global record. While many people love a bit of sun, extreme heat is deadly. But are these sweltering temperatures just a freak event, or part of an ominous trend we need to prepare for?
Earth’s climate system has always produced occasional extreme weather events, both warm and cold. What is different about now is that extra short-term warmth – from the jet stream being further north than usual – is adding to the long-term trend of rising global temperatures. The warming trend is very clear: the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows that all 18 years of the 21st century are among the 19 warmest on record; and 2016 was the warmest year ever recorded. Overall global surface air temperatures have risen by 1C since the industrial revolution. It is therefore no surprise that temperature records are being broken. And we can expect this to become a feature of future summers.
The long-term warming trend is driven by the release of greenhouse gases, chiefly carbon dioxide. Many alternative causes have been tested by scientists: the effects of sunspots, volcanic eruptions and other natural events. Only greenhouse gas emissions, dominated by fossil fuel use, explain the warming over the past century. This understanding isn’t just retrospective: 30 years ago this summer, climate scientist James Hansen told a US Senate committee that the climate was changing and fossil fuels were the main culprit. He made headlines worldwide with predictions that if emissions continued our planet would continue to warm, which it inexorably has.
Today’s heatwave is not related, as some have suggested, to the every-few-years shift of Pacific Ocean currents that affects global weather patterns, known as El Niño. A new modest-sized El Niño is predicted for later this year but is not yet detectable. Today’s heatwave is what is expected as Earth moves to an ever warmer state. But it is worth watching the news for the coming El Niño later this year: if it turns out to be a large event, next summer could bring more extremely hot weather. And beyond that, as the climate warms, summer heatwaves will escalate in their severity.
So what is to be done? The amount of warming we see is directly related to the cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide. Stopping the warming requires moving to zero emissions of carbon dioxide. Despite the Paris agreement on climate change being designed to do exactly that, progress has been slow. Today 80% of world energy use is from fossil fuels. While the share of renewables is rising rapidly, so is energy use, meaning that globally, carbon emissions are flatlining, not declining. Commitments made so far under the Paris agreement show that we are on track for an additional 2C warming this century. Such large and rapid change will make it very difficult for societies to cope.
We will therefore also need to adapt. There is a lot we can do. At an individual level, we can cool our homes by keeping the curtains and windows shut on the sunny side of our house during the day to slow the rate at which it heats up, and then open windows at night to cool it down. We also need to keep a close eye on the very young and very old because they cannot regulate their temperatures very well, and suffer most in the heat. The major 2003 European heatwave killed 70,000 mostly older people. Changes to social care, for example, to attend to the needs of people who are vulnerable to high temperatures, can help avoid such death tolls in the future.
Climate change is a greater threat to the UK than EU directives, terrorism, or a foreign power invading
Beyond this, many aspects of society will require deep and difficult changes, including to our own mindsets. In the summers of the future, particularly in the south of England, we will regularly live in Mediterranean-type conditions. Adapting our national infrastructure, particularly around maintaining our water supplies, updating our housing stock as it is built to retain heat, and altering how we manage our land to avoid further catastrophic fires, will all be required. It is under-appreciated that climate change will transform the very fabric of the experience of living in the UK.
This coming new reality is not high on the political agenda. Climate change is a greater threat to the UK than EU directives, terrorism or a foreign power invading. Yet the scope of our political discussion on future threats is limited to Brexit and spending on defence. Instead of this blinkered view where the future is the same as the past, we need to step out of the intense heat and take a cool look at what we are doing to our home planet.
The development of farming and rise of civilisations occurred within a 10,000-year window of unusually stable environmental conditions. Those stable interglacial conditions are over. Human actions are driving Earth to a hot new super-interglacial state. What scientists call the Anthropocene epoch, this unstable time, is a new chapter of history. Today’s heat is a forewarning of far worse to come. To live well in this new world needs political action to catch up with this changing reality. Fast.

… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for our species and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

Well, The Australian's/Business Spectator's “adults” on being in “charge” in the abbott period proved themselves clueless as well as spectacularly incompetent. Having adopted exactly the mentality that drove the Imperial conquest of Iraq, the returning of asylum-seekers to Indonesia in breach of our own obligations plus the Law of the Sea plus Indonesia's territorial integrity, and the Re-Dispossession of NT Aborigines, the abbott Misgovernment then waged a similar campaign against us with the quite open aim of a similar degree of oppression, impoverishment and degeneration. Perhaps we need to devise a form of government that involves bombing people from high altitudes, which appears to be abbott's only conspicuous talent.

I note that after nearly two whole terms of the LNP being in federal government, Birmingham now makes an announcement supposedly to address the critical shortage of Science and Mathematics teachers. We have known for years that a crisis was looming in this area. 
It is obvious to me that Science teachers need to be paid more after gaining degrees in a Science subject (Physics, Chemistry or Biology) and Education. (It is one thing to graduate in Science, but another to know how to impart that knowledge to students.) 
Their salary then needs to be increased at the point where teachers have experience in effectively teaching all years up to and including Higher School certificate or its equivalent. Not every current Science teacher has covered the whole curriculum.
 In Victoria, Science teachers also teach Mathematics. This requires additional study. Teachers experienced in both Science and Mathematics through the whole gamut of the curriculum probably should receive an extra loading as well, as it gives schools flexibility to organise timetables and fill in for staff who are on sick leave. Relying on casual staff should be an absolute last resort. 
Yes, this would require more cash, but I see little evidence that Birmingham and Morrison are willing to make it happen. STEM teachers need to be rewarded appropriately if we want to attract the best possible teachers.

Sadly for Abbott, this compelling pitch to the world at large did not stoke a revolution, just a couple of public smackdowns. The same sortie fell similarly flat during the last couple of sitting weeks in the parliament when the former prime minister tried and failed to blow up the national energy guarantee.
Politics can be a singularly cruel business, so when Tuesday night’s treatise of denial to a group of climate sceptics in Melbourne didn’t quite land in the way Abbott might have hoped, the anger kicked in.
Popping up on his favourite radio station 2GB the next day, Abbott was a-n-g-r-y. Angry with Malcolm Turnbull, who had “politically assassinated” a democratically elected prime minister (apparently overlooking the inconvenience of his own political assassination of a democratically elected opposition leader in 2009).
Abbott told his interlocutor he didn’t really want to be out on this denial tour – playing these one-night-only ukulele gigs on Sky News at night and 2GB and the Australian – he wanted to be sorting out this fight internally, but he couldn’t because Turnbull had changed the dynamics in the Coalition party room in a way that limited internal political discussion.
Incredibly moving, this oppression. Pass the tissues.
Before Tuesday night and its aftermath, Abbott had performed his own forward sizzle by granting an exclusive interview with Simon Benson at the Australian. He wanted to know whether his Liberal party colleagues realised they had now washed up at the very same juncture they’d reached in 2009 “with Malcolm Turnbull trying to do a deal with the Labor party on emissions reduction”.
Hint, hint, guys.
Then he shared an insight that more than any other insight exemplifies the politics of Tony Abbott. Climate change, he contended, was not “a circle you can square with the Labor party … it is a fight that has to be won. There can be no consensus on climate change … you either win or lose … and at the moment we are losing”.
This really is the most extraordinary thing to say.
Just let it settle on you for a moment. There can be no middle ground, no pragmatic and sensible compromise in the national interest, no consensus, there is just total victory or total defeat.
Apart from the small problem of the default disposition trapping the country in some medieval jousting session, as if the joust has some intrinsic value in and of itself, that it is some sort of heroic conquest – there’s the fact that Tony’s victory is Australia’s defeat.
Let’s be clear. We are in the mess we are at the moment – higher power prices, rising emissions, a more unreliable electricity grid – largely because Abbott in 2013 prioritised a political jousting session with Labor on climate change over the national interest. A massive misjudgment was made. It was clear at the time, and it has only become clearer with the passage of time.
But in Abbott’s head this cage fight – one dogged Forestville resident versus evidence-based policy (the former prime minister showed in technicolour how little he cares about policy detail on Tuesday night when he indicated he didn’t understand the Paris commitments he signed up to in 2015) – is more important than the practical consequences that flow from it.
The mythic, the totemic, the symbolic, trumps the practical. Just let that settle on you for a moment or two, and think about how you might feel about your politics being a game of toy soldiers.
Fortunately for Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg, the signs point to the Abbott sortie being contained: Don Quixote tilting at imagined wild-eyed, carbon-constraining leftists like the Business Council of Australia and the National Farmers Federation.
What isn’t contained is an internal push on coal that could easily blow up the national energy guarantee. At this stage of proceedings, we need to train our eyes on the Nationals.
The national energy guarantee as a policy mechanism is supposed to be technology neutral. It will impose a reliability guarantee and an emissions reduction target on energy retailers, and that framework is then supposed to let the market determine the optimal energy mix to deliver reliable power with emissions trending downwards.
Turnbull has made much in recent months of the virtues of technology neutrality (engineering and economics) as opposed to ideology determining what the various power sources should be.
If this seemed all too good to be true, turns out it was. Some Nationals want a new taxpayer funded boondoggle for coal as the price for supporting the Neg. The ambit claim is either new power stations or retrofitting or both.
This week I asked the Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, what his party’s position on the Neg was, and whether the coal boondoggle was an official Nationals position or a position being championed by some Nationals, and by this I meant Nationals in Queensland.
This was his answer: “I support a sound energy policy that can help to achieve reliable supply and affordable energy prices for all Australians, especially those in rural and regional Australia who the Nationals represent”.
“Like other Nationals, I support the Neg and its purpose in bringing about consistency in the energy supply arrangements through a Coag process. All governments in Australia have a role to play in this process.
“In relation to current issues being reported by the media on negotiations in the Liberal and Nationals federal government, these matters are still in consideration.”
So, drum roll please, the official Nationals position articulated by the party leader is we support the Neg at a price still to be determined.
This would be fine if settling the Neg was only up to the commonwealth. The fact of the matter is any state or territory can veto the policy, and some of the Labor states are already concerned that the emissions reduction target in the scheme is too low.
What you do not want to say to those fretful states, if you are Frydenberg, is please sign off on this policy even though you think the emissions reduction target is too low ... and by the way, here’s my new coal boondoggle. Surprise!
The other moving part that some of the states will have in the back of their mind when they meet Frydenberg in early August will be the results of the 28 July super Saturday byelections.
If the Coalition performs well, taking either Braddon or Longman from Labor, then there will be a rush of collective blood about an early election, notwithstanding the fact Turnbull keeps insisting the government will not go to the polls until 2019.
It’s possible that some states might be tempted to sit tight rather than be herded into a quickie agreement on a policy they have reservations about if they think we are five minutes away from going to the polls.
Even if one of the states doesn’t kill the policy on the basis that technology neutrality and a Queensland inspired coal boondoggle are inherently contradictory propositions, then Labor federally might.
The working assumption has been Labor is more likely than not to support the policy once it returns to the federal arena, with some caveats such as increasing the level of ambition with emissions reduction, in the event it wins the next federal election.
I suspect this is still more likely than not, but I certainly don’t think it should be assumed that Labor will sign up on any terms.
I’ve been saying for months Frydenberg settling this policy is a lot like scaling Everest without oxygen.
So far, the energy minister has managed to haul himself to the south base camp at Nepal. He will back himself to get to the summit, but the toughest climb still looms.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute. Thank you.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jul/07/abbott-is-angry-about-energy-but-there-are-bigger-fish-to-fry

The mind isn’t something to be force fed to discriminate on others , it requires less haste more waste of pace, to gain some common self guidance. what they are willing to discover first!! Then give them iphone they allready know how to use it. Everyone is different from birth to death yet we are still at work today education is not working for humanity and how the understanding of this is more important.

As far as winter temeratures and ""GW""+""CC"" are concerned, the Andes had no snow two years in a row, but this year, they are probably pleased to say, it has been thick and deep. With regard to the seasons in Canada, it must always have been more difficult to grow things than here due to the shortness of the growing season, and the times in which seeds can germinate effectively in Spring time. I acquired, if not received the wisdom that the early (late 19thC) colonists of Canada who were given small plots of land, could make nothing of them due to their inability to grown anything on them. It was only with machinery, other than the human frame, that successful planting got under way.In the UK, the most competent farmers suceed in planting many crops in the Autumn, to grow onwards in the early Spring time.Farming and growing crops is a gamble at the best of times, which may account for the high incidence of suicide amid the farming population of these islands.The movement of species from one place to another, and from one continent to another is an enjyable subject of study. Some we complin about; some we don't. The movement of the crop sugar cane we could well do without; the movement of coffee, the dominant crop of Brazil, even now, we probably could not. the human race depends on it, and it is heavily used in medicine. Heroine, produced from Poppies in Colombia and Afgh is another.Lawfully we can not do with out that either; unlawfully it does severe damage to the user. Gardens may be microcosms but they are also potential micro-climates. I have a withering NW wind in my own garden but I can stand out there in a howling gale, and hey presto there is no little air movement in the garden at all. That may be no particular advantage,but other microclimate features are. The whole of the semi-steppe of Argentina is covered with these hugely high Italian poplars, completely surrounding not particularly large fields. They were planted 100-150 years ago and they produce easier working conditions, not least against the heavy gales experienced from the south, for half the year.

Being a vine, a clematis will twine around anything that crosses its path, including itself, at all available opportunities. The result is often, even with a short period of gardener inattention, a snarly mess; the leafstalks curl, and curl, in on themselves in order to find some – any – purchase. In this situation, if you want to coax the vine outward, you have to unwind the intricate tendrils very gently and place them against better climbing scaffolds: a thin stick, a wire. One long Canadian spring afternoon in May, that is what I did: slowly and carefully took apart the knots, suggesting to each shoot a less tangled path up a new, metal trellis.
On that particular afternoon, I had to wait until the sun had passed over the deck to do this work, or it would have been just too hot. It was nearly 31C that afternoon with high humidity: not quite record-breaking, but unseasonable for Toronto. Summers, here, are getting longer and hotter, and winters warmer and more unpredictable. This year, the thermometer hit 16C in February: that’s in a Canadian city in which the historical average high for the month is -3C. Now, we are in the middle of an extended heatwave.
In a year of large contrasts, there was also an exceptional storm in mid-April that turned roads and sidewalks to glass for days, and with such high winds that insurance companies threw up their hands at the number of claims related to roof damage, including mine. Then in May – May! – there was a heat alert. This is enough drama to make even my least environmentally-conscious friends make noises about global warming.
The garden has suffered this year, especially the lower-growing plants; even some of the hardy, well-established lavenders packed it in. The problem is not that it was too cold (although there was a top-10 longest and coldest polar air event in December/January), or that it was too warm in those double-digit February days, or that there was the ice storm in April, or that it was 31C in May, or even that there are now again record-breaking temperatures. The problem is that all of these things happened in a remarkably short time span, and that longer-term climate changes have already begun to destabilise plant communities, making them more vulnerable to extreme weather events.
What can I do, concretely, to mitigate change, to adapt to it, and even to resist it?
From my perspective as caretaker of this little plant community, the problem is also that many of the seasonal understandings that have been basic to gardening in Toronto can no longer be assumed. Lavender might not survive the winter without wrapping. Tomatoes might need to be shaded in order to survive what is forecast to be an especially hot summer. Plants that require specialist pollinators may find their calls unanswered because the short-lived insects on which they rely may now have lives out of sync with the blooms.
There is a multitude of opinions about gardening in these climate changing times. Many urban gardeners talk about how to protect their plants from climate change: shielding them from extreme temperatures, conserving and/or diverting water, planting a greater range of resilient species in more cohabitative arrangements, and being extra-aware of the presence of both predatory and pollinator insects.
Some gardeners understand their work as itself a form of climate change mitigation: getting rid of lawns that require mowing, planting to preserve and foster biodiversity, moving toward organic and permaculture practices to decrease the use of chemical fertilisers, and favouring native species that know what resilience means. Some are preparing for an intensified food security crisis, adapting flower beds for vegetables, and planting fruit-bearing shrubs and trees for future sustenance.
To me, more than anything, gardening in these times means two things. First, looking after my little backyard demands that I pay close attention to the present and future: what are the plants telling me about the ways the climate is changing? What do they need that I can give them? What do these needs tell me about the larger scale of the changes in which we are immersed? What can I do, concretely, to mitigate change, to adapt to it, and even to resist it?
Second, and more foundationally, this garden invites me to reflect on the past and present: on gardening itself, and how the particular plants I am tending are part of larger processes of colonial, global transformation in which histories of plant movements are bound up with those of capitalist, fossil-fueled developments. We can, perhaps, more easily think about cotton, wheat, sugar cane, and corn at this level: plants that were central to slavery, to the rise of industrial agriculture, to what some scholars call “ecological imperialism.” But gardens are also part of this picture.
Think about the clematis, for example. The purple specimen growing up my back deck is a Clematis “jackmanii”, a cross with Mediterranean and Chinese origins of an already global species first made by 19th century English horticulturalist George Jackman. Although there have been clematis in North America for millennia, there is no question that the international spread of C. “jackmanii” stems from a history of British colonial botany and, more recently, capitalist horticultural trade, both of which have selected for masses of large blooms rather than, say, medicinal potency. Many popular cultivars originate from particular species that are appealing to this narrow set of aesthetic criteria. The resulting inbreeding has spread particular diseases, like “clematis wilt”; moreover, the favouring of these cultivars by gardeners and industry means that less attention is paid to species that invite different kinds of relationship.
What does it mean, then, to worry about this beautiful, compromised, plant in the midst of climate change, when it is already so clearly implicated in global colonialism and capitalism? Yes, we can tend to gardens as acts to mitigate climate and foster biodiversity. But we can also challenge the relationships that have brought these particular gardens into being as part of, rather than as a refuge from, climate changing times. Gardens are microcosms of the complicated relationships that are the difficult world in which we are living, whether we like it or not, even as we may consciously refract those relations into new possibilities. In the garden, this practice involves taking careful stock: of the plants that are here, of the travels that have brought them here, and of the possibilities that “here” might yet bring about.

Recent efforts by the Ministry of Defence to use the Nato summit to secure further budget increases are misguided. Instead of increasing our safety, heavy spending on aggressive military capabilities and power projection is exacerbating global tensions. By the same token, turning a blind eye to Trump’s abusive and degrading rhetoric and actions in the hope of shoring up a superpower alliance deepens global insecurity.
If the UK wants to make a genuine contribution to security, the government needs to invest far more in addressing the underlying causes of global insecurity, such as economic inequality, climate change and poor governance. It should be using its diplomatic clout to increase international focus on these issues, as well as supporting local actors in concerted efforts to bring about durable political resolution of the conflicts in Yemen, Syria, Israel-Palestine and elsewhere. Conflict prevention and peacebuilding are not soft options; failure to make progress on these critical challenges of our time only results in more insecurity for everyone, both in the UK and overseas.
We therefore call for an urgent and comprehensive rethink of the government’s approach to security and international relations, based on systematic commitment to its declared values of human dignity, human rights, freedom, democracy and equality.  The UK’s security alliances need to work for the common good of all the world’s people.Celia McKeonCoordinator, Rethinking Security
• Mrs May is surely right that the majority of British people understand the “importance of the UK-US alliance” (Report, 7 July).  However, that is certainly not an alliance with the opinions and actions of the current president and his administration. Thousands of British people would want to be aligned with those in the United States who are protesting against the huge arsenal of nuclear weapons which the US not only maintains but which is being developed; those fighting to preserve the Environmental Protection Agency and stand up against the destruction of the environment by the climate change-denying president; with those working against the money and resource being put into developing and producing more and more advanced technological weapons to line the pockets of the huge military manufacturers. Our sympathies are with those women and men in the US who are prepared to take non-violent direct action to stem the tide of racism, misogyny, militarism and cruelty of their current leaders.Rae StreetLittleborough, Greater Manchester
• You report that President Trump will be spending only a couple of days in London, meeting the Queen and prime minister, before being flown to Scotland for a “private visit”, for the remainder of his trip. The Foreign Office may be following precedent. Almost exactly 47 years ago, on 12 July 1971, a close British ally with a somewhat unsavoury reputation visited the UK, and was given two days in London, including talks with the monarch and PM.  He then flew to Scotland for two days including some shopping, sea swimming and military ceremonies. His name? President Idi Amin Dada of Uganda. Mark LeopoldHove, East Sussex
• Mr Trump has been invited to this country by our government. He should therefore be treated with civility. He has, however, shown himself to be self-serving, ignorant, vulgar and mendacious. He does not deserve our attention. Many of his actions and statements deserve contempt.
The best response is to ignore him as much as possible, with minimal publicity and absolutely no demonstrations. He feeds off adulation and will enjoy the attention which demonstrations will provide.Chris OsmanOxford

• You shouldn’t waste time criticising Donald Trump. He has had little effect on greenhouse gas emissions. China is producing twice as much carbon dioxide (CO2) as the USA, and is also pumping out illegal greenhouse gases, like CFC-11, which were banned by the Montreal protocol (China is source of illegal CFC-11 eroding ozone, 9 July). Since everyone agreed that atmospheric CO2 had to be kept below 450 ppm, China has gone from producing 10% of global emissions to producing 28%, and intends to continue increasing its output until 2030.Robert McCartneyFarnborough, Hampshire

The state’s €8bn national investment fund will be required to sell all investments in coal, oil, gas and peat “as soon as is practicable”, which is expected to mean within five years. Norway’s huge $1tn sovereign wealth fund has only partially divested from fossil fuels, targeting some coal companies, and is still considering its oil and gas holdings.
The fossil fuel divestment movement has grown rapidly and trillions of dollars of investment funds have been divested, including large pension funds and insurers, cities such as New York, churches and universities. 
Supporters of divestment say existing fossil fuel resources are already far greater than can be burned without causing catastrophic climate change and that exploring and producing more fossil fuels is therefore morally wrong and economically risky. However, some critics argue say that remaining as shareholders and persuading fossil fuel companies to change can be more effective. 
The Irish fossil fuel divestment bill was passed in the lower house of parliament on Thursday and it is expected to pass rapidly through the upper house, meaning it could become law before the end of the year. The Irish state investment fund holds more than €300m in fossil fuel investments in 150 companies.
“The [divestment] movement is highlighting the need to stop investing in the expansion of a global industry which must be brought into managed decline if catastrophic climate change is to be averted,” said Thomas Pringle, the independent member of parliament who introduced the bill. “Ireland by divesting is sending a clear message that the Irish public and the international community are ready to think and act beyond narrow short term vested interests.”
Éamonn Meehan, executive director of international development charity Trócaire, said: “Today the Oireachtas [Irish parliament] has sent a powerful signal to the international community about the need to speed up the phase-out of fossil fuels.”
Meehan said: “Just last month Ireland was ranked the second worst European country for climate action, so the passing of this bill is good news. But it has to mark a significant change of pace on the issue.”
The bill defines a fossil fuel company as a company that derives 20% or more of its revenue from exploration, extraction or refinement of fossil fuels. The bill also allows investment in Irish fossil fuel companies if this funds their move away from fossil fuels.
Gerry Liston at Global Legal Action Network, who drafted the bill, said: “Governments will not meet their obligations under the Paris agreement on climate change if they continue to financially sustain the fossil fuel industry. Countries the world over must now urgently follow Ireland’s lead and divest from fossil fuels.”

Authorities have told residents of the Innaarsuit island settlement living near the shore to move to higher ground.
“We fear the iceberg could calve [break apart] and send a flood towards the village,” said Lina Davidsen of Greenland police.
Susanne Eliassen, a member of Innaarsuit’s council, said it was not unusual for large icebergs to be seen close to the community.
“But this iceberg is the biggest we have seen ... and there are cracks and holes that make us fear it can calve anytime,” she said.
“Nobody is staying unnecessarily close to the beach and all children have been told to stay in areas that are high up.” 
The village’s power station and fuel tanks are located close to the shore. 
Police have moved a search-and-rescue helicopter closer to the remote community, which has a population of about 170. 
The incidence of icebergs breaking free from glaciers is likely to become more common, said William Colgan, a Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland researcher.
“Iceberg production in Greenland has been increasing in the past 100 years as climate change has become stronger,” he said, while the rising number of icebergs were in turn “increasing the tsunami hazards”.
Last year, four people died and 11 were injured after a landslide caused a tsunami off another island settlement called Nuugaatsiaq, sending several houses crashing into the sea.
The latest incident comes after scientists at New York University released a time-lapse video of a massive iceberg breaking free from a glacier in eastern Greenland last month.
Denise Holland, of NYU’s environmental fluid dynamics laboratory, and David Holland, an expert in atmospheric and ocean science, had camped by the Helheim glacier for weeks to collect data to better project sea level changes due to global warming.
David Holland said it was “the largest event we’ve seen in over a decade in Greenland”. 
The video, which is 20 times faster than real time, shows 3% of the annual ice loss of Greenland occuring in 30 minutes.
“It sounded like rockets going off,” David Holland said, describing it as “a very complex, chaotic, noisy event”.
While the couple is studying Greenland, he said that “the real concern is in Antarctica, where everything is so big the stakes are much higher”.

A heatwave swept the planet, and it was not simply one hot summer: the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows that all 18 years of the 21st century are among the 19 warmest on record, and 2016 was the warmest year ever. “In 20 years’ time, the [recent] heat ... will no longer be news. It will be routine,” warned a Guardian editorial.
Climate change in cities is frequently discussed in terms of flooding or storms – but its most dangerous consequence may be heat. Air conditioning, private transport and water engineering have allowed urban settlements in arid areas to expand at a dizzying and unsustainable rate, while outdated paradigms of urban planning and design give little relief from rising temperatures.
Cities around the world may find their water use restricted – Cape Town, South Africa and Shimla, India have already have already come dangerously close to “day zero”, when taps run dry – and their power infrastructure compromised by reliance on air conditioning. Standards of living are likely to fall. Heat islands, droughts and disrupted seasons will likely lead to more deaths – particularly among the young, the old and those with health issues.
Guardian Cities will be publishing a special week of journalism next month investigating heat in cities, and we want to hear from you.

States of emergency have been declared in Latvia and Lithuania, while the sun continues to bake Swedish fields that have received only 12% of their normal rainfall. 
The abnormally hot temperatures – which have topped 30C in the Arctic Circle – are in line with climate change trends, according to the World Meteorological Organization. And as about 50 wildfires rage across Sweden, no respite from the heatwave is yet in sight.
Lennart Nilsson, a 55-year-old cattle farmer from Falkenberg near Malmo and co-chair of the Swedish Farmers Association, said it was the worst drought he had experienced.
 “This is really serious,” he said. “Most of south-west Sweden hasn’t had rain since the first days of May. A very early harvest has started but yields seem to be the lowest for 25 years – 50% lower, or more in some cases – and it is causing severe losses.”
 If no rain comes soon, Nilsson’s association estimates agricultural losses of up to 8bn Swedish kronor (£700m) this year and widespread bankruptcies. The drought would personally cost him around 500,000 kronor (£43,000), Nilsson said, adding that, like most farmers, he is now operating at a loss.
 The picture is little different in the Netherlands, where Iris Bouwers, a 25-year-old farmer, said the parched summer had been a “catastrophe” for her farm.
“Older families around me are comparing this to 1976,” she said. “My dad can’t remember any drought like this.” 
The Bouwerses expect to lose €100,000 this year after a 30% drop in their potato crop. After investing in a pig stable over the winter, the family have no savings to cover the loss.  
Asked what she would do, Bouwers just laughed. “Hope and pray,” she said. “There is not much more I can do. I wouldn’t talk about bankruptcy yet, but our deficit will be substantial. It probably means we need to have a very good talk with the bank.”
If anything, the situation is even worse in Poland, Belarus and the Czech Republic, where vegetation stress has taken hold. In parts of Germany, some farmers are reportedly destroying arid crops.
After June was declared the second warmest on record, the European commission pledged to help farmers with a raft of measures, including the temporary suspension of “greening” obligations partly intended to prevent climate change.
Farmers who have diversified their crops and invested in irrigation are in a better position to handle extreme weather events, which will become more common as the climate warms. But that is not an option for smallholders with monocultures and little access to irrigation.
Jannes Maes, a small dairy farmer in Flanders and the president of the European council of young farmers, said concerns about insolvent farms were rising but were not the only problem.
 “Bankruptcies would be hard,” he said, “but the economic loss farmers are suffering is often just as bad because they are hidden bankruptcies that have been prevented by wasting family capital on a farm.”
 Thomas Duffy, an Irish dairy farmer from County Cavan, said the drought “won’t break us, but our feeding costs are 50% higher than last year and all the money we’d normally be putting into improving conditions for the cows and infrastructure is now going to silages [winter feed] and buying forage.”
The European Drought Observatory (EDO) has described the drought as “an extensive and severe anomaly” affecting Scandinavia, Scotland, Ireland, the Baltics, the Netherlands and northern Germany.
A spokeswoman for the EU’s Joint Research Centre, which oversees the EDO, said farmers should prepare to adapt to a warmer climate with “diversification or change of crop types and varieties, but also a more efficient use of water”.
All water-related sectors “should be preparing sustainable adaptation measures towards an increase of drought frequency and intensity in the future”, she said.

Teaming up with the ex-president of Ireland for a podcast I learned how women around the world are working to save the planet – and unlearned my ‘west knows best’ attitude,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0483d67280bba5969db90f5fb62da5354e13feac/0_392_2790_1674/master/2790.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=889df6c4865746274d569e7d2619fe21,"Meet the inspiring, hopeful women fighting for climate justice | Maeve Higgins",article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/24/meet-the-inspiring-hopeful-women-fighting-for-climate-justice,321,"In March this year I started to care about the planet. Like, in a big way. Before that, I fretted about it and treated it like an extremely beautiful but very sick creature I was afraid to get too attached to. If you want to know how my change of heart started, I’ll tell you the same thing I told the poor old Texan man sitting beside me on a flight out of JFK. “I’m going for a chemistry test with the first woman president of Ireland so I could potentially be her co-host for this climate justice podcast she’s about to make.” He stayed quiet after that.
The following morning, jet-lagged and disoriented on a winding London street, I couldn’t find the restaurant where I was supposed to meet Mary Robinson. When I eventually did find it, I couldn’t find the door, so her first impression of me was of a tardy wild-eyed woman knocking on a window mouthing “so sorry” and “just an omelette please”.
My first impression of her was way back when I was eight years old, and she became the president of Ireland. Back then, she came across as powerful and good and clever, certainly not someone to mess with. Those were the instincts of a child and three decades later I’m glad to have been proven correct. After the Irish presidency Mary Robinson became the UN high commissioner for human rights, and it was during this time she began to see the link between climate change and human rights. She focused in on this and 15 years ago set up the Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice. Climate justice means a people-centered solution to climate change. It pushes for restorative justice and recognizes the integrity of the planet and every creature on it. And I’ve come to understand that climate justice is a way out of the capitalist and paternalist way of living that’s gotten us into this climate change mess in the first place.
I’m a comedian and a podcaster, as I explained to the Texan on the airplane who was now pretending to be asleep. My job as co-host, should I get it, would be to help navigate the world of podcasting and, I whispered as I patted his hand, I’d add in my own sense of curiosity and hopefully some levity too. 
The following morning, after hurriedly eating my omelette, we headed to a studio where we had some classic podcast banter, which went as follows: Me: “On you and your husband’s first date, who paid for dinner?” Mary, narrowing her eyes: “This is a little frivolous. Shall we begin the divestment discussion?” 
That’s how it started; that’s how I learned more about climate justice in the past six months than in the whole rest of my life. I count myself lucky, because climate justice is fascinating, uplifting, and intersectional in a way that’s still too large for me to comprehend but could change the course of the world. 
Over the course of five months, Mary and I spoke to and heard from amazing women all over the world. There are scientists in Africa, farmers in Asia, politicians in Brussels, and indigenous community leaders in America, all working to solve climate problems every single day. People I didn’t realize were helping turn out to be the heroes of this story – like lawyers and children and midwives. People like Tara Houska, an attorney who advocates on behalf of tribal nations at the local and federal levels, who spent six months on the frontlines in North Dakota fighting the Dakota Access pipeline. 
She is also heavily engaged in the movement to defund fossil fuels, and she travels the world challenging major banks and institutions about this. I got so fired up after listening to that I called my bank to see what they were doing with my savings: $3,200 at the time (less now that I had to buy a new sofa). Turns out I needed to move it (my money, not my sofa) because Chase Bank is … not a good choice if you care about divestment from fossil fuels.
Two youngsters stick in my mind, Victoria Barrett and Ridhima Pandey. They are just a couple out of dozens of kids worldwide using the law to force their governments to take climate change more seriously. Victoria is a 19-year-old New Yorker. Her school was flooded by Superstorm Sandy and she’s a plaintiff in a groundbreaking constitutional climate lawsuit against the US government, arguing the administration’s climate-changing actions violate young people’s constitutional rights to life, liberty and property. The trial starts in October. Ridhima, from Uttarakhand, India, filed a petition against her government in 2017 when she was just nine years old. She argued that the Indian government had failed to fulfill its duties to her and the Indian people to protect them from climate impacts – a hearing on the case is expected soon. When I was nine, all I wanted was one of those pens with lots of different colors to click between. 
While all of us have contributed to climate change to some extent, its results are not gender neutral
I also learned that while all of us have contributed to climate change to some extent, its results are not gender neutral. It affects women first and worst: women are more likely to die in a climate disaster, and day to day they are the ones cooking on solid fuel stoves that can ultimately poison them. Climate justice offers a feminist solution, one that sees women as equally valuable as men. I learned too that the countries that do the worst damage to the planet don’t actually feel its effects, at least not fully and not yet. 
Which brings me to what I unlearned. I’m sorry to say that in the past I’ve seen people in countries and communities hit worst by climate change as unfortunate victims, and failed to see that precisely because of this suffering, they are often the ones leading the fight against it. Climate justice heroes come from Bangladesh, Rwanda and Puerto Rico, to name a few, and also from indigenous communities worldwide. It took repeated conversations and actual listening on my part to break down my colonial mindset, my internalized “the west knows best” attitude, one I wasn’t aware I had. 
Within the US, people of color and poor people breathe dirtier air than whiter, wealthier people. In LA, you’re almost twice as likely to die in a heatwave if you’re black, because of the urban heat island effect and less access to air conditioning and cars than other Angelenos. Isn’t that just disgusting? But again, leadership is coming from within the communities at risk. We had a conversation with Sarra Tekola. She’s a climate justice and Black Lives Matter activist working on a PhD in climate science in Seattle. It was thrilling to sit in a studio and be part of a discussion between Mary, someone accustomed to and comfortable moving through the halls of power, and Sarra, someone who is 40 years younger and usually found protesting outside those very halls. 
As you would expect, there was more in common than not, and what I found moving was the women’s shared sense of urgency and fighting spirit, and the unspoken kinship that comes with it. Anyone can be a part of this, you just have to join in. Until now, I’ve felt a pervasive sense of doom that’s kept me stuck when it comes to climate change. But today, there are new elements I’ve learned about that bolster me and give me hope: namely the ethics, the politics and the spiritual dimension in our relationship to the planet and the people who live on it. 
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism.

One in five homes dangerously overheats during heatwaves today, the MPs found, while on the hottest day of 2016 alone there were almost 400 heat-related deaths. But climate change has doubled the risk of heatwaves and events even worse than the heat currently baking the nation could occur every other year by the 2040s, the MPs report said, with a tripling of heat deaths to 7,000 a year as a result.
Buildings, particularly hospitals and care homes, must be prepared for heatwaves, the MPs said, with sick and elderly people especially vulnerable to heart and breathing problems. But currently the NHS is only required to prepare plans for severe cold weather and there are no building regulations to prevent overheating with ventilation and shading. 
The MPs also called for other measures, including formal guidance from Public Health England to relax office dress codes and allow home working during heatwaves, and to head teachers about relaxing school uniform policy.
The MPs said a public information campaign on the serious dangers of heatwaves was needed and health minister Steve Brine, giving evidence to the MPs in June, acknowledged this: “Heat alerts tend to be seen as barbecue alerts, as opposed to there being a risk.”
Mary Creagh MP, chair of the environmental audit committee, said: “The government has sat on its hands, ignored the warnings of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) and left the UK woefully unprepared.” As far back as 2003, a severe heatwave saw temperatures reach 38.5C and more than 2,000 heat-related deaths in 10 days, she said: “But the government has continued to allow homes, hospitals and schools to be built that are not resilient to heatwaves.”
Kathryn Brown, head of adaptation at the CCC said: “We have recommended to government every year since 2014 that a new standard or regulation is needed to address the risk from overheating in new homes.” Ministers have rejected the advice, citing a commitment to “reduce net regulation on homebuilders”.
The government published its updated National Adaptation Strategy on 19 July but Brown said it made no commitment to deal with the issue. “Action is needed now to redouble efforts to tackle overheating – one of the key risks facing the UK from climate change.”
Heatwaves are known killers in the UK and the number of hot days is rising. “It is likely that more than 1,000 people have died in the UK as a result of the extended heatwave conditions this summer,” said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics. “There would justifiably be an outcry if more than 1,000 people had died in a flood.” 
“The government’s apparent lack of concern about the growing risks of deadly heatwaves is absolutely woeful,” he said. “The lack of communication by government departments and agencies about the risks of heatwaves is contributing to the death toll every year.”
The EAC report found that homes in densely populated urban areas, which can be 10C hotter than the countryside, are already at significant risk of overheating, as are certain other buildings, including houses built in the 1960s and 1970s.
“The current lack of regulation to prevent overheating, means that new developments, including hospitals and care homes, which will be around for the next 70 years will add to the number of buildings that overheat,” it said.
Excess deaths in nursing homes increased more than 40% in some parts of the UK during the 2003 heatwave, the MPs reported, but the homes are still not required to report their readiness to cope under NHS emergency preparedness rules.
Heatwaves are also economically costly, the EAC reported, particularly due to lost working days as a result of transport problems. “Only 50% of the UK’s motorways and major roads are surfaced with material that is the most resilient to the kind of summer temperatures the UK is beginning to experience regularly,” the MPs said, while in June, railway tracks buckled in the heat and caused significant delays.
Research cited in the report found that in 2010, 5m staff days were lost due to overheating above 26C, resulting in an economic loss of about £770m.
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs did not respond to a request for comment.

The result is preliminary but they say the signal of climate change is “unambiguous”. Scientists have long predicted that global warming is ramping up the number and intensity of heatwaves, with events even worse than current one set to strike every other year by the 2040s.
“The logic that climate change will do this is inescapable – the world is becoming warmer, and so heatwaves like this are becoming more common,” said Friederike Otto, at the University of Oxford and part of the World Weather Attribution (WWA) consortium that did the work.
“What was once regarded as unusually warm weather will become commonplace, and in some cases, it already has,” she said. “So this is something that society can and should prepare for. But equally there is no doubt that we can and should constrain the increasing likelihood of all kinds of extreme weather events by restricting greenhouse gas emissions as sharply as possible.”
The new analysis is a climate-change attribution study. By comparing extreme weather with historical measurements and with computer models of a climate unaltered by carbon emissions, researchers can find how much global warming is increasing the risk of dangerous weather.
The researchers analysed records of the hottest three-day period at seven weather stations in northern Europe, from Ireland to the Netherlands to Scandinavia, where data was easily accessible.
“We found that for the weather station in the far north, in the Arctic Circle, the current heatwave is just extraordinary – unprecedented in the historical record,” said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and also part of WWA. 
Across northern Europe, the group found global warming more than doubled the risk of scorching temperatures. “We can can see the fingerprints of climate change on local extremes,” he said. “It is amazing now that it is something you can really see at a local level.”
“Most heatwave studies have been done on large scale averages, so European-wide temperatures,” said Otto. “In this study, we have looked at individual locations, where people live, to represent the heatwave people are actually experiencing.” The analysis is a preliminary study as a full study requires many climate models to be run on high-powered computers, which takes months.
Previous attribution analyses have shown very strong connections between climate change and extreme weather events. The scorching summer in New South Wales, Australia, in 2016-17 was made at least 50 times more likely by global warming, meaning it can be “linked directly to climate change”, said the scientists. 
The “Lucifer” heatwave across Europe’s Mediterranean nations in 2017 summer was made at least 10 times more likely by climate change, while the unprecedented deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey also in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change, new research has found. However, other events, such as storms Eleanor and Friederike, which hit western Europe in January, were not made more likely by climate change, according to the scientists.
In Europe, the heatwave has been caused by the stalling of the jet stream wind, which usually funnels cool Atlantic weather over the continent. This has left hot, dry air in place for two months – far longer than than usual. The stalling of the northern hemisphere jet stream is being increasingly firmly linked to global warming, in particular to the rapid heating of the Arctic and resulting loss of sea ice.
The role of climate change in driving extreme weather events may actually be underestimated by these attribution studies, according to Prof Michael E Mann at Penn State University in the US. The work is good, he said, but computer models cannot yet reliably account for the complex jet stream changes caused by global warming, making the attribution studies “inherently conservative”. 
Serious climate change is “unfolding before our eyes”, said Prof Rowan Sutton, director of climate research at the University of Reading. “No one should be in the slightest surprised that we are seeing very serious heatwaves and associated impacts in many parts of the world.”
The wide geographical spread of the heatwave, right across four continents, points to global warming as the culprit, said Prof Peter Stott, a science fellow at the UK’s Met Office: “That pattern is something we wouldn’t be seeing without climate change.”
The heatwave across northern Europe has seen wildfires in the Arctic Circle and prolonged heat across the UK and the European continent. In the south, fierce blazes have devastated parts of Greece, with scores of people killed. 
But extreme weather has struck across the globe. Severe floods killed at least 220 people in Japan in early July, with the nation then hit by an “unprecedented” heatwave that peaked at 41.1C and left 35,000 people in hospital. In the US, extreme heat in the west is feeding wildfires, with Yosemite national park being evacuated, while flooding is affecting the east.
Temperature records have also fallen in Taiwan, with a temperature of 40.3C in Tianxiang, and in Ouargla in Algeria’s Sahara desert, which reported a maximum temperature of 51.3C, the highest temperature ever reliably recorded in Africa. The first six months of the 2018 are the hottest recorded for any year without an El Niño event, a natural climate cycle that raises temperatures.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

More than 3,000 firefighters have been deployed to contain the flames, and the destruction is expected to worsen throughout the weekend as high temperatures and dry conditions inhibit efforts.
The state governor, Jerry Brown, has declared a state of emergency in northern California’s Shasta county, and in southern California’s Riverside county, to help provide local fire crews with the resources they need to battle the blazes. Donald Trump has not yet commented on the fires.
Redding, a city of 92,000 near the Oregon border, is at grave risk from the Carr fire, which has so far killed two people. The fire is only 3% contained and has already scorched more than 44,450 aces. “Really, we’re in a life-saving mode right now in Redding,” said the Cal Fire battalion chief, Jonathan Cox. “We’re not fighting a fire. We’re trying to move people out of the path of it because it is now deadly, and it is now moving at speeds and in ways we have not seen before in this area.”
The Carr fire erupted on Monday 23 July and is being propelled by “extreme fire behavior and challenging wind conditions”, according to CalFire officials. The blaze continues to threaten nearly 5,000 structures and 65 buildings have already been incinerated. 
Meanwhile, in southern California, the Cranston fire has consumed 11,500 acres and is also only 3% contained. The fire threatens swaths of lands in Idyllwild, and Mt San Jacinto state park and San Bernardino national forest have both been closed.
The Ferguson fire, which has burned close to 46,000 acres near Yosemite national park and caused the death of a firefighter, prompted national parks officials to close the most popular areas, including evacuating the famous Yosemite valley at the peak of tourist season. More than 3,800 fire personnel are working to protect the groves of ancient sequoias along the western edge of the park.
The season has followed a particularly destructive and deadly fire year in the state –in 2017 nearly 9,000 wildfires tore through 1.2m acres, taking down close to 11,000 structures. Forty-six people lost their lives, making it one of the deadliest fire seasons on record in the state. This year could prove to be even worse – already this year, roughly 4,000 fires have erupted in California, scorching more than 144,303 acres, and officials say it is still early in the season.
“We are still in July, which is kind of unnerving for us here in California because we are seeing this kind of destruction happening already,” Lynne Tolmachoff, a CalFire representative, said. “We still have at least three months – and generally the worst part of fire season – yet to come.”
She explained that California’s recent five-year drought killed 129m trees, which are fuel for the fires. So are the grasses that grew over the winter but have now dried out. “It’s the kindling for a big fire,” she adds.
California’s climate has become drier, with longer, hotter summers. Over the past two decades the fire seasons has become longer, stretching from May to November or December. 
“There have been numerous homes destroyed in the Carr fire just last night and two deaths that we have confirmed already,” Tolmachoff said. “So it is definitely not looking good and it’s turning out to be a very difficult fire season. It could, depending on what occurs down the road, could easily meet or surpass last year.”

There will be little respite from the hot weather in many areas of the country, even as thunderstorms and heavy rains spread from the east, as farmers have seen their crops wilt, their fields parched and livestock struggle in the extreme conditions.
Although it is too early to say precisely what price rises may come, the National Farmers’ Union said farmgate prices were likely to increase. Retailers will have to decide whether to pass such rises on to consumers.
Anand Dossa, economist at the NFU, said early indications were that harvesting for staples such as grains was taking place early, but it was too early to say exactly what the yields would be. “These are challenging conditions, and we would expect to see an effect,” he said. He added that sheep meat production was down 16% this year.
Following the year’s wet and cold spring, many livestock farmers have had to dip into their stores of winter feed early, said Robert Martin, who keeps a 120-strong herd of dairy cattle near Carlisle. “Milk yields are down because of the conditions,” he added. “People are coming to market early with cattle because they can’t afford to carry passengers.”
Tim Mead, of the organic dairy company Yeo Valley, said a 10% reduction in milk yield was common but “there is still plenty of milk around”. Many farmers were still in debt as a result of low prices in the last few years, however, and this year’s conditions would hurt them further. George Dunn, chief executive of the Tenant Farmers Association, said confidence in the beef market had also “taken a hit”, the result of lower supplies of fodder and very little grass. “Store markets are well down in price, which may lead to shortages into next year,” he warned.
Another problem for livestock farmers is the lack of straw, used for bedding. “Straw length is short because of the impact of the hot weather on the growth of wheat and barley, and straw was already in desperately short supply because of the previous year’s wet harvest,” said Zoe Davies, chief executive of the National Pig Association. “We are encouraging anyone who can to bale straw to try to make more available. The last thing we want is for the large number of our members reliant on straw to be outbid on it by subsidised straw-burning [power] plants, which will only exacerbate the issue.”
Jack Ward, chief executive of the British Growers Association, warned of impacts across the market for vegetables. “As a broad generalisation, volumes [of crops harvested] will be down and for the majority of crops costs will be up.”
The next few months would be crucial, he said. “Brassicas, such as broccoli and cabbage, are down in volume. With salad, growers are having difficulty just keeping the plants alive. But there is still time for potatoes to bulk up, and onions,” he said. “That will depend on the weather in August and September.”
Many farmers are having to harvest crops, particularly grain, early this year because the hot conditions have caused them to ripen sooner, but without time to “bulk up” to their usual size. This is likely to depress the yield on such crops, which could in turn raise prices.
The widespread nature of the heatwave across Europe and beyond would mean retailers cannot simply pick up cheaper food elsewhere to put on their shelves, said Liz Bowles, head of farming at the Soil Association. “Many food exporter regions around the globe are being affected, so we could see pressure on prices for consumers,” she said.
Farm economics are also much affected by the weak pound, added Dossa, which he called a “double-edged sword”, because while it makes exports more profitable, it raises the cost of inputs such as feed, fuel and fertiliser. Meanwhile, the uncertainty over Brexit has resulted in a slump in confidence among farmers, with the NFU’s latest survey in April showing confidence at its lowest in eight years. Low confidence translates to lower investment, which could have a long-term dampening effect on productivity.
Farming leaders have warned that thousands of rural families may face hardship as a result of this year’s conditions. Malcolm Thomas, chairman of the Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution, which provided £2m in help to farming families last year, said: “I envisage a busy autumn and winter [for us], with many livestock farmers already forced to feed winter rations to their stock. Having to buy more feed will quickly drive up overheads. We’ve not seen weather like this in decades, and it’s worth remembering it comes hot on the heels of a long cold winter and a particularly wet spring, which resulted in floods in many areas.”
Farmers are used to dealing with the vagaries of the weather, but the long winter and cold spring, followed by the heatwave, has produced a meteorological double whammy that has sent many reeling. That would have been bad enough, but the added effects of Brexit are creating turmoil. Thomas said: “Reacting to what the elements throw at you is part of a farmer’s life, and most accept that. However, extreme weather creates extreme challenges that make it impossible to plan for anything. There’s already tremendous uncertainty about the future due to Brexit and the implications of a possible no deal outcome.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/30/extreme-weather-could-push-uk-food-prices-up-this-year-say-farmers

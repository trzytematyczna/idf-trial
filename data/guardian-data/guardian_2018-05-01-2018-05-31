Their research shows that, even with all the carbon cuts already pledged by nations so far, climate change would make almost half of insect habitat unsuitable by the end of the century, with pollinators like bees particularly affected.\nHowever, if climate change could be limited to a temperature rise of 1.5C - the very ambitious goal included in the global Paris agreement - the losses of insects are far lower. \nThe new research is the most comprehensive to date, analysing the impact of different levels of climate change on the ranges of 115,000 species. It found plants are also heavily affected but that mammals and birds, which can more easily migrate as climate changes, suffered less.\n\u201cWe showed insects are the most sensitive group,\u201d said Prof Rachel Warren, at the University of East Anglia, who led the new work. \u201cThey are important because ecosystems cannot function without insects. They play an absolutely critical role in the food chain.\u201d\n\u201cThe disruption to our ecosystems if we were to lose that high proportion of our insects would be extremely far-reaching and widespread,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople should be concerned - humans depend on ecosystems functioning.\u201d Pollination, fertile soils, clean water and more all depend on healthy ecosystems, Warren said.\nIn October, scientists warned of \u201cecological Armageddon\u201d after discovering that the number of flying insects had plunged by three-quarters in the past 25 years in Germany and very likely elsewhere.\n\u201cWe know that many insects are in rapid decline due to factors such as habitat loss and intensive farming methods,\u201d said Prof Dave Goulson, at the University of Sussex, UK, and not part of the new analysis. \u201cThis new study shows that, in the future, these declines would be hugely accelerated by the impacts of climate change, under realistic climate projections. When we add in all the other adverse factors affecting wildlife, all likely to increase as the human population grows, the future for biodiversity on planet Earth looks bleak.\u201d\nIn the new analysis, published in the journal Science, the researchers gathered data on the geographic ranges and current climate conditions of 31,000 insect species, 8,000 birds, 1,700 mammals, 1,800 reptiles, 1,000 amphibians and 71,000 plants. \nThey then calculated how the ranges change when global warming means some regions can no longer support particular species. For the first time in this type of study, they included the 1.5C Paris target, as well as 2C, the longstanding international target, and 3.2C, which is the rise the world will experience by 2100 unless action is taken beyond that already pledged.\nThe researchers measured the results in two ways. First, they counted the number of species that lose more than half their range and this was 49% of insect species at 3.2C, falling to 18% at 2C and 6% at 1.5C. Second, they combined the losses for each species group into a type of average measure.\n\u201cIf you are a typical insect, you would be likely to lose 43% of your range at 3.2C,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe also found that the three major groups of insects responsible for pollination are particularly sensitive to warming.\u201d\nGuy Midgley, at University of Stellenbosch, South Africa and not part of the research team, said the new work built on previous studies but is far more comprehensive. He said major impacts on wildlife would be expected given the potential scale of climate change: \u201cGlobal average surface temperatures in the past two million years have rarely approached the levels projected over the next few decades.\u201d\nWarren said the new work had taken account of the ability of species to migrate, but had not been able to include the impact of lost interactions between species as ranges contract, or of the impacts of more extreme weather events on wildlife. As both of those would increase the losses of range, Warren said the estimates of losses made were likely to be underestimates.\nWarren said that the world\u2019s nations were aware that more action on climate change is needed: \u201cThe question is to what extent greater reductions can be made and on what timescale. That is a decision society has to make.\u201d\nAnother study published in Science on Thursday found that one third of the world\u2019s protected areas, which cover 15% of all land, are now highly degraded by intense human pressure including road building, grazing, and urbanisation.\nKendall Jones, at the University of Queensland, Australia, who led the work, said: \u201cA well-run protected area network is essential in saving species. If we allow our protected area network to be degraded there is a no doubt biodiversity losses will be exacerbated.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/animals", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/biology", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Insects are vital to ecosystems but will lose almost half their habitat under current climate projections", "date_published": {"$date": 1526580036000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1526601301000}, "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Insects", "Climate change", "Conservation", "Wildlife", "Animals", "Environment", "World news", "Biology", "Science"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/17/climate-change-on-track-to-cause-major-insect-wipeout-scientists-warn", "og:description": "Insects are vital to ecosystems but will lose almost half their habitat under current climate projections", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8bbeb093909252894980b481a85f138a1ac242b/0_271_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=9878510c65124de8bb8589fbe240ba64", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Climate change on track to cause major insect wipeout, scientists warn"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8bbeb093909252894980b481a85f138a1ac242b/0_271_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=16eec54698dcccb9ae8d1e72e69e12af", "width": "4256", "height": "2554", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8bbeb093909252894980b481a85f138a1ac242b/0_271_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3634924b5fb9eecdd7fad4ce0f2335d3", "description": "The famous migration of the North American monarch butterfly is one of the most well-documented examples of an insect species affected by climate change.\nPhotograph: Joel Sartore/NG/Getty Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fcbe50e19cebb4b7173f52a9198814154965a98/0_0_3496_2436/master/3496.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b577652b5d2f15b7ff1db97a59bc4ba5", "width": "3496", "height": "2436", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fcbe50e19cebb4b7173f52a9198814154965a98/0_0_3496_2436/master/3496.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d3f75199b59dca4a271f7423a779d757", "description": "A dragonfly lands on a stalk of wheat.

We are no longer in the 14th century, when as much as 76% of the population worked in agriculture \u2013 but farming still employs more than 26% of all workers globally. And that does not include the people who work along the meat supply chain: the slaughterers, packagers, retailers and chefs. \nIn 2016, the world\u2019s meat production was estimated at 317m metric tons, and that is expected to continue to grow. Figures for the value of the global meat industry vary wildly from $90bn to as much as $741bn. \nAlthough the number of people directly employed by farming is currently less than 2% in the UK, the food chain now includes the agribusiness companies, the retailers, and the entertainment sector. According to the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, in 2014 the food and drink manufacturing sector contributed \u00a327bn to the economy, and employed 3.8 million people.\nIt is not simple to separate out the contribution that meat production makes to this \u2013 particularly globally. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation states that livestock is about 40% of the global value of agricultural output and supports the livelihoods and food security of almost a 1.3 billion people.\n\nWhat about its cultural and social importance?\nCooked meat may have been partially responsible for the large brains that characterise Homo sapiens and have put humans where we are now. Cooking made calories from meat (and from vegetables) easier to consume and absorb than in a raw form. \nAnd the domestication of certain animals \u2013 along with the domestication of wild grains and vegetables \u2013 marked the beginning of human agricultural history in the \u201cfertile crescent\u201d. Throughout human history the hunting and farming of meat has been part of our stories and mythologies and some of our legal and religious systems; the fatted calf for the prodigal son; the medieval forest laws that created areas where no one but English royalty could hunt; the sacrifical sheep to mark the beginning of Eid Al-Adha; even the roasted wild boars consumed at the end of every adventure by Asterix and Obelix.\n But is meat still crucial to human life? Some argue that, just because we\u2019ve always eaten meat, that doesn\u2019t mean we always have to. If we can get all the dietary nutrients and protein that we need elsewhere, should we? \nHow has meat production changed?\nThe old-fashioned vision of a mixed farm with wheat and chickens and pigs still exists. More than half of the farms in the US, for example, were small enough in 2012 to have sales of less than $10,000 dollars. But the 20th century saw the application of the principles of the industrial revolution to agriculture - how could inputs be minimised and profits be maximised? \n The result was the factory farm, first for chickens, then pigs, and more recently cattle. Producers discovered that animals could be kept inside, and fed grain, and could be bred to grow more quickly and get fatter in the right places. Since 1925, the average days to market for a US chicken has been reduced from 112 to 48, while its weight has ballooned from a market weight of 2.5 pounds to 6.2. \nPig and cattle farming has followed suit. Sows are held in gestation crates for up to four weeks once they are pregnant, and then put into farrowing crates once they\u2019ve had their piglets to prevent them accidentally crushing their young. Industrially reared pigs spend their lives in indoor pens. Cattle farming is now being similarly streamlined, with cows in the last few months of their lives being fattened in feedlots with no access to grass and sometimes no shelter.\nWhat is the environmental impact of our current farming model?\n It is extremely difficult to separate out the different impacts of different farming models and types. Many measurements look at agricultural impact without making a distinction between arable v livestock, or industrial v small farms. However, the following information begins to indicate the scale of the problem.\n An influential study in 2010 of the water footprints for meat estimated that while vegetables had a footprint of about 322 litres per kg, and fruits drank up 962, meat was far more thirsty: chicken came in at 4,325l/kg, pork at 5,988l/kg, sheep/goat meat at 8,763l/kg, and beef at a stupendous 15,415l/kg. Some non-meat products were also pretty eye-watering: nuts came in at 9,063l/kg. \n To put these figures into context: the planet faces growing water constraints as our freshwater reservoirs and aquifers dry up. On some estimates farming accounts for about 70% of water used in the world today, but a 2013 study found that it uses up to 92% of our freshwater, with nearly one-third of that related to animal products.\n Farms contribute to water pollution in a range of ways: some of those are associated more closely with arable farming, and some with livestock, but it\u2019s worth remembering that one-third of the world\u2019s grain is now fed to animals. The FAO believes that the livestock sector, which is growing and intensifying faster than crop production, has \u201cserious implications\u201d for water quality. \n The types of water pollution include: nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilisers and animal excreta); pesticides; sediment; organic matter (oxygen demanding substances such as plant matter and livestock excreta); pathogens (E coli etc); metals (selenium etc) and emerging pollutants (drug residues, hormones and feed additives). \n The impacts are wide-reaching. Eutrophication is caused by excesses of nutrients and organic matter (animal faeces, leftover feed and crop residues) \u2013 which cause algae and plants to grow excessively and use up all the oxygen in the body of wate at the expense of other species. A review in 2015 identified 415 coastal bodies already suffering these problems. Pesticide pollution can kill weeds and insects away from the agricultural area, with impacts that may be felt all the way up the food chain. And although scientists do not yet have full data on the connection between antibiotic use in animals and rising levels of antibiotic resistance in the human population, water pollution by antibiotics (which continue to have an active life even after going through the animal and into the water) is definitely in the frame. \nLivestock is the world\u2019s largest user of land resources, says the FAO, \u201cwith grazing land and cropland dedicated to the production of feed representing almost 80% of all agricultural land. Feed crops are grown in one-third of total cropland, while the total land area occupied by pasture is equivalent to 26% of the ice-free terrestrial surface\u201d.\nIt\u2019s hard to work out exactly what quantity of greenhouse gases (GHG) is emitted by the meat industry from farm to fork; carbon emissions are not officially counted along entire chains in that way, and so a number of complicated studies and calculations have attempted to fill the gap.\nAccording to the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, agriculture, forestry and other land use accounts for 24% of greenhouse gases. Attempts to pick out the role of animal farming within that have come up with a huge range of numbers, from 6-32%: the difference, according to the Meat Atlas, \u201cdepends on the basis of measurement\u201d. Should it just be livestock, or should it include a whole lot of other factors? Different models of farming have different levels of emissions: this has generated an energetic discussion around extensive versus intensive farming, and regenerative farming \u2013 a model that aims to combine technologies and techniques to regenerate soils and biodiversity levels while also sequestrating carbon. \nWhat about the giant companies that dominate the sector? A 2017 landmark studyfound that the top three meat firms \u2013 JBS, Cargill and Tyson \u2013 emitted more greenhouse gases in 2016 than all of France. \n What next?\n Some argue that veganism is the only sane way forward. A study last year showed, for example, that if all Americans substituted beans for beef, the country would be close to meeting the greenhouse gas goals agreed by Barack Obama. \nBut there are some alternatives. Reducing the amount of meat you eat while improving its quality is advocated by many environmental groups. But where do you find this meat? The organic movement was founded on the pioneering work of Sir Alfred Howard. It is still relatively small - in Europe 5.7% of agricultural land is managed organically - but influential. There are other agricultural models, such as biodynamic farming and permaculture. More recently some innovators have been fusing technology with environmental principles in the form of agroforestry, silvopasture, conservation farming, or regenerative agriculture to create farming methods which all encompass carbon sequestration, high biodiversity and good animal welfare. A recent study showed that managed grazing (a technique which involves moving cows around to graze) is an effective way to sequester carbon.

Wind, rain, ice and snow all contribute to weathering; nibbling away at mountains, sea cliffs, limestone pavements and even solid granite tors.\nFreshly exposed rock surfaces react with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to make bicarbonate ions, which flow down to the ocean (hitching a ride on rivulets of rainwater) and are used by ocean critters to make limestone. This natural process helps to keep the Earth cool by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and locking it up in rocks underground for a few million years.\nSo could we speed up this cooling process by smashing up more rocks? German scientists have been investigating the cooling potential of two types of rock: dunite and basalt. Their results, published in Environmental Research Letters, show that, if done on a large scale (comparable with today\u2019s coal industry), crushed basalt could mop up nearly 10% of mankind\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions every year, while dunite could absorb double that. Basalt could also have the co-benefit of adding nutrients to soil in tropical regions. \nPricewise, the technique would cost about 10 times as much as afforestation and about two to four times as much as carbon capture and storage.\n ", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "German scientists propose using basalt and dunite to soak up carbon from the atmosphere", "date_published": {"$date": 1525206603000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1525208412000}, "authors": ["Kate Ravilious"], "article_section": "Science", "article_tags": ["Geology", "Climate change", "Environment", "Science", "Climate change"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/01/terrawatch-rocks-could-have-a-role-in-combatting-climate-change", "og:description": "German scientists propose using basalt and dunite to soak up carbon from the atmosphere", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e7852a8ec1cdbe692b7e8d7f149fb969b8d0c07/125_520_3445_2067/master/3445.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=3762d4a182a6eb791e73f37776653c3b", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Terrawatch: rocks could have a role in combatting climate change"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e7852a8ec1cdbe692b7e8d7f149fb969b8d0c07/125_520_3445_2067/master/3445.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=43c873de0ebe1bdf1db4b145780b6de6", "width": "3445", "height": "2067", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e7852a8ec1cdbe692b7e8d7f149fb969b8d0c07/125_520_3445_2067/master/3445.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3aef466c60b3d9d46a4b5151b42cc5fc", "description": "Basalt core containing carbonates.\nPhotograph: Sandra O Snaebjornsdottir/Climeworks / Zev Starr-Tambor"}}], "comments": [{"id": "115455642", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1525444984000}, "author": "dave6723", "author_id": "18522661", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "(Ultra)basically, a slippery customer....

Artificially speeding up rock-erosion to solve artificial change to the geological carbon-cycle. \nThe fossil industry lives in this reality of physics: The joy of fossil fuel is based on the same thermodynamics as AGW. Fossil fuel gives off energy when one burn it. But to collect and bind the waste-product (although it can be done) simply does not add up when scaled to the energy produced in the first step (and the price it is sold for). \nThis means that CO2 levels will eventually go back to natural - because of rocks. But it takes the age of human civilisations times thousands to do it properly - after being left alone. \nThere is only one solution to this problem - to scale back our mucking about with the geological carbon cycle - to zero. \nEven if we price energy on the level that carbon can be profitable with CCS (meaning that the profit from making energy from wind and solar will be crazy high and cause fossil to collapse instantly) - the efficiency of CCS is still too low. \nCCS research is still needed, though - for non-fossil applications such as cement-production etc. \nFinally - this is science. It looks into the effect industrial scale crushing of rocks (similar in size to global industrial scale fossil geology) - and ends up with a 10% \"effect\".

Sure the laws of the universe can make your emission problem a bit smaller. \nScience did the same sarcasm with the CCS dream. Sure science can help you design a CCS plant. No problem. But you must pay for it's construction - and you must offset 30% of the coal you buy - and burn it non-profit to give the energy for the CCS-system (if you do not want to invest in a lot of wind-mills or solar farms to provide that energy).Then you must send these numbers over to your economics section and ponder what you can sell \"clean fossils\" for \nNo fossil companies talk about CCS any longer.

Several high-profile figures in the moderate faction of the Liberal party, including the powerbroker Michael Photios and his wife, Kristina, attended the lunchtime gathering of the NSES at Seaforth in March.\nAlso attending were the New South Wales MP for North Shore, Felicity Wilson, and David Begg, a longtime Liberal party member who ran against Abbott for preselection in the 1990s. \nPhotios addressed the meeting and, according to one attendee, put the case that the Liberals were the party that would tackle climate change \u2013 and that they should join. He highlighted his own record of defending the environment when in state parliament. . \n\u201cAt the meeting I soon realised that the NSES was ... seeking to recruit people concerned about the lack of action on climate change to join the Liberal party in order to block the preselection of Tony Abbott to stand in Warringah at the next federal election,\u201d the attendee claimed.\nOne invitation for the Mosman meeting said: \u201cWe have a real opportunity be a force for good in the party, a voice for the environment right here in the electorate of the Monash Forum\u2019s figurehead \u2013 Tony Abbott. Come and learn about how we can shift the politics here in Warringah at our info session this Sunday!\u201d\nPhotios told Guardian Australia he had attended the Seaforth meeting because his wife, a passionate environmentalist, had been asked to speak. She ultimately didn\u2019t speak but Photios did and was the main speaker at the event.\nHe said there was \u201czero involvement\u201d of the Liberal party or the moderate faction in the formation of the NSES.\n Kristina Photios quit the Liberal party in 2016 because she was appalled by its stance on climate change but has since rejoined.\nA year ago, the Photios couple formed a spinoff from Photios\u2019s lobbying firm, Premier State, to represent clean energy companies. The firm, Clean Energy Strategies, describes itself as \u201ca boutique corporate advisory firm specialising in energy\u201d.\nUntil a few years ago Photios held several senior positions in the state executive of the NSW Liberal party and was head of the moderate faction, known as the Group, which has been locked in a long-running power struggle with the right. Abbott is one of the leading members of the right faction.\n As prime minister, Abbott pushed through rule changes in the Liberal party to ban registered lobbyists from holding party positions. \nSeveral members of NSES are also members of the activist group GetUp. A GetUp spokeswoman said the NSES \u201cwas definitely not a GetUp project but the environmental justice team knows of it ... and think they\u2019re great\u201d.\nThe official organiser of NSES, Rob Grant, told Guardian Australia the group was no more than \u201ca group of like-minded people on the north shore who want to see action on climate change, and who believe in driving change from inside the tent\u201d.\nGrant, a businessman who had a company in the renewables sector, is also a member of the Liberal party\u2019s Neutral Bay branch.\nSenior figures in the moderates scoffed at the idea that Abbott was in any danger of losing his northern beaches seat in a preselection. They said he had a firm grip on the numbers and that to take part in a preselection members must have joined at least six months earlier.\nThere is no firm date for federal preselections but they are likely to take place by the end of the year or earlier, if an early election is called.\nBut figures closer to the machinations in Warringah warned the seat could be vulnerable to an attack by Young Liberals, whom they described as marauding across NSW.\nThis is because the geographic rules that require members to join their local federal branch do not apply for members under the age of 30. Young Liberals can therefore vote in preselections outside where they live.\nTony Abbott declined to comment.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/activism", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "description": "Sydneysiders urged to join party in former PM\u2019s seat to \u2018shift the politics\u2019 and speak up for the environment", "date_published": {"$date": 1525284019000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1525322996000}, "authors": ["Anne Davies"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Tony Abbott", "Sydney", "Liberal party", "Climate change", "Environment", "Activism", "Australia news", "Australian politics", "New South Wales", "New South Wales politics", "Energy", "Energy", "GetUp", "Environmental activism", "Coalition"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/03/environmentally-conscious-liberals-urged", "og:description": "Sydneysiders urged to join party in former PM\u2019s seat to \u2018shift the politics\u2019 and speak up for the environment", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b234b3a97367c110400e7bbafd3631f9ceb635b/0_140_1892_1135/master/1892.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=c976084045d2a6eb43f9f31c9f23c035", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Liberal activists target Tony Abbott's seat over climate change policy"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b234b3a97367c110400e7bbafd3631f9ceb635b/0_140_1892_1135/master/1892.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=069a25a707d0d7662d82f49adc64134a", "width": "1892", "height": "1135", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b234b3a97367c110400e7bbafd3631f9ceb635b/0_140_1892_1135/master/1892.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5d96a7b689cb56e7eb808555bea243d8", "description": "Environmentally conscious Sydneysiders are being urged to join the Liberal party in Tony Abbott\u2019s seat.\nPhotograph: Jonny Weeks for the Guardian"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07dbba2c3613145ed8e39"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/04/california-burning-life-among-the-wildfires-climate-change", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "In 2017, the weather in California was the hottest in history. It was hotter than in 2016, which was also the hottest in history. The vineyard owners spoke nervously of how difficult it was to find people willing to pick grapes in this heat. The apple trees dropped all their apples. Over the summer the smoke from hundreds of wildfires burning throughout the state gave me a chronic cough, which turned into walking pneumonia. People began to talk about how illnesses are getting weirder these days. I decided to attend a climate change action meeting I had seen announced in the local newspaper.\nIt was an experimental prototype course founded on the ideas in George Marshall\u2019s book Don\u2019t Even Think About It: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Ignore Climate Change. After spending 15 years studying climate change-denying microcultures, Marshall concluded that facts don\u2019t change people\u2019s minds \u2013 only stories do. We\u2019re so motivated by wanting to belong that we\u2019d rather risk the dangers of climate change than the more immediate symbolic death of estrangement from our peers. In order to address climate change in our communities, Marshall suggests, we must appeal to the same desires that religion does: belonging, consolation and redemption.\nFor this reason, the purpose of the group \u2013 or \u201cfellowship\u201d, as the organisers called it \u2013 was to borrow the most effective tools of religion in order to create a community of people who would work together when it was time to implement policy change, or even take to the streets. Their aim was to galvanise 3.5% of the local population \u2013 the number that social scientists estimate is the tipping point for effecting social change.\nYou had to apply to join the prototype course, so after the informational meeting I wrote the organisers the following email: \u201cI grew up with a dad who would regale us with climate change statistics over the dinner table. If my brother said he was going to a Giants game, my dad would say that he better enjoy it now because there weren\u2019t going to be any Giants games in the future. Hanging on the wall was a colour-coded map he had created, showing what property values would be when ocean levels rose in the Bay Area. He terrorised all my friends by describing how the atmosphere would start to smell like rotten eggs as soon as the oceans warmed and started pluming carbon. In effect, I assumed that by 2020, life on Earth wouldn\u2019t exist anymore. I teach environmental studies, and am looking for ways that I can bring hope to my students but also help motivate them (as well as myself).\u201d\nThe organisers tried many methods for cultivating a feeling of fellowship. They\u2019d start the session by banging a gong, or by reciting a poem by William Stafford, or one about holdfasts \u2013 the dangly part of seaweed that clings to rock \u2013 which we were encouraged to commit to memory in order to steady ourselves when things got rough. They encouraged us to discuss our vulnerabilities. But the most effective method was to scare the crap out of us with mini-lectures about the realities of climate change, which bonded us in common terror.\nWe were presented, at the beginning, with a self-proclaimed \u201chumourless, brain-numbing deep dive into climate science\u201d. They told us it wasn\u2019t supposed to happen this quickly. Climate scientists had predicted that by 2017 we would be at 380 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but we were already past 410ppm. The man who presented this information was, like my father, a local architect. Scrunching up his face he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to depress you, but I want to tell it to you straight.\u201d\nThe most effective glue for bonding, our organisers said, was collaboration: we needed a goal we could all work towards. Our goal was to phase out the internal combustion engine in California by 2030. They gave us questionnaires so we could spend the next week testing the public\u2019s receptivity to this idea. Here are some of the responses we got:\n\u201cWhat happens if the power goes out?\u201d\n\u201cWhere do the cars on the road go? Do we get a free car? What happens to the oil companies? Would you be punished for having a gas car?\u201d\n\u201cDo I have to get rid of my brand-new car? How did we get into this mess? What can we do to ensure our children can understand so they know what is going on by the time they get through high school?\u201d\n\u201cWhy not just get everyone to stop eating meat instead? Agriculture creates as many greenhouse gases as automobiles. Haven\u2019t you seen Cowspiracy?\u201d\n\u201cThere are so many other issues. Why electric cars? We need to change our habits! Our schools should feature human relationships and our relationship to the Earth. The 4 Rs: Reading, \u2019Riting, Rithmetic, Relationships.\u201d\n\u201cCould I go to Nevada to buy a car?\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t solar production toxic?\u201d\n\u201cWhat will I do with my beloved van that carries all my stuff day after day?\u201d\n\u201cWould there be violent, emotional reactions to such a \u2018radical\u2019 move? How do we deal with that reaction?\u201d\n\u201cI like it. Get there!\u201d\n\u201cProud of you, Bill, for being involved. It\u2019s inspiring.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not driving an electric car! I\u2019m allergic to electricity and smart-meter rays!\u201d\n\u201c2030 may be too late to avoid some of the most catastrophic climate &amp; social issues.\u201d\n\u201cWe have such a gas + car culture. Why do we let high-schoolers drive to school? We need to change the consciousness. Only HS kids who work should have a car.\u201d\nI was surprised by the responses. To be honest, I thought people would be more excited about it.\nOur climate change group provided a metastudy about the 97% scientific consensus on climate change. Because scientists never say that something is 100% true, and by nature, are often poor at communicating on an emotional level and tend to resist alarmist scenarios, the climate change deniers have been able to point to that 1-3% of doubt (97% is also the proportion of scientists who support the theory of plate tectonics).\nWe also learned that 61% of Americans say climate change is important to them, but rarely or never discuss it with people they know. Our homework was to become climate change evangelists for a month. To prepare, we discussed how to raise the topic with a stranger: \u201cSure is hot these days\u201d, or \u201cHow often do you take the train? Trying to save on fossil fuels?\u201d or \u201cDo you ever remember it being 97 degrees in October?\u201d\nI decided, as an experiment in humiliation, to discuss climate change everywhere I went. The following are methods I do not recommend:\n1. Bumping into someone\u2019s shopping cart at the supermarket: \u201cOh, sorry, I was just so distracted thinking about climate change.\u201d\n2. After complaining to my boss about the measly salary I make as an adjunct professor: \u201cI apologise for expressing myself in such a heated manner about how impossible it is to live on this salary. I was just really distressed thinking about climate disruption.\u201d\n3. During Hurricane Harvey, I was having dinner with my neighbour, whose car has bumper stickers that say things like \u201cMy other car is a broom\u201d and \u201cNever fear, the Goddess is here!\u201d So it was unsurprising to hear her say: \u201cThis hurricane is Earth Mama expressing her anger at the patriarchy!\u201d\n\u201cActually,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure if the hurricane has anything to do with the Earth getting angry. It might have more to do with greenhouses gases. I\u2019m not saying that climate change is causing the hurricane. It acts more like a hormone, or an adverb, an intensification of the qualities already present. I\u2019m afraid things are only going to get worse.\u201d\n4. I went to my friend\u2019s Blade Runner party, which was filled with fortysomething guys who kept reciting all the lines and knew all the trivia answers. During the pee break, one guy started talking about how we\u2019d all be wearing Google Glass in 10 years.\n\u201cIf the Earth doesn\u2019t burn up,\u201d I added.\n\u201cRight!\u201d someone interjected, and I thought we might be on our way to a useful discussion.\n\u201cThis party just turned into a real downer,\u201d someone else said, so we went back to the movie.\nOh, no, I thought. I\u2019m turning into my dad. Over dinner, he often told stories about how the heartbeat of the ocean might stop, which would affect the wind and freeze parts of the midwest and Europe. For this reason I think of discussing climate change as a relaxing family activity. My father\u2019s second wife, on the other hand, got so tired of hearing about global warming that she considered getting a \u201cStop global dooming\u201d bumper sticker for her car. When my brother announced that his wife was pregnant, my dad told him he wouldn\u2019t need a college fund since there wouldn\u2019t be any college in the future. My brother, who was tenderly grilling ribs, threw down his barbecue fork and said: \u201cFor once I want to talk about life, and not always be focused on the end!\u201d\nAfter that, climate change became a forbidden topic on holidays. Now I was rediscovering what I had understood as a kid: people don\u2019t respond well to threats, to cajoling, to end-of-the-world scenarios, to dystopian futures, to hopelessness.\nBut as I watched the news about Hurricane Harvey, I was astonished that not a single anchor mentioned climate change. Instead they blamed the flooding on Houston\u2019s paved surfaces. According to George Marshall, those who don\u2019t believe in climate change are less likely to believe in it after a climate disaster. Every single member of our group was confounded by this. \u201cThat makes no sense!\u201d we said to one another.\nIf a person believes that weather fluctuates regardless of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, or that catastrophes represent some kind of punishment from God, confirmation bias will lead him to view the latest climate disaster as proof. And after a climate disaster, people feel a heightened sense of community; they don\u2019t want to get into a politicised discussion with the neighbour who just saved their dog. Furthermore, Marshall writes, climate disasters operate according to the same psychological logic people develop when they get struck by lightning. They tend to believe they are statistically immune to it happening again, even as the actual odds remain the same. And if your house floods due to a changing climate, it is more likely it will flood again. If your house burns down, it is more likely it will burn again.\nThe night the fires started in northern California, my boyfriend and I had an argument. Afterward, he took out the garbage. \u201cCome here,\u201d he said when he opened the door. \u201cCheck out how hot it is outside.\u201d A little while later, the wind started to sound like airplane engines. The following morning, my mom and my aunt both told me that they\u2019d thought we were being attacked by North Korea.\nOn the evening of 8 October 2017, severe gusts of dry winds blew across desiccated grasses and diseased trees caused by years of excessive heat and drought. A great flood had fattened grasses into combustible fuel. The wind knocked down power lines, which lit the trees on fire. The firestorm destroyed a thousand homes in a single neighbourhood. Neighbours pounded on neighbours\u2019 doors, honking horns, trying to rescue one another. It took hours to leave town. Most people reported that drivers were calm, though a few resorted to the sidewalk, the median, and the opposite side of the road. One woman managed to stuff her pony in the back seat of her Honda Accord. Another woman had to choose between saving her car or her horse. She jumped on her horse in her pyjamas and rode away from the flames. The fires burned for over a week, killed 44 people, and destroyed more than 10,000 structures and square miles of land. It was the most destructive outbreak of fires in California\u2019s history.\nDuring the fires I took walks, and I tried to read the paper falling from the sky. I wanted to collect the scattered notes, but they disintegrated when I picked them up, leaving the smell of poison on the tips of my fingers. The paper pieces lay curled like chocolate shavings. They were all the size of my palm. I was looking for stories, but I could only find information. Bible pages (sections from Genesis); phone bills; pieces of romance novels (so many of those); perfectly preserved letters so meticulously burned around the edges that they looked the way letters do when you burn them in fourth grade to make them look romantic; gold-embossed stationery with someone\u2019s name written over and over in tiny letters at 45-degree angles; musical scores; Swedish package-tour vacation brochures; pieces of phone books (people still have phone books); a kid\u2019s homework (he did poorly); journal pages (so many pages of people talking to themselves); as well as tar paper and bits of insulation burned until thin as paper.\nI walked and walked and tried not to breathe. Why was the sky directly above me blue, while everywhere else it was gunmetal grey, and flickering with particulate matter? Everyone spoke of particulate matter. In the hardware store all you needed to say was \u201cWhere are they?\u201d and they\u2019d point you to the pile of N95 respirator masks. Someone passed me on the trail. I imagined he was judging me for not wearing a mask, but I couldn\u2019t read his expression because he was wearing one. I looked at the dun, shoulder-high grass. That explosive fuel, the colour of pale grasshoppers, was all that stood between an out-of-control fire and me.\nOutside the grocery store, the usual produce had been moved inside to avoid falling ash. Walking down an aisle, I heard a woman yelling into her phone: \u201cKeep it watered down. Dammit! Keep watering it down!\u201d\nThe news never reported where the active fire was. We only knew that it was completely uncontained, and that all effort was focused on rescuing people, evacuating the hospital, and getting elderly people out of their homes. All we could do was hope the winds wouldn\u2019t change. I walked into the grasses to get away, to get away from the panic on people\u2019s faces.\nThere was no digesting this fire. There was no beginning, middle or end. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Sugarloaf Ridge State Park, which was now decimated. I hadn\u2019t walked on Sugarloaf Ridge in years, but whenever I used the words \u201cpoison oak\u201d or \u201cgallop\u201d or \u201cfog\u201d, my mind flashed femtosecond images of the park. Now it was ash. My old high school had burned down, as well as everything along the roads to get there.\nBefore the fires, I had been teaching a class on ecology. We were learning about systems theory and the interdependency of ecosystems, how trees communicate and send messages and medicines to other parts of the forest, and draw up water to share with other plants.\nWe learned how insects can digest the compounds in eucalyptus and create poop that inhibits the growth of encroaching plants such as mustard. This is probably one reason why the eucalyptus has been so successful as an invasive species here. But in the 1850s, when the government planted eucalyptus throughout California at maniacal speed because its fast-growing wood was essential for railroad ties and fence posts, it turned out that these trees \u2013 unlike old-growth eucalyptus groves in Australia \u2013 twisted when they dried and became so hard that they were no longer suitable for building. And now the volatile oils in their leaves turned out to be extremely combustible. In seasonably dry climates, native oaks are fire-resistant, but with the introduction of eucalyptus we introduced an extreme fire hazard. I stared at the eucalyptus twisting in the heat.\nThe weekend before the fires, I attended a grief workshop sponsored by the climate change group. They told us that grief processed on one\u2019s own turns to despair, but grief processed communally becomes medicine. Our workshop leader suggested that the thing that will save us may be our own broken hearts, for true action can only come through these deeper feelings.\nThe night after the grief workshop I got into an argument with my boyfriend.\n\u201cYou should get out of the Silicon Valley rat race and dedicate yourself to transitioning to a green economy,\u201d I heard myself saying. \u201cYou\u2019re a scientist. You can help develop technologies. This article says we have to treat climate change like we are fighting the second world war. For example, we have to start movements where everyone paints their roofs white to try to dissipate the heat before it reaches a rise of 1C. We have to cut carbon emissions now,\u201d I said. \u201cHere\u2019s an article about what we can do to stay below a one-degree rise. There are solutions. If you were to really internalise that we are the first generation to see the effects of climate change and the last generation to be able to do anything about it, would you change your life?\u201d\nEven while I spoke, I could hear myself sounding like a maniac. I kept reminding myself that people don\u2019t respond well to threats, to cajoling, to end-of-the-world scenarios. But I couldn\u2019t help it. I was in a bad mood because it was so hot outside.\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d my boyfriend finally said, calmly. \u201cBut if it were really that bad, as bad as you say, don\u2019t you think Google would be doing something about it?\u201d\nOn the fourth night of the fires, the humidity plummeted again, and anxiety peaked. A dry wind was expected to blow almost as strongly as on the night the fires started.\nI packed a suitcase full of clothes and looked around my room. Should I pack the vase I bought in Turkey? How about the old Soviet tourist books about Tbilisi? How was it possible to choose between items of sentimental value? Better to leave it all.\n\u201cAt least we have the public pool across the street,\u201d my mom said. We\u2019d heard about the couple who took refuge in their neighbour\u2019s pool while their own house burned. They stayed in the water for six hours, covering their faces with wet shirts whenever they had to come up to breathe. \u201cHow long does it take for a house to burn?\u201d the woman had wondered underwater.\nMy sister-in-law called and said: \u201cRemember how when your brother and I first got married and your dad was always talking about global warming? Turns out he was right!\u201d My dad called: \u201cI\u2019ve been needing Ambien to sleep. I\u2019ll forgo that tonight.\u201d\nThe next day, having survived the night and craving fresh air, I drove to the ocean. I was searching for clean air, but smoke covered the soot-coloured sea all the way to the horizon. I could have felt guilty for driving a car with an internal combustion engine, but guilt goes on hold during fires. I sped on my way home, because the rule of law no longer applies during fires. This is the wildness that descends. This is the triggered reptilian brain. During the fires we craved sugar and fat and ordered pizza and didn\u2019t mention that we usually never order pizza. During the fires my neighbour, the goddess, forgot she was gluten-intolerant. During the fires all I could think of was the word \u201choldfast\u201d.\nWe made a plan. It seemed perfectly reasonable at the time. If the wind blew the fire this way, we would get in our cars and head to the ocean. If the fire kept following us, we would drive into the ocean.\nA student of mine complained that he still had to work at the bank during the fires, since his branch was the only one open in the region. In one day customers deposited $600,000 in cash \u2013 a record \u2013 which they must have been keeping under their mattresses. My student said that all day his nerves were on edge because people kept walking into the bank wearing N95 masks. Later, the firemen told us that the masks don\u2019t actually help much.\nA friend who was evacuated said he grabbed his two dogs and two banjos and hustled into his car. Driving away, he realised he had forgotten to pack any clothes. During fires you hear, over and over, \u201cI lost everything, but at least I have my life.\u201d A couple of people, after losing everything, knocked on the door of a man whose house was for sale. They said: \u201cWe\u2019ve lost everything. Can we buy your house and everything in it?\u201d He left everything he owned to them, including his toaster and bath towels.\nThe songs on the local radio stations were especially upbeat during the fires. They interspersed Tom Petty\u2019s I Won\u2019t Back Down with quotes from locals who had lost their houses. \u201cFires are burning in eight California counties,\u201d the news announcer said, with the Tom Petty beat in the background. A woman\u2019s voice: \u201cI came out to get my dog and looked down the ridge and saw a glow and I looked at the wind and I told my parents that they might want to pack up something just in case, and my mom said that the fire was already at the bottom of the hill \u2026 \u201d\nNo I won\u2019t back down, no I won\u2019t back down / You can stand me up at the gates of hell but I won\u2019t back down \u2026\nAnother woman: \u201cI just want to thank all of you first responders. I love you all from the bottom of my heart. I thank you all for being there. For being away from your families, to help everyone else out there \u2026 \u201d\nHey baby, there ain\u2019t no easy way out / Hey \u2026\n\u201cWe are Sonoma County strong \u2026 \u201d\nI cried when the song came on, though I\u2019d already heard it five times. I cried while driving, and when I saw the banners on every highway overpass: \u201cThanks, first responders.\u201d \u201cThank you, firefighters.\u201d Or the signs in front of the cafes: \u201cFirefighters eat for free.\u201d Even as the fire raged on.\nAll the Mexican restaurants were closed except one. I went in to get a burrito and found it full of evacuees. \u201cSure is busy here,\u201d people kept saying. One man said to the cashier: \u201cIt\u2019ll have to be bulldozed. Totally demolished. How was yours?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re OK.\u201d\nIt was still hot: 35C (95F) in late October. We wondered if winter would ever come again. You can\u2019t get into a pumpkin-carving mood when it\u2019s so hot. On Halloween a few kids came looking for candy, but it seemed like everyone else went to the movies. The parking lot at the theatre was full. I had a dream that I had to evacuate, and the only thing I grabbed was the leftover bag of Halloween candy. I handed out Kit Kats to people as we ran from the fire.\nAfter the fires, on Facebook people posted about the most random item they grabbed when they evacuated.\n\u2013 daughter\u2019s piggy bank with $2.35 in coins in it\n\u2013 Grandmother\u2019s Christmas cactus\n\u2013 a wetsuit\n\u2013 an avocado\n\u2013 the cat-scratcher tree\n\u2013 a Hermione wand\n\u2013 the cookie cutters\n\u2013 tarot cards\n\u2013 all the beer\n\u2013 kids\u2019 pinewood derby trophies\n\u2013 the sewing machine\n\u2013 dog\u2019s ashes\n\u2013 the spice rack\n\u2013 Norton Anthology of English Literature\n\u2013 son\u2019s Darth Vader alarm clock\n\u2013 husband\u2019s Hawaiian shirt collection\n\u2013 jury duty notice for the next day\n\u2013 the cat-litter box and all the cat litter\n\u2013 combat-ready lightsabers\n\u2013 a toothbrush (even though the man who grabbed this one was evacuating to a dentist\u2019s office)\n\u2013 a jar of Miracle Whip (because they were evacuating to a mayo-heavy household)\nThe fires didn\u2019t discriminate between the houses of the rich and the poor. Everyone\u2019s pearls melted, no matter how large. Nor did they discriminate between the houses of the \u201crealists\u201d and the \u201cidealists\u201d. After the fires, the realists wanted to rebuild as fast as possible with the same footprint. The original developers of Santa Rosa\u2019s Coffey Park, which was destroyed by the fires, offered to use updated versions of their old floor plans in rebuilding efforts. Homeowners were upset to learn that they were now required to rebuild in adherence with the California green building standards code. They argued that they shouldn\u2019t have to.\nBefore the fires, the builders who showed up to city council meetings were the same people every time \u2013 they all seemed to be on a first-name basis. But after the fires, something changed. People began presenting ideas to install rain-catchment and grey-water systems, community gardens and bike paths. They wanted to revamp the land-use laws, change the zoning for tiny houses, use fire-resistant straw-bale construction, and concrete and foam. The city council was inundated with people wanting to rebuild with green roofs and walls, to rebuild in a way that would promote bees and carbon-capturing methods, even permaculture methods and composting plants. City officials looked a little frightened as they listened to a large group of people talk about a town in Kansas that rebuilt with renewable energy after getting hit by a tornado. More than 600 people showed up for a breakfast sponsored by Daily Acts, an organisation that builds community by working with neighbourhoods to turn lawns into drought-tolerant gardens. A farmer who had lost his farm and all of his bees spoke at the podium: \u201cWhy can\u2019t Sonoma County always be able to feed its poor?\u201d My neighbours started talking about \u201cagrihoods\u201d, a new trend in which affluent, slow-foodie millennials move to neighbourhoods surrounding a farm, instead of to the golf-course communities of their parents\u2019 generation. My dad even wrote an op-ed about it.\nA longer version of this story appeared under the title An Account of My Hut in the Spring issue of n+1 magazine\n\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/natural-disasters", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The long read: People used to roll their eyes at my gloomy talk of climate change.

This is perhaps not surprising, given the booming online conspiracy culture in the Trumpocene, with even would-be presidential science advisers hanging around with conspiracy theorists.\nThe study also tried to tease out the links between the rejection of human-caused climate change and the ideologies that people hold. \nIt\u2019s here that the study offers the greatest cause for hope, Hornsey says. He has developed a form of \u201cjiujitsu\u201d persuasion technique that he thinks might work.\nThere\u2019s been a general acceptance that people who have broadly conservative or rightwing ideologies tend to rail against climate science because it rubs their worldview up the wrong way. That is, that tackling climate change will require broad interventions from governments.\nBut Hornsey\u2019s study finds that \u201cthere is nothing inherent to conspiratorial ideation or conservative ideologies that predisposes people to reject climate science\u201d.\nInstead, it suggests vested interests have managed to reshape the conservative identity with \u201cignorance-building strategies\u201d in two countries \u2013 the US and Australia.\nHornsey agreed to expand on the study by answering further questions by email. \nYou found that in the US people\u2019s climate \u201cscepticism\u201d was more aligned to a conservative worldview than any other country surveyed. Why do you think the US is in this position?\nI think it\u2019s a result of two things. First, a lot of the big business interests that are threatened by climate change are situated in the US. My overall argument is that there\u2019s nothing inherent to political conservatism that makes people want to reject climate science.\nRather, the link between conservatism and climate scepticism only emerges in countries that are economically threatened by the notion of responding to climate change. When the vested interests are high (in terms of the fossil fuel industry, for example) then there is more of a motivation for big business to engage in an organised campaign of misinformation around climate change. These campaigns often develop as a collaboration between the fossil fuel industry and conservative thinktanks, media and politicians, and are designed to \u201ccoach\u201d conservatives to believe that the climate science is not yet settled. From this perspective, conservatives don\u2019t spontaneously feel the need to reject climate science; they only do so when they are taking their cues from conservative elites, and these cues only emerge when the economic stakes are high.\nSecond, America has an unusually intense brand of conservatism, one that has a particularly strong opposition to government interference in the free market. Climate science is a nightmare for these people, because in some ways it does imply a big-government response designed to regulate industry. \nWhat role do the views of high-profile politicians have in influencing voters to think about the issue in a certain way?\nIn the US people advertise their climate scepticism like they\u2019re advertising their political gang colours\nI think it plays a massive role. In many countries, climate scepticism is not part of the language of the conservative parties. But in Australia and America it is. So in those countries being a climate sceptic starts becoming part of the package of attitudes that you\u2019re supposed to have if you\u2019re a good conservative. The obvious example of this is in the US. Of the 17 candidates who campaigned to be the Republican nominee for the 2016 presidential campaign, the majority were climate change sceptics. So people\u2019s sense of what it means to be a Republican in America has expanded to incorporate something that shouldn\u2019t really be political, like climate science. There, people advertise their climate scepticism like they\u2019re advertising their political gang colours. It\u2019s not quite as bad here, but threatened to become like that during the [Tony] Abbott era.\nWhy do you think this has happened?\nI think it\u2019s all about vested interests. When the vested interests are high, the fossil fuel industry and conservative thinktanks, media and politicians collaborate in an organised campaign of misinformation. In my data, the link between conservatism and scepticism is really only obvious in countries with high per capita carbon emissions. If you think of per capita carbon emissions as a measure of how fossil fuel reliant a country is, then this makes sense. In countries with low fossil fuel reliance \u2013 where the vested interests are low \u2013 then there\u2019s no need to kick off a campaign of misinformation, and no motivation to believe one either.\nIn the paper, you say \u201cthere is nothing inherent to conspiratorial ideation or conservative ideologies that predisposes people to reject climate science\u201d. Can you clarify this? Doesn\u2019t endorsement of small governments and low regulation actually predispose conservatives to engage in motivated reasoning to reject the science of climate change?\nYes, but most conservatives aren\u2019t paying that much attention. I really think conservatives have to be trained and coached to pay attention, and to see the issue through the lens of their worldviews. In the 1980s you didn\u2019t see conservatives get upset about governments shutting down CFCs to protect the ozone layer. Technically the issue was the same \u2013 government regulations curbing the freedom of industry \u2013 but because the vested interests were low there was no need for conservative elites to fight back.\nWhat do you think it would take for the US and Australia to break the apparent link between conservative ideology and climate \u201cscepticism\u201d?\nAs the negative consequences of climate change become more severe and more immediate, I think the ideological element will fade away (although by then it\u2019s likely to be too late, sadly). The other option is to use what I call \u201cjiujitsu\u201d persuasion techniques; to talk about climate mitigation in a way that aligns with people\u2019s underlying ideologies rather than competing with them. There\u2019s already evidence that if you frame climate change mitigation as something that\u2019s sympathetic to free markets, or as a patriotic act designed to maintain energy security, or as a chance to generate green jobs, then conservatives are less likely to resist the science. \n\u2022 You can read Matthew Hornsey\u2019s paper in Nature Climate Change", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/business-australia", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Study across 24 countries suggests the fossil fuel industry has reshaped conservative political values in the US and Australia", "date_published": {"$date": 1525705252000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1525708616000}, "authors": ["Graham Readfearn"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change scepticism", "Environment", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Science", "Australian politics", "US politics", "Australia news", "Business (Australia)", "Fossil fuels", "Greenhouse gas emissions"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2018/may/08/its-all-about-vested-interests-untangling-conspiracy-conservatism-and-climate-scepticism", "og:description": "Study across 24 countries suggests the fossil fuel industry has reshaped conservative political values in the US and Australia", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4f754d8e408de08f9515ca84b5b61981456716f/0_180_5411_3246/master/5411.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=068c13f9e26b88e4fda13e0234ed8fe2", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "'It's all about vested interests': untangling conspiracy, conservatism and climate scepticism | Graham Readfearn"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4f754d8e408de08f9515ca84b5b61981456716f/0_180_5411_3246/master/5411.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1cde48c73ebf5d31a948fcb11408e439", "width": "5411", "height": "3246", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4f754d8e408de08f9515ca84b5b61981456716f/0_180_5411_3246/master/5411.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=19e92cb130f17ff0923db9cb703fc980", "description": "A protest against the US government\u2019s decision to exit the Paris climate deal in 2017. \u2018Ignorance-building strategies\u2019 by fossil fuel companies have bred climate change scepticism among conservative in the US and Australia.\nPhotograph: Anthony Anex/EPA"}}], "comments": [{"id": "115597995", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1525852872000}, "author": "loco_p_man", "author_id": "13126382", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nbut who includes that in climate change science?\nBQEND\nDid you bother to look for the answer to this question ?

Also the potential for forest soils to release carbon when warmed is becoming apparent. Also it is now being shown that the most accurate models are the ones that predict the most warming.

Many will be replaced with gas turbines and wind. Gas plants have a short life expectancy- just 20 years - so as a project that will take decades the challenge is achievable.\nThe UK has demonstrated that wind can generate 30% of electricity needs in just a couple of decades and this will be boosted to 50% by 2030 or so. Wind turbines and solar are made in factories and are erected and functioning in weeks.\nIt will be a process that will last years- perhaps to 2100 for last bit.hydro in the US is extremely important- and removal of dams is not going to be helpful- however many can be converted to pumped storage.\nThe first 805 is the easy bit- the last 20% in 2050 and beyond will be the tricky bit.\nthe US biggest issue is investing and upgrading the grid- it should have been done decades ago- but there has not been the political will.\nTransport is the next big issue, but the speed of EV development is stunning. Battery prices fallng from over $1000 kwh to $200 in just a few years, and on course to be $100 kWh in 5 years. Range has increased as battery density has improved- the luxury SUV market - Jaguar, Tesla, Merc, Porche all offer or will offer 300 mile super fast charging.The prediction is most cars will be EV by 2030. The impact will be severe on oil producers- with choice in fuel oil cannot compete on price unless it is very cheap oil as produced in some of the Gulf. Peak oil has always depended on price of economic extraction- if transport switches then demand declines and only $30 oil can be economically extracted.\nBuses, trucks, even farm tractors and construction equipment can be run on batteries- China has 1000s of buses that are cheaper than their diesel versions.\nRail is already electrified in many countries.\nThe last tricky bit is long distance HGV [with overhead lines being tested in Germany with batteries], hydrogen fuel etc- air transport and shipping. So again the 80% first part is not impossible and in current economic climate will happen because it fits the economics.\nHeating a problem in the UK too- most is gas but this is not something that has been around for that long- many home in the UK were powered with coal only a few decades ago. Gas boilers again needs replacing every 25 years - commercial properties use heat pumps so the switch is possible, as is bio gas or wind or solar gas.\nwhether AGW was urgent or not the oil age has only a few decades at current consumption levels- it could be even shorter if US shale oil is not maintained at current 5 million barrels day. Technologically the transition is happening- wind is mass produced and unsubsidiesed in parts of the world as is solar- and we seem to be pursuing battery technology as a current fix- lithium ion battery production is undergoing a massive expansion- 600% growth in production and new factories over a 5 year period.\n'climate extremists ' are seeking urgent action- and that start is urgent- but no one expects it to take years but decades.", "recommendation_count": "3", "in_reply_to": "115630762", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "it fits the economics", "effect": "in current economic climate will happen"}]}, {"id": "115630762", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1525917449000}, "author": "kent31", "author_id": "15456519", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nHow do you suggest we proceed?\nBQEND\nSimple....start first by reading this....\nhttp://www.rff.org/blog/2018/decarbonization-it-ain-t-easy\nInstead of alarmists touting supremely unrealistic policies, it's time for realistic conversations about how to create energy/decarbonisation policies that are reasonable, fair, economically and logistically possible.

It falls into the broad class of relevance fallacies.\nSlowly- some green ngos/charities/ membership organisations use emotional language- and as political entities [i.e. looking to create change] they also mirror political debate- i.e. drugs policy, where one side may argue [using scientific studies ] to decriminalise drug use and the other side will use emotive language such as 'ruining lives' - 'drug gangs and crime' as a counter argument. Likewise the American right demonise the welfare state and multicuturalism- these are political arguments because even though you may disagree with the policy they come with their own logic.\nGreenpeace policy is available to read- it says that nuclear is dangerous and expensive- they are emotive but also true to a degree. Nuclear waste is highly toxic and accident have happened, and nuclear is proving to be more expensive than other forms of power generation. The waste is a long term legacy- which is true.To deny this is to deny the basic science of nuclear power.\nAnd as a membership organisation people [members] have the right to hold its opinions.

In recent years, how has economic output around the world been affected by changes in temperature and precipitation?\n2. What do these historical responses imply about the potential future impacts of climate change?\nTo answer question 1, we analyzed changes in temperature and changes in economic output (as measured by per capita gross domestic product) for 166 countries for the years 1960-2010. To answer question 2, we combined these historical estimates with projections of future climate change from global climate models, and projections of how countries\u2019 economies might develop absent climate change\nOur findings demonstrate that changes in temperature have substantially shaped economic growth in both rich and poor countries over the last half century, and that future warming is likely to reduce global economic output, relative to a world without climate change.\nTo further explore our country specific projections, or to see how we developed the historical relationship between temperature and economic growth, click on the links below.\nBQEND\n1.

Please could you use your investigative journalism skills to investigate and double check one of the most important aspects of the case for CAGW? It would be more valuable than investigating and promoting conspiracy theories. \nHere it is: One of the strongest pieces of evidence for CAGW is that current temperatures and rates of increase are unprecedented in many centuries. How do scientists conclude this when reliable instrumental thermometers provide data back to only about 1880? They use proxy data. But, most proxy data (and certaintly those most relied upon) do not align with instrumental data in recent decades (since about 1980) - the very period when warming is argued to be at its strongest. It's called the Divergence Problem. It is well known amongst climate scientists. However, they dismiss it as unimportant without providing any scientific evidence of why its not important. They don't know beyond speculating: 'we think its to do with modern air pollution'. It's so simple to understand, it even has a Wikipedia entry. \"It is the disagreement between the temperatures measured by the thermometers (instrumental temperatures) and the temperatures reconstructed from the latewood densities or, in some cases, widths of tree rings in the far northern forests....The deviation of some tree ring proxy measurements from the instrumental record since the 1950s raises the question of the reliability of tree ring proxies in the period before the instrumental temperature record.\"\"Some\" records? Michael Mann et al stated in a comprehensive proxy study: \nBQSTART\nthe observed warming rises above the error bounds of the estimates during the 1980s decade, consistent with the known \u2018\u2018divergence problem\u2019\u2019, wherein the temperature sensitivity of some temperature-sensitive tree-ring data appears to have declined in the most recent decades. Interestingly, although the elimination of all tree-ring data from the proxy dataset yields a substantially smaller divergence bias, it does not eliminate the problem altogether\nBQEND\nAnd why is it so important? As\nD'Arrigo et al state:\n\nBQSTART\nreconstructions based on northern tree-ring data impacted by divergence cannot be used to directly compare past natural warm periods (notably, the MWP) with recent 20th century warming, making it more difficult to state unequivocally that the recent warming is unprecedented.\nBQEND\nSo, Graham Redferan, please investigate this, if only to reassure yourself the Divergence problem does not undermine the case for CAGW.\nUnderstanding this will give you a much better insight into the reasons for CAGW scepticsm than juvenile conspiracy theories or psychological studies on 'why do you not agree with me?'.", "recommendation_count": "4", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "115599078", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1525855103000}, "author": "dave6723", "author_id": "18522661", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Nah.

But its production relies on processes that have changed little since the 1880s when the first smelting processes were pioneered.\nOn Thursday the Canadian government and two of the world\u2019s biggest aluminium producers, Alcoa and Rio Tinto, hailed a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d technology that they said would remove carbon dioxide from the smelting process. Executives from the companies said it was \u201cthe most significant development in aluminium in a century\u201d.\nThe companies said the change would reduce carbon dioxide production by 6.5bn tonnes a year in Canada alone, where it is first being rolled out. That is equivalent to taking about 1.8m vehicles off the road. The technology would also reduce operating costs by about 15%, the executives said.\nCarole Ferguson, the head of investor research at the Carbon Disclosure Project, which rates businesses and sectors on their performance in reducing carbon, said: \u201cThis is very important. It is fantastic to have this technology that reduces carbon and eliminates it from the [smelting process].\u201d \nHowever, she said aluminium production would still require large quantities of energy, and emissions from the production process were only a part of its overall carbon footprint. \nSmelting aluminium conventionally requires anodes made of carbon-rich material as carbon is a good conductor of electricity as well as being cheap and plentiful. They are used to release the metal from aluminium oxide. During the process the carbon anodes are destroyed, releasing carbon dioxide gas.\nAlcoa and Rio Tinto\u2019s new process involves the use of a proprietary material they invented and developed over a decade that can be used in place of carbon. When used in smelting, it releases oxygen instead.\nThe new process will not reduce the need for vast quantities of energy in the smelting process, but if it comes from renewable sources it will in effect mean the aluminium produced is carbon-free.\nAluminium production accounts for about 0.8% of global greenhouse gas emissions and demand is rising. But it is also a material at the core of plans to reduce emissions. For instance, aluminium cars are lighter than vehicles made from steel, requiring less fuel. Aluminium is also easy to recycle, giving it the potential to be a \u201cgreen\u201d resource.\nAlcoa and Rio Tinto have formed a joint venture, Elysis, to exploit the new smelting material, which they said had been proven to work at industrial scale in plants. Investors in the $144m (\u00a3106m) project include the Canadian and Quebec governments, and Apple, which helped broker the deal between the rival aluminium companies and which intends to use the resulting product in its hardware.\nProducts using the new technology are not expected to become commercially available until about 2024. \nWhile most of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions come from energy production for electricity, transport, and heating and cooling, a sizeable chunk also comes from industrial processes, such as the production of plastics, petrochemicals and cement. But methods of reducing emissions from industrial processes have proved difficult to develop.\nResearchers working on cement production, which emits carbon dioxide as calcium carbonate is broken down, have explored using graphene and other materials to reduce emissions.\n", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/steel-industry", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbonfootprints", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ethical-living", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Development could transform how one of the world\u2019s most common materials is made", "date_published": {"$date": 1525977019000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1525986039000}, "authors": ["Fiona Harvey"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Environment", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Science", "Technology", "Steel industry", "Canada", "World news", "Carbon footprints", "Ethical and green living"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/10/new-technology-slash-aluminium-production-carbon-emissions", "og:description": "Development could transform how one of the world\u2019s most common materials is made", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c27a5ec9b711410bb8b253e8d90056139302cc6c/0_34_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=bbeab1014e1d584eea9fcb16c7ce02ff", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "New technology could slash carbon emissions from aluminium production"}, "headline": "N", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c27a5ec9b711410bb8b253e8d90056139302cc6c/0_34_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b564a0b12ddf017152b6c937ef44ecf5", "width": "4000", "height": "2400", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c27a5ec9b711410bb8b253e8d90056139302cc6c/0_34_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5a0ba21ac7557641b0598e81cfa6d4eb", "description": "A worker at a conventional aluminium smelting facility in Fort William in the UK.\nPhotograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07deca2c3613145ed8e4a"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/14/my-partner-convinced-me-of-the-facts-readers-on-changing-their-opinion-on-climate-change", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "I first thought it was fake as I used to watch Fox News with my family. In 2015 I met my partner Stephen who knew that the facts of climate change couldn\u2019t be ignored. He took it upon himself to try to convince me. We started watching documentaries on the subject on Netflix. The first documentary that caught my attention was Cowspiracy directed by Kip Andersen and Keegan Kuhn. This documentary really hit home and I even wrote an essay on it. Then came What the Health by the same directors. After we watched the movie Stephen and I turned to an all plant-based diet. We have our ups and downs on staying true to our new lifestyle change, but we always keep in mind that for every burger we don\u2019t eat that is 660 gallons of water that we are saving for others in need. I was lucky enough that Stephen took the time and saw that if I could see the issues I would see that the facts are true.\nAs a graduate student in the early 2000s, I did not really have an opinion on the matter but the debate raised my curiosity. So when some of the prominent sceptical websites made claims about some scientific papers, I searched for the papers online and checked for myself. It soon became quite obvious that the sceptic claims made no sense whatsoever. So I became politically active and I\u2019ve now been active in the Finnish Green party for 10 years. \nClimate change seemed like a questionable thing to me at first and now it\u2019s not. What made me change my mind is several news articles and blogs that I\u2019ve read up on the internet as well as visits to museums and exhibitions. It was informative and introduced aspects such as rising temperatures, rising seas, extreme weather events and risks that we as a community face. I believe it will help people understand how serious the situation is and I would like to encourage the community to visit museums and learn about climate change. Given everything I have been told, my belief in climate change has gone from weak to very strong even if I still have many questions. After learning about how bad this can really get, it not only changed whether or not I believed in it, but also made me worry more and more. I now understand that I must try to do things that benefit the environment but at the same time I must also understand that I can\u2019t save the world.\nI was a teenager when President Ronald Reagan reassured us that global warming was all part of a natural, cyclical process - not dangerous and not caused by humans. Being a young, naive Republican, I believed him. When Al Gore\u2019s documentary An inconvenient Truth came out in theatres, I would never have considered going to see it if I hadn\u2019t become angry about Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq and cynical about the Republicans\u2019 lip service to Christian values. The movie was an eye-opener to say the least. Now I am a Green Party member, try to live a zero waste life, I\u2019m nearly vegan and read up on climate change issues in the news on a regular basis. I agree 100% with Pope Francis\u2019 encyclical on the environment that fighting climate change is a moral imperative for social justice and that it is a grave sin to be tyrants rather than stewards of the earth. \nI believe that the climate is changing, but I now think that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s view on the importance of CO2 is significantly overstated. I assumed that mainstream science was right and agree that burning fossil fuels is generally harmful and should be reduced if possible. However, after researching more about the factors effecting our climate I am of the opinion that other factors are more important than the IPCC stated factors. The sun and solar magnetic flux, plus the ocean currents are much more significant than stated by some scientist and the press. I also see significant data manipulation and misinformation (from both sides) so finding good independent sources of information is hard. I check published \u2018hard data\u2019 against obvious proxy data to see if it agrees, and too often it doesn\u2019t. I think climate science has become political (understandable given the consequences) which means normal scientific debate is not happening as it should. \nI used to think climate change was a serious problem but now I think it has been overblown. As a research physicist I looked at research first hand and came to the conclusion that the modelling of climate is not particularly good. Catastrophic predictions are silly. Global warming is real but not as serious as portrayed in the press. The probable total effect on the climate due to people is nothing to worry about compared to other, far more urgent ecological or environmental concerns, such as land management, ocean management, invasive species etc. Also, regardless of the actual reality of catastrophic global warming the actual actions taken have been ridiculous, futile, expensive and have had no impact on CO2 production in any meaningful way. If predictions made in the 90s had been true, the only solution was to use the already developed, reliable, cheap nuclear power and to get India, China and African countries using it. Instead people are burning fuel.

The Asia-Pacific was the region \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d to the security and humanitarian impacts of climate change, the committee heard, and faced an \u201cexistential threat\u201d.\nAn existential threat was defined as \u201cone that threatens the premature extinction of Earth-originating intelligent life or the permanent and drastic destruction of its potential for desirable future development\u201d.\nSign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon\nThe committee report said climate change threatened Australians\u2019 health, and the viability of communities, businesses and the economy. Climate change was heightening the severity of natural hazards, increasing the spread of infectious diseases and increasing water insecurity, and threatening agriculture.\nSherri Goodman, a former US deputy undersecretary of defence in the Clinton administration and founder of the CNA Military Advisory Board, told the committee climate change was a \u201cthreat multiplier\u201d, exacerbating existing conflicts over water and other resources, and that it posed \u201ca direct threat to the national security of Australia\u201d.\n\u201cThe problem also is not a distant one in the future but it\u2019s now. We are experiencing this in regular sunny-day flooding at military bases in the United States and in changes in the Arctic, forcing the first wave of displaced persons from villages in the Arctic.\u201d\nThe Climate Council told the committee climate change was \u201calready contributing to increases in the forced migration of people within and between nations, as well as playing a role in heightening social and political tensions, flowing onto conflict and violence\u201d.\nThe Australian government has recognised the security implications posed by climate change. Its seventh national communication on climate change to the United Nations in December highlighted that Australia was \u201calready experiencing the impacts of a changing climate, particularly changes associated with increases in temperature, the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events, extreme fire weather and drought\u201d.\nIt noted \u201ccommunities in the Torres Strait are already being impacted by rising sea levels and many of the region\u2019s coral reefs have been severely impacted by increased sea surface temperatures\u201d.\nAnd the Department of Defence agreed climate change had the potential to worsen existing conflicts.\n\u201cWhen climate impacts are combined with ethnic or other social grievances, they can contribute to increased migration, internal instability or intrastate insurgencies, often over greater competition for natural resources. These developments may foster terrorism or cross-border conflict.\u201d\nThe Senate committee heard that acute climate disruption \u2013 in particular long-running and severe droughts \u2013 exacerbated conflicts in Mali and Syria, contributing to the destabilisation of fragile states.\nIn Australia\u2019s region, the Australian Council for International Development said: \u201cFor Pacific nations such as Tuvalu, Kiribati and Micronesia, climate change is already a genuine existential threat with the capacity to diminish their livelihoods and even erase their states\u2019 territorial footprints.\u201d\nThe Senate committee noted Australia does not have an overarching climate security strategy. \nResearch Director for Breakthrough National Centre for Climate Restoration David Spratt said there was a disconnect between the evidence presented to the inquiry and the recommendations that emerged from it.\n\u201cExistential risk management requires brutally honest articulation of the risks, opportunities and the response time frame. At the moment we are knowingly locking in an existential disaster without being prepared to articulate that fact \u2026 at least this Senate inquiry report is significant for having broken the ice, but it should be so much more.\u201d\nGreens Senator Peter Whish-Wilson said the defence personnel who appeared before the committee \u201cengaged deeply with climate change science and were in no doubt that a warming world is a more dangerous world\u201d.\n\u201cWhat this inquiry has brought home to me is that when people choose to engage with the climate science, without any partisan or ideological blinkers, they quickly understand the seriousness of the challenge and decide to act. We have seen that the Australian Defence Force is changing how it does things because it is taking climate change seriously, but we have a government that is doing nothing to reduce emissions to actually reduce the threat of climate change itself.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-military", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/asia-pacific", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Threat is not a possible future one but one endangering Australia now, parliament told", "date_published": {"$date": 1526580036000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1526591950000}, "authors": ["Ben Doherty"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Australian politics", "Australia news", "Australian defence force", "Environment", "Asia Pacific"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/18/climate-change-an-existential-security-risk-to-australia-senate-inquiry-says", "og:description": "Threat is not a possible future one but one endangering Australia now, parliament told", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d55fb5cfa32bb9a4a99dce773b1d66cb0cdfd850/0_0_3333_2000/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=a57ff5808adeffd062d6ec6a3909eec0", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Climate change an 'existential security risk' to Australia, Senate inquiry says"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca3cdb323ba0ffd5ba7cf4f24d758fa1e3e4a90d/0_129_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=77fd9ee99d2f4d479c689f5a5df661e0", "width": "2000", "height": "1200", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca3cdb323ba0ffd5ba7cf4f24d758fa1e3e4a90d/0_129_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=efa4acde5616a2cda9d8f8562d6df222", "description": "The Senate report says climate change threatens Australians\u2019 health, businesses and the economy.\nPhotograph: The Washington Post/Washington Post/Getty Images"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556126283463}, "comments": [{"id": "116027570", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1526830215000}, "author": "Vlamingo", "author_id": "15902664", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nThe most common and significant GHG is actually water vapour NOT Co2\nBQEND\nYou are correct that water vapour is the dominant GHG, but without CO2, the Earth would not be warm enough to have a water vapour greenhouse effect in the first place.\nWater vapour cannot drive climate change, because any excess water vapour simply precipitates and quickly falls back to Earth.

We run a nursery to grow plants endemic to the catchment which we supply to members involved up and down the creeks. We were also auspicing three other groups involved in organic vegetables and indigenous food plants. \nIn the lead up to the 2015 Queensland state election in which Premier Newman lost his seat and government, we had an interesting experience with a local men's shed group. They had already shared space with another group in the electorate but were keen to move elsewhere.\nOur nursery adjoined and shared expertise with a Greening Australia nursery, the operators of which were told with days to spare that their operation was winding up. Their parent organisation removed almost all their stock within days. We took what we could salvage from the skip and organised ameeting of Brisbane revegetation groups at short notice. \nAlmost immediately our local LNP councillor told us the men's shed group would be moving in. They came and had a look and told us they'd be taking over.\nAt the meeting we decided to support the very skilled staff in continuing the native nursery which dealt with plants beyond our catchment selling them to the public. We told the council we couldn't operate without that valuable synergy. The councillor was not happy at the time.\nThe groups we auspiced at the other location said they were happy to share with the men's shed group and the council realised they had a location for the men's shed group to build their shed, already paid for by the Newman government, at that site.\nWe auspiced the new nursery while our other auspiced groups became independent. Within a year that nursery was up and running and paying its permanent staff. The men's shed group built their shed and, except for one unfortunate incident where their president told an indigenous woman to move on, have more or less fitted in. That president has pulled out for health reasons and their operation seems to be running more smoothly.\nA few months after that meeting to organise to keep the native plant nursery running as a worker run enterprise, my daughter defeated Newman at the state election.

Is there anything we can do other than despair? Insects will need stepping stones to move around the country as the climate changes. Here are some ways you can help.\nIf you have a garden, make it part of the solution. Insects need food and we have destroyed 97% of our wildlflower meadows. The charity Buglife has a great guide that shows which plants help which insects: winter flowers such as hellebore, erica and mahonia for pollinators such as bees; evergreen shrubs and climbers for bugs such as woodlice and spiders.\nInsects need water \u2013 make sure you have some in your garden. Watching bees drink at the bird bath is fun; better still is watching dragonflies emerge from your wildlife pond.\nLook beyond your own patch and lobby your council to turn verges into highways for insects. Plants help insects, which help mammals, bats, amphibians, reptiles and birds to thrive. We need to fix the system, not just an isolated\u00a0component.\nB-Lines, a series of insect pathways running through the countryside, are the best way to help on a national scale. You can help by writing to your MP and asking them to support Ben Bradley\u2019s Protection for Pollinators bill.

Stop building so many roads - habitat fragmentation is a death knell for wildlife, you can actually calculate pretty accurately how much each habitat 'downsizing' - for example if you drive a motorwa or bypass through the middle of half the woodland you don't just create a minor barrier you create two sperate woodlands exactly half the size of the previous one - you then get a pretty linear decline in species numbers and total biomass.\n3. Shift to public transport - car usage (as well as needing more roads) increases nitrogen content near roads which causes homogenisation of plants (cow parlsely, nettles and brambles do well - other things such as poppies and other flowers that have evolved to do well in low nitrogen soils do worse) and this has a knock on effect on the diversity of species that can be supported.\n4. More joined up planning - the ever increasing trend for these estates of 3/4/5 bedroom houses outside towns that have no amenities and no bus access is driving the eating up of habitat.\n5. Stop paving over gardens (which I appreciate you might not have done!) but it's a real scourge!\n6. Support (and government needs to fund) programmes to reduce invasive species, for insects things like rhododendron might seem good but they are hugely invasive and drive out pretty much all other plants (which leads to a reduction in insect biodveirsty)\n7.

But in the long run, history\u2019s direction is clear cut,\u201d he writes. \u201cIn recent generations the few remaining civilisations have been blending into a single global civilisation.\u201d\nThe new book, 21 lessons for the 21st Century, is published in August and comes amid a period of unprecedented introspection in British politics over how to leave the European Union. Yet Harari argues the coming challenges of global warming, technological disruption and nuclear proliferation will make us \u201cever more interdependent\u201d and in need of cooperative projects such as the EU.\n\u201cIn a different century and different situation, I don\u2019t think there is anything necessarily wrong about Brexit,\u201d he added in an interview. \u201cIf you want to be a completely independent country and not part of a bigger organisation, then fine. The problem is that given the kind of challenges we face today, the opportunity costs of being very self absorbed are becoming higher and higher all the time.\u201d\nThe thesis may infuriate Brexit supporters who regard it as a way for Britain to look out to the world more, but Harari also has words of criticism for liberals who regard the EU referendum as a catastrophe.\n\u201cLike a person imagining that a bad headache signifies a terminal brain tumour, many liberals fear that Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump portend the end of human civilisation,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe first step is to tone down the prophecies of gloom and switch from panic mode to bewilderment \u2026 more humble, and therefore more clear-sighted.\u201d\nHe also claims it is not inevitable that humanity will learn to collaborate more, warning of a possible \u201cunravelling\u201d of the EU in the wake of Brexit \u2013 with worrying implications.\n\u201cIf the European project fails \u2026 it would indicate that belief in the liberal values of freedom and tolerance is not enough to resolve the cultural conflicts of the world,\u201d writes Harari. \u201cIf Greeks and Germans cannot agree on a common destiny, and if 500 million affluent Europeans cannot absorb a few million impoverished refugees, what chances do humans have of overcoming the far deeper conflicts that beset our global civilisation?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s say the rise of artificial intelligence completely disrupts the global job market, this will create far far bigger social and economic challenges than the immigration of a few million people to the EU or some workers from Poland and Romania to the UK,\u201d he added.\nHarari, who lectures at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, was also critical of Israeli nationalism in the wake of the killing of Palestinian protesters last week.\n\u201cIf every nation thinks about itself, then who is thinking about the global problems?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see Israel making any significant contribution to confronting the main challenges of humankind.\u201d\nBut the book singles out the EU as a model for how national interests can be balanced and what is at stake if it fails.\n\u201cAfter centuries of terrible bloodshed, French, Germans, Italians and Britons have finally built a mechanism that ensures continental harmony \u2013 only to have the British public throw a spanner into the miracle machine,\u201d writes Harari.\n\u201cWe have a global ecology, a global economy and a global science \u2013 but we are still stuck with only national politics,\u201d he adds. \u201cTo have effective politics we must either deglobalise the ecology, the economy or the march of science \u2013 or we must globalise our politics.\u201d",

"topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Last summer, the United states was pummeled with three severe hurricanes in rapid succession. It was a truly awesome display of the power of weather and the country is still reeling from the effects. In the climate community, there has been years of research into the effect that human-caused global warming has on these storms \u2013 both their frequency and their power. \nThe prevailing view is that in a warming world, there will likely be fewer such storms, but the storms that form will be more severe. Some research, however, concludes that there will be both more storms and more severe ones. More generally, because there is more heat, there is more activity, which can be manifested in several ways.\nRegardless, there is very little doubt that a warmer planet can create more powerful storms. The reason is that hurricanes feed off of warmer ocean water. In order to form these storms, oceans have to be above about 26\u00b0C (about 80\u00b0F). With waters that hot, and with strong winds, there is a rapid evaporation of moisture from the ocean. The resulting water vapor enters into the storm, providing the energy to power the storm as the water vapor condenses and falls out of the storm as rain.\nAs a large hurricane passes over warm water, it sucks in heat not only from the top layer of water but also from quite deep in the ocean, at least 160 meters (approximately 525 feet) or more. The main way heat is pulled out of the ocean is through the aforementioned evaporation process. There are also smaller effects from mixing the ocean waters and blocking sunlight to the ocean. Basically, when a hurricane passes over warm waters, the ocean \u201csweats\u201d and cools off \u2013 a process enabled by the strong winds. The image below shows this evaporation and condensation process.\nA very recent publication in the journal Earth\u2019s Future studied the impact of hurricanes on warm oceans in order to understand how warm waters fuel the storms and also how storms affect the water temperatures. With Hurricane Harvey, a near perfect natural laboratory was available in the Gulf of Mexico. Temperature measurements are plentiful there and the scientists were able to measure the total ocean heat content in the upper 160 meters just before Hurricane Harvey passed and compare the heat measured after the storm. \nWhat they found was very interesting. As seen in the image below, before the storm (top frame), the ocean heat content was very high (red colors). After the hurricane passed (bottom frame), the waters were notably cooler. \nThe scientists calculated that the waters lost approximately 6 x 1020 Joules of heat because of Harvey. That\u2019s about 10 million times as much energy as the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Then the scientists used rainfall data and calculated how much heat fell in the form of rain. The results were a nearly perfect match with the energy taken up by the storm. That is, they were able to balance the energy and water flows into and out of the storm to a very high level of accuracy.\nWith the passage of the hurricane and the \u201ccold wake,\u201d it made the scientists consider how future storms would be impacted. That is, any storms following Harvey would pass over a cooler ocean and should not be as intense as Harvey was. \nThe researchers discovered that the so-called \u201ccold wake\u201d was still hot enough to fuel future storms. The surface temperatures were reduced by about 2\u00b0C (3\u00b0F), but remained above the threshold needed to fuel hurricanes. The reason why the waters remained hot was that the temperatures before Harvey were off-the-charts hot because of human warming. Just before Harvey, ocean waters both globally and in the Gulf of Mexico were at record temperatures.\nSo, what does this all mean? First of all, the balancing of energy flow into and out of a hurricane is a tremendous accomplishment and it validates much of what is understood about these storms. Secondly, this study shows that storms can become more violent in a warming world. Not only that, but there is the potential of getting very active seasons, as occurred in 2017.

In fact, Harvey became the sixth event to bring rainfall at a return period of at least 1,000 years since 2010 alone.... Another important point is that rainfall return periods do not automatically translate to an equally sized flood return period\"\nAlthough sea level rise is on the order of 3.3mm/yr, pointing this out is like thinking a second after you've fallen out of a twentieth floor window \"Hey, I'm only falling at about 20 miles per hour - no problem\" - ignoring the physical process called acceleration.Increasing rates of ice mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets revealed by GRACE; I. Velicogna; GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 36, L19503, 2009; doi:10.1029/2009GL040222\"The best fitting estimate for the acceleration in ice sheet mass loss for the observed period is \u000230 \u00b1 11 Gt/yr2 for Greenland and \u000226 \u00b1 14 Gt/yr2 for Antarctica. This corresponds to 0.09 \u00b1 0.03 mm/yr2 of sea level rise from Greenland and 0.08 \u00b1 0.04 mm/yr2 from Antarctica.\"\"To verify that the improvement obtained with the quadratic model is significant we used an F-test [e.g., Berry and Feldman, 1985]. The F-test show that the improvement obtained with the quadratic fit is statistical significant at a very high confidence level.\"\"We showed that a detailed analysis of the GRACE time series over the time period 2002\u20132009 unambiguously reveals an increase in mass loss from both ice sheets. The combined contribution of Greenland and Antarctica to global sea level rise is accelerating at a rate of 56 \u00b1 17 Gt/yr2 during April 2002\u2013February 2009, which corresponds to an equivalent acceleration in sea level rise of 0.17 \u00b1 0.05 mm/yr2 during this time. This large acceleration explains a large share of the different GRACE estimates of ice sheet mass loss published in recent years. It also illustrates that the two ice sheets play an important role in the total contribution to sea level at present, and that contribution is continuously and rapidly growing.\"\nDynamic thinning of glaciers on the Southern Antarctic Peninsula; B.

The widespread, simultaneous nature of the acceleration, in the absence of a persistent atmospheric forcing, points to an oceanic driving mechanism.\"\"This suggests a remarkable rate of acceleration in dynamic mass loss since about 2009 that must have been near-simultaneous across multiple basins and glaciers.\n\"The GRACE data shows an increase in mass loss in our region of interest (fig. S6) and are consistent with the ICESat/Envisat and Cryosat-2 observations within uncertainties at all time intervals.\"\"Combining the Cryosat-2\u2013 and GRACE-derived rates yields an error-weighted mean mass loss of 56 \u00b1 8 Gt/year for July 2010 to April 2014.\"", "recommendation_count": "4", "in_reply_to": "116152317", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "116312013", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1527457507000}, "author": "John Samuel", "author_id": "13496713", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "You've given up on being the great entertainer then.

That would include Alfred Wegener who was a meterologist experimenting with baloons and kites in the 1920s and the earlier attempts to understand the Antarctic wind patterns by the Scott expeditions. These last observed the steam from Mt. Erebus (some 20 000 ft) to get better readings of the cyclone patterns over that continent. \nSince the early 20th century the sciences of meteorology and climate have made great strides and confirmed some of their conjectures about the key role of the jetstreams on climate.", "recommendation_count": "5", "in_reply_to": "116193055", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "116206344", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1527235436000}, "author": "John Samuel", "author_id": "13496713", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "The models are very good.The denial is very weak.Try again.", "recommendation_count": "7", "in_reply_to": "116203219", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "116204562", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1527231851000}, "author": "GoldenAppleCorps", "author_id": "17327071", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "'What climate issue is comparable to bombs falling on us right now??'Permafrost melt releasing methaneAccelerating sea level rise\nIf you mean that science is a 'crystal ball', then what would you call your youtube research?

And this is from the blog they recommended for more information... \nBQSTART\nWith Texas just beginning to recover from the devastation wrought by Hurricane Harvey and the Southeastern U.S. preparing for Hurricane Irma's iminent arrival, people are naturally asking the question: What role might human-caused climate change be playing in all of this?... The first approach is to account for the simple physical processes at work and what role they may be playing. There are certain indisputable linkages that we can talk about immediately because they have already been vetted in general rather than for any specific storm. For example, even if we could say nothing else, we can conclude that sea level rise has contributed to the coastal flooding associated with recent major hurricanes: nearly a foot at Battery Park in New York City in the case of 2012 Superstorm Sandy and roughly half a foot in the case of Hurricane Harvey. The seemingly modest 1 foot of sea level rise off the New York City and New Jersey coast made a Sandy-like storm surge of 14 feet far more likely, and led to 25 additional square miles of flooding and several billion extra dollars of damage. What about the increasing strength of these storms? Here, too, the science is fairly conclusive. Whether or not we see more tropical storms (a matter of continuing research by the scientific community), we know that the strongest storms are getting stronger, with roughly eight meters per second increase in wind speed per degree Celsius of warming. And so it is not likely to be a coincidence that the strongest hurricanes on record (as measured by sustained wind speeds) for the globe, the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere, the Pacific, and now, with Irma, in the open Atlantic, have all been observed over the past two years. \nBQEND", "recommendation_count": "15", "in_reply_to": "116152317", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "they have already been vetted in general rather than for any specific storm", "effect": "that we can talk about immediately"}, {"cause": null, "effect": "25 additional square miles of flooding and several billion extra dollars of damage"}]}, {"id": "116152887", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1527108836000}, "author": "Erik Frederiksen", "author_id": "15131989", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "You see the jet stream has been getting stuck in wavy patterns which makes for persistent weather patterns.", "recommendation_count": "14", "in_reply_to": "116152317", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "116152801", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1527108620000}, "author": "DennisHorne", "author_id": "4446531", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Influenced by climate change?

The fund is supposed to support projects that would reduce Australia\u2019s carbon pollution below what it would otherwise have been.\n But the Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee found one type of project \u2013 existing landfill sites that capture methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from decomposing rubbish and burn it to generate energy \u2013 already make enough money from the sale of electricity and renewable energy certificates to cover their costs and were mostly likely to continue without taxpayer support. The report was published online in late March. \n It follows long-standing criticism that the emissions reduction fund is in some cases not delivering the cuts the government has promised. Critics say under the current design it is creating \u201cjunk\u201d carbon credits that do not represent actual reductions, but are used by industry and government to offset emissions. \n The committee recommended that no electricity generating landfill gas projects currently receiving carbon credits be given extensions when agreements lapse. Most existing contracts run to 2021 or longer. \nThe University of Melbourne legal academic Tim Baxter, who has published peer-reviewed research revealing flaws in the fund, said the change was long overdue.\n He said several analyses had suggested many of the emissions reductions paid for from the fund were not genuine as they would have happened without spending more than $2bn of taxpayers\u2019 money. Landfill gas was probably the worst example, he said.\n \u201cThere is no way that 191m tonnes of abatement is being kept in the ground or sequestered (as the government has claimed),\u201d Baxter said. \u201cBased on the design and accounting, we are either counting abatement that they were already doing or we\u2019re counting emissions they were not going to be released anyway.\u201d\nThe emissions reduction fund is the only policy the Coalition has legislated to cut emissions. It was hastily devised by then opposition environment spokesman Greg Hunt after Tony Abbott took the Liberal leadership in December 2009 promising to oppose carbon pricing, and introduced in 2014.\n Landfill gas projects have long been controversial inclusions in the Direct Action scheme, largely because about three-quarters of them were already operating before the emissions reduction fund was created in 2014.\n Half of the projects received payments under the defunct New South Wales greenhouse gas reduction scheme (the world\u2019s first mandatory emissions scheme) or the federal greenhouse friendly offsets program that shut in 2010. Labor and the Greens offered continued support by including them in the Carbon Farming Initiative set up in 2011. The Coalition extended it further by including them in the list of projects that could win funding under Direct Action.\n All parties received departmental or agency advice that they may be crediting projects that were likely to happen anyway, and therefore not cutting emissions below what they otherwise would have been. \n Baxter said it was a transparent case of political expediency overruling good policy.\n \u201cFor the sake of being able to say \u2018our scheme per tonne of emissions is cheaper than the previous government\u2019s scheme\u2019 you\u2019re seeing essentially junk credits being created,\u201d he said.\n \u201cThese projects are allowed into the fund to make the price cheaper based on a spurious argument that if we don\u2019t provide credits that these worthwhile landfill gas projects would close. There is no evidence that any of these projects were at or near closure.\u201d\n Iain Macgill, from the University of NSW\u2019s Centre for Energy and Environmental Markets, welcomed the committee\u2019s recommendation but said the evidence that landfill gas should be excluded was not new, and suggested it should be extended to cover other projects that just flared methane emissions but did not generate electricity. \u201cWhy has it taken so long to address?\u201d he said.\n Macgill said emissions from landfills needed to be cut but policy efforts would be better focused on reducing the proportion of waste being dumped.\nEnvironment minister Josh Frydenberg did not directly respond to questions about whether he would accept the committee\u2019s recommendation. He said a departmental review of climate policies last year confirmed Australia had a comprehensive set of emission reduction policies and the emissions reduction fund was internationally recognised as one of the world\u2019s largest domestic carbon offset markets.\n Emissions from waste increased 1% last year, part of an overall increase in national emissions of 1.5%.\n Under Labor and the Greens, the credits would have been paid for by businesses offsetting their emissions. Under Direct Action, their main source of income to date is public money.\n The government has 87 existing emissions contracts with landfill gas projects, promised to prevent about 20m tonnes of emissions \u2013 about 4% of what Australia emits each year. Assuming landfill operators are paid the average price of $11.90 per tonne of carbon dioxide, they would be getting $243m worth of carbon credits from taxpayers.\n This is likely to be an overestimate. The emissions reduction fund works as a reverse auction \u2013 the lowest credible bids win government contracts. Given they have existing revenue streams for their electricity, landfill operators could bid in at a price less than the average. Some estimates suggest they may be paid about half the average price.\n About half of the promised emissions cuts are contracted with one company, Adelaide-based LMS Energy. The rest are spread across several companies and councils. They included energy giants AGL and EnergyAustralia, though AGL sold its landfill gas generation assets last month. LMS Energy declined to comment on the proposed changes.\n In a research paper with Dr George Gilligan published in the Australian Journal of Environmental Law in December, Baxter found the emissions reduction fund had been set up to include landfill gas projects even though they should not qualify based on three tests built into the legislation to ensure all projects were \u201cadditional\u201d \u2013 that they are delivering carbon abatement that would not happened anyway. \n In simple terms, the three tests are that each project must be new, not have access to other government funding and not be required by other laws or regulations.\n For landfill gas, Baxter said the last two tests were overruled by a declaration that being a methane-capture-and-combustion project alone was enough to qualify, regardless of other circumstances. The \u201cnewness\u201d test has been overridden by ministerial decision.\n \u201cTwo of the three tests are replaced with a statement that \u2018a landfill gas operator is a landfill gas operator\u2019. It\u2019s just nuts,\u201d Baxter said. \u201cIt is legal because it is built into the act, but it is of questionable morality. It is a neutering of the letter of the law and the spirit of the law.\u201d\n The independent expert review comes as the Clean Energy Regulator, the government agency that runs the emissions reduction fund, prepares for its seventh auction on 6 and 7 June. To date, $2.285bn has been contracted, leaving $265m to spend.\nThe Clean Energy Regulator chairman, David Parker, told a Senate estimates hearing last week that he expected contracts worth between $50m and $100m would be signed in June.

Accepting and/or acting on the findings of the scientific experts is not an option they\u2019re willing to consider.\nSo according to this memo, the administration considered 3 options--(1) framing reality as being up for debate; (2) developing their own view of reality; or (3) ignoring reality--and went with option 3.Interesting that \"accepting reality\" was not an option. https://t.co/ejqBOEa0B0\nMeanwhile, a paper published in Nature last week concluded that limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial temperatures would save more than $20tn as compared to a temperature of 2\u00b0C. The carbon pollution cuts needed to achieve the 1.5\u00b0C target would cost about $300bn more than efforts to meet 2\u00b0C. In other words, the economic benefits of the more aggressive target would outweigh its costs by a factor of about 70-to-1.\nCurrent international climate policies will only limit global warming to about 3\u20133.5\u00b0C global warming, and America\u2019s policies are \u201ccritically insufficient\u201d to meet either the 2\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C targets. Under the Trump administration, the US has no plans to try and cut its carbon pollution, and in fact the administration has been taking every possible step to undo established climate policies and increase pollution from the coal and oil industries, even though global warming will especially hurt Trump country.\nBasically, taking aggressive action to curb global warming would save the world a lot of money, and it would especially benefit the economies in southern, conservative states. But it wouldn\u2019t be good for the fossil fuel industry, and the Trump administration has prioritized short-term corporate profits above all else, including American welfare and lives.\nThere\u2019s a 97% expert consensus that humans are causing global warming, and the scientific research is clear that the consequences of continued rapid climate change could be devastating for the economy and for all species on Earth.\nThe case for the Trump administration approach \u2013 ignoring and casting doubt on the conclusions of climate science experts \u2013 is that of a bad gambler. It\u2019s not a 100% consensus; maybe the less than 3% of climate contrarians are onto something. Perhaps the experts are wrong and climate change won\u2019t be so bad.\nIf the stakes were something inconsequential like a Trump steak, that would be fine, but it should go without saying that betting the future of humanity and life on Earth on a less than 3% long shot is a bad idea. The stakes could not be higher. Prudent risk management dictates that we should be taking serious steps to mitigate the chances of such a disastrous outcome. That\u2019s why Americans buy home and auto and health insurance. It\u2019s why fewer than 17% of Americans today are smokers, down from 42% in 1965.\nNot only is global warming denial terrible policy, but it\u2019s bad for the long-term health of the Republican Party. There\u2019s a climate change generation gap \u2013 most young Americans realize that humans are causing global warming, and young conservatives want their leaders to do something about it. Climate change impacts will only become more severe over time, and today\u2019s youth know that they\u2019ll have to live with the consequences of our actions today. They simply can\u2019t afford denial, and the GOP risks losing these voters forever by willfully ignoring the problem that poses an existential threat to young Americans.\nThere are a few glimmers of hope in the party. Trump\u2019s new Nasa administrator now accepts climate science. Eight House Republicans signed a letter to leaders of the Appropriations Committee urging them to reject any provisions in the 2019 spending bill that would undermine efforts to combat climate change. The conservative Climate Leadership Council proposed a free market, small government, revenue-neutral carbon tax ready to go as soon as the GOP can elect a leadership that\u2019s willing to make a great climate change deal.\nBut right now the GOP is still stuck being, as Governor Bobby Jindal (R-LA) described it five years ago, \u201cthe stupid party.\u201d Its leadership won\u2019t even consider the possibility that 97% of climate science experts are right. That denial is going to be very expensive, and as Americans increasingly accept the realities of climate change, it will also land the GOP on the endangered species list.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-tax", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/economy", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Dana Nuccitelli: Even though smart climate policies could save tens of trillions of dollars", "date_published": {"$date": 1527588020000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1527588105000}, "authors": ["Dana Nuccitelli"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Carbon tax", "Fossil fuels", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Energy", "Environment", "Economic policy", "Politics", "Donald Trump", "Republicans"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/may/29/trump-administration-refuses-to-consider-that-97-of-climate-scientists-could-be-right", "og:description": "Dana Nuccitelli: Even though smart climate policies could save tens of trillions of dollars", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff1ec5518daf7aa69b41d3fd1164f1664fa20625/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=6cfbc65506dfd1f05c7c391df1f718c0", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Trump administration refuses to consider that 97% of climate scientists could be right | Dana Nuccitelli"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff1ec5518daf7aa69b41d3fd1164f1664fa20625/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3e315512ee0e2e00bff72e468af8b53e", "width": "3500", "height": "2101", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff1ec5518daf7aa69b41d3fd1164f1664fa20625/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3d3c351a1d57e00fbb85046f12e1889b", "description": "President Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., May 26, 2018.\nPhotograph: Yuri Gripas/Reuters"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556126345032}, "comments": [{"id": "116635925", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1528211128000}, "author": "WillOnce", "author_id": "15661409", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "We're both saying similar things, but in different ways. \nI am interested in why people are opposed to climate change.

I see this in climate change, astronomical research and medicine to name three of the most prolific studies around, where consensus is taken as fact. It is not.

The findings in the heart were statistically stronger than the findings in the brain. But note, it is \u201cconsidered likely\u201d not \u201cdefinitely is\u201d.\nBQEND\nThat's just how scientists talk (as opposed to \"normal\" people like journalists and politicians).\nYour final sentence about \"... growing evidence of harmful effects to both plants and animals\" links in the PDF to Balmori (2009), with the following abstract :\nBQSTART\nA review on the impact of radiofrequency radiation from wireless telecommunications on wildlife is presented. Electromagnetic radiation is a form of environmental pollution which may hurt wildlife. Phone masts located in their living areas are irradiating continuously some species that could suffer long-term effects, like reduction of their natural defenses, deterioration of their health, problems in reproduction and reduction of their useful territory through habitat deterioration. Electromagnetic radiation can exert an aversive behavioral response in rats, bats and birds such as sparrows. Therefore microwave and radiofrequency pollution constitutes a potential cause for the decline of animal populations and deterioration of health of plants living near phone masts. To measure these effects urgent specific studies are necessary.\nBQEND\nThat sounds more like \"an appeal for further funding\" than a shining example of \"proof\" to me.\nA quick Google search led me to Cucurachi et al (2013), \"A review of the ecological effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF)\", which 3 or 4 years after Balmori had a longer than usual \"Abstract\" that included the following :\nBQSTART\nResults \nInformation was collected from 113 studies from original peer-reviewed publications or from relevant existing reviews. A limited amount of ecological field studies was identified. The majority of the studies were conducted in a laboratory setting on birds (embryos or eggs), small rodents and plants. In 65% of the studies, ecological effects of RF-EMF (50% of the animal studies and about 75% of the plant studies) were found both at high as well as at low dosages. No clear dose\u2013effect relationship could be discerned. Studies finding an effect applied higher durations of exposure and focused more on the GSM frequency ranges.\nConclusions\nIn about two third of the reviewed studies ecological effects of RF-EMF was reported at high as well as at low dosages. The very low dosages are compatible with real field situations, and could be found under environmental conditions. However, a lack of standardisation and a limited number of observations limit the possibility of generalising results from an organism to an ecosystem level. We propose in future studies to conduct more repetitions of observations and explicitly use the available standards for reporting RF-EMF relevant physical parameters in both laboratory and field studies.\nBQEND\nWhile the mention of \"future studies\" is standard (scientists have to keep paying their bills too !), the mention of the lack of a \"clear dose\u2013effect relationship\" is troubling.", "recommendation_count": "2", "in_reply_to": "116435016", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "116488782", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1527861995000}, "author": "Bernie Thomas", "author_id": "17746707", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\"...you argue that emissions reduction should not come at the expense of global industrial output...\"\nNo I don't.

People inside the agency are concerned Trump will cut climate science funding. There is a fear and anxiety there and the outcome has been chaos.\u201d\nTenenbaum said that around a month after Trump\u2019s inauguration last year an \u201carduous review process\u201d was put in place over every blog post, Facebook post and tweet that she put out from Nasa\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.\n\u201cI was told verbally by media relations it was because with Trump as president, climate change is now a sensitive subject,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was confusion about what to do now we have a president who doesn\u2019t believe in climate change. Everyone was scrambling. It was chaos.\u201d \nPlanned blogposts on coal plants being turned into solar plants, \u201creasons to be positive about Nasa\u201d and an interview with Gavin Schmidt, a senior Nasa climate scientist, were all either halted or scrapped due to interference from career staff nervous about provoking the new administration, according to Tenenbaum.\nFigures show there has been a notable decline in Nasa\u2019s output of climate information since the election of the Trump administration. During 2016, Nasa posted frequently on its climate change Facebook page, peaking at 122 posts during August of that year, according to CrowdTangle. \nThere were 53 Facebook posts in January 2017, the month of Trump\u2019s inauguration, and Nasa hasn\u2019t come close to this total since, posting 21 times this March and 31 times in April.\nThis drop off in posts has resulted in dwindling interactions with the public on Facebook. During January 2017 there were more than 61,700 interactions \u2013 defined as likes, comments and shares \u2013 on the climate page. This has slumped dramatically since then, totaling just 7,000 in April. In April 2016, under the Obama administration, there were more than 100,000 interactions. \nNasa\u2019s Earth Right Now blog, which Tenenbaum wrote for, has also seen a decrease in activity, with just two originally-produced posts since Tenenbaum\u2019s last entry in August 2017. Tenenbaum said she was warned about speaking to the media and then was offered another job elsewhere in the agency, before taking a leave of absence and then resigning. \nNasa\u2019s climate change website and Facebook page still clearly outline its findings, common with other scientific organizations, that the world is warming and the seas are rising.\nA Nasa spokesman said there has been \u201cno policy change about how we communicate out science to the American public\u201d.\n\u201cNasa Communications has not received any directive to change how we communicate about agency research, which includes climate change,\u201d he added. \n\u201cThe frequency of blogposts on climate.nasa.gov has always varied depending on personnel availability and other factors including mission activities (launches, expeditions in the field, etc).\u201d\nThere has been some angst within Nasa over Trump\u2019s aversion to climate science \u2013 which he has previously called \u201cbullshit\u201d and a \u201choax\u201d inspired by China \u2013 and his administration\u2019s dismantling of efforts to address global warming.\nThe White House\u2019s proposal to cut funding for Nasa\u2019s Earth science work, which uses satellites to measure the planet\u2019s climate, soils, wildfires and weather events such as hurricanes, is also a point of contention. \nOne agency scientist, who didn\u2019t wish to be named, said: \u201cSome people are apprehensive, some are defiant and some put their nose to [the] grindstone and get on with it.\u201d\nNasa has yet to attract the level of controversy that surrounds the Environmental Protection Agency, whose administrator Scott Pruitt has denied basic facts on climate science, remodeled scientific panels to include more industry representatives and oversaw the removal of climate change information from the EPA website for a \u201creview\u201d that has lasted for more than a year. \nKate Marvel, a climate scientist at Columbia University and the Nasa Goddard Institute of Space Studies who said she was speaking in a personal capacity, said no one has told her to \u201cshut up\u201d about her work.\n\u201cPhysics doesn\u2019t change just because the administration has changed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to understand how the planet works and I will continue to keep doing that.\u201d\nJim Bridenstine, Nasa\u2019s new administrator and former Republican congressman, has previously voiced doubt over the mainstream scientific understanding that the world is warming due to human activity. \nBut he appeared to have shifted his position during a televised meeting with Nasa workers earlier this month.\n\u201cI don\u2019t deny the consensus, I believe fully in climate change and that we human beings are contributing to it in a major way,\u201d Bridenstine said, adding that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and \u201cwe are putting it into the atmosphere in volumes we haven\u2019t seen before.

For this to change, these companies must be held accountable for the emissions and they must have credible, independently verifiable emissions reductions strategy,\u201d said Shefali Sharma, director of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy European office. \nThe new Coller FAIRR Protein Producers Index has examined the environmental and social commitments of 60 of the world\u2019s largest meat and fish producers and found that more than half are failing to properly document their impact, despite their central role in our lives and societies.\nMany of the names in the index will be unfamiliar, but their consolidated revenues of $300bn cover around one-fifth of the global livestock and aquaculture market \u2013 roughly one in every five burgers, steaks or fish. \nThe companies looked at by the index include giants like the Australian Agricultural Company, which has the biggest cattle herd in the world; the Chinese WH Group, the largest global pork company; or the US\u2019s Sandersons, which processes more than 10 million chickens a week.\nMany of them run vertically integrated systems, sourcing meat from contracted farmers around the world, processing it themselves through their own slaughter and packing houses and then selling on to frontline, more familiar companies such as McDonalds, Walmart, Nestle and Danone.\nBut a close examination by the Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return (FAIRR) group has shown that, despite their critical part in our food system, these companies appear to be neglecting some of their social responsibilities. \nThe food system, according to FAIRR, is \u201cvery sensitive to changing public sentiment\u201d, and really large sums of investor money in the sector are often at risk due to little-understood risks. The organisation, founded by financier Jeremy Coller in 2015, aims to shed greater light on these risks.\nAnimal welfare, water scarcity, deforestation and working conditions were some of the areas in which the 60 largest protein-producing companies around the world were assessed. The index looked at self-declared information from each company, and set a wide range of key performance indicators such as targets for deforestation reduction, a policy on antibiotic reduction, or water exposer of supply chains. Overall 60% were found to be \u201ceither not managing critical risks or are failing to disclose basic information\u201d.\n\u201cThe findings from this first index create cause for concern,\u201d said the report\u2019s introduction. \u201cThere is still a worrying lack of ESG [environmental, social and governance] data availability and disclosure \u2026 despite the sector\u2019s myriad sustainability impacts.\u201d\nClimate change emerged as a particular concern. Despite the fact that, according to the report, livestock production represents 14.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions, almost 72% of companies provided little or no evidence to show that they were measuring or reporting their emissions. Some 19 companies received the lowest possible mark in this section, including Australia Agricultural Company, Cal-Maine (a US company which reportedly produced 1bn eggs in 2017), Russian Cherkizovo and Indian Venky\u2019s. This, the report argues, may be \u201cputting the implementation of the Paris agreement in jeopardy\u201d. The Guardian approached these companies for comment but received no response. \n Studies over the last decade have repeatedly shown that the production of red meat is energy and water-intensive compared to the production of most grains and vegetables. But many government officials appear to be reluctant to suggest that consumers should reduce their meat consumption.\nAntibiotic use also stood out. Antibiotic resistance has soared in recent decades and is now considered one of the biggest public health threats facing the world. The role of farming and food production in spreading resistant bacteria has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years as growing evidence points to a direct threat to human health from veterinary overuse of antibiotics on farms.\nDespite this, there has been a \u201cwidespread failure to respond\u201d to the crisis, the report says. The report says that 77% of the sector - 46 companies worth an estimated $239bn - rank \u201chigh risk\u201d on antibiotic stewardship, with \u201clittle or no measures in place to reduce excessive use of antibiotics\u201d.\nAbigail Herron, global head of responsible investment, Aviva Investors, said: \u201cOur research shows that three in four of these companies are ignoring the calls from regulators, health professionals and the financial community to manage and reduce their use of antibiotics. That failure puts both global public health and their business models at risk.\u201d\n \nIndian poultry giant Venky\u2019s is among the companies ranked as \u201chigh risk\u201d on antibiotics. Sanderson Farms, one of the US\u2019s largest poultry producers, is also given bottom-tier ranking.\nVenky\u2019s was recently found by an investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism to be advertising colistin, a so-called \u201clast resort\u201d antibiotic, for sale as a growth promoter in India, one of five pharma companies found to be doing the same.\nDeforestation is another area in which many companies are falling short. A recent analysis by Forest 500 found that despite cattle production being the biggest driver of tropical production globally, only 17% of assessed cattle companies had a policy addressing forest production. And the Coller Index finds that of the 24 companies processing beef and dairy (where deforestation is a particular risk), only one is assessed as \u201clow risk\u201d.\n \u201cFrom an investment point of view, it is not only this $300bn group of companies at risk but the wider multi-trillion dollar global food supply chain ... Investors sit at the top of the chain as ultimate owners of these listed businesses. They need to use their influence as responsible stewards of these assets to start a dialogue on best practice and encourage a race to the top to build a more sustainable food system,\u201d said Aarti Ramachandran, head of research and corporate engagement at FAIRR.\n\u201cA major, systemic change is needed in the way we source protein if we are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, habitat loss and water stress. This can only be achieved if businesses and policymakers, working with the latest food technologies and scientific advice, collaborate to create a sustainable and nutritious food revolution that meets tomorrow\u2019s demand,\u201d said Emily Farnworth, Head of Climate Change Initiatives, World Economic Forum.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always worth remembering that there is no such thing as cheap meat\u2014these industries have been subsidised for years by the public because we pay for their environmental pollution, public health costs that they do not account for in their business model. This is where governments need to step in,\u201d said Sharma. \nAdditional research by Naomi Larsson", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/food/meat", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/farming", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/food", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "New index finds many of the world\u2019s largest protein producers failing to measure or report emissions, despite accounting for 14.5% of greenhouse gases", "date_published": {"$date": 1527660043000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1534350506000}, "authors": ["Bibi van der Zee", "Andrew Wasley"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["The meat industry", "Meat", "Paris climate agreement", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Environment", "Farming", "Food", "Food", "World news", "Business"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/30/meat-and-fish-protein-multinationals-jeopardising-paris-climate-goals", "og:description": "New index finds many of the world\u2019s largest protein producers failing to measure or report emissions, despite accounting for 14.5% of greenhouse gases", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28f18743234b6a3b985d9447642c9c5f067a9f3e/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=94e0682a7399d591aba41b7961bf9397", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Meat and fish multinationals 'jeopardising Paris climate goals'"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28f18743234b6a3b985d9447642c9c5f067a9f3e/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=adb6b3c75330486862cb4718f681b755", "width": "5568", "height": "3341", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28f18743234b6a3b985d9447642c9c5f067a9f3e/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2cf81a78f3a42a963dc1e0dbb6e2ddd3", "description": "The companies examined by the report include Australian cattle giants and a Norwegian seafood company.\nPhotograph: Tracey Nearmy/AAP"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07e5ca2c3613145ed8e6d"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/29/justin-trudeau-world-newest-oil-executive-kinder-morgan", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "In case anyone wondered, this is how the world ends: with the cutest, progressivest, boybandiest leader in the world going fully in the tank for the oil industry.\nJustin Trudeau\u2019s government announced on Tuesday that it would nationalize the Kinder Morgan pipeline running from the tar sands of Alberta to the tidewater of British Columbia. It will fork over at least $4.5bn in Canadian taxpayers\u2019 money for the right to own a 60-year-old pipe that springs leaks regularly, and for the right to push through a second pipeline on the same route \u2013 a proposal that has provoked strong opposition.\nThat opposition has come from three main sources. First are many of Canada\u2019s First Nations groups, who don\u2019t want their land used for this purpose without their permission, and who fear the effects of oil spills on the oceans and forests they depend on. Second are the residents of Canada\u2019s west coast, who don\u2019t want hundreds of additional tankers plying the narrow inlets around Vancouver on the theory that eventually there\u2019s going to be an oil spill. And third are climate scientists, who point out that even if Trudeau\u2019s pipeline doesn\u2019t spill oil into the ocean, it will spill carbon into the atmosphere.\nLots of carbon: Trudeau told oil executives last year that \u201cno country would find 173bn barrels of oil in the ground and just leave it there\u201d. That\u2019s apparently how much he plans to dig up and burn \u2013 and if he\u2019s successful, the one half of 1% of the planet that is Canadian will have awarded to itself almost one-third of the remaining carbon budget between us and the 1.5 degree rise in temperature the planet drew as a red line in Paris. There\u2019s no way of spinning the math that makes that okay \u2013 Canadians already emit more carbon per capita than Americans. Hell, than Saudi Arabians. \nIs this a clever financial decision that will somehow make Canada rich? Certainly not in the long run. Cleaning up the tar sands complex in Alberta \u2013 the biggest, ugliest scar on the surface of the earth \u2013 is already estimated to cost more than the total revenues generated by all the oil that\u2019s come out of the ground. Meanwhile, when something goes wrong, Canada is now on the hook: when BP tarred the Gulf of Mexico, the US was at least able to exact billions of dollars in fines to help with the cleanup. Canada will get to sue itself.\nNo, this is simply a scared prime minister playing politics. He\u2019s worried about the reaction in Alberta if the pipe is not built, and so he has mortgaged his credibility. His predecessor, Stephen Harper, probably would not have dared try \u2013 the outcry from environmentalists and First Nations would have been too overwhelming. But Trudeau is banking on the fact that his liberal charm will soothe things over. Since he\u2019s got Trump to point to \u2013 a true climate denier \u2013 maybe he\u2019ll get away with it.\nBut it seems like a bad bet to me. Faced with the same situation \u2013 a revolt over the Keystone XL pipeline \u2013 Barack Obama delayed for several years to avoid antagonizing either side. He ultimately decided he couldn\u2019t defend the climate cost of building it, and so became the first world leader to explicitly reject a big piece of infrastructure on global warming grounds. Trudeau has made the exact opposite call, and now we\u2019ll see if pipeline opponents cave. \nI was in Vancouver two weeks ago to help activists raise money for lawyers, and I would guess that the civil disobedience will continue \u2013 so far, two members of parliament have been arrested, an escalation we\u2019ve never seen even in the States. Coast Salish elders have built a \u201cwatch house\u201d along the pipeline route and, as at Standing Rock, other native activists have been pouring in \u2013 I\u2019m guessing that making this petro-colonialism officially state sponsored will only harden people\u2019s resolution. The showdown will be powerfully symbolic: kayaktivists, for instance, have paddled peacefully around the pipeline\u2019s terminal, at least until Kinder Morgan put up an ugly razor wire barrier in the middle of the harbor.\nNow it\u2019s Trudeau who owns the razor wire, Trudeau who has to battle his own people. All in the name of pouring more carbon into the air, so he can make the oil companies back at the Alberta end of his pipe a little more money. We know now how history will remember Justin Trudeau: not as a dreamy progressive, but as one more pathetic employee of the richest, most reckless industry in the planet\u2019s history.

The classic economic vision: Favoured across a wide spectrum from Marxist-Leninist to Libertarian Capitalist. A rapid economic growth vision predicated on treating the environment as a \u2018free good\u2019 to be exploited at will.\n2.

Both these stances enjoy support in various regions of Canada & equally strong opposition in other regions.\nThe Liberals, to their credit, have tried to find a viable symbiosis transcending these 2 visions. However, they have seriously underestimated the need for a frank debate to rally support for such a symbiosis.

She told the conference that Australia needed integrated energy and climate change policy and the NEG was \u201can opportunity for bipartisanship on a mechanism to deliver emissions reduction\u201d.\nIt does not follow that bipartisan acceptance of the NEG would mean a bipartisan position on emissions reductions targets, Savage said. \n\u201cIndustry do need confidence around the mechanism that will operate and the framework within which the targets will change.\u201d\nSavage also said Australia should focus on energy efficiency as the main policy lever that could reduce energy prices, reduce emissions and increase reliability.\n\u201cReducing peak demand is a way of dealing with peak demand,\u201d she said.\nButler said addressing the inefficiency of Australian industry and households was \u201ccritical\u201d to both reducing costs and ensuring supply.\n\u201cWe have an enormous challenge in that we\u2019ve gone from being a low-cost energy economy to a high-cost energy economy but we\u2019re still behaving like a low-cost energy economy,\u201d he said. \nButler and Savage were speaking on a panel that included the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, the Nationals MP Damian Drum and the Australian Industry Greenhouse Network chief executive, Susie Smith. \nDi Natale said the Greens would consider supporting a policy of either party if it felt it was a \u201cstep forward,\u201d and the NEG was not.\nDrum said the push for renewables in the form of state-specific targets was \u201cbullshit\u201d if it came at the expense of affordable dispatchable power.\n\u201cWe all love to have a social conscience, just think about your social conscience when you get the price of energy to the stage where mums and dads can\u2019t pay their bills,\u201d he said. \nDrum said that Australia\u2019s capacity for gas electricity generation had been \u201chijacked by liars.\u201d\n\u201cGas is half the emissions of coal, and better, and it\u2019s dispatchable and it\u2019s available and we lock it up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe lock it up for political reasons.

For example, grants for 12 new large-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) projects which will triple Australia\u2019s large-scale solar capacity from 240 MW to 720 MW \u2013 enough to power 150,000 Australian homes.The $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation will continue to operate as a \u201cgreen bank\u201d financing new technologies.By Building Snowy 2.0, we will make renewable energy reliable by increasing storage by 50%, adding 2,000 megawatts of renewable energy \u2013 enough to power 500,000 homes.\nAnd off the ALP propaganda machine: Climate change is driving the most profound restructuring of the world economy this century \u2013 the transition from fossil fuel based energy to renewable energy. The transition is happening now and it is accelerating. With the right policies the renewable energy sector provides immense opportunities: it will drive jobs creation, drive manufacturing investment and put downward pressure on power prices for families and small businesses.That\u2019s why a Shorten Labor Government will: Ensure that at least 50% of the nation\u2019s electricity is sourced from renewable energy by 2030;Expand the investment mandate of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation;Provide $206.6m to ARENA to support a specific Concentrated Solar Thermal funding round;Establish a Community Power Network and Regional Hubs at a cost of $98.7m over four years; andEnsure the Commonwealth Government leads by example as a direct purchaser of renewable energy.The Liberal Government has done everything in its power to try and destroy Australia\u2019s share in one of the world\u2019s fastest growing industries with devastating consequences for our country. In the last two years more than 2 million renewable energy jobs were added to the global economy, but over the same period 2,900 jobs were lost in Australia.In 2014, clean energy investment grew in China (32 per cent), the US (8 per cent), Japan (12 per cent), Germany (3 per cent) and the UK (3 per cent). But over the same period, investment in large scale renewables dropped by 88 per cent in Australia\u2013 from over $2 billion to around $240 million.A strong renewable energy sector will be at the centre of Labor\u2019s response to the challenges of climate change. With the right policies the renewable energy sector also provides immense opportunities: it will drive jobs creation, drive manufacturing investment and put downward pressure on power prices for families and small businesses. \nThe trouble is we can't trust the ALP on any one topic, they have proven time and time again, as theytreat us all so cynically they must think we are all stupid. \"There will be no carbon etc in a government I lead\", they help vote down the SSM debate in 2012, they set up the FWC, they continually forget their past and trust we will believe their every utterance.", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "115344809", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "115430501", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1525421005000}, "author": "entropy_is_a_hoax", "author_id": "12694642", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Wrong ink, but not by much https://www.theguardian.com/media/commentisfree/2018/may/04/news-corp-taxes-david-speers-with-pro-business-roadshow.", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "115429090", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "115357015", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1525265038000}, "author": "justdreamingguss", "author_id": "13984824", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Dutton's abuse of facial recognition, surveillance on the population should be the priority article open to comment!!!!!!!!!

The latter accounted for 72,523 new car registrations in 2017, compared with 13,597 for fully electric models and 33,666 for plug-in hybrids.\nProf David Bailey, an automotive expert at Aston university, said the switch to 100% electric cars would only begin to take off in a big way in the 2020s. \u201cWe will see a quicker shift into hybrid technology which is set to become the mainstream,\u201d he said.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/business/automotive-industry", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/motoring", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ethical-living", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/travel-and-transport", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Environment secretary favours the move but it is hotly contested within government", "date_published": {"$date": 1525455337000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1525473301000}, "authors": ["Adam Vaughan"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Electric", "hybrid and low-emission cars", "Automotive industry", "Business", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Environment", "Motoring", "Ethical and green living", "Technology", "Travel and transport", "Road transport", "Transport policy", "Politics", "UK news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/04/michael-gove-leading-plan-to-ban-sale-of-new-hybrid-cars-from-2040", "og:description": "Environment secretary favours the move but it is hotly contested within government", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1350175486cae265a85d33fe89e1596cbc5ac83/0_141_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=7f0863f6abe9add4882c04151880d928", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Michael Gove leading plan to ban sale of new hybrid cars by 2040"}, "headline": "0", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1350175486cae265a85d33fe89e1596cbc5ac83/0_141_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e213b365aa31349d850b3ebcdf18a985", "width": "4000", "height": "2400", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1350175486cae265a85d33fe89e1596cbc5ac83/0_141_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b9d14e1a97c7e6345b72405e3e3bb96c", "description": "Toyota\u2019s Prius production line in Aichi, Japan.\nPhotograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07dd7a2c3613145ed8e3f"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/09/secret-uk-push-to-weaken-eu-climate-laws-completely-mad", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": " A secret UK push to weaken key EU climate laws before Brexit risks scotching the bloc\u2019s Paris commitments, MEPs say.\n The EU has committed to a 20% cut in its energy use by 2020 to be achieved by two directives, covering energy efficiency and buildings.\nBut leaked documents seen by the Guardian show that Britain is pushing for its 2014-2020 timeline to be stretched backwards four years to count \u201cearly actions\u201d taken that comply with the efficiency directive. \nAny \u201cexcess energy savings\u201d during the law\u2019s writ would then be forwarded to the post-2020 period. MEPs have branded the plan \u201cincomprehensible\u201d.\n Benedek J\u00e1vor, the vice chair of the European parliament\u2019s environment committee, told the Guardian: \u201cThe UK\u2019s proposal to widen \u2018flexibilities\u2019 is completely mad and undermines the principle of additionality, as well as the overall ambition of the energy efficiency directive.\u201d\n \u201cThis approach would risk failure in our efforts to reach even moderately ambitious overall targets, while the higher \u2013 and beneficial targets \u2013 that we need to strive for could become lost altogether.\u201d\nJ\u00e1vor added that it was \u201crude\u201d for the UK to weaken climate measures that it would only be bound by during a transition period, before it left the bloc.\n Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade and climate spokesman, said: \u201c2018 is the year when countries have been asked by the UN to ratchet up their commitments on climate change. Instead our government is actually proposing to count emissions savings made from as far back as 2010 towards fulfilling their obligations in the next decade from 2021-2030.\u201d\n\u201cThis sneaky, behind-the-scenes amendment indicates a government that likes to pretend it is a global leader but will not take the strong policy action needed to deliver the necessary change.\u201d\nA UK government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are asking for clarity on certain energy savings between 2010 and 2013 and agreeing these for the 2020 target. This is not about applying these energy savings post-2020. To suggest otherwise is incorrect and we continue to advocate ambitious future targets.\u201d\nThe British correspondence with the European council, dated 4 May, proposes allowing EU states to count climate actions taken \u201cin any of the four previous or three following years\u201d towards the energy efficiency directive\u2019s annual 1.5% energy savings obligations.\nAny \u201cexcess energy savings\u201d between 2014 and 2020 \u201cmay count towards the fulfilment of obligations between 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030\u201d, it says.\nThe UK tried but failed to have similar loopholes added to the original directive in 2012. The Liberal-Democrat MEP, Catherine Bearder said it \u201cgave the lie\u201d to Michael Gove\u2019s claims to be leading a \u201cgreen revolution\u201d.\n \u201cOne despairs,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the face of Brexit, we really don\u2019t have a leg to stand on. We\u2019re in no position to start issuing demands. This is a carefully crafted agreement to decrease our carbon emissions and make our energy use more efficient. It is disappointing and ludicrous that we would come forward trying to water that down as we head towards the EU\u2019s exit door.\u201d \n The EU\u2019s climate goals for 2020 are a staging post to its more ambitious promise to the Paris conference of a 40% emissions cut by 2030. \n Europe is expected to easily achieve this, although its CO2 emissions appear to be rising as economic activity picks up, while energy efficiency gains have gone into reverse. \n Eurostat figures released last week showed a 1.8% rise in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use in 2017 after a 0.4% fall the year before.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will soon provide its own 2018 hurricane predictions. \nThe initial forecasts of an above-average season for hurricanes follow a punishing 2017, most notable for Hurricane Harvey, which drenched large areas of Texas, Hurricane Irma\u2019s sweep over Florida and the devastation that stubbornly lingers in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria. \nThese huge hurricanes brought winds of up to 185mph and lashing rains, causing hundreds of deaths, flattening homes, felling power lines and ruining roads. Combined, the three storms caused around $265bn in damage, and all ranked in the five most destructive hurricanes ever recorded.\nMany communities, particularly in Puerto Rico and Texas, are still struggling to recover from last year\u2019s hurricanes as the upcoming storm season approaches. And while the US may be spared 2017 levels of devastation this year, scientists have warned that the warming of the oceans, driven by climate change, is likely to stir greater numbers of prodigious storms in the future.\nAtlantic hurricanes are intensifying far more rapidly than they did 30 years ago, according to a new study that analyzed the acceleration in wind speed of previous storms. Major hurricanes are defined by a sharp increase in speed, of at least 28mph in a 24-hour period. \nResearchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory found that these big hurricanes are, on average, speeding up 13mph faster in this 24-hour period than they did 30 years ago. Much of this has to do with shifts in a natural climate cycle called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.\nSeparate research from the National Center for Atmospheric Research suggests this natural variation will combine with escalating warming in the oceans and atmosphere, caused by the burning of fossil fuels by humans, to produce stronger hurricanes in the future. A warm ocean surface, combined with consistent wind patterns, contribute to the formation of fiercer, if not more numerous, hurricanes.\nIn the weeks before Hurricane Harvey smashed into Texas in August last year, the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s waters were warmer than any time on record at around 30C (86F), the NCAR research found. \n\u201cThe implication is that the warmer oceans increased the risk of greater hurricane intensity and duration,\u201d said Kevin Trenberth, an NCAR senior scientist and lead author of the study. \u201cAs climate change continues to heat the oceans, we can expect more supercharged storms like Harvey. \n\u201cWhile we often think of hurricanes as atmospheric phenomena, it\u2019s clear that the oceans play a critical role and will shape future storms as the climate changes.\u201d\nHurricanes act as a sort of relief valve for hot tropical oceans, funneling heat away into the atmosphere. Persistent warmth in the oceans, however, adds further energy to hurricanes and risks causing worse damage to life and property when these storms make landfall.\nFaced with the prospect of supercharged hurricanes, as various other burgeoning climate change-related threats, Donald Trump has rescinded Obama-era rules preparing infrastructure for climate impacts. He has taken an axe to policies that would lower greenhouse gas emissions from cars and power plants and announced that the US will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. \nThis agenda has been criticized by researchers who have called for an urgent reappraisal of the risk posed by climate change. \n\u201cWe know this threat exists, and yet in many cases, society is not adequately planning for these storms,\u201d Trenberth said. \n\u201cI believe there is a need to increase resilience with better building codes, flood protection, and water management, and we need to prepare for contingencies, including planning evacuation routes and how to deal with power cuts.\u201d\nThis year, however, the focus will again be on disaster recovery rather than long-term mitigation. Ken Graham, director of Noaa\u2019s National Hurricane Center said that the \u201centire Gulf Coast is at risk from storms and that several hurricanes can strike in a single season\u201d.\n\u201cDon\u2019t wait for a hurricane to be on your doorstep to make a preparedness plan, by then it may be too late,\u201d he added. \u201cTake the time now to get prepared for the season ahead.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/natural-disasters", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The initial forecasts of an above-average season for hurricanes, beginning on 1 June, follow a punishing spate of storms last year", "date_published": {"$date": 1526014832000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1536672519000}, "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "article_section": "World news", "article_tags": ["Hurricanes", "US news", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Climate change", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/11/hurricane-season-may-be-even-worse-in-2018-after-a-harrowing-2017", "og:description": "The initial forecasts of an above-average season for hurricanes, beginning on 1 June, follow a punishing spate of storms last year", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/583cd18e6b2a87fcf5b85907433bc3ada3f5652d/0_0_5010_3006/master/5010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=ae8fcabb60bb162c0e7c17f9d44a7c55", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Hurricane season may be even worse in 2018 after a harrowing 2017"}, "headline": "0", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/583cd18e6b2a87fcf5b85907433bc3ada3f5652d/0_0_5010_3006/master/5010.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d2ae9419054e262bed12f3a28f6a3c59", "width": "5010", "height": "3006", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/583cd18e6b2a87fcf5b85907433bc3ada3f5652d/0_0_5010_3006/master/5010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8caa8c401211a2e4a58c4fc775d3b8a4", "description": "Flooded homes at Citrus Park in Bonita Springs, Florida on 16 September 2017, six days after Hurricane Irma.\nPhotograph: Nicole Raucheisen/AP"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/513a348fb79857d00e45de5653dc7fc18e6f104a/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=633448b081d160ef9147ed064b5b5867", "width": "4500", "height": "2700", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/513a348fb79857d00e45de5653dc7fc18e6f104a/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6f07ac662fc5f5305cc7380d6f04305e", "description": "People make their way onto an I-610 overpass after being rescued from flooded homes during the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, on 27 August 2017 in Houston, Texas.

But the figures also highlight that the government\u2019s current plan to focus almost exclusively on electricity, through its national energy guarantee , means Australia will be unable to meet its commitment to reduce economy-wide emissions by 28% below 2005 levels by 2030.\nThe government is never all that excited about releasing the quarterly update on greenhouse gas emissions. In December it released them the week before Christmas, and this time it released it late Friday afternoon \u2013 the end of budget week. \nThe minster for environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, didn\u2019t bother to even put out a media release which, given the importance of the figures to his portfolio, would be like the treasurer not bothering to note the release of the quarterly GDP figures. \nThe budget last week was not exactly replete with money and news about action on climate change. There was $500m to go towards mitigating the impact of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef, which is often the government\u2019s favoured way with climate change \u2013 do bugger all to prevent the harm, and then spend money to make it seem like they care after the damage has been done. \nSign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday\nBut as for actual efforts to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, for now the only thing close to a policy is related to electricity via the national energy guarantee.\n\u200bThe latest emissions data, however, shows that will in no way be enough.\nIn 2017, Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to have been 533.7 Mt CO2 -e. The report notes that this is 2.4% below emissions in 2000 and 11.7% below emissions in 2005.\nBut that rosiness is really a bit of a figleaf as it refers to total emissions including the emissions from the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sectors, which were very high in the early 2000s but which have been reduced due to less forest reduction and planting more trees.\nSuch activity was included in our Paris emissions targets because doing so made the cuts easier to achieve. But the measurement of the LULUCF sector is subject to a fair degree of error, and if you really want to look at actual greenhouse gas emissions you exclude it \u2013 but doing so makes the job of reducing our emissions to 26% below 2005 levels by 2030 much harder:\nEven including LULUCF, there was a 1.5% increase in emissions in 2017 compared with 2016.\nThe report notes that a big reason for this was \u201cthe expansion in LNG exports, which saw a 41.4% increase in LNG production in 2017 and a forecast increase in LNG production for 2018 of a further 18.1%.\u201d\nAnd certainly the report puts to bed any claims that we have some sort of a gas-supply crisis \u2013 production is at record levels \u2013 but most of the increase is going towards LNG exports rather than domestic gas:\nBut let\u2019s not be coy about the cause of these emissions. \nThere is one reason Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have increased, and it is the same one that has been in place since July 2014 \u2013 we no longer have a carbon price:\nIn the three and half years since the carbon price was removed, total greenhouse gas emissions (excluding LULUCF) have grown on average by 1.3% each year \u2013 compared with an average annual fall of 1.1% during the carbon price period.\nThe somewhat good news is that since the end of the carbon price, emissions in the electricity sector, which accounts for just over a third of total emissions, have actually fallen:\nThe reason, however, is not due to any great work by the government in crafting an energy policy designed to encourage renewables or cleaner energy, but because the extremely dirty and inefficient Hazelwood power station has closed. This has seen the use of brown coal to generate electricity in the national energy market fall from accounting for 25% in 2009 to now just 18%:\nBut while emissions from electricity have fallen, they have not fallen anywhere near enough to counter the rises in emissions in other sectors:\nAnd with a focus on electricity set to remain, that means our ability to meet our emissions targets looks set to be impossible.\nConsider that since June 2016, the increase in emissions from transport and stationary energy (emissions that come via manufacturing, mining and other commercial activities) have almost cancelled out the fall in electricity emissions in that period:\nA one-sector-only approach to emissions reduction is not going to cut it (literally).\nThe government\u2019s own projections last year for our path to 26% or 28% below 2005 levels highlight just how far we have to go, and how unlikely it is to be achieved with the current policy:\nNo one ever really believed Direct Action would work, and it clearly has not. The data shows unequivocally that the government\u2019s climate change policy has been a complete failure.\nAnd so long as this government remains beholden to climate change deniers within the partyroom and cabinet, who break out into spasms of lunacy at the mere suggestion of an emissions trading scheme or price on carbon, it will continue to be a failure and our emissions will continue to rise.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The only thing close to climate change policy is the national energy guarantee.

It all turned out fine. So much so that she is now about to have her own child.\nAnd there was the time when Number One Son, aged about two, bellowed from the back of the car, \u201cAhh fuck \u2013 you idiot!\u201d I\u2019d just slammed on the brakes, inspiring him to speak with perfect intonation in precise mimicry of ... words I may have previously uttered from behind the wheel in a similar situation.\nWhich brings me to something Number Two Daughter, a nearly-teen, said in the car a few months ago.\n\u201cMum and Dad \u2013 I don\u2019t want you to be upset at this or anything,\u201d she began.\nShe had our attention. \u201cYes?\u201d came our chorus.\nShe continued, \u201cOK and when I talk about you in what I\u2019m about to say I don\u2019t actually mean you personally \u2013 I mean your generation. OK?\u201d\n\u201cYes ... \u201d\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re wrecking the world for my generation. The world is more unsafe than when you were kids, more and more species are going extinct, there are more refugees and the world is meaner to them, there are more wars, there\u2019s more terrorism and more racism and you haven\u2019t stopped climate change. No offence \u2013 but it\u2019s true. You\u2019re ruining the world.\u201d\nSign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday\nFor good measure she also threw in something about being priced out of the housing market.\nIt\u2019s impossible to overstate quite how devastating this was.\nDevastating \u2013 because it\u2019s mostly true. Those of us gen Xers in our early to mid-50s inhabit a world that is vastly more dangerous and uncertain than the one we were bequeathed. Us gen X men were the first generation since federation not to be forced or urged to go to war. We all had free tertiary education, stable government, a strong national and global economy, reasonable job prospects and security and, despite ridiculous interest rates in the mid-1980s, every prospect of owning our own homes.\nIn the 1980s our chief global concern was nuclear Armageddon at the tail end of the cold war. Today the daily threat might be China, Iran or North Korea, with the constant, of course, given the bellicosity and unpredictability of Trump, always America. Many Australian conservatives let slip much about their fears of a Trump White House as the beast roared on its way up \u2013 his hatred of women and minorities, his temperamental unsuitability, in short all of the things our children so easily identified and empathetically condemned as they would the schoolyard bully. My daughter and her friends talk of Trump constantly as a present and future threat to their world.\nMeanwhile, toxic nationalism, in Australia and elsewhere, is more potent than it has been since the world wars, manifesting here in even greater oppression and marginalisation of Indigenous people, and the political vilification of asylum seekers and their banishment to earthy hell. The militarisation of Australian history and culture continues apace at the expense of gentler, more thoughtful forms of patriotism.\nTerrorism was frightening for us, though largely in the abstract \u2013 a thing that mostly happened elsewhere, and quite rarely, rather than the global and domestic threat it is for our kids. It did not cross our minds when we boarded a plane, attended a big public event \u2013 or walked through a mall in the city.\nThe early science was there for us on climate change and ozone depletion. Governments needed little convincing of their reality and had begun to act. The change was not deliberately contorted, like today, as a matter of belief (despite the science) that divides politics, media and society \u2013 and delivers a status quo of stalemate between enlightenment and darkness that bequeaths to our young bleaching reefs, vanishing species and rising sea levels.\nSome parents go to great lengths to shield their children from the worst realities of the world \u2013 war, famine, the threat of global warming, toxic racism, terrorism. We\u2019d never tried \u2013 or wanted \u2013 to do that. The days have always began and ended in our homes with radio news and current affairs. There have always (until recently) been daily newspapers, and family conversation has inevitably included a fair amount of domestic and geopolitics. We wanted to raise informed, socially and politically engaged, and caring, young people.\nWe have tried, as parents and as people engaged with the world, who want to make it and this country better, to argue our causes. Some days there are wins. Others, it feels like progress is stuck in a morass beyond our control, at the whim of those at the very top of the power tree.\nI inherited a better world, indeed, a better Australia, than my mother and father. But were I gone tomorrow, I doubt my kids would say the same about their parents.\nBut I\u2019m not done yet \u2013 and I heard everything Number Two Daughter said in the car that day. The one thing I did not hear was any hint of fear. She sounded defiant and courageous. But never afraid. Perhaps that\u2019s one of the things we did get right.\n\u2022 Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-security-and-counter-terrorism", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "I inherited a better world than my parents did.

Carbon pricing mechanisms are proving to be essential elements of the toolkits [to meet the commitments made in the Paris agreement].\u201d\nDirk Forrister, chief executive of the International Emissions Trading Association, told the Guardian the report showed \u201cwidespread interest in using pricing systems to meet the Paris goals\u201d. He said: \u201cThe market is beginning to accelerate. We anticipate a major role for China and the market for international aviation [which when operational from 2020 will] more than double the amount of carbon subject to market pricing.\u201d\nIn addition to the national carbon markets across the world, there are more than 20 that have been set up at a regional level.\nIf taxes on carbon are also included, the value of the world\u2019s carbon markets and carbon taxes is likely to be about $82bn this year, compared with $52bn in 2017, according to the World Bank report.\nCarbon pricing has long been considered a key way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and numerous efforts have been made to develop markets where organisations can trade \u201crights\u201d to produce carbon, with an overall cap on the allocation of rights ensuring emissions are limited.\nEconomists consider carbon trading, which was enshrined in the Kyoto protocol of 1997, an efficient tool to encourage businesses to cut their greenhouse gases in the most cost-effective ways, but the problem has been that governments \u2013 the main creators of carbon markets \u2013 have been unwilling to impose costs on their industries. As a result, the caps on carbon have usually been too weak and the resulting price of carbon too low to generate a strong signal to the markets.\nCarbon markets are also supposed to benefit developing countries, as under UN systems rich countries can buy credits from poor countries that have instituted protections for their forests, or other ways to reduce greenhouse gases.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-offset-projects", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-tax", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Development of major new markets in China and reforms in Europe have provided a crucial boost as countries look at tools to cut carbon and meet their Paris climate targets", "date_published": {"$date": 1526976049000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1526986865000}, "authors": ["Fiona Harvey"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Paris climate agreement", "Carbon offsetting", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Environment", "Carbon tax", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/22/carbon-markets-back-from-the-brink-of-collapse-says-world-bank", "og:description": "Development of major new markets in China and reforms in Europe have provided a crucial boost as countries look at tools to cut carbon and meet their Paris climate targets", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/020d0e70ac56ffb72b6cf8ff7157cf116d7cfd08/0_135_2896_1738/master/2896.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=6d7fbab3587e6cfecfcfbd6d7be8adf3", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Carbon markets back from the brink of collapse, says World Bank"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/020d0e70ac56ffb72b6cf8ff7157cf116d7cfd08/0_135_2896_1738/master/2896.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3e1ecb1b0efebc4b480eeef0f2057e60", "width": "2896", "height": "1738", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/020d0e70ac56ffb72b6cf8ff7157cf116d7cfd08/0_135_2896_1738/master/2896.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=97fb2c3782fbc3e5b0c9f909eb63005f", "description": "An activist pushes a giant ball with the words, \u2018toxic tonnes\u2019 during a protest over carbon pricing reforms outside the European Parliament in Brussels.\nPhotograph: Fran\u00e7ois Lenoir/Reuters"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07e43a2c3613145ed8e61"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/24/canada-polar-bears-labrador-rigolet-seal-hunt", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Guido Rich, 28, an Inuit hunter from Rigolet, Labrador, brings his Ski-Doo to a careful stop on the sea ice, mindful of the precious cargo it hauls: the body of an 800lb male polar bear. It takes Rich and two other men to roll the animal off the sled and on to the ice, while his wife and young children watch.\nHis sister, Natasha Pottle, who shot the bear the night before, hands her brother the plastic bags used to store liver, hair and fat samples that will be sent away for lab testing. The animal will provide valuable information for Labrador\u2019s biologists, a small windfall for his family and meat for the community. Rich has barely begun cutting into the hide when a parade of people from the village start arriving to take pictures, offer observations or just watch respectfully.\n\u201cWhen you get a bear, everyone in town knows it,\u201d Rich said.\nScenes like this are being repeated up and down the rugged, remote coast this year. Despite vanishing sea ice and shorter, milder winters, Labrador\u2019s polar bear population is actually growing \u2013 which means a bigger harvesting quota for Inuit hunters.\nThere are more than 2,500 polar bears in the vast coastal area that includes Labrador and northern Quebec, according to Environment Canada \u2013 far more than was expected earlier in the millennium \u2013 and further signs the bears continue to rebound despite the impacts of climate change.\nIndeed, although scientists and Inuit sometimes clash over the estimates, the polar bear population of coastal Labrador is among the healthiest in the world.\nThey jumped on the harp seal boom ... we're seeing them further south than in the past\n\u201cWhen I grew up, a polar bear was kind of this mythical creature because you didn\u2019t see them very often. You didn\u2019t hear tell of people seeing them,\u201d said Jim Goudie, wildlife manager for Nunatsiavut, the regional indigenous self-government.\n\u201cThis abundance of polar bears is not something my father\u2019s generation grew up with. It\u2019s only since the mid-80s there\u2019s been the boom. Now there\u2019s polar bears everywhere.\u201d\nThe reason, biologists suspect, is the boom in the harp seal population. As Newfoundland\u2019s seal fishery has collapsed under international pressure, the harp seals of the north-west Atlantic have proliferated. They now number about 7.4 million animals \u2013 more then seven times the population in the 1970s.\nThat has created a veritable feast for Labrador\u2019s polar bears, who have shifted their diet from ring seals to their more southerly, promiscuous cousins.\n\u201cThey jumped on the harp seal boom,\u201d Goudie said. \u201cThey appear to have adapted for this moment in time \u2026 We\u2019re seeing them further south than in the past.\u201d\nLabrador\u2019s Inuit have hunted polar bears for thousands of years. But only recently have they been able to so carefully monitor and protect the population, thanks to a unique, indigenous-run conservation program managed by Nunatsiavut.\nThe bear shot by Pottle was one of 12 killed by Inuit hunters this season under Nunatsiavut\u2019s quota system, which doles out bear hunting licences through a lottery. A hunter has one week to get a bear before the licence expires and is transferred to another person. Only Inuit residents can apply for a licence, and it\u2019s illegal to sell a licence to a big game hunter who is not from the region.\nIn Inuit culture, a polar bear remains a deeply respected animal, called Nanuk in the Inuktitut language, and getting one is still considered the mark of a great hunter. The harvest remains such an important part of local tradition that it has its own statute in Nunatsiavut\u2019s land claim with the federal government.\nBut Pottle isn\u2019t putting on any airs. Shooting her first polar bear was a terrifying experience, she said.\n\u201cI was scared,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was intense. We chased the tracks out on to the ice and there he was. Then our Ski-Doo stalled and he started coming toward us. That\u2019s when I started calling for my brother.\u201d\nHer brother, carrying the rifle on his back, circled around to keep the animal at a safer distance. Then he handed the gun to Natasha and told her to shoot.\n\u201cShe was crying, and I said: \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 She said she\u2019s never going polar bear hunting again,\u201d he said. \u201cI said: \u2018It\u2019s your licence. You\u2019ve got to shoot it.\u2019\u201d\nThe bear meat will be divided up and shared among the region\u2019s community freezer program, which provides food for the elderly and others who can\u2019t hunt for themselves. Wasting the meat is prohibited by Nunatsiavut law. Failure to share the meat or submit samples for testing means a hunter can be banned for five years.\n\u201cSome people say it\u2019s our right. But I\u2019ve always viewed it as a privilege. We ask a lot of [hunters], but you\u2019re getting something that not every Canadian has the right to go out and do,\u201d said Goudie. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think Nunatsiavut leads not only Canada, but also the world, when it comes to conservation management and buy-in to our system.\u201d\nInuit hunters can sell a bear pelt for $4,000 to $5,000 to a local taxidermist, who will auction it off to buyers around the world. In previous decades, when the international market for pelts was booming, the same bearskin could fetch as much as $30,000. Under Nunatsiavut\u2019s program, a computer chip is embedded in the pelt to prove it was harvested through a legal hunt.\nMuch like the coastal Inuit themselves, the polar bear\u2019s world relies heavily on reliable, vast expanses of sea ice. As the region\u2019s sea ice vanishes because of warming oceans and milder winters, the bear has had to adapt. The animals appear to be thriving, but winter is becoming increasingly unpredictable.\nThe loss of sea ice has been dramatic, according to climatologist Robert Way. He points to the Canadian Ice Service historical database, which shows Nunatsiavut\u2019s northern region has lost about a third of its ice cover in the past decade.\nConservationists say the Nunatsiavut model is a lesson for other regions trying to manage their polar bear population. Goudie argues the Inuit, sometimes criticized by animal rights activists for allowing the bear hunt, have a vested interest in preserving the polar bears that live among them.\n\u201cFor Inuit, it would be like losing an entire piece of their culture,\u201d he said.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/americas", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/poles", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/animals", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Despite vanishing sea ice and shorter winters, Labrador\u2019s polar bear population is among the healthiest in the world \u2013 and it could be thanks to the harp seals", "date_published": {"$date": 1527148847000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1531948217000}, "authors": ["Greg Mercer"], "article_section": "World news", "article_tags": ["Canada", "Americas", "World news", "Polar regions", "Animals", "Environment", "Climate change"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/24/canada-polar-bears-labrador-rigolet-seal-hunt", "og:description": "Despite vanishing sea ice and shorter winters, Labrador\u2019s polar bear population is among the healthiest in the world \u2013 and it could be thanks to the harp seals", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07fbe70cc3a40dc90ecfa64beed2eba98b37fb57/0_219_5120_3074/master/5120.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=e31bdcef5eacc1c4f9d7d0fa1647f954", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "'They're everywhere': has the decline of the seal hunt saved the polar bear?"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07fbe70cc3a40dc90ecfa64beed2eba98b37fb57/0_219_5120_3074/master/5120.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c3bdcd5c681a33515e3f586b5394a2d5", "width": "5120", "height": "3074", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07fbe70cc3a40dc90ecfa64beed2eba98b37fb57/0_219_5120_3074/master/5120.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72b41dddca87cbc244bcdd2ffe8fadfc", "description": "There are more than 2,500 polar bears in the coastal area that includes Labrador and northern Quebec, according to Environment Canada.\nPhotograph: Danita Delimont/Getty Images/Gallo Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf9f5dbdc0a77792260a66d56b30331af07be492/0_71_5102_3063/master/5102.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=93e72527089a38a736276cca2d5f6b4e", "width": "5102", "height": "3063", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf9f5dbdc0a77792260a66d56b30331af07be492/0_71_5102_3063/master/5102.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=249446db4426b2ed4fe788b99a152761", "description": "In Inuit culture, a polar bear remains a deeply respected animal, called Nanuk in the Inuktitut language, and getting one is considered the mark of a great hunter.

For one thing, traditionally they've used pretty much every part of the animal, and they've also hunted in defence.\nSecondly, the argument that Inuit should be allowed to continue hunting references their culture long before present day, not just \"now\", and as the 2nd paragraph of your linked article points out:\nBQSTART\nInuit have hunted polar bears as an element of their overall set of ecological relations for millennia with this hunting (see Nelson 1970; Robbe 1975; Wenzel 1981) being conducted for spiritual-cultural reasons and to contribute to the traditional food economy.\nBQEND\nIn other words, it pretty much says that polar bear is part of their diet and has been for a long long time, and (if you look into it) eating polar bear is not just about calories but has a community/cultural/spiritual dimension.\nAnd whilst the document does go on to point out that the subsistence role of polar bears changed \"in the last 50 years or so\" to include some sports hunting, it rebuts your apparent view and the objection based on it (as I read it in comments you made elsewhere) that polar bear hunting was not a significant part of a cultural - or culinary - tradition at any time in Inuit history, so we can dispense with that line of argument.\nThe document does discuss present day (up to about the year 2000) sport hunting and social and economic factors that have motivated more of it since about 1970, which seems more relevant to your position. You can argue that sports hunting should not be allowed, and I had a lot more sympathy with that position before I talked to the polar bear tour guides - who you'd think of all people would object, but they accept it, given the cultural significance of bear hunting and the resulting use of the animal, and the realities of living in the far north. \nHowever, more importantly, you also appear to conclude that this document supports your key claim that the Inuit don't coexist with nature as part of an ecologically functioning community, but I'm not sure that follows either, at least not as most people would interpret the term \"ecologically functioning community\" which would probably indicate living in such a fashion as to maintain the local ecosystem in a reasonably ecologically-sustainable fashion (and which the government-managed harvest scheme appears to be attempting to do).\nSo when you say \"ecologically functioning community\" here, do you intend to imply \"not aided by a single drop of oil\", which you clarified elsewhere was intended to be understood when you use the term \"sustainable\"? Or, since you say:\nBQSTART\nIt's all about the MONEY.\nBQEND\n...do you mean something like \"without using money as a medium of exchange for any resource obtained from the ecosystem, or for any tools used for obtaining said resources\"?\nIf so, it seems a bit rich if not outright hypocritical to be complaining that the Inuit don't get to adopt money in their culture, or should drop or decline to evolve millennia-old elements of their culture because they can make money from it, when you and I and all of our fellow readers are living in Western capitalist (it's all about the MONEY!) societies that have a much bigger negative impact on the earth's ecosystems.\nBQSTART\nThe historical record shows the commercial exploitation of any species always results in diminished biodiversity.\nBQEND\nThis is probably the crux of one of your arguments, but I think it's a dubious assertion. A well-run management scheme for even a commercially exploited species can definitely maintain biodiversity levels that would otherwise diminish (e.g. fisheries management schemes that stepped in to prevent total collapse).\nSo the effect of bear harvest management scheme on biodiversity must depend on how it operates. Do you have any evidence that the management scheme has led to, is leading to or must lead to diminished biodiversity? I'm not saying there is none, but a brief look at how the management scheme operates suggests diminishment isn't an obvious outcome.\nCertainly as climate change gets worse, the harvests for some populations will have to drop rapidly towards zero so the scheme's settings/policy must be dynamic.

Perhaps you meant \"a normal source\".\nEven then, it doesn't necessarily follow that a culture that hunts polar bears results in polar bears being shy of people, especially if successful hunts weren't all that common, or (as I seem to recall you suggesting elsewhere) if polar bears are rather difficult to hunt with traditional hunting equipment, or (as you suggest further down in your comment) polar bears see humans as a food source.\nBQSTART\n...how is that significant in hunting Polar bear...\nBQEND\nYou appear to have rapidly forgotten that it was your own claim that it was a myth that the Inuit hunted polar bears with weapons such as bows and arrows, a claim that you disparaged on the basis of, and I quote:\nBQSTART\n[were [sic] would they get the wood from?]\nBQEND\nI pointed out that your incredulity (a) betrayed a lack of easily obtainable knowledge which indicates that your opinions are not well grounded in evidence, and (b) doesn't contribute to the attempt to debunk the myth because they had access to wood.\nBQSTART\nAccusing someone of not knowing anything without any evidence proving them wrong is hardly a reasoned argument...\nBQEND\nThe evidence of a low level of understanding (not your misquote of \"not knowing anything\") is in my earlier comment, and elaborated upon in this one (e.g. in my previous paragraph). I'm not sure how much more I can do to help you grok it.\nBQSTART\nI believe we are approaching this from an entirely different angle.\nBQEND\nThat seems likely. Your issue appears to have changed from the culture practice of polar bear hunting to some other concern, and your communications about the issue don't seem all that coherent, at least when you try to apply it to justify disapproval of polar bear hunts. \nAnd that other concern doesn't seem to be used consistently either, as it applies much more strongly to the non-sustainability to the entirety of Western civilisation which is responsible for the vast majority of humanity's drawing down of natural resources at a rate faster than the ecosphere can replenish them.", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "116240868", "causal_relations": [{"cause": null, "effect": "polar bears being shy of people"}]}, {"id": "116274088", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1527375897000}, "author": "Lotharsson", "author_id": "14463693", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nYou haven't been through the evidence because i am certain that you cannot understand it.\nBQEND\nAs I said before, with denialists it's always projection, not to mention unsubstantiated (and often highly dubious) assertion.

There were no banks or shops in the arctic back then.\nBQSTART\nAND we insist upon a rigid definition of \"self-sufficient\" that we typically don't require elsewhere.\nBQEND\nMy definition of self sufficient is a *sustainable living without raising/relying on a single drop of oil from the earth.

What you seem to fail to acknowledge is the Polar Bear has probably been there for well over a Million years. If polar bears were the normal source of food for the Inuit they would be much shyer around people. eg. See the relationship between Lions & Maasai. \nBQSTART\nYou appear to be backing your own lack of knowledge\nBQEND\nSo they had some access to wood from pioneer species shrubs & small trees in the form of driftwood how is that significant in hunting Polar bear they could have made weapons from bone & tusk. a small point taken out of context. Nothing suspect about it because my comments are a theory i didn't make any claims to be an expert. Its called a discussion but i see you like most, so called \"experts\" don't seem able to have reasonable civil discussions without being rude & arrogant. What I am certain of is that they did not find plywood or rifles washed up on the beach, your paper asserts most of the wood was valued as fire wood. There is no mention that the supply was enough to make shelters from it.\nBQSTART\nThe Inuit culture has a respect for the ecosphere that you fail to account for when you assert that their culture \"doesn't meet that obligation to the natural world\".\nBQEND\nI believe that depends on your perspective & criteria used to measure it. when you were in Churchill did you see any motor vehicles? electricity? Commercial products? gas? Nylon Clothing? Runways? Roads? I believe we are approaching this from an entirely different angle. I have no doubt the Inuit culture has a deep respect & reverence for the natural world & how it once provided them the nutrition & warmth they required. Lets not confuse their ancient culture with how they live in 2018.\nBQSTART\nAgain, it might be worth acquiring more knowledge before drawing inferences from a low level of understanding.\nBQEND\nAccusing someone of not knowing anything without any evidence proving them wrong is hardly a reasoned argument, disprove my assertions. Please provide the evidence that Polar Bears were regularly hunted by Inuit since they have inhabited the region. I \"suspect\" [note i have used this term through out] early bear kills would have resulted in human bear conflict, polar bears are predators they do see humans as prey. Most likely the bears came to the people not the other way round. I look forward to your evidence contesting this theory.\nAgain you have made a subjective defensive stance for the Inuit simply out of your own belief system. If ANY culture or race of people can live within the rules of the natural world, they have my deepest respect & admiration & present us all a model we should all emulate. But that requires non use of oil or modern technology. Since before man discovered fossil fuels as a source of energy we have been depleting the earths resources much faster than it can ever possibly be replenished.\n*Sustainable, living a lifestyle that enables nature to replenish the ecosystem at the same rate that resources are used. there are probably only a few isolated groups of Homo sapiens that are doing so in 2018.

However according to the self proclaimed polar bear expert Susan Crockford (a controversial individual who's expertise is unrecognized in the rest of the polar bear biologist circles) asserts many thousands of polar bears were culled through out the 1800's. In fact the so called self sufficient Inuit (whom everyone presumes are hunters & receive no assistance from the outside world) traded with fur traders in the late/early 1800's/1900's.\nSo that debunks the myth the Inuit are traditional self sufficient hunters, hunting only for food & that they used spears & bows & arrows [were would they get the wood from?].\nIncidentally how do you get close to a polar bear that is being hunted they can out run you, out pace you & smell you from 20 miles away so if they want to avoid you they will. I would also suggest any species that is hunted frequently quickly becomes shy around humans, so a polar bear being tracked by traditional Inuit with noisy sled dogs are probably very capable of avoiding hunters who would if using traditional weapons made from bone unlikely to get close enough to a bear to hit it with a spear. I suspect bear hunts were few & far between before the Inuit were supplied with rifles.\nIt would be erroneous to assume hunting with rifles is quick clean & painless the death of course relies entirely on the marksmanship of the hunter. I wouldn't want to attract criticism from people assuming i am anti Inuit or against indigenous cultural lifestyles i very much respect those that can make a sustainable living within natures balance, but trading in animal parts for modern technological conveniences isnt in any form sustainable or traditional.\nThe lifestyles of those living in the frozen tundra of north canada is a lifestyle choice which benefits from all the luxuries modern technology can provide but exploiting the natural world in much the same manner every other culture does, its not sustainable & Polar bears being the apex predator long before The Inuit people existed does not need human control other than that humans are intimidated by them. Polar bears do not have \"natural\" predators including Man.\nThere are many comments below defending the Inuits way of life, the majority the typical Hunting fraternity with right wing political views on freedom to kill wildlife. I myself am very much an advocate for personal freedoms but with those rights we are obliged to take responsibility for our own actions. Killing because its your cultures tradition doesn't meet that obligation we have the to the natural world. especially when we have taken so much from it already in the past.\nIts time we started paying back, that means some compromise on our part & a little discipline the modern Inuit way of life is unsustainable probably more so than most because of the distance their modern conveniences have to travel.", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "116201274", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "its your cultures tradition does n't meet that obligation", "effect": "killing we have the to the natural world"}, {"cause": "the distance their modern conveniences have to travel", "effect": "the modern inuit way of life is unsustainable probably more so than most"}]}, {"id": "116221288", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1527253634000}, "author": "TimMellor", "author_id": "10884951", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "If only all meat had such regulations!

Water, certainly, but also tiny particles known as \u201caerosols\u201d. Whether they originate from wildfires, volcanoes, sandstorms, ship emissions or power stations, aerosols alter the properties of a cloud. By providing a surface for water to condense on to, they can help water droplets to form. But exactly how aerosols alter clouds is not clear. Now a new satellite study is helping scientists to see inside a cloud.\nNicolas Bellouin, from the University of Reading, and colleagues compared ordinary satellite images of clouds with infrared images. Clouds that appear plain white in ordinary images contain different shades and patterns when viewed in infrared. From wildfires in Siberia to volcanoes erupting on the Pacific islands of Vanuatu, and the trail of smoke from power stations in northern England, Bellouin and his colleagues show that polluted clouds tend to redistribute the same amount of water over a greater number of droplets. Their findings are published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.\nThis observation contrasts with some climate models, which indicate that increasing aerosols should help clouds to become \u201cwetter\u201d by increasing their capacity to hold water. The findings also suggest that climate models are overestimating the ability of aerosols to offset global warming.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/pollution", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/meteorology", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "New findings contrast with some climate models that indicate aerosols make clouds \u2018wetter\u2019", "date_published": {"$date": 1527539403000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1527541213000}, "authors": ["Kate Ravilious"], "article_section": "UK news", "article_tags": ["UK weather", "Pollution", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Environment", "Science", "UK news", "Meteorology"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/28/weatherwatch-pollution-can-make-clouds-drier", "og:description": "New findings contrast with some climate models that indicate aerosols make clouds \u2018wetter\u2019", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/beccf7a0a20132add559460f5441a8c198cb5141/0_1_1196_718/master/1196.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=c0833b0401e068f44788261f34e0e3bb", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Weatherwatch: pollution can make clouds drier"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/beccf7a0a20132add559460f5441a8c198cb5141/0_1_1196_718/master/1196.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e2124d3afc1371a6f5153e9e7633fe80", "width": "1196", "height": "718", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/beccf7a0a20132add559460f5441a8c198cb5141/0_1_1196_718/master/1196.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=00781f47198f0bf029919ec1d38b4774", "description": "True colour image taken by Nasa\u2019s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Modis) over Vanavara, central Russia.\nPhotograph: Nasa Worldview"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14b0c6eae7898ce87e09bb4bf3fb2c9963ff2913/0_1_1196_718/master/1196.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ba4d77aae966d6647651b15d1cc8c9ae", "width": "1196", "height": "718", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14b0c6eae7898ce87e09bb4bf3fb2c9963ff2913/0_1_1196_718/master/1196.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=77b4f2bbe73a94134e03ce2162be2542", "description": "The same image as above of clouds over Vanavara, central Russia, taken using a near-infrared wavelength.

It was stained black, as if someone had ladled tar over its bark. In February, the temperature had dropped below freezing for three hours, killing the limb. The thick leaves had shriveled and fallen away, exposing the green avocados, which then burned in the sun. Sayer estimated he\u2019d lost one out of every 20 avocados on his farm in Ventura, just 50 miles north of Los Angeles, but he counts himself lucky.\n\u201cIf that freeze was one degree colder, or one hour longer, we would have had major damage,\u201d he said.\nAvocado trees start to die when the temperature falls below 28F (-2C) or rises above 100F (38F). If the weather turns cold and clammy during the short period in the spring when the flowers bloom, bees won\u2019t take to the air and fruits won\u2019t develop. The trees also die if water runs dry, or if too many salts accumulate in the soil, or if a new pest starts chewing on its leaves. \u201cAll of which is quite possible in the next few decades, as the climate shifts,\u201d Sayer said.\nThe weather had been strange lately, Sayer told me. In the past year, Californians have lived through a historic drought, a massive wildfire that blotted out the sun and a strangely warm winter followed by that unseasonable freeze. When I visited in April, his lemon trees were already loaded with ripe fruit \u2013 that usually doesn\u2019t happen until June. \u201cThings are screwy,\u201d Sayer said.\nThe trees are totally confused\nFrom the vineyards of the north coast to the orange groves of southern California, farmers like Sayer have been reeling from the weird weather.\n\u201cWe are already suffering the effects of climate change,\u201d said Russ Lester, who grows walnuts at Dixon Ridge Farms, east of Sacramento. \u201cI can look out my window and see trees that don\u2019t have a leaf on them and others that are completely leafed out.\n\u201cThe trees are totally confused.\u201d\nIt might feel like we\u2019re peering into the distant future when we hear that by 2050, temperatures may very well climb four degrees, seas could rise a foot and droughts and floods will become more common. But for farmers planting trees they hope will bear fruit 25 years from now, that seemingly distant future has to be reckoned with now.\nA lot of the country\u2019s tree crops grow in California, which produces two-thirds of the fruits and nuts for the United States. The same is true of grapevines, which bear abundant fruit for about 25 years (they slow down after that, but can keep going for hundreds of years). It\u2019s in large part because so many farmers are making these long-term gambles on orchard crops that a recent scientific paper noted: \u201cAgricultural production in California is highly sensitive to climate change.\u201d\nJay Famiglietti, the senior water scientist at Nasa\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, goes even further: \u201cIt\u2019s a virtual certainty that California will get drier. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a climate that\u2019s conducive to orchard crops anymore.\u201d\nIn other words, for anyone trying to make money off long-lived crops, climate change is already here. And yet new saplings are pushing out of the ground all over the state.\nIf these farmers were planting an annual crop, like cilantro, they\u2019d be making a bet on the weather for the next 45 days. But they\u2019re planting trees, which means making a bet on the next 40 years.\nAfter years of putting it off, Sayer is about to place such a four-decade bet by planting a bunch of new avocado trees. There\u2019s no way Sayer can foresee oncoming climate disaster, if that\u2019s what\u2019s hurtling toward the land his family has worked for the past 130 years in Ventura. He can see just a little bit of what might be coming \u2013 as if he\u2019s straining to glimpse signs of danger while blinkered. When I asked him how it felt, he said: \u201cLike I\u2019m about to cross a very busy road with my hood pulled over my head.\u201d\nWhen Katherine Jarvis-Shean was a doctoral candidate researching the decline of cold winters a few years back, she thought more farmers should be freaking out. \u201cI used to think, \u2018Why aren\u2019t you guys more worried about this? It\u2019s going to be the end of the world.\u2019\u201d\nAfter all, many fruit and nut trees require a good winter chill to bear fruit. But after spending a few years as an extension agent for the University of California \u2013 working directly with farmers and translating science into techniques they can apply on the land \u2013 she understands better. It comes down to this: farmers have a ton of concerns, and the climate is just one of them.\n\u201cIf you decide what to plant based on climate, but then can\u2019t make the lease payment, that\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d Jarvis-Shean said.\nIf you are worried about water running out in 15 years, you might think it\u2019s a good idea to cut down half the state\u2019s almond groves \u2013 but if those almond trees are still putting money in your pockets, that wouldn\u2019t make sense until the killer drought hits. That\u2019s the crux of the matter for Sayer, and other farmers I interviewed. They\u2019re concerned about the changing climate, but they always come up with ingenious plans to adapt to bad weather. It\u2019s much harder for them to adapt to an overdrawn bank account.\nThey would grow in any postapocalyptic hellscape you could imagine\nSayer grows mostly lemons right now, but they\u2019re not long for this world. \u201cYou can see these lemon trees are getting a little rangy looking,\u201d Sayer said, gesturing toward a leafless branch. \u201cThis is going to be their last harvest, then they\u2019ve got a date with the chipper.\u201d\nSayer knows lemons. He knows how to coddle them in old age, how to nudge them to produce more, how to keep them alive when rains fail, how to protect them from aphids, and snails, and scale insects, and the nematodes in the ground. But this land has provided a home to a citrus orchard for 70 years, and each year more pests accumulate to suck the life from the trees. So Sayer needs to move on from lemons, and he\u2019s settled on avocados.\nFrom a climate perspective, the leather-skinned fruit are a risky choice. Avocado trees like their surroundings not too hot and not too cold, and they always need water. One study estimated that climate change would hurt California avocado trees so much that the state\u2019s production could be cut in half by 2050.\nAs the sun burned off the marine layer of clouds over the orchard, Sayer patiently laid out the reasoning that led him to plant avocado trees. He explained that climate poses risks that are easy for outsiders to see \u2013 when you\u2019re reading about historic droughts in the newspaper and driving past acres of withered crops, it seems crazy to plant orchards. But farmers often have to contend with other risks that outweigh the danger of bad weather. Sayers puts them into three categories: climate risk, market risk and execution risk.\nIf he were only worried about climate risk, Sayer said, he\u2019d plant prickly pear. \u201cThey would grow in any postapocalyptic hellscape you could imagine,\u201d he said. But who would buy them? Most Americans don\u2019t put prickly pear on their shopping lists. So there\u2019s a huge market risk.\nThen there\u2019s execution risk: the chance that Sayer screws things up. If he didn\u2019t have to worry about that, Sayer might follow his neighbor\u2019s lead and start growing annual crops. He pointed across the road from his farm, where orchards once stood, at a flat expanse of strawberries dotted with hustling pickers. There\u2019s always an appetite for strawberries so they pose a low market risk. And because strawberries get planted every year, they\u2019re not such a big gamble on the changing climate. If a freak storm kills everything growing in Ventura, for instance, Sayer\u2019s neighbor would lose that year\u2019s strawberry crop while Sayer would lose a 30-year avocado investment.\nSmoothies, toast, ice cream, you name it \u2013 that consumption has increased sevenfold since 2000\nBut the execution risk of switching to strawberries \u2013 figuring out how to grow them, buying the right equipment and learning how to sell them \u2013 is too high for him. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about years of learning,\u201d Sayer said. \u201cIt would be like me deciding to go back to college to study medicine.\u201d He\u2019s 52, and not prepared to start fresh.\nSayer has one other option that would eliminate all the climate, market, and execution risks: Pave his farmland and build houses. When I visited in April, workers were constructing apartments on what used to be farmland at the end of his street. If more farmers start taking climate risks seriously, a surge of subdivisions could start sprawling across some of the most fertile farmland on the planet. But the thought of that saddens Sayer. He wants to farm.\nAfter weighing all those risks, he decided to bet the farm on avocados. These trees are no climate savior \u2013 far from it. But Sayer been experimenting with them for decades and understands how they work. He knows he can sell avocados, because he\u2019s tapped into a network that reserves spots for the fruit in every grocery store, and turns sunburned avocados into frozen guacamole. Also, you might have noticed the market is strong: Americans are chowing down so much avocado tonnage in new, creative ways \u2013 smoothies, toast, ice cream, you name it \u2013 that consumption has increased sevenfold since 2000.\nOrchards can endure weird weather brought on by climate change, but if they don\u2019t get any water, the trees will die. In the past, California farmers have always survived droughts by sticking deeper and deeper straws into the ground to suck up groundwater. But since 2014, the state has had a law against depleting aquifers, and farmers soon won\u2019t be able to take out more water than goes in.\nThat policy alarms growers, especially since they can no longer depend on snow in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Mountains hold water \u2013 in the form of glaciers \u2013 through the colder months, then release it during the warmer months. But as the climate heats up, more of the precipitation that fell in California as snow will turn to rain. That means more floods in winter and more droughts in summer.\nTo adapt to this boom-and-bust cycle, a few farmers around California are letting swollen rivers spill into their orchards. If carried out on a large scale, this would slow down rushing flood waters and let them percolate into aquifers.\nAfter four years of experimentation in almond groves, scientists have found that this inundation hasn\u2019t hurt the trees. They\u2019ve also identified nearly 700,000 acres under almond trees suitable for recharging groundwater, said Richard Waycott, president of the Almond Board of California. At the same time, growers continue to use less freshwater for irrigation and draw more water recycled from city drainpipes.\nIt looked like someone had irradiated the place with toxic chemicals\nIn another example of climate adaptation, farmers are developing a kind of hyper-local climate engineering, spraying clay dust over their trees to create shade and cool them down in unseasonably hot weather, according to David Zilberman, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. Elsewhere, scientists have planted a pistachio orchard where no self-respecting pistachio farmer would ever put a tree: in the middle of the southern California desert near Coachella.\nMost pistachio trees grow 200 miles north, where colder winters allow them to settle into their natural cycles. But in a few decades, that traditional pistachio land could have the climate of Coachella. It\u2019s a type of time travel; the idea is to find a version of the future that already exists.\nThe pistachio trees aren\u2019t at all happy in the desert: \u201cIt\u2019s just terrible out there,\u201d said Craig Kallsen, another extension agent for the University of California. \u201cIt looked like someone had irradiated the place with toxic chemicals.\u201d\nAll the same, a few pistachio trees are beginning to produce leaves. By growing this orchard in this analogue of the climate future, researchers like Kallsen can see which varieties stand up to heat, and then zero in on the genes that allow those trees to adapt. Using those genes, researchers hope to breed trees that can thrive in a hotter, drier world.\nSayer is also adapting by growing different varieties of avocados, but the most visible climate adaptation in the orchard was the knee-high carpet of grasses and turnip stems we waded through as we made our way among the trees.\n\u201cBack in the 1970s, bare dirt between the rows was considered clean and tidy,\u201d Sayer said. \u201cIf you had a blade of grass sticking out, oh man, that wasn\u2019t good.\u201d\nLetting plants grow beneath the trees seemed like a squalid, lazy, weed-spreading hazard. When he and his father first began planting between the rows in 2005, it felt taboo. Other farmers would sidle up to them at the coffee shop and ask in an undertone: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with your orchard? Is that a cover crop?\u201d\nA cover crop protects the soil from heavy rains and helps turn it into a habitat for worms, beetles and thousands of microbes. As we walked through the dappled sunlight, the ground beneath my feet was yielding like a giant sponge.\nSayer has calculated that, since first planting the cover crop, his lemon orchard can absorb 2.5m gallons more water in a downpour. \u201cSince every scenario I\u2019ve seen involves water stress, better soil is going to put us in a better position, because it holds and absorbs more rain,\u201d he said.\nBetter soil is going to put us in a better position\nLester, the Sacramento-area walnut grower, also plants cover crops. And he has an audacious justification for planting new trees: He hopes to reverse climate change.\nCover crops pull carbon from the air into the soil and \u2013 if we can figure it out \u2013 all of agriculture could become a giant carbon dioxide sponge. Lester powers his operation with solar panels and a walnut shell burning furnace (releasing carbon his walnut trees recently sucked out of the air), making his farm carbon negative.\n\u201cCall me optimistic, but I believe if all farmers adopted healthy soils technology, agriculture can play a huge role in stopping, slowing down, maybe even reversing climate change,\u201d Lester said.\nNot all farmers are as scientifically literate as Lester or Sayer; many shrug off climate change as just another shift in the weather. But even the ones who readily accept the science of climate change continue to plant trees. Perhaps they are overly optimistic. Perhaps they are just human: it\u2019s not in our nature to ignore threats right in front of our face so we can focus on those in the seemingly far-off future.\nAgriculture can play a huge role in stopping, slowing down, maybe even reversing climate change\nAfter I\u2019d spent the day with Sayer, his decision to plant more avocados made sense: It\u2019s the choice that allows him to keep farming. He\u2019s making preparations based on the best climate projections he can get, while also setting himself up to react to the unexpected. He can see a path to profitability, though he allows that his vision into the future \u2013 in terms of both climate and weather forecasting \u2013 is severely restricted.\nIf you recall, he likened planting a new round of avocado trees to crossing a busy road with a hood over his head. There was a second part to that analogy: \u201cAt least I know which way to look for the oncoming traffic.\u201d\nNathanael Johnson is a senior writer at Grist and the author of two books, Unseen City: The Majesty of Pigeons, the Discreet Charm of Snails &amp; Other Wonders of the Urban Wilderness, and All Natural*: *A Skeptic\u2019s Quest to Discover If the Natural Approach to Diet, Childbirth, Healing, and the Environment Really Keeps Us Healthier and Happier.

The sea will continue to rise and the question now is whether they will be replaced by open water. I think they will.\n\u201cThe outlook is pretty grim. What\u2019s mind boggling is that we are facing the inundation of south Florida this century.\u201d\nMangroves are made up of coastal vegetation that grows in salty or brackish water. They are considered crucial buffers to storms and salt water intrusion, as well as key habitats for certain marine creatures.\nUsing aerial photographs, satellite imagery and sediment cores, FIU researchers found that mangroves just south of Miami were migrating westwards over marshland at a rate of about 100ft a year until they were halted by the L-31E levee, a flood barrier in Miami-Dade county, where they are now making their last stand. \nPrevious research has suggested the same phenomenon has happened in other parts of south Florida, making the region more vulnerable to storms, such as Hurricane Irma, which swept up Florida last year, and land loss as the sea rises further.\nOf particular concern is the future of the Everglades, the vast marsh, mangrove and pine flatwoods wilderness that provides a home to threatened species such as the manatee, American crocodile and Florida panther.\nThe Everglades, known as the \u201criver of grass\u201d, was long nourished by fresh water flowing slowly from marshes, lakes and rivers to the north. \nHowever, the ecosystem has shrunk by around half since a network of canals and dams were built over the past century to divert water for agriculture and to build homes. Swaths of the Everglades have been drained to accommodate a booming human population \u2013 more than 6 million people now live in south Florida.\nA restoration plan to divert water back to the Everglades has been backed by Congress but the area now faces the existential problem of sea level rise, which is connected to climate change. The oceans are rising rapidly at the largely flat south Florida coastline, around three times faster than the global average. Salt water is entering the Everglades from the coast and from underground aquifers. \n\u201cYou can restore the plumbing of the Everglades but the question is whether that will be enough,\u201d Parkinson said. \u201cIf you have a healthy patient, it will have a higher probability of survival if they are exposed to a virus. The Everglades isn\u2019t a healthy patient, it faces a lot of threats. \n\u201cWe are at a tipping point. Sea level rise could be more than 20mm [o.79in] a year by the end of the century and there\u2019s no way our coastal habitats will keep pace with anything more than 10mm a year.\u201d\nDr Stephen Davis, a wetland ecologist at the Everglades Foundation who was not involved in the FIU study, said the work illustrates the problems that researchers have witnessed in south Florida in recent years.\n\u201cThere will still be some mangroves in south Florida but areas will collapse into open water bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cUnabated sea level rise will continue to eat away at the marshes. We should do everything we can to help restore the Everglades to reduce its vulnerability.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/plants", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oceans", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The \u2018river of grass\u2019 wilderness and coastal communities are in peril, with the buffer coastal ecosystems on a \u2018death march\u2019 inland", "date_published": {"$date": 1525272730000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1525357251000}, "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Sea level", "Florida", "Environment", "Climate change", "US news", "World news", "Plants", "Oceans"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/02/mangroves-everglades-florida-rising-sea-level", "og:description": "The \u2018river of grass\u2019 wilderness and coastal communities are in peril, with the buffer coastal ecosystems on a \u2018death march\u2019 inland", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aa528b19e5ae9b858e4a3dd27e317df76d70c90/0_343_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=2f362d30d7556b785361123efa3722f2", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Everglades under threat as Florida's mangroves face death by rising sea level"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aa528b19e5ae9b858e4a3dd27e317df76d70c90/0_343_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eb95a996eb405cd4730ce0aa0160ff4d", "width": "5150", "height": "3090", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aa528b19e5ae9b858e4a3dd27e317df76d70c90/0_343_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f21d5f6ed4c73a2655ff0092deedf821", "description": "The Everglades wilderness has already been reduced by half by the construction of dams and canals and to accommodate a booming population.\nPhotograph: Getty Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dae651a5395092d56a3dbf70ab5c145121553c56/0_188_5607_3364/master/5607.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c0226f19785c1e24bd0a90db60e652bc", "width": "5607", "height": "3364", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dae651a5395092d56a3dbf70ab5c145121553c56/0_188_5607_3364/master/5607.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=93a1e71de27ae0085871c1f75a5973c0", "description": "The Everglades national park seen from the air.

Hope this helps.\nAs reported in the Guardian in 2016:\nBQSTART\nHansen: Some things do change gradually because of the inertia system. The global average temperature, if you average it over several years, is going up pretty smoothly, since the middle 1970s. January/February of this year, global temperature is now 1.3 degrees above the 1950-1980 average, but that was just two months. Averaged over the year, it\u2019s going to be about 0.9 degrees Celsius, and that\u2019s pretty much on this almost linear increase over the last four decades. \nLocally and regionally you get abrupt events, which are the ones that have the biggest impact on people. The frequency and severity of extreme events increase as the planet continues to get warmer. Sea level and ice-sheet disintegration is also a very nonlinear process. It\u2019s going to lead to rapid change within the next several decades.\n The other thing we point out is that the fresh water coming off of Greenland and Antarctica is affecting the ocean circulation. Normally in the winter at the polar regions, it gets cold, the salt in the ocean water gets dense, and will sink toward ocean bottom, and that drives this overturning ocean circulation or conveyor belt. \nI think there\u2019s a danger that if we keep adding greenhouse gases, that we will get shutdown in the AMOC, Atlantic Meridian Overturning Circulation, sooner than the model indicates. It\u2019s very interesting scientifically, but it\u2019s very threatening. \nBQEND\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/12/climate-scientist-james-hansen-i-dont-think-im-an-alarmist", "recommendation_count": "2", "in_reply_to": "115381780", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "its affect on the antarctic ice sheet", "effect": "good point about the warming of the oceans that has built in a lot of change no matter what we do on out"}, {"cause": null, "effect": "rapid change within the next several decades"}]}, {"id": "115382164", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1525317726000}, "author": "prematureoptimsim", "author_id": "15146901", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "All of mankind is guilty.", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "115381940", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "115382135", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1525317410000}, "author": "Erik Frederiksen", "author_id": "15131989", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Even my grim scenario above may be optimistic if large swaths of the planet are rendered to hot for us and the ocean starts converting from a provider of O2 to lethal H2S.", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "115381412", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "115382103", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1525317103000}, "author": "Erik Frederiksen", "author_id": "15131989", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "How's the GBR doing lately?

Governments have to agree new accounting standards for climate finance under the Paris agreement. This is an opportunity to agree fair and robust standards.\u201d\nGovernments from around the world are meeting in Bonn this week and next under the auspices of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to discuss how to implement the 2015 Paris agreement in practice. \nClimate finance is a key, though contentious, subject under discussion. Rich countries say that when contributions from the private sector are taken into account the amounts of climate finance are in line with the Paris commitments.

Wind power is one of the options being discussed.\nInternational shipping accounts for more than 2% of global carbon dioxide emissions, roughly the same as aircraft. But the 2015 Paris agreement to fight climate change left control of the shipping industry\u2019s emissions to the International Maritime Organisation.\nWhile environment groups applauded the agreement to cut hard and deep by 2050, they pointed out that it falls far short what is technically achievable.\nA report published just before the meeting by the International Transport Forum (ITF), a thinktank run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), found that the industry could achieve up to 95% decarbonisation as early as 2035 using \u201cmaximum deployment of currently known technologies.\u201d\nLow-tech solutions\nThe good news is that easy-to-do low-tech solutions can deliver a lot. Maersk, the world\u2019s largest container shipping line, has already discovered it can cut fuel use 30% simply by steaming more slowly.\nBecause of the wide availability of cheap (and often dirty) fuel, shipping has traditionally been wasteful. Most merchant ships are made of heavy steel rather than lighter aluminium, and don\u2019t bother with obvious energy-saving measures like low-friction hull coatings or recovering waste heat.\nMore slender ship designs alone could cut fuel use \u2014 and hence emissions \u2014 by 10-15% at slow speeds and up to 25% at high speeds, says the ITF. But replacing the existing fleet would take time. The average age of today\u2019s shipping fleet is 25 years. Rules of energy efficiency for new ships introduced by the IMO in 2013 will only fully come into force from 2030, meaning that any switch to slender ships would not apply to most ships at sea until mid-century or beyond.\nBut much could be done more quickly by retrofitting existing ships with technology to cut their fuel use and hence emissions, according to the ITF. Here are just four:\nFitting ships\u2019 bows with a bulbous extension below the water line reduces drag enough to cut emissions 2-7%;\nA technique known as air lubrication, which pumps compressed air below the hull to create a carpet of bubbles, also reduces drag and can cut emissions by a further 3%;\nReplacing one propeller with two rotating in opposite directions recovers slipstream energy and can make efficiency gains of 8-15%,\nCleaning the hull and painting it with a low-friction coating can deliver gains of up to 5%.\nEntirely new ships\nPutting together better designs and better fuel will create entirely new kinds of ships in future. And the blueprints are already being drawn up.\nThe Aquarius Ecoship, a cargo ship devised by a Japanese company called Eco Marine Power, is driven by a phalanx of rigid sails and solar panels. The same system could power oil tankers, cruise ships and much else. It would not, the designers admit, entirely eliminate the need for conventional fuel: Even with large batteries to store the solar and wind energy, back-up would be needed. But it could cut emissions by 40 percent.\nGoing one better, the Japanese shipping line NYK boasts that its design for a 350m-long container ship, the Super Eco Ship 2030, would use LNG to make hydrogen to run fuel cells. Backed up by solar panels covering the entire ship and 4,000 square metres of sails to catch the wind, the combination could cut emissions by 70%. Or for a completely zero-carbon option, engineers at Wallenius Wilhelmsen, a Scandinavian shipping line, offer the E/S Orcelle, a lightweight cargo ship designed to transport up to 10,000 cars (electric, we trust) on eight decks.\nIt would be powered by electricity, half coming directly from wind, solar and wave energy, and the other half from converting some of that energy into hydrogen to power fuel cells. The company says the ship could be afloat by 2025.\nToday\u2019s ships are in many respects almost indistinguishable from those of a century ago. But the IMO decision to finally get with the global climate agenda has fired the starting gun on what is set to be a race to create a new standard for low-carbon shipping that should be the norm just a few decades from now.\nBanishing conventional fuel\nSome of the biggest gains will require banishing conventional petroleum-based fuel, says the Sustainable Shipping Initiative, a progressive industry ginger group whose members include cruise lines and commodities shipping lines. Innovations ranging from biofuels to liquefied natural gas (LNG), nuclear reactors to sails to catch the wind, and hydrogen to solar panels have been proposed.\nEach has its benefits and drawbacks, and nobody is putting all their money on one solution. Biofuels are problematic because they take land to grow, though specially engineered crops such as algae could change that, says the ITF. While electric engines already operate on some short ferry journeys, the sheer weight and space taken up by batteries on oceangoing ships make them unviable until there are breakthroughs in lithium-ion batteries. Solar power can only augment other power sources.\nOne innovation already underway is converting ships to run on LNG. There are already more than a hundred LNG-fuelled ships globally. A new generation of giant cruise ships powered this way and carrying up to 7,000 passengers will be launched by MSC Cruises starting in 2022. Some LNG ships claim a reduction in CO2 emissions of 15%, though that depends crucially on keeping leakage of the greenhouse gas methane to a minimum in ships and bunkers.\nThe first LNG-powered cruise ship is the Viking Grace, operating between Finland and Sweden. This vessel has another claim to fame. As of this April it also boasts the first ship-based \u201crotor sail\u201d to capture power from the wind. Rotor sails have a large spinning cylinder amidships. Wind hitting the rotor creates a vertical force that can be used to power the ship, a phenomenon known as the Magnus effect. The Viking Line says the extra power will reduce the ship\u2019s CO2 emissions by 900 metric tonnes (1,000 tons) per year.\n", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/travel-and-transport", "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/transport", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "With a target to halve its huge carbon footprint, the race is on to find new technologies to green the world\u2019s shipping fleet", "date_published": {"$date": 1525352441000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1538400369000}, "authors": ["Fred Pearce"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Travel and transport", "Transport policy", "Climate change", "Environment", "World news", "Technology", "Renewable energy", "Energy"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/03/future-sailors-what-will-ships-look-like-in-30-years", "og:description": "With a target to halve its huge carbon footprint, the race is on to find new technologies to green the world\u2019s shipping fleet", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b85a2b5abb87a28250c1badf6f756163b3acfd9d/221_41_1838_1103/master/1838.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=1bd9b163968bceb78a7a0a1f8ab8a4fd", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Future sailors: what will ships look like in 30 years?"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "0", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b85a2b5abb87a28250c1badf6f756163b3acfd9d/221_41_1838_1103/master/1838.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e175fc475bfad6edf0930558f092e7ca", "width": "1838", "height": "1103", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b85a2b5abb87a28250c1badf6f756163b3acfd9d/221_41_1838_1103/master/1838.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=858da43ce29b9b3b0b43e5d3da9e9cd9", "description": "Low-tech solutions can deliver big emission cuts: sails could once again become the norm.\nPhotograph: Courtesy of Elomatic Oy/NYK"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62941b731e36684d0dffb656516da18b6cd8a56b/0_73_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f0e56b7e137c4933594aa9e6c95a0858", "width": "1024", "height": "614", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62941b731e36684d0dffb656516da18b6cd8a56b/0_73_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=78adf72ff1596c0eeb5a6d5a4cefed2c", "description": "The Aquarius Eco Ship concept design incorporates the innovative solar and wind power.

The first is the substitution of Heavy Fuel Oil or Marine Fuel Oil with hydrogen, in increasing percentages, in a a (slightly modified) conventional engine. This has been successfully achieved to 100% hydrogen in a Volvo FH16 Heavy Duty truck by a UK company called ULEMCo, and is efficient. In fact, it easily has the potential (depending on the cost of hydrogen) to be more efficient than diesel. The price per kilometer with electrolysed hydrogen from renewable electricity at about \u20ac40-60/MWh is maybe 50% less than diesel. And this is with a relatively simple modification of the existing engine; they do hydrogen retrofits for all different types of vehicles, and they all run very successfully. Its a fairly new development, because the (potential) price of hydrogen has only recently got down to the \u20ac5-7/kg level recently; and it will improve further. So thats that; this is the way to decarbonise shipping; retrofit existing ship engines and have an electrolyser at the port and some storage and just do it.\nThe other way to decarbonise is to use a fuel cell rather than an IC engine, which is basically 2 times more efficient than an IC engine. So this is will likely be more possible for ships in a decade or so; although it will obviously be the preferred choice eventually as the savings will be very significant.\nThe other issue with using hydrogen in an IC engine as they are starting to do now with trucks is that you can have a part-hydrogen part-existing fuel so you can decarbonise incrementally. \nI think really they all know this but they don't want to tell everyone because of the cost and hassle - its just easier than having to change and politicians and even industry watchdogs are not that aware of the mechanics and technical side, so they can sort of get away with it.", "recommendation_count": "2", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "that", "effect": "decarbonised shipping"}, {"cause": "the potential price has only recently got down to the \u20ac 5 7/kg level recently", "effect": "its a fairly new development and it will improve further"}, {"cause": "the cost and hassle its just easier than having to change and politicians", "effect": "to tell everyone"}]}, {"id": "115470216", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1525471242000}, "author": "thankthegod", "author_id": "100078587", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Your crap stinks", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "115456930", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "115470084", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1525470881000}, "author": "user512", "author_id": "3522873", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nbut in terms of efficiency at converting wind energy to movement and flexibility in direction of movement, they can\u2019t compete with cylindrical wind turbines.\nBQEND\nCylindrical wind turbines can't hope to provide enough power, though.

Before I changed career in the mid 80s, I worked in Japan for 7 years. One of my employers was the Japan Marine Machinery Development Association (JAMDA,) which was developing sail assisted cargo ships. The first of these, the Shin Aitoku Maru, was built together with a sister ship that was identical apart from the sail system. This was done to get a better assessment of the fuel savings. Over the first two years of service, fuel savings were nearly 50%. A number of these vessels were built, the largest being Usuki Pioneer, a 26,000 ton log carrier. The larger ships were less efficient, due to restrictions on sail size imposed by the need to pass under harbour bridges. However, JAMDA's figures indicated fuel savings of up to 30% compared to similar conventional vessels.So why didn't they take off? Simple. The oil price dropped, so ship owners could no longer be bothered paying the extra initial cost for more efficient ships. This was despite JAMDA using a sail design which, while not the most efficient out there, met the owner's requirements for a sail system that added less than 10% to the ship's build cost, and did not interfere with loading and unloading. It is good to see that the issue is being revisited, but depressing to think what could have been achieved over the last 30 years if the industry had been less short sighted.", "recommendation_count": "12", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "restrictions on sail size imposed by the need to pass under harbour bridges", "effect": "the larger ships were less efficient"}]}, {"id": "115435757", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1525425886000}, "author": "Celtiberico", "author_id": "3178420", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Well, most sailboats these days have a petrol-fuelled engine for when there isn't much wind.

There's a few things here which have my antennae twitching.\nFirst point is that The Flettner rotor (aka \"rotor sail\" in this article) is an old idea. The first ship powered by Flettner rotors, Buckau, was built in 1924. Barbara followed two years later, in 1926, and was featured in a kids' colouring-in book of ships that I remember from my childhood. Viking Grace is definitely not the first ship to have such a device fitted.\nBQSTART\nMaersk, the world\u2019s largest container shipping line, has already discovered it can cut fuel use 30% simply by steaming more slowly.\nBQENDNot much of a discovery. This has been known since steamships were invented. If you don't move them at all, they use zero fuel.\nBQSTART\nMost merchant ships are made of heavy steel rather than lighter aluminium, and don\u2019t bother with obvious energy-saving measures like low-friction hull coatings or recovering waste heat.\nBQENDAluminium is a lot cheaper than steel, especially in the quantities needed to build large freighters. I'm not sure how aluminium is expected to become cost-effective for such uses.\nShips already try to use \"low-friction hull coatings\". Fouling of hulls has a big effect on running costs and schedules. The problem is marine critters love growing on ships. Sure, you can put a low-friction coating on a ship. That's easy.

And the states with the hottest summertime temperatures are all located in the South: Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Arkansas, and Arizona. All of these states voted for Donald Trump in 2016.\nThis paper is consistent with a 2015 Nature study that found an optimal temperature range for economic activity. Economies thrive in regions with an average temperature of around 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F). Developed countries like the US, Japan, and much of Europe happen to be near that ideal temperature, but continued global warming will shift their climates away from the sweet spot and slow economic growth. The question is, by how much?\nThe new working paper concludes that if we meet the Paris target of staying below 2\u00b0C global warming, US economic growth will only slow by about 5 to 10%. On our current path, including climate policies implemented to date (which would lead to 3\u20133.5\u00b0C global warming by 2100), US economic growth would slow by about 10 to 20%. In a higher carbon pollution scenario (4\u00b0C global warming by 2100), US economic growth would slow by about 12 to 25% due to hotter temperatures alone.\nHouse Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who represents Louisiana (the second-hottest state), recently introduced a new anti-carbon tax House Resolution. Scalise introduced similar Resolutions in 2013 with 155 co-sponsors (154 Republicans and 1 Democrat) and in 2015 with 82 co-sponsors (all Republicans). The latest version currently only has one co-sponsor, but more will undoubtedly sign on. All three versions of the Resolution include text claiming, \u201ca carbon tax will lead to less economic growth.\u201d\nAs the economics research shows, failing to curb global warming will certainly lead to less economic growth. Climate policies could hamper economic growth, but legislation can be crafted to address that concern. \nFor example, as Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby notes in its point-by-point response to the Scalise Resolution, an economic analysis of the group\u2019s proposed revenue-neutral carbon tax policy found that it would modestly spur economic growth (increasing national GDP by $80 to 90bn per year). With this particular policy, 100% of the carbon tax revenue is returned equally to households, and for a majority of Americans, this more than offsets their increased costs. As a result, real disposable income rises, and Americans spend that money, spurring economic growth.\nIn short, failing to implement climate policies will certainly slow economic growth, especially in hot, red, southern states. A carbon tax, if crafted smartly, could modestly spur economic growth. Blind opposition to carbon taxes is simply bad for the economy and especially bad for Trump voters.\nWhile the Federal Reserve paper focused on the US economy, developing countries will be made much worse off by climate change. Many third world countries are located closer to the equator, where temperatures are already hotter than the temperature sweet spot identified in the 2015 Nature study. A new paper published last week in Science Advances also found that these poorer tropical countries will experience bigger temperature swings in a hotter world. Because of this combination of hot temperatures with bigger swings in countries with fewer resources available to adapt, these poorer nations are the most vulnerable to climate change impacts.\nThis is a key moral and ethical dilemma posed by global warming: as an important 2011 study concluded, the countries that have contributed the least to the problem are the most vulnerable to its consequences. Meanwhile, wealthy countries are already lagging behind their promised financial aid to help poor countries deal with climate change.\nWhen evaluating climate policies, it\u2019s important to compare the outcomes to the correct baseline. In a world without a carbon tax or other efforts to tackle climate change, temperatures will continue to rise, which will slow economic growth. That\u2019s the baseline against which climate policies need to be compared.\nThus, even if a carbon tax were to slow economic growth, the question is whether it would slow more or less than in the hotter world without the carbon tax. That largely depends on what the rest of the world does, since the US is just one country representing about 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions. But the rest of the world has agreed to try and limit global warming to 2\u00b0C in the Paris climate accords \u2013 the US is the only country whose leaders are stupid enough to reject that agreement.\nRejecting climate policies like a carbon tax will ensure that the world misses the Paris targets, resulting in slower economic growth. This will particularly hurt poorer countries and Trump\u2019s base in the South. The Federal Reserve Bank paper notes that these states are already among the least developed in the US, based on the Human Development Index. This means that they already have the weakest economies in the US, and failing to take steps to slow global warming will just hamper their economic growth further yet.\nIn short, if Trump, Scalise, and the rest of the Republican Party want to prevent slowed economic growth in red states, they should be trying to craft an optimal carbon tax, not blindly rejecting the idea outright.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-tax", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/economy", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomicgrowth"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Dana Nuccitelli: It\u2019s global warming that will hurt the economy in red states, not a carbon tax.", "date_published": {"$date": 1525687246000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1525687292000}, "authors": ["Dana Nuccitelli"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Carbon tax", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "Climate change", "Science", "Economic policy", "Politics", "Republicans", "Donald Trump", "US economic growth and recession"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/may/07/global-warming-will-depress-economic-growth-in-trump-country", "og:description": "Dana Nuccitelli: It\u2019s global warming that will hurt the economy in red states, not a carbon tax.", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5705c5ddf05107f0ffd3f5f6568af363cf1768de/0_0_2676_1605/master/2676.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=59d743706f9ac8bc0319618a8d3b23a6", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Global warming will depress economic growth in Trump country | Dana Nuccitelli"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5705c5ddf05107f0ffd3f5f6568af363cf1768de/0_0_2676_1605/master/2676.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0d3452698ab5b591d189f2f5132f442f", "width": "2676", "height": "1605", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5705c5ddf05107f0ffd3f5f6568af363cf1768de/0_0_2676_1605/master/2676.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d9db7cfd4e84daa9b5766ec910e62d5e", "description": "Texas State Park police officer Thomas Bigham walks across the cracked lake bed of O.C.

And, since the North and South Pole regions contain lots of ice, anyone who wants to see evidence of climate change can look there.\nBut beyond this simplistic view, things can get pretty complex. First, it\u2019s important to recognize that the Arctic and the Antarctic are very different places. In the Arctic, almost all the ice is floating on water \u2013 there is very little land. So, we talk about \u2018sea ice\u2019 in the north, formed from frozen sea water. On the other hand, Antarctica is a massive land mass that is covered by ice formed from snowfall (called an \u2018ice sheet\u2019). There is some floating ice around the perimeter of the land, but the vast majority of Antarctic ice is on land.\nThis difference not only affects how these regions response to climate change, but it also impacts their importance. We know that when floating ice melts, the ocean levels will not rise, because the ice was already floating in the water. But, when land ice melts, the liquid water flows into the ocean and causes the water levels to rise. So, at least from a sea-level perspective, land ice is more important than floating ice.\nThere are other differences between the north and south. One feature of the south is that there is a strong current that travels around Antarctica and partially shields it from waters elsewhere in the ocean. The Nasa Jet Propulsion Laboratory provides a good summary of some of the differences between the poles.\nWith global warming, both of the poles are warming quite quickly, and this warming is causing ice to melt in both regions. When we think of ice melting, we may think of it melting from above, as the ice is heated from the air, from sunlight, or from infrared energy from the atmosphere. But in truth, a lot of the melting comes from below. For instance, in the Antarctic, the ice shelves extend from the land out over the water. The bottom of the ice shelf is exposed to the ocean. If the ocean warms up, it can melt the underside of the shelf and cause it to thin or break off into the ocean.\nA new study, recently published in Science Advances, looked at these issues. One of the goals of this study was to better understand whether and how the waters underneath the shelf are changing. They had to deal with the buoyancy of the waters. We know that the saltier and colder water is, the denser it is. \nAround Antarctica, water at the ocean surface cools down and becomes saltier. These combined effects make the surface waters sink down to the sea floor. But as ice melt increases, fresh water flows into the ocean and interrupts this buoyancy effect. This \u201cfreshening\u201d of the water can slow down or shut down the vertical mixing of the ocean. When this happens, the cold waters at the surface cannot sink. The deeper waters retain their heat and melt the ice from below. \nThe study incorporated measurements of both temperature and salinity (saltiness) at three locations near the Dalton Iceberg Tongue on the Sabrina Coast in East Antarctica. The measurements covered approximately an entire year and gave direct evidence of seasonal variations to the buoyancy of the waters. The researchers showed that a really important component to water-flow patterns were \u2018polynyas.\u2019 These are regions of open water that are surrounded by ice, typically by land ice on one side and sea ice on the other side.\nA satellite photograph of a polynya is shown below. When waters from the polynya are cold and salty, the waters sink downwards and form a cold curtain around the ice shelf. However, when the waters are not salty (because fresh water is flowing into the polynya), this protective curtain is disrupted and warm waters can intrude from outside, leading to more ice melt.\nBased on this study, we may see increased ice loss in the future \u2013 sort of a feedback loop. That concerns us because it will mean more sea level rise (which is already accelerating), and more damage to coastal communities. I asked the lead author, Alesandro Silvano about this work:\nWe found that freshwater from melting ice shelves is already enough to stop formation of cold and salty waters in some locations around Antarctica. This process causes warming and freshening of Antarctic waters. Ocean warming increases melting of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, causing sea level to rise. Freshening of Antarctic waters weakens the currents that trap heat and carbon dioxide in the ocean, affecting the global climate. In this way local changes in Antarctica can have global implications. Multiple sources of evidence exist now to show that these changes are happening. However, what will happen in Antarctica in the next decades and centuries remains unclear and needs to be understood.\nThis is just another reason to take scientists seriously and act to slow down climate change before it is too late.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/sea-level", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/poles", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oceans", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/sea-ice", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/antarctica"], "share_count": "0", "description": "John Abraham: Warming oceans melting Antarctic ice shelves could accelerate sea level rise", "date_published": {"$date": 1525860044000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1525860089000}, "authors": ["John Abraham"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Sea level", "Polar regions", "Environment", "Oceans", "Sea ice", "Antarctica", "Climate change", "Science"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/may/09/global-warming-is-melting-antarctic-ice-from-below", "og:description": "John Abraham: Warming oceans melting Antarctic ice shelves could accelerate sea level rise", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bec218bc996b7c108dfe09dcd5a90332516eaf2/0_105_2872_1723/master/2872.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=e9f2b9081e45175a1b70582477684909", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Global warming is melting Antarctic ice from below | John Abraham"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "m", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bec218bc996b7c108dfe09dcd5a90332516eaf2/0_105_2872_1723/master/2872.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=599fca1b8ec1229ce37114bfe38876ec", "width": "2872", "height": "1723", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bec218bc996b7c108dfe09dcd5a90332516eaf2/0_105_2872_1723/master/2872.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=01669e33b47aaad7f6a2e9701a9a4bdb", "description": "A view of the leading edge of the remaining part of the Larsen B ice shelf that extends into the northwest part of the Weddell Sea is seen in this handout photo taken on March 4, 2008.\nPhotograph: HO/REUTERS"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f8d06d567a1b6e0ef711d46c194e61f9eb533cf/0_0_800_1029/master/800.png?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f963b0e55ba84011e7401de47bd23a5a", "width": "800", "height": "1029", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f8d06d567a1b6e0ef711d46c194e61f9eb533cf/0_0_800_1029/master/800.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=196fa79b4e33fb9e6381f565ddfaffef", "description": "A polynya off the coast of Antarctica, near Ross Island and McMurdo Station on November 16, 2011.

The heat flux at this site is 285 \u00b1 80 mW/m2, significantly higher than the continental and regional averages estimated for this site using regional geophysical and glaciological models. Independent tem- perature measurements in the ice indicate an upward heat flux through the WAIS of 105 \u00b1 13 mW/m2.

Tragic stories of explorers perishing in blizzards or in either the Australian deserts (Burke and Wills) or rainforests (Kennedy) were a feature of the school syllabus in those days. Later as a young person working in science and combining that with adventure a number of friends and colleagues spent time on various Antarctic and sub-Antarctic bases coming back with stories and beautiful photographs.\nScott's expedition was part of the British Antarctic expedition which took place from 1910 to 1913, overlapping with the Australian from 1911-1914 which was led by Australian Geologist Douglas Mawson who when on Shsckleton's 1907-09 expedition had been in the first party to climb Mt Erebus. Like the roughly concurrent British expedition Mawson's expedition made significant discoveries in geology, glaciology and terrestrial biology as well as charting 3,200 km of coastline.\nA joint British, Australian (and) New Zealand Antarctic research expedition in 1929-31, also led by Mawson has been described as an \"Acquisitive exploratory expedition with Mawson making proclamations of British sovereignty over Antarctic lands at each of his five landfalls\"; but it also produced 13 volumes of reports on geology, oceanography, meteorology, terrestrial magnetism, zoology and botany between 1935 and 1975. British sovereignty was later ceded to Australia. In the first half of the twentieth British and Australian sovereignty were regarded as much the same.\nMawson lobbied for the establishment of a permanent Australian Antarctic base which was established in 21958 and bears his name. My three friends spent various periods of time in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic Islands.\nOne a botanist and British citizen was director of the British South Georgia base at the time they captured by the Argentine Navy and held in Buenos Aires. Amid the fervid reports of that war his comment that they were being well treated and fed good Argentine steak was welcome relief. He brought back slides of sled dogs, wonderful scenery and entire plant ecosystems minus vascular plants.\nOne an engineer who overwintered at the Australian base also brought back wonderful slides of dogs, scenery, wildlife and weather. He climbed Mt Erebus and undertook a long motorised overland seismic line journey.\nThe third, 20 years my senior had researched penguins in the early days of the Antarctic Division when Mawson was still alive.

We emailed American News but did not get a reply.\nThe American News story refers to a real study by NASA, but the headline falsely suggests that the study debunks climate change advocates. A NASA scientist involved in the study told us the headline is inaccurate.\nHere\u2019s the real story: On Nov. 7, NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., issued a summary of the study about the heat source under West Antarctica. The paper, \"Influence of a West Antarctic mantle plume on ice sheet basal conditions,\" was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth.\nThe heat source isn\u2019t new or increasing, but may help explain why the ice sheet collapsed so rapidly in an earlier area of climate change and remains unstable.\nSome 30 years ago, a scientist at the University of Colorado Denver suggested that heat from a mantle plume under Marie Byrd Land might explain regional volcanic activity and a topographic dome feature, NASA wrote. Recent seismic imaging has supported this concept.\n \n\"At the end of the last ice age around 11,000 years ago, the ice sheet went through a period of rapid, sustained ice loss when changes in global weather patterns and rising sea levels pushed warm water closer to the ice sheet -- just as is happening today,\" NASA said.\nErik Ivins, a scientist and the second author on the study, told PolitiFact that the study didn\u2019t address climate change.\n\"The study itself is about steady state conditions that would exist at the bottom of the ice sheet for many many millions of years,\" he said. \"We think of climate change as occurring 10 years, 100 years, maybe 500 years -- our study has nothing to do with those time scales.\"\nThe NASA study is about the bottom of the ice sheet. Climate change has had an impact on the top of the ice sheet. Warmer ocean waters intruding on the ice shelf causes the ice shelves to break up. When grounded ice sheets exit the land and go into the water that causes sea level rise\n\"This study doesn\u2019t discredit that,\" he says. \"Nothing in our paper has anything to do with climate change.\"\nBQEND\nhttp://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/20/americannewscom/no-nasa-antarctica-study-didnt-discredit-climate-c/", "recommendation_count": "5", "in_reply_to": "115628248", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "warmer ocean waters intruding on the ice shelf", "effect": "the ice shelves to break up"}, {"cause": "that", "effect": "sea level rise"}]}, {"id": "115706684", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1526090021000}, "author": "Anthonyhu", "author_id": "17407909", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nTony could learn something from him, the amount of time AH spends here.

These are marginal changes, but our internal dynamics amply it to the extent that we get sea-level changes by 10 meters per 1000 year (as average trend). \nNow, Ever since Milancowich a century ago, we have known that when we solve the equations, there is also a weak c. 400,000 harmonic going on. Mainly caused by our big planets tugging on our orbit. \nBut we only had around 2.5 million years of recent ice-age signals to trace - so that provide only 6 repetitions of a harmonic - and that is not enough (also because the Plio Pleistocene also changed own harmonics internally on our planet around a million years ago) \nSo - last week came results from rock cores going hundreds of millions of years back. \nAnd here is the scary news - that tiny tiny amount of solar energy that these almost half a million year wobbles create by the solar system is fixed in the rocks under us - so much that science can measure it. \nhttps://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-05/teia-iar050418.php\nIt is important to remember that GHG gasses can at zero order be considered as external (like orbital changes) instead of internal (like El Nino variations). \nAnd when stuff happening hundreds of million years ago - in the age of dinosaurs pick up this orbital signal - we should be seriously conserned as we now provide change in our energy balance of several Watt per square meters - within time-scales measured in decades. \nI understand that deniers still talking about hockey-gate think that paleoclimate is there to prove the AGW hypothesis. This is wrong. Paleoclimate exists to provide long time-series and sensitivity information. \nFor those who think paleoclimate is slave of models - rethink that. It is paleoclimate that has continously been telling the modellers involved in IPCC that the estimates grossly underestimate the risk of rapid degliaction (models are nowhere near to simulate what reality has shown to be facts). Models do well with steady state simulations (even last glacial maximum conditions and Eocene conditions that paleoclimate provides for them as test-bench mean conditions - but when it comes calculate transitions - they are sadly bad at that even though they are getting better. \nThat they are doing bad is not the fault of bad understanding of physics - it is limited by how many Flops the biggest computers in the world can do. \nOf course a climate model from 1990 or 2010 could not predict the sub-glacial energy transfer pathways. Paleoclimate studies could not either. \nBut science can know that there are some serious issues with this issue - and with the balmy 3 degree warmer planet they promise us by on purpose mixing up the feedback sensitivity of 2xCO2 with some idea that it can not be more than 3 degrees whatever we do as their private sensitivity (or giving carbon-only sensitivity). \nI have said this before, science is running after the pace of change. \nThe nation of USA like that since Trump canceled the NASA's Carbon Monitoring System (CMS)\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/05/trump-white-house-quietly-cancels-nasa-research-verifying-greenhouse-gas-cuts\nIt saved the US a NASA post costing 10 million dollars a year.

It seems that in the Amundsen Sea and Totten glacier region the freshwater discharge forms an insulating cap on the surface ocean because it is less dense,\" Naish said.\n\"This has the affect of reducing deep mixing and allowing warm circumpolar deep water to continue to upwell onto the continental shelf where it comes into contact with the marine margins of the ice sheet enhancing melting.\"\nIn the Ross Sea, however, scientists believed this fresh melt water may end up entrained by the Antarctic slope current, where it was drawn down to greater depths and formed a road block restricting warm ocean currents from reach the ice sheet.\nThis - an example of \"negative\" feedback, as opposed to the \"positive\" feedback highlighted by Silvano - then reduced melting.\n\"It's important to note that this is a high prioirty forefront of research today, and there are still many uncertainties,\" Naish said.\n\"What is clear is that different regions of Antarctica are behaving in different ways, and if we are to understand how fast the ice sheet will melt and contribute to future sea-level rise we need to understand the processes of ocean circulation on the ice sheet margin at the local scale.\"\nBQEND", "recommendation_count": "18", "in_reply_to": "115635163", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "it is less dense", "effect": "that in the amundsen sea and totten glacier region the freshwater discharge forms an insulating cap on the surface ocean"}]}, {"id": "115635511", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1525936965000}, "author": "Walsunda", "author_id": "12483673", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "You say that in Antarctica \"this geothermal heat is a recent discovery previously unknown\"\nAntarctica is the largest glaciovolcanic province in the world. There are many volcanoes and they occur all the way from sub-Antarctic South Sandwich Islands, through the Antarctic Peninsula to Marie Byrd Land, and into East Antarctica, a distance of about 5,000 km. Eruptions coincided with the development of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. The volcanoes are overwhelmingly basaltic and the are few examples of more evolved magmatic compositions. They range from very large stratovolcanoes with elevations up to 4,000 metres and basal diameters of 40 to 60 km, to volcanic fields composed of multiple small centres. The individual volcanoes are often extremely beautiful but the extensive cover of snow and ice and the remote locations can make accessing themquite challenging.\nUnlike lower-latitude volcanoes which are typically obscured extensively vegetation, volcanic outcrops in Antarctica are characteristically very clean and beautifully exposed. In places such as North Victoria Land, cliff sections up to 2 km high extend 10 to 20 km laterally. However, many volcanoes have minimal exposure or have been extensively removed by multiple overriding ice-sheets, particularly in the Antarctic Peninsula. A curiosity of subglacially erupted volcanoes is that, because they are formed of alternating thick sections of lavas and fragmental rocks and are therefore technically stratovolcanoes, the fequent development of lava-fed deltas has resulted in volcano slopes of less than 15 degrees that are normally associated with (lava dominated) shield volcanoes. Both terms have been used to describe Antarctic volcanoes.\nThe above is by Prof John Smellie\nThe West Antarctic Ice sheet has many subglacial lakes beneath it; geothermal heating is thought to contribute to the melting of the base of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. However, the extent of this, and the rate, is very poorly known and currently not included in glaciological numerical models. Actual volcanoes may, during eruptions, melt quite large portions of the ice sheet around them. In Iceland volcanic eruptions, beneath the ice sheet, regularly cause catastrophic floods, called jokulhlaups. Subglacial volcanoes are therefore contributing at least a little to Antarctic Ice Sheet melt; the extent to which this is happening is probably reasonably stable over longer time scales.\nThe above is by Bethan Davies.\nBoth extracts above are from Antarctic Glaciers.org.\nThe presence of volcanic activity under and breaking through the vast Antarctic Ice Sheet has been known and studied for some time.\nIn 1979 a New Zealand Airlines tourist day trip to Antarctica crashed into Mt Erebus killing all 257 people on board.", "recommendation_count": "16", "in_reply_to": "115631805", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "they are formed of alternating thick sections of lavas and fragmental rocks and are therefore technically stratovolcanoes", "effect": "a curiosity of subglacially erupted volcanoes is that"}, {"cause": "the fequent development of lava fed deltas", "effect": "volcano slopes of less than 15 degrees that are normally associated with"}, {"cause": null, "effect": "catastrophic floods called jokulhlaups"}]}, {"id": "115649453", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1525955812000}, "author": "DavidFTA", "author_id": "4644463", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nLong-record data shows little sign that circum-Antarctic waters are warming sufficiently to do any melting.\nBQEND\nActually, no, that's not correct: in Konrad et al, Nature Geosciencevolume 11, pages258\u2013262 (2018): \"Net retreat of Antarctic glacier grounding lines\" (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0082-z): \nBQSTART\ncombine satellite altimeter observations of ice-elevation change and measurements of ice geometry to track grounding-line movement around the entire continent, tripling the coverage of previous surveys.

We have much better means of measuring ice extent than before, as we have a consistent satellite record since 1978. This does not mean that the sea ice retreat began that year. For example the explorations of the nineteenth and early twentieth century already set markers in specific places that measured the retreat of outlet glaciers and some of the interior of Greenland. For more information on this read the accounts of Greenland exploration by Alfred Wegener from the 1920s.\nWhat is now happening is an acceleration of the melting process which can be seen by using the graphics provided by NSIDC called Charctic as well as the MASIE graphics. The ice this year near the Arctic Circle is in its seasonal retreat as usual but with one difference: most of the ice is young ice often of less than a year. Even in the coldest regions of the Arctic Ocean the ice now lasts less than a year as it moves from its place of forming and circulates out of the Arctic Ocean through the Fram Strait and Bering Straits. \nThis article explains the mechanics of the ice melt with a particular focus on the way that the water column transports colder saltier water to the lower depths. The freshening of polar waters through melt increases the effects of ambient heat on the ice and disrupts normal cycles. Thus cold spots form and warmer waters can be trapped below the surface, leading ice shelves to become unstable. The ice on the Larsen Ice Shelf is estimated to be 200 000 years old, which means it is a regular feature of Antarctic geography, when this begins to break up, as it is doing, then we can be sure that the whole of the ice-shelf outlet glacier system there is undergoing dramatic changes. \nThese observations of ice loss and disruption of the polar hydrology is undeniable.

More than 200 people have been arrested for blocking the entrance of a facility belonging to Trans Mountain, including two federal MPs.\nThe political stalemate over the project catapulted into the national conversation last month after Kinder Morgan Canada announced it was halting all non-essential spending on the project and planned to walk away unless it saw a clear path to completion by the end of May.\nIn response, Justin Trudeau said Canada\u2019s government was prepared to use taxpayer dollars to push forward with the proposed plans. \u201cThe Trans Mountain expansion is a vital strategic interest to Canada \u2013 it will be built,\u201d he told reporters.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oil", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Gore says pipeline expansion in Canada \u2018would be a step backward in our efforts to solve the climate crisis\u2019", "date_published": {"$date": 1526075061000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1526078608000}, "authors": ["Ashifa Kassam"], "article_section": "US news", "article_tags": ["Al Gore", "Canada", "US politics", "Climate change", "Environment", "US news", "World news", "Oil", "Fossil fuels", "Energy"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/11/al-gore-canada-kinder-morgan-oil-pipeline", "og:description": "Gore says pipeline expansion in Canada \u2018would be a step backward in our efforts to solve the climate crisis\u2019", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aed28cd1c9e3295d39dd9f950af2153338139b2/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=a4a9dd6779e0083d57f91e48c165228d", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Kinder Morgan pipeline: Al Gore joins fight to block 'destructive' project"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aed28cd1c9e3295d39dd9f950af2153338139b2/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5ebbcbb5b7f7bf4129bb8d97064fc04b", "width": "3500", "height": "2100", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aed28cd1c9e3295d39dd9f950af2153338139b2/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a93a2e8a0bab98508d689dcc11c22d14", "description": "Gore says he supports \u2018all of the Canadians \u2013 including the First Nations \u2013 who are fighting to stop this destructive pipeline\u2019.\nPhotograph: Wolfgang Rattay/Reuters"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07de3a2c3613145ed8e46"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/12/peers-to-rebel-over-toothless-environment-watchdog-brexit", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "A former Tory cabinet minister is backing efforts to force through tough green laws after Brexit, amid anger over plans that would weaken environmental protections once Britain leaves the European Union.\nFour former environment and climate change secretaries from three parties told the Observer they had concerns about \u201ctoothless\u201d plans announced by the government last week, which suggested the new post-Brexit green watchdog would lack the power to take the government to court.\nSenior Tory MPs are also said to have concerns about the move. It comes after a row over post-Brexit green laws between Michael Gove, the environment secretary, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond.\nGove, a leading Brexiter, has been keen for the new watchdog to have identical powers to those currently enjoyed by the European commission, which can fine governments that fail to meet their green obligations. However, the Treasury is said to have concerns about the impact on post-Brexit growth and construction.\nA cross-party group of peers is planning a rebellion this week that would keep all the green protections currently in place, including the power to take legal action against the government.\nAmong those backing the rebellion is John Gummer, now Lord Deben, the former Tory environment secretary and current chairman of the UK committee on climate change. \u201cThe government has moved significantly on this, but the new watchdog has got to have the power that we now have as members of the European Union \u2013 to call the government to account,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no such power in the current consultation document.\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have had any of the action that we\u2019ve had up until now unless the EU structures had the power to hold the government to account. The government committed itself to putting into British law all the protections and commitments that we have in the EU. Unless we make these changes, you don\u2019t do that.\u201d\nGreen groups immediately spoke out after Gove\u2019s \u201cGreen Brexit\u201d consultation, published last week, contained no commitment to give the new watchdog power to initiate legal action. It suggested it would have the power only to issue advisory notices. However, there is still time for the watchdog\u2019s remit to be strengthened before its formation.\nFormer climate change secretaries called for an urgent rethink. Labour\u2019s Ed Miliband said: \u201cClimate change is the biggest environmental challenge the world faces but these proposals for a weak regulator with no proper legal powers are yet more evidence of the government\u2019s continued failure to match their rhetoric with action.\nGove\u2019s watchdog is a toothless mutt\n\u201cMichael Gove claimed to have been deeply moved by David Attenborough\u2019s Blue Planet. But his watchdog is about as toothless as a jellyfish.\u201d\nThe Lib Dem MP Ed Davey, who served as climate change secretary under the coalition government, said the post-Brexit plans would leave Britain with \u201ca weaker environmental regime than Trump\u2019s America\u201d. He added: \u201cBefore we joined the EU, we were called the dirty man of Europe. We cleaned up our act during our membership. Over time, Britain has become one of the champions of environmental legislation. This will completely damage that reputation. The threat is we will go back to being the dirty man of Europe once again.\u201d\nChris Huhne, who also held the role under the coalition, said: \u201cGove\u2019s watchdog is a toothless mutt. Basic legal principles in EU law like polluter pays and the precautionary principle have been ditched to allow a sludge brown not green Brexit.\u201d\nAmy Mount, of the Greener UK coalition, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s plans for this toothless watchdog would leave us with weaker protections after Brexit. The power to take the government to court is a strong deterrent and then a vital last resort when the law is not being followed. This means we need more than advisory notices if our air is dangerously polluted, or wildlife under serious threat.\n\u201cIt is also very troubling that the watchdog will not enforce law relating to climate change, despite ministers\u2019 claims of global leadership on this urgent challenge. Bizarrely, this would mean that after Brexit the climate will be less protected than every other aspect of our environment.\n\u201cThere is still time for the government to live up to its stated \u2018world leading\u2019 ambitions, but time is fast running out.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/pollution", "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ed-davey", "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove", "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/lords", "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/edmiliband", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Former ministers condemn new body\u2019s lack of power for legal action against government", "date_published": {"$date": 1526153619000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1526158852000}, "authors": ["Michael Savage", "James Tapper"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Environment", "UK news", "Conservation", "Pollution", "Ed Davey", "Michael Gove", "Politics", "House of Lords", "Ed Miliband", "Brexit", "Wildlife", "Climate change", "Climate change"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/12/peers-to-rebel-over-toothless-environment-watchdog-brexit", "og:description": "Former ministers condemn new body\u2019s lack of power for legal action against government", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6140ac779971d22cb7a24b15fb3deb9fe1f4bc3a/0_112_5039_3025/master/5039.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=738f6e4e818de8b7c390f12a55460353", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Peers to rebel over \u2018toothless\u2019 post-Brexit green watchdog"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6140ac779971d22cb7a24b15fb3deb9fe1f4bc3a/0_112_5039_3025/master/5039.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e20f4aafb37b5ddfc171e0d71d4ad83a", "width": "5039", "height": "3025", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6140ac779971d22cb7a24b15fb3deb9fe1f4bc3a/0_112_5039_3025/master/5039.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=462976d5e4fc7868fea1f2e9ceeed9f6", "description": "A sewage outfall pipe: \u2018The new watchdog has got to have the power we now have as members of the European Union to call the government to account,\u2019 said Lord Deben, John Gummer.\nPhotograph: Alamy"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0039d09e7aaae36939a676b8c76d090de2be37b5/0_609_3283_2310/master/3283.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2d5c7f5bd9f7ae993c1d560574209b96", "width": "3283", "height": "2310", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0039d09e7aaae36939a676b8c76d090de2be37b5/0_609_3283_2310/master/3283.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fa072a240926a0e399175e3bf6f17ccb", "description": "\u2018The government committed itself to putting into British law all the protections and commitments that we have in the EU\u2019: John Selwyn Gummer, Lord Deben.

First we had to ramp up deployment of renewable energy sources to match the increase in demand for energy. Until we achieved that output of CO2 was accelerating. At that point atmospheric CO2 was increasing linearly. Then we needed to increase the rate of deployment so that fossil fuel plants could be retired. At that point CO2 in the atmosphere is still increasing but at a slower rate. Finally we will get to the point when we stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere at the level stabilises at that new level. Because of the lag in the system global warming will continue rising for several more decades after the CO2 levels stabilise. \nPlan A is to reduce our production of greenhouse gases as fast as possible by switching to renewable energy sources for power, heating, transport etc., plus cutting CO2 output from all the other sources. Achieve that and global warming should stop sometime in the next century, hopefully at a level still suitable for human civilisation.\nPlan B is to move to a much simpler lifestyle - pre industrialisation. Populations would probably move to countries that were neither too hot in the summer nor too cold in the winter and rely on more or less clothing etc. I can't see that happening because I don't think the population would accept it until it is forced on them but maybe some parts of the world might manage it. \nPlan C is we continue on our rake's progress until civilisation collapses and world population plummets.

The Climate Change Authority will be worse off to the tune of $550,000. Yet there is money for miners: the diesel fuel rebate remains in place.\u201d\nThe organisation also questioned why the government was years behind markets such as the United States and Canada in the introduction of tougher pollution standards for vehicles. \nLabor\u2019s climate change and energy spokesman, Mark Butler, said seasonally adjusted data showed emissions jumped by 0.83% in just the last quarter alone.\n\u201cYet, just last week, Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s government delivered a budget which has no policy to drive down pollution and combat climate change,\u201d he said.\u201cActing on climate change is not a priority \u2013 it is not even on the agenda \u2013 for this out-of-touch government.\u201d\nBlair Palese, 350.org Australia\u2019s CEO, said \u201cwith numbers like these, Australia may as well not be signed up to Paris to act on climate because we\u2019re making no progress at all.\u201d\n\u201cWe can blame the federal government\u2019s inability to stand up to fossil fuel interests and its failure to give any meaningful support to renewable energy for Australia\u2019s increasing emissions.\u201d\nMatthew Doman, director at the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA) said it was not surprising that the industry\u2019s emissions profile had grown alongside an increase in production.\n\u201cThe report highlights that the growth in emissions from gas production is less than the growth in gas production,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis highlights that the emissions intensity of Australian gas production is declining as the industry becomes more efficient and improves its carbon performance.\u201d\nHe said the industry managed fugitive emissions in a range of ways, including through the use of \u201cgreen completions\u201d, a process that captures and filters out impurities from wells instead of burning them off. \nComment has been sought from the minister for environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/josh-frydenberg", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gas", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "LNG was major contributor to 1.5% rise in year to December 2017, government data shows", "date_published": {"$date": 1526271240000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1526279988000}, "authors": ["Lisa Cox"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "Josh Frydenberg", "Climate change", "Australia news", "Australian politics", "Gas", "Fossil fuels", "Energy"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/14/gas-fuels-australias-third-straight-year-of-rising-emissions", "og:description": "LNG was major contributor to 1.5% rise in year to December 2017, government data shows", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70c3b3c6c9e4bba42fb1d30e16cdb99e71690787/0_839_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=64c150e93dc7fa61b8683f4b48440da3", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Gas boom fuels Australia's third straight year of rising emissions"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70c3b3c6c9e4bba42fb1d30e16cdb99e71690787/0_839_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d32b6a9f740dafbf171e1b908e392616", "width": "3000", "height": "1800", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70c3b3c6c9e4bba42fb1d30e16cdb99e71690787/0_839_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7823d2d2881f440dd1b945a94788b7f2", "description": "Greenhouse gas emissions were driven by an increase of 17.6% in natural gas production.\nPhotograph: Ken Mulvaney"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07de7a2c3613145ed8e48"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/13/young-people-are-angry-meet-the-teenage-activists-shaping-our-future", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "In a political climate where most adults are inert with despair, a growing number of teenagers are responding with action. After 14 children and three adults were massacred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, it was students \u2013 not parents, teachers or political representatives \u2013 who organised themselves to campaign for changes to US gun laws. The March for Our Lives demonstration in Washington, DC on 24 March was accompanied by sister marches around the world: millions of young people supporting each other and demanding policy reform. Lead campaigner Emma Gonz\u00e1lez, a high-school student who now has more than 1.5m Twitter followers, made a call to arms for her peers to: \u201cFight for your lives before it\u2019s someone else\u2019s job.\u201d\nGonz\u00e1lez is one of many teenagers shattering the stereotypes of the lazy, entitled, self-obsessed millennial. More and more teenagers are noisily questioning the world they\u2019re inheriting and demanding things work differently. Here, we meet some of the young activists whose voices are increasingly impossible to dismiss.\nLast spring, I was watching the news when there was a report on girls in the UK missing school because they couldn\u2019t afford menstrual products. Some were using toilet paper, newspaper or socks. Thinking about girls my age going through this hit me hard. The report gained attention, but I felt the government was sweeping it under the carpet and we needed to pressure them to do something. So I did what felt normal to me and went online and started a petition. It calls for free menstrual products for children on free school meals. I didn\u2019t imagine even getting 100 signatures. But in between revising for AS exams, I emailed as many people, companies and universities as I could. I asked my parents to send it around their work. My dad was a bit reluctant at first, but he did.\nThere\u2019s huge embarrassment about periods, but it\u2019s something half the world\u2019s population will go through for a week every month. That it\u2019s a taboo holds us back in achieving gender equality. Within two weeks, the petition reached 2,000 signatures. Comments were divided between people being shocked that this happens and others saying it affects them or their friends. Hearing that made me want to fight harder.\nWhen the general election was announced, I emailed the parties. The Green party and Women\u2019s Equality party both replied and included a pledge in their manifesto. I was so frustrated I couldn\u2019t vote. Then in December we organised a protest outside Theresa May\u2019s bedroom; more than 1,000 people came and shouted. To date, 150,000 people have signed the petition. It\u2019s sad when adults are surprised to hear a young person being politically vocal. Young people are angry about the state of the world and a lot of us use social media to articulate that. I get asked to speak a lot.\nThe other morning, a TV station sent a car to school, I left for an hour, spoke on the issue and came back to a history lesson. My parents are supportive and as surprised as me that this has taken off. My dad went with me to the Women\u2019s March, which was cool. But sometimes my mum can get annoyed if I\u2019m doing lots of campaign stuff with exams coming up.\nIf someone tells me I should be in school right now, I know that they don\u2019t see the bigger picture. Earth\u2019s ability to support human life is falling apart and if things don\u2019t change in the next five to 10 years, nothing\u2019s going to matter.\nI\u2019ll finish high school, but right now this is the most important thing I can do with my time. Myself and 20 other kids are currently suing the Trump administration for violating our constitutional rights for failure to act on climate change. We originally launched it against the Obama administration a few years ago. The US government has known the fossil fuel industry is having a negative impact on our climate, yet they have been offering them subsidies and opening up land to exploration. We have just heard that we are going to trial in October.\nI\u2019m also involved in law actions and civil disobedience to stop fracking around my hometown of Boulder. In 2012, my friends and I successfully helped push for a five-year ban.\nFrom a young age, I was aware of my part in protecting our planet. I was three or four the first time I went on a protest, and six when I started speaking at them. I was born in Colorado and have spent a lot of time in Mexico. My entire childhood was travelling, hanging out in nature and learning about my family\u2019s indigenous heritage. My dad taught me that we have a responsibility to protect the Earth the way that our ancestors did.\nI\u2019ve spoken at the UN about my work. I was surprised how disrespectful, disconnected and sterile it was. The delegates were on their phones, not listening. They perked up when they heard I was just 15 years old. The power of me speaking wasn\u2019t for them but for the millions of people my speech has since reached online.\nThe world is seeing how powerful young people are and how things are going to change. Adults on CNN and in the United States specifically, they can argue and cover gossip about Trump and his hair and porn stars. But young people are mobilising on the streets.\nThere\u2019s so much power in what\u2019s happening within our generation. We don\u2019t have the respect we deserve, but I think it\u2019s coming.\nI\u2019ve been racially abused since about 12, but it was never seen as an important thing to tackle. At secondary school, white children called me disgusting things, but teachers would turn a blind eye. And not just to racism, but sexism, homophobia, transphobia. There\u2019s also internal racism in the Eritrean community. My dad is called names because he has darker skin. It all comes from preconceived ideas that black is less, or the darker you are the lower you are in terms of income, society and politics.\nBecause these problems weren\u2019t taken seriously, I normalised them. But when I moved to a sixth form where the majority of students are black girls, I was surrounded by political and social consciousness. The more educated I got, the angrier I became. Last summer, I joined an organisation called the Advocacy Academy and, with a small group of people my age, we launched a campaign challenging the image and under-representation of black people in the media. We recreated iconic posters, such as Doctor Who, Titanic and Harry Potter, and made all the characters black. The campaign is rooted in personal experiences and I\u2019ve gone from talking about things with my friends in the lunch hall to speaking about them nationally.\nThe Academy has revolutionised the way I think. Back in the day I definitely upheld toxic masculine identities. I\u2019d tell myself that I didn\u2019t cry. Challenging gender norms wasn\u2019t of interest to me because I wanted to fit in with my friends. But I\u2019ve learned to let go of my ego and be vulnerable so I can say what\u2019s on my mind. It\u2019s allowed me to take all the cold anger I have built up over years and turn it into something good. I\u2019ve learned to become an ally to many other issues that don\u2019t affect me directly.\nAfter university, I don\u2019t just want to get a really good job, buy a big house and forget about my community. I want to change something and challenge the status quo.\nEven before the war in Syria, I wanted to change society, but I knew I needed to get educated to do that. Back then, we had a normal life. We went to school every day and saw our friends. The war started when I was 11 or 12. Going to school became difficult. There were people fighting on the ground, there would be bombing, sometimes bullets. Sometimes school was just closed because of budgets. My father is a teacher and he lost his job.\nWe left Syria five years ago, when I was 14. I was so worried about my future and education. We went to a refugee camp in Jordan. I didn\u2019t expect there to be a school, but I was happy to discover a caravan with a tent and some teachers. There was no electricity. We studied computing from a book. In the winter, it got so cold it was hard to focus on the teacher.\nBut school gave me hope. And I started to encourage other girls and boys to go, too. I would walk from tent to tent, caravan to caravan, persuading kids and parents. I met people who thought that because we are refugees, education isn\u2019t important any more, or that they\u2019d continue school when they returned to Syria. I encouraged people to believe in themselves and not give up. I met kids who\u2019d never been to school, and girls who saw marriage as their profession. Some parents told me it had nothing to do with me. I fought hard for everyone to believe that we can\u2019t do anything without knowledge and got involved with international charities who supported me.\nWhat\u2019s happening in my country is not of our making and it\u2019s not our fault that we\u2019re losing our rights. One day, we\u2019ll be able to return, and we need to have knowledge. After three years in Jordan, my family came to the UK. Last year I became the youngest and first refugee Unicef Goodwill Ambassador. I\u2019m now on my way to university and am doubling my activism.\nI came out at 14. When you\u2019re a young LGBTQ+ person and you come out, you\u2019re put in this position where you are suddenly expected to educate your peers. I\u2019d be in a lesson and someone would ask me an incredibly inappropriate question. People feel like they have permission to access all of you when you\u2019re still figuring things out for yourself.\nAt the same time, someone in my class was sending me online anonymous, violent messages, telling me to kill myself. My school didn\u2019t know what to do with it. At one point, they had contacted my parents, pushing me to come out to them, too, and it all became detrimental to my mental health.\nI don\u2019t come from a political family, but I\u2019ve always had a strong sense of fairness. After coming out, I started making educational YouTube videos on LGBTQ+ issues and people watched them. I also worked with my school to establish support systems and visibility for LGBTQ+ pupils. I got together with teachers to set up a group. We held events and assemblies, and suddenly others wanted to join. I worked with the school to run surveys of the staff and students, so we knew the issues that needed addressing.\nAs part of a Stonewall youth programme, I started a YouTube series called Queeries. I invite anyone to submit questions, however inappropriate or silly, and I sit down with another LGBTQ+ person and we answer them. Part of that is creating space for difficult questions, but also to give others a platform. I am very aware of the fact that I am white, middle-class and able-bodied, and there are a lot of things I feel I can\u2019t speak to. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and autism, but campaigning is always something I\u2019ve felt able to do.\nI was happy to do the work with my school, and I know that education resources are stretched, but schools shouldn\u2019t rely on pupils to affect change. That puts pressure on young people to challenge things adults should be addressing.\nMany young people think they aren\u2019t going to amount to anything because of all the headlines we read. But that\u2019s designed to discredit our concerns about how the world\u2019s being run. A lot of people in control are invested in the world as it currently stands; to suggest that things aren\u2019t great the way they are scares them.\nWe are going to be the kids you read about in textbooks. Not because we\u2019re going to be another statistic about mass shooting in America, but because we are going to be the last mass shooting. Just like Tinker v Des Moines, we are going to change the law. And it\u2019s going to be due to the tireless effort of the school board, the faculty members, the family members and most of all the students. The students who are dead, the students still in the hospital, the students now suffering PTSD, the students who had panic attacks during the vigil because the helicopters would not leave us alone, hovering over the school for 24 hours a day.\nIf President Trump wants to tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and how it should never have happened and maintain telling us how nothing is going to be done about it, I\u2019m going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter because I already know: $30m. And divided by the number of gunshot victims in the United States in the first one and a half months of 2018 alone, that comes out to being $5,800 each. Is that how much these people are worth to you, Trump? If you don\u2019t do anything to prevent this from continuing to occur, that number of gunshot victims will go up and the number that they are worth will go down. And we will be worthless to you.\nTo every politician who is taking donations from the NRA, shame on you. The people in the government who were voted into power are lying to us. And us kids seem to be the only ones who notice and call BS. Companies trying to make caricatures of the teenagers these days, saying that all we are is self-involved and trend-obsessed and they hush us into submission when our message doesn\u2019t reach the ears of the nation, we are prepared to call BS.\nPoliticians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been done to prevent this, we call BS. They say tougher guns laws do not decrease gun violence. We call BS. They say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. We call BS. They say guns are just tools like knives and are as dangerous as cars. We call BS. They say no laws could have prevented the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred. We call BS. That us kids don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about, that we\u2019re too young to understand how the government works. We call BS.\nThis is an edited transcript from the speech student and activist Emma Gonz\u00e1lez gave at the anti-gun rally in Fort Lauderdale on 17 February 2018, three days after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/activism", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/society/poverty", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gun-control", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Fed up with waiting for the older generation to sort out its problems, a growing number of teenage activists are taking matters into their own hands.

The state experienced its worst drought in over a millennium from 2012 to 2016, followed immediately by its wettest year on record in 2017. The consequences have been similarly extreme, including hellish record wildfires, narrowly-avoided catastrophic flooding at Oroville Dam, and deadly mudslides.\nA study published last month in Nature Climate Change found that these wet and dry extremes will only worsen in California as temperatures continue to rise. As lead author Daniel Swain wrote:\nmost of California will likely experience a 100 \u2013 200% increase in the frequency of very wet November-March \u201crainy seasons\u201d \u2026 California will likely experience an increase of anywhere from 50% to 150% (highest in the south) in the frequency of very dry November-March periods \u2026 Since California is so dependent on precipitation during its relatively brief winter rainy season, even a single dry winter can quickly lead to adverse drought impacts upon agriculture and the environment.\nLast week, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment also published a report detailing the indicators and impacts of climate change on California.\nThe most dramatic impacts include wildfires that are larger and more frequent, and the most severe drought since recordkeeping began. Underlying these events is a long-term warming trend that has accelerated since the mid-1970s. In addition, spring snowmelt runoff is decreasing, sea levels are rising, glaciers are shrinking, lakes and ocean waters are warming, and plants and animals are migrating.\nIn short, climate change will continue to have severe consequences for California, whose economy recently surpassed that of the UK to become the fifth-largest in the world. But the state has also become a leader in trying to minimize those climate damages.\nIn 2006, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the Global Warming Solutions Act into law, whose most significant component was a carbon cap and trade system. The bill required California to reduce its greenhouse gas pollution to 1990 levels by 2020, and the state is on track to meet that goal despite a growing population and thriving economy with an $8.8bn surplus. California has proved that an economy can thrive with a price on carbon pollution in place.\nIn 2016, California passed an update to the California Global Warming Solutions Act requiring a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas pollution by 2030 on the way to the target 80% reduction below 1990 levels by 2050. California\u2019s annual per capita emissions (11.5 tonnes of CO2-equivalent per person) are currently on par with those of Germany and Japan, and 40% lower than the US average.\nCalifornia is investing in climate change solutions, like pilot projects using farms to sequester carbon. More than half of the state\u2019s electricity is generated by carbon-free sources (21% hydroelectric, 12% solar, 9% nuclear, 6% wind, 6% geothermal), and another 43% comes from natural gas. While California can take steps to further reduce the greenhouse gas pollution from its electric power (for example, it just became the first state to require solar panels on new homes), electricity now comprises less than 20% of the state\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation is the biggest culprit, now accounting for 37%.\nThat\u2019s why California\u2019s war with the EPA over vehicle fuel efficiency standards is so important. With its low-carbon power grid mix, California can achieve significant transportation emissions cuts by transitioning to electric cars. So far they comprise about 4.5% of the state\u2019s vehicle fleet (340,000 electric cars), well above the national average of 1.1%, but with a long way to go yet. The state\u2019s goal is to have 1.5m electric cars on the road by 2025 and 5m by 2030, with a $2.5bn initiative to install another quarter million charging stations in California to meet the growing electric vehicle infrastructure needs.\nCalifornia has become a leader both in experiencing climate change impacts and taking action to mitigate them. The state has provided a perfect example that contrary to current Republican Party beliefs, climate change has serious economic and human costs, whereas economies can thrive after putting a price on carbon pollution. America needs leaders with the foresight of California\u2019s.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/drought", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/wildfires", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/water", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-tax", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-capture-and-storage"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Dana Nuccitelli: Hit by record droughts and rainfall and wildfires, California leads the way in tackling global warming", "date_published": {"$date": 1526292025000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1526292150000}, "authors": ["Dana Nuccitelli"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Drought", "Wildfires", "Environment", "Water", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Carbon tax", "Carbon capture and storage (CCS)", "Energy", "Fossil fuels", "Solar power", "Electric", "hybrid and low-emission cars", "Renewable energy", "Climate change", "Science", "California"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/may/14/california-battered-by-global-warmings-weather-whiplash-is-fighting-to-stop-it", "og:description": "Dana Nuccitelli: Hit by record droughts and rainfall and wildfires, California leads the way in tackling global warming", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6226db4014312f63e02289d850c0e3e861429f24/0_199_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=49f3d96f89ffd330035e37a2df855a6a", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "California, battered by global warming\u2019s weather whiplash, is fighting to stop it | Dana Nuccitelli"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6226db4014312f63e02289d850c0e3e861429f24/0_199_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=152aed1ac06ccaf7d97ecca4036fe074", "width": "3000", "height": "1801", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6226db4014312f63e02289d850c0e3e861429f24/0_199_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8ed4811ecedc004ccb4fea43cd0fe65a", "description": "California Gov.

This change in Northern US Rocky Mountain forest wildfire has been linked to climatic factors such as warmer temperatures, dry summers, below-average winter precipitation or earlier spring snowmelt [1\u20134]. Analyses of reconstructed paleo wildfire and climate indices have also shown similar associations between widespread Northern US Rockies fire years and warm springs combined with warm and dry summers [5,6]. Warming temperatures increase vapour pressure deficit and evapotranspiration, with effects on wildfire, other disturbance and mortality, and forest productivity [7]. \nThe timing, extent and severity of wildfire in western US forests is strongly influenced by climate: over seasonal to decadal time scales antecedent climate shapes fuel characteristics such as their amount, connectivity and structure, while seasonal to interannual climate variability governs fuel flammability [8\u201310]. A changing climate consequently alters forest fuels characteristics across multiple time horizons.\nhttp://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/1696/2015017\nBQEND", "recommendation_count": "19", "in_reply_to": "116001280", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "116001280", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1526758290000}, "author": "JimKerr", "author_id": "16721037", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "What I state is fact.

This change in Northern US Rocky Mountain forest wildfire has been linked to climatic factors such as warmer temperatures, dry summers, below-average winter precipitation or earlier spring snowmelt [1\u20134]. Analyses of reconstructed paleo wildfire and climate indices have also shown similar associations between widespread Northern US Rockies fire years and warm springs combined with warm and dry summers [5,6]. Warming temperatures increase vapour pressure deficit and evapotranspiration, with effects on wildfire, other disturbance and mortality, and forest productivity [7]. \nThe timing, extent and severity of wildfire in western US forests is strongly influenced by climate: over seasonal to decadal time scales antecedent climate shapes fuel characteristics such as their amount, connectivity and structure, while seasonal to interannual climate variability governs fuel flammability [8\u201310]. A changing climate consequently alters forest fuels characteristics across multiple time horizons.\nBQEND\nhttp://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/1696/2015017", "recommendation_count": "21", "in_reply_to": "115812368", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "115812472", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1526321174000}, "author": "DanaNuccitelli", "author_id": "4434349", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Repeating falsehoods doesn't make them any less false.

This change in Northern US Rocky Mountain forest wildfire has been linked to climatic factors such as warmer temperatures, dry summers, below-average winter precipitation or earlier spring snowmelt [1\u20134]. Analyses of reconstructed paleo wildfire and climate indices have also shown similar associations between widespread Northern US Rockies fire years and warm springs combined with warm and dry summers [5,6]. Warming temperatures increase vapour pressure deficit and evapotranspiration, with effects on wildfire, other disturbance and mortality, and forest productivity [7]. \nThe timing, extent and severity of wildfire in western US forests is strongly influenced by climate: over seasonal to decadal time scales antecedent climate shapes fuel characteristics such as their amount, connectivity and structure, while seasonal to interannual climate variability governs fuel flammability [8\u201310].

The area burned by these fires is also growing at an alarming rate. Across the Western U.S., the average annual number of large fires (larger than 1,000 acres) burning each year has more than tripled between the 1970s and the 2010s. The area burned by these fires has shown an even larger increase: in an average year, more than six times as many acres across the West were burned in the 2010s than in the 1970s. The fire season is 105 days longer than it was in the 1970, and is approaching the point where the notion of a fire season will be made obsolete by the reality of year-round wildfires across the West. The situation in some individual states is more extreme: The average number of large fires burning each year on Forest Service land has increased at least 10-fold in the Northern Rocky Mountain states of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. In the Pacific Northwest, there are now five times as many large fires burning in a typical year in Washington as there were in the 1970s; in Oregon there are nearly seven times as many.\nBQEND", "recommendation_count": "16", "in_reply_to": "115803323", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "115826778", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1526371706000}, "author": "GoldenAppleCorps", "author_id": "17327071", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "So weather has nothing to do with climate?

The government must urgently plug this policy gap and publish its plan to secure the [billions of pounds of] investment required to meet the UK\u2019s climate change targets, and explore how a sovereign green bond could kickstart its strategy.\u201d \nCuts to taxpayer-funded support for renewable projects, along with planning obstacles that have effectively ruled out new onshore wind turbines across much of the country, have deterred energy companies and their financial backers. The market for energy efficiency measures, such as home insulation, has also seen a sharp decline since the government scrapped its flagship policy, and the Green Investment Bank was sold off.\nAlex White, senior policy officer at the Aldersgate Group, said: \u201cThere are willing investors in the green economy, but not enough projects to invest in. Boosting the pipeline of green infrastructure projects will be critical to meet the UK\u2019s environmental goals and should be the first priority in green finance. Policy detail is key [for investors].\u201d\nAlongside the EAC report, researchers and NGOs have called for a \u201cgreening\u201d of the Bank of England, to meet carbon targets and encourage clean growth. Positive Money, a thinktank, called for the monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, to have to take the risks of climate change into account in making its decisions, a controversial recommendation that would require wide reviews of how climate change could make an impact on inflation.\nThe report, A Green Bank of England, also suggested that the Bank of England should be given a specific remit on environmental sustainability, which would affect its decisions and advice to government, and should no longer buy bonds issued by fossil fuel companies.\nLord Deben, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change, the government\u2019s statutory advisors, said linking the Bank of England\u2019s work to climate change was essential, as was linking the performance of other government departments on the issue. \u201cWe have compartmentalised our reactions to climate change \u2013 we say, we have a minister for this, so the secretary of state for health or the chancellor do not think they have responsibility for it.\u201d\nHe said: \u201cThe Bank of England can make a huge difference by using its own direct powers, and by influencing [others].\u201d\nHe was backed up by Barry Gardiner, Labour\u2019s shadow secretary for international trade, who said: \u201cWe have to make it clear to the Bank of England that it is given a specific remit to deal with these issues, not to limit its activity to more conventional banking activity.\u201d\nThe governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has repeatedly warned of the risks of climate change to the financial sector, and the need for action by companies, investors, government and regulators to ensure the necessary transition to a low-carbon economy happens beneficially, rather than by shocks to the finance system.\nSovereign green bonds, recommended by the EAC, are financial borrowing instruments issued by governments to raise cash for environmental improvement projects, with part of the return on the projects going to market investors. They enable governments to take advantage of the low interest rates on borrowing available to them, while investors are attracted by the relatively low levels of risk.\nPoland made a bond issue in 2016, with Belgium following suit this year, and countries around the world from Nigeria to Indonesia have also entered the market. The Bank of England would have to take the lead in issuing such bonds in the UK.\nThe Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it would respond to the EAC proposals in due course.

Warren Winiarski would know \u2013 his wine, a cabernet sauvignon, was a firm underdog at a legendary 1976 blind tasting in Paris, which pitted the best of France against the little-known California region.His winery, Stag\u2019s Leap, shocked the wine world by taking top honors. \u201cIt broke the glass ceiling that France had imposed on everyone,\u201d he recalls. \u201cPeople\u2019s aspirations were liberated.\u201dToday Winiarski, 89, is speaking not of liberation, but of limits. A growing coalition of industry veterans and longtime residents fear that Napa has become a victim of its own success, pointing to the ecological transformation of the valley floor from dense oak woodland to a sea of vine-wrapped trellises. And they are posing a thorny question: has a unique agricultural region reached a tipping point at which agriculture itself becomes the threat?\n\u201cWe\u2019re not thinking ahead,\u201d says Winiarski. \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is a national treasure.\u201d\nAgainst this backdrop, a local environmental initiative has sparked fierce debate. The effort, known as Measure C, would cap the amount of oak woodland that could be cleared for future vineyards \u2013 in effect limiting the growth of some of the world\u2019s most famous wine brands.\nNearly 500 wineries now call Napa County home. Many are in the valley itself, which is just 30 miles long and five miles wide and welcomes 3.5 million visitors a year. Global recognition has attracted big beverage companies. Tourists have clogged the narrow two-lane roads. Wealthy \u201clifestyle vintners\u201d have scooped up second homes and attempted to build private helicopter pads. \n\u201cWith great success came great money and outsiders,\u201d explains James Conaway, a journalist and author who has been covering Napa since the 1980s. He describes the valley of 30 years ago as egalitarian and idealistic, a mixed agricultural community that raised wine alongside livestock and fruit trees. \u201cNow it\u2019s monoculture with a vengeance. Hundreds of miles of steel trellising holding up the vines from one end of the valley to the next. It has an industrial sheen.\u201d\nThrough the windows at Winiarski\u2019s hilltop home, the transformation can be surveyed with ease. Vineyards stretch in all directions, rows of green as orderly as soldiers. The Silverado Trail, a famous wine tasting route, cuts a path to the west. To the east lie hills covered in oaks \u2013 trees that, Winariski points out, once carpeted the valley floor. \nNapa\u2019s oaks have become a flashpoint in the story of wine\u2019s takeover. Ninety-five per cent of those on the valley floor have been felled, the vasty majority replaced by grapes. Now developers are eyeing the surrounding hillsides. \nNapa county has California\u2019s densest concentration of oak woodland, thanks to the rich foliage that still carpets the hills. While much of it is privately owned and not public land in the classic sense, the woods are regarded as a public resource \u2013 a place of recreation and biodiversity, a vital part of the valley\u2019s watershed and a fierce point of pride. But more than a third sits on potentially agriculturally productive soil \u2013 a 2010 management plan estimated that by 2030, up to 3,065 acres of mixed woodland would be lost due to vineyard development.\n\u201cForests are the best negative emissions technology we have,\u201d says Jim Wilson, a former brewing quality manager at Anheuser-Busch and a leader in the band of grassroots activists behind Measure C. \u201cShould Napa\u2019s wine industry get a pass?\u201d\nThe measure is the culmination of years-long battle \u2013 one that\u2019s involved knocking on doors, gathering thousands of signatures, and fighting an opposition which, according to a private newsletter seen by the Guardian, plans to spend nearly $1m to defeat it. Wilson\u2019s side, by contrast, has raised just over $160,000. The effort has consumed his life, but then, Napa is his life.\n\u201cI was born here in 1955,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cI raised a family on my wife\u2019s ranch.\u201d Their home \u2013 a patchwork of steep hills, creeks and woodlands on the county\u2019s east side \u2013 is wild and uncultivated. During a walk beneath the oaks on a recent morning, his love for the forest is palpable. \n\u201cWhen you take forest out, you negatively impact carbon sequestration,\u201d he explains. The trees play a crucial role in capturing rain and replenishing groundwater, he said, while their root systems prevent soil erosion. \nVoters will decide on the proposal by 5 June, but the campaign has sharply divided the wine community. Veteran vintners like Winiarski have gone against the industry trade groups, who are united in their opposition. The Napa Valley Vintners, a key trade body, initially supported the measure but later pulled a surprise U-turn. Wilson and his co-organizers say pressure from powerful industry figures turned the tide. The Vintners declined to comment on the reversal, but an official statement said the majority of its members \u201cconveyed opposition\u201d.\n\u201cThis decision does not change our longstanding commitment to promoting, protecting and enhancing the Napa Valley and to upholding its goals of advocating for the local wine industry while preserving this special place for future generations,\u201d it added.Ryan Klobas, the policy director for the Napa Valley Farm Bureau, warns the measure is \u201cfull of unintended consequences\u201d and calls its proposed regulation too complicated for voters to grasp. \u201cYou\u2019re asking everyone to become a technical expert overnight. This is an issue better left to the board of supervisors.\u201d\nBut longtime residents such as Ginny Simms \u2013 an environmental advocate who served on the county\u2019s board of supervisors in the 1970s \u2013 believe corporate greed is at the root. Napa today is a multibillion-dollar industry, where global beverage companies such as Treasury Wine Estates, Gallo and Constellation \u2013 which own brands such as Corona and Svedka vodka \u2013 have acquired smaller wineries for their portfolios.\n\u201cThe real issue here is power,\u201d says Simms, 90. \u201cOpponents want to run the county in a way that is favorable to the expansion of all wineries and wine events. Which leaves the people of Napa voiceless.\u201d\nDespite the talk of pushing back against power, some worry more regulation would actually favor the wealthy by boosting the price of the little free land that remains. Don Clark is a mid-sized grape grower and vineyard manager from Texas, who came to Napa in 1994 and was lucky to buy affordable land.\n\u201cWe may have been the last generation who could come here as a young farmer,\u201d he says. \u201cThe barriers to entry are almost impossible now.\u201d Startup costs have soared \u2013 Clark\u2019s last vineyard development client spent half a million dollars on various legal, consultation and county fees, as well as archeological and environmental studies, he says.\nClark and others point to a landmark 1968 ordinance known as the Agriculture Preserve \u2013 the first of its kind in the US \u2013 which deemed agriculture the \u201chighest and best\u201d use of Napa\u2019s land. Measure C therefore undercuts a fundamental right to farm, these opponents argue. \nBut proponents say the measure is born of love, not reproach, for the wine world, and is simply about responsible farming. \u201cSomething\u2019s very wrong with the way we are thinking about our resources,\u201d Winiarski says. \u201cThey are finite. And yet we go on with development as though we could do that indefinitely.\u201d\n\u2022 This article was amended on 21 May 2018 to clarify the distribution of wineries in Napa County.

Follow This has welcomed the move but said it is not enough.\nMeanwhile, influential shareholder advisers have urged investors to oppose the CEO\u2019s remuneration package, which rose to \u20ac8.9m (\u00a37.79m) in 2017. \nInstitutional Shareholder Services (ISS) said Van Beurden\u2019s \u20ac3m (\u00a32.63m) bonus was not warranted, given how the firm performed on its sustainable development targets. The advisory group Pensions and Investment Research Consultants (Pirc) also recommended opposition.\nA Shell spokesperson said the company \u201cstrongly disagreed\u201d with ISS\u2019s concerns, noting that the advisory group had supported the policy that put the bonus framework in place.\nThe spokesperson added: \u201cWe share the objective of Follow This for Shell to show leadership in the energy transition but we consider their resolution unnecessary as we have already outlined an approach, through our industry-leading net carbon footprint ambition, that is wider-ranging and more progressive.\u201d\nThe rival oil firm BP also faces a potential challenge \u2013 over pay \u2013 during its AGM in Manchester on Monday, the first time the London-based firm has held the event outside the capital in more than a century.\nThe British firm said about 40% of its shareholders lived north of Birmingham, and Manchester\u2019s location and transport links would be convenient for retail investors. \nThe company\u2019s healthy profits off higher oil prices mean the extraordinary 2016 shareholder revolt over chief executive Bob Dudley\u2019s \u00a314m pay package is unlikely to be repeated.\nBut some proxy adviser groups have urged investors to reject Dudley\u2019s \u00a39.5m remuneration for 2017, which Pirc said was at an \u201cunacceptable\u201d ratio of 48:1 compared to average employee pay.

This includes almost all the world\u2019s poorest countries, as well as the three biggest economies \u2013 the US, China and Japan \u2013 contradicting the claim of US president, Donald Trump, that climate action is too costly.\nAustralia and South Africa would also benefit, with the biggest winners being Middle East nations, which are threatened with extreme heatwaves beyond the limit of human survival.\nHowever, some cold countries \u2013 particularly Russia, Canada and Scandinavian nations \u2013 are likely to have their growth restricted if the 1.5C target is met, the study suggests. This is because a small amount of additional warming to 2C would be beneficial to their economies. The UK and Ireland could also see some restriction, though the estimates span a wide range of outcomes. \nThe research, published the journal Nature, is among the first to assess the economic impact of meeting the Paris climate goals. Data from the last 50 years shows clearly that when temperatures rise, GDP and other economic measures fall in most nations, due to impacts on factors including labour productivity, agricultural output and health.\nThe scientists used this relationship and 40 global climate models to estimate the future economic impact of meeting the 1.5C target - a tough goal given the world has already experienced 1C of man-made warming. They also assessed the long-standing 2C target and the impact of 3C of warming, which is the level expected unless current plans for action are increased.\n\u201cBy the end of the century, we find the world will be about 3% wealthier if we actually achieve the 1.5C target relative to 2C target,\u201d said Marshall Burke, assistant professor at Stanford University in the US, who led the new work. \u201cIn dollar terms, this represents about $30tn in cumulative benefits.\u201d\nThe estimated cost of meeting the 1.5C target is about $0.5tn over the next 30 years,\u201d he said: \u201cSo our evidence suggest the benefits of meeting the targets vastly outweigh the costs.\u201d \n\u201cWe also calculated what\u2019s going to be the additional economic cost if we hit 3C instead of 2C. This will cost the globe an additional 5-10% of GDP, relative to 2C; that is tens of trillions of dollars. These are very large numbers,\u201d he said.\nThe researchers acknowledge there are significant uncertainties in their economic modelling, but said they are confident that keeping climate change to 1.5C is very likely to benefit the vast majority of the world\u2019s people. \nThe exact size of the benefit will depend, for example, on whether new technologies are created that help societies adapt to global warming, such as clean, cheap air conditioning, or whether climate tipping points are passed, bringing more severe damage such as rapid sea level rise. \u201cThe caveats apply to both the impacts and the adaptation,\u201d said Prof Noah Diffenbaugh, also at Stanford University.\nThe economic analysis did not include the impacts of climate change on areas that are harder to quantify, such as the natural ecosystems that are vital for clean air and water and fertile soils, or the health benefits of burning less fossil fuel. Including these would make the benefits of action even greater.\nProf Maximilian Auffhammer, at the University of California Berkeley, US, and not part of the research team said: \u201cTranslating the impacts of climate change into economic damages is challenging. Pinning down just how large the effects of climate will be on the long-term growth of GDP needs to be a high priority for future work.\u201d\n\u201cI think the authors of this study are doing the best job possible, by basing their estimates on a rigorous analysis and clearly stating their assumptions,\u201d said Prof Wolfram Schlenker, at Columbia University, US.

But when it comes to per capita emissions the Netherlands ranks ninth \u2013 the highest of any EU country. A Dutch person emits twice as much as the global average and 1.5 times more than the average EU citizen.\n \u201cIf we are not to reduce our emissions as quickly as possible, who is?\u201d\nWith Urgenda\u2019s legal battle becoming a litmus test for the effectiveness of climate litigation, the judges\u2019 verdict \u2013 expected on 9 October \u2013 will be closely watched. \nChristiana Figueres, the former head of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said: \u201cUrgenda\u2019s bold action against the government of the Netherlands created an important new incentive for all governments to act expeditiously. \n\u201cGovernments must act boldly and urgently. The Urgenda climate case is evidence that this is not just what should be done, it\u2019s what must be done.\u201d \nThe World Meteorological Organization reported that last month was the third warmest April on record after 2016 and 2017, while Bering Sea ice cover fell to lowest level ever and a new CO2 ppm (parts per million) record was set. \nIn a sign of increased urgency in Brussels, the EU\u2019s climate commissioner, Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, called this month for member states \u201cto accelerate our efforts considerably and raise our ambition\u201d. \nA UN dialogue to begin the process of \u201cratcheting up\u201d climate pledges made at the Paris climate conference is under way, and seven EU states have called for the bloc to raise its ambitions. \nThe Netherlands was one of them, and Wiebes reportedly proposed a 55% cut in Europe\u2019s planet-warming emissions by 2030, describing the Dutch government as \u201cone of the frontrunners on climate policy\u201d. \nDomestically though, frustration with the slow pace of climate mitigation helped the Dutch Green party to more than triple its count of MPs in elections last year.\nJesse Klaver, the Greens\u2019 leader, told the Guardian: \u201cThe main reason for that is that citizens are fed up with a government that chooses the interests of fossil companies over the environment.\n \u201cThe Urgenda case made it possible to call the government to account. The tragedy of Dutch climate policy is that our governments always had goals, but were never able to fulfil them. The verdict showed that when they fail to act on climate change a court can tell a government: you have a responsibility to protect your people and to keep your commitments.\u201d\nClimate actions have often been hostage to the changing composition of national governments, and the Dutch parliament is currently working on a climate change bill to ensure policy continuity. \nAnne van Pinxteren, a government spokeswoman, said that while Rutte\u2019s administration expected to cut emissions by between 19-27% by 2020, the court judges had \u201cset a major legal precedent\u201d in altering its plans.\n\u201cThere is a chance that with current policy the emission reduction goal of the court will not be met,\u201d she said. \u201cIf that is the case, the state will have to take additional measures which will need to have an effect in the very short term. These will most likely not be cost-effective and/or have big consequences on society.\u201d\nEnvironmentalists, though, counter that the cost of the toughest climate action now pales by comparison to the estimated $30tn of damages that not meeting it could bring. \nMarjan Minnesma, Urgenda co-founder and director, told the Guardian: \u201cToday in court we showed that it would cost around 0.5% of our GDP to meet the climate measures that have been proposed. If it is necessary and we are an extremely rich country and we can avoid extremely high risks, we think it should be done.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/netherlands", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/mark-rutte", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Judges ordered a 25% carbon emissions cut by 2020 in the first successful lawsuit against a government\u2019s climate policy", "date_published": {"$date": 1527526120000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1527537690000}, "authors": ["Arthur Neslen"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Environment", "Netherlands", "Europe", "World news", "Mark Rutte"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/28/dutch-government-appeals-against-court-ruling-over-emissions-cuts", "og:description": "Judges ordered a 25% carbon emissions cut by 2020 in the first successful lawsuit against a government\u2019s climate policy", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd14fac40e281b73994a5776de2703617564ec3b/0_54_2356_1413/master/2356.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=11b11c4134c3b04af975940ac64221fc", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Dutch government appeals against court ruling over emissions cuts"}, "headline": "m", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd14fac40e281b73994a5776de2703617564ec3b/0_54_2356_1413/master/2356.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=24c8a816f215d84c34be28da78b20e17", "width": "2356", "height": "1413", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd14fac40e281b73994a5776de2703617564ec3b/0_54_2356_1413/master/2356.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c3e40e25fe3de8d52657daa3d4cf1b79", "description": "Marjan Minnesma, director of the environmental group Urgenda, arrives at court in The Hague prior to the appeal from the Dutch government.\nPhotograph: Jerry Lampen/AFP/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07e52a2c3613145ed8e68"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/29/cricket-natural-choice-world-leader-climate-change", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "In September 2017 Roosevelt Skerrit, the prime minister of Dominica, stood up in front of the UN general assembly. \u201cEden is broken,\u201d he said.\nSkerrit had travelled to New York from his devastated island nation, battered to bare-root nakedness by Hurricane Maria, which spat out homes and lives, leaving behind flooding, landslides and a crumpled infrastructure. The category five storm splintered the island\u2019s ancient forests, a Unesco world heritage site, ripping away the lush canopy to reveal a broken, brown reality.\nThe storm also razed the island\u2019s Windsor Park cricket stadium \u2013 and on Thursday a Rest of the World team take on the West Indies at Lord\u2019s to raise money for its restoration, and that of James Ronald Webster Park in Anguilla, ruined by hurricane Irma just two weeks earlier.\nThe game is a shining example of cricket acting for the common good. It will raise much-needed funds and the tickets, which are \u00a310 for children, are reasonable. The game is being held during the half-term holiday and will be shown on Sky. It brings together players from around the globe including Rashid Khan, Shahid Afridi, Thisara Perera, Dinesh Karthik, and Mitchell McClenaghan under the captaincy of Eoin Morgan for the Rest of the World.\nBut there is something missing. There has been no discussion of the reasons why the weather seems to be changing, what might be done to prevent it or why the hurricane season of 2017 was both so unprecedented and so brutal.\nNo one weather event can be categorically labelled as \u201ccaused by climate change\u201d. But scientists are confident that climate change is bringing more extreme weather events, and that it increases the severity of hurricanes, like Irma and Maria, as greenhouse gases trap energy in the atmosphere driving more powerful winds. Rising temperatures have led to higher sea levels, which in turn means bigger storm surges. Higher water temperatures lead to more evaporation of water into the air, and that means more rain and therefore a higher risk of flooding.\nSkerrit is in no doubt what is to blame for his island\u2019s repeated battering. In April he spoke of the country\u2019s plans to become the world\u2019s first climate resilient nation. But, he asked, what of the rest of the planet?\n\u201cIn the current system, those who reap the financial benefits from the emissions of greenhouse gasses are not those who carry the costs. As a result, there is an underinvestment in limiting climate change, mitigating its costs and reducing climate-related damage. That is no longer a viable situation. The time for talk, conventions and declarations is over. The time for action is now,\u201d said Skerrit.\nSo what does cricket do? There is for the game both a responsibility and an opportunity in tackling climate change. Cricket, and its followers, have an emotional and physical bond with the land in a way that few other field sports do. From the dustbowls of Ahmedabad to the lush pastures of the Somerset levels, cricket is its environment. It affects the batting conditions, the way the ball moves, the choice of players on the field, the way the game is played.\nA roll-call of incidents from the the last few years suggest the scale of future challenges the game will have to face, and the risks of doing nothing. Last October Irma and Maria hit the Caribbean; this February the Western Province Cricket Association cancelled all club and school cricket because of severe drought in Cape Town and the surrounding areas. \nIn 2016, 13 IPL games were moved from Maharashtra as parts of the state endured their worst drought for 100 years, and the control of water became a legal issue this April when the Mumbai high court forbade the Maharashtra Cricket Association from receiving water from the Pavana dam for its matches in Pune. \nLast December, air pollution in Delhi during the India v Sri Lanka Test resulted in players vomiting on the pitch and wearing face masks. Play was repeatedly held up and oxygen cylinders were brought into the dressing rooms. In England, 10 county grounds sit in cities where pollution levels exceed WHO recommendations. In the last month, a heatwave in Karachi has killed at least 65 people. And earlier this year, a report by the Climate Coalition named cricket as the game in the UK most likely to be affected by climate change.\n \u201cThere is clear evidence that climate change has had a huge impact on the game,\u201d said Dan Musson, the ECB\u2019s national participation manager, \u201cin the form of general wet weather and extreme weather events.\u201d\nGlamorgan, the sole Welsh voice in county cricket, have lost 1,300 overs of cricket since 2000 because of the weather. Their head of operations, Dan Cherry, is frank.\n\u201cLosing so much cricket is a county\u2019s worst nightmare \u2013 it affects the club at every level,\u201d he has said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult even for first-class counties to be commercially viable with such an impact.\u201d\nSteve Birks, the Trent Bridge groundsman, told the Cricket Paper only this month: \u201cThe rain is getting tropical, it is getting heavier. We\u2019re getting thunderstorms more often when it rains \u2013 I think that\u2019s when you can tell the difference.\u201d\nCricket must adapt to what the World Bank calls \u201cthe new climate normal\u201d but it must also become part of the solution. On the day of the IPL final, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) signed an agreement to promote green cricket, \u201cgreening operations and engaging cricketers and fans in green initiatives\u201d. The following months will give us an idea of how much the BCCI really cares, and how much is greenwash.\nBecoming a world leader, a shining example of good environmental practice would attract to cricket the much-desired growth audience \u2013 as well as being the right thing to do. Young people, in particular, care about the future of the planet in a way they might not care about, say, 100-ball cricket. Increasingly sponsors too are likely to look at environmental performance when calculating where to put their money.\nSo many things could be done quite easily \u2013 large and small \u2013 from carbon audits to sensible tour planning to reduce the number of flights, from encouraging spectators to travel to matches in sustainable ways to curbing single-use plastic use. Some grounds, Lord\u2019s and the Oval particularly, but also Edgbaston and Cardiff, are acting unilaterally, but cricket, and sport in general, is crying out for environmental leadership \u2013 how fabulous it would be if Thursday\u2019s match banged heads together. With 2.5bn fans worldwide, cricket has the potential to influence human behaviour in profound ways.\n\u2022 This is an extract taken from The Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.

He hands the weapon to Dane, and the pair crouch behind their snowmobile. Dane fires two quick shots. Two white partridges, almost invisible in the tree line, drop dead.\nDane runs to retrieve the birds, warming his hands against their bodies to ward off the chill from the cold wind whipping in from the North Atlantic Ocean.\nShiwak is an Inuit trapper and hunter who grew up relying on the wild bounty of Labrador. He takes his son out for trips like this every week, trying to pass on generations of knowledge around living off the land: how to collect firewood, hunt and fish, and travel safely in a place where the rhythm of life is still built upon ice and snow.\nBut he\u2019s running out of time.\nThe sea surrounding coastal Labrador is warming at an unprecedented rate, according to data from Canada\u2019s Department of Fisheries and Oceans.\nRobert Way, a climatologist based in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, said the region is a volatile place climatically, with extreme swings in the weather that can amplify \u2013 and sometimes mask \u2013 the changes that are happening. Compared to historical terms, winter is about six weeks shorter, while the region\u2019s sea ice coverage is about a third smaller than it was a decade ago.\n \u201cIf you look at the rate of warming from the late 1980s to 2015, this is one of the fastest warming places in the world. It\u2019s quite concerning,\u201d said Way.\nFor the people of Rigolet, a former trading post that is the southernmost Inuit community in Canada, the vanishing ice and increasingly unpredictable seasons means they\u2019re being forced to adapt in ways they never have before.\nLike generations of Inuit before him, Derrick Pottle is a trapper and hunter. His diet of wild game, salmon, berries, trout and seal would have been familiar to his ancestors who were living in Hamilton Inlet around 8,000 years ago.\nBut Pottle worries all the skills he\u2019s learned from older generations may soon become irrelevant. More and more, Inuit are relying on expensive, store-bought processed foods because it\u2019s safer and easier than catching or shooting supper.\nPottle\u2019s ancestors never experienced a time when their frozen world in northern Labrador was being altered so dramatically because of climate change. Shrinking ice packs and more severe weather has made travel increasingly difficult and dangerous, often cutting people off from other communities and traditional hunting lands.\nThere are no roads connecting Rigolet to other communities, so people here long ago came to rely on trails over the ice as their lifelines. But those frozen lifelines are increasingly unreliable, prone to sudden thaws, weak ice and dangerous openings.\nThe world may have warmed by around 1C (1.8F) over the past century but the Arctic far outstrips this global average and is warming at around twice the rate of the rest of the world.\nIn places, the rate of warming has been astonishing. Novembers in the Alaskan town of Utqia\u0121vik, formerly Barrow, are now 5.5C warmer than they were in 1979. This past winter, the warmest on record in the Arctic, saw some locations exceed 20C hotter than normal.\nThe Arctic is dominated by sea ice, unlike the Antarctic which is essentially a huge land-based ice sheet. As the ocean and atmosphere warm, sea ice is shrinking in extent, at around 13% a decade since 1979, according to Nasa. The bright white surface of ice, known as albedo, is giving way to the dark ocean, meaning that sunlight is being absorbed rather than reflected, amplifying the warming effect.\nThese \u201crapid and dramatic changes\u201d are introducing a \u201cnew normal\u201d to the Arctic, according to US government scientists in a report card last year. Storms are eroding away ice-free coastlines, summer wildfires are becoming fiercer and certain species, such as polar bears, are increasingly struggling to find food. This is all providing a major challenge to communities in the Arctic, but a boon to the shipping industry, which can navigate the area more easily. This task will get even simpler once the Arctic is ice free in summertimes, forecast as soon as 2040s.\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing changes that impact the way that we live,\u201d Pottle said. \u201cThe sea, the ice, the snow, it\u2019s all changing. You can\u2019t travel safely any more. Up and down the coast, it\u2019s the same thing. And it\u2019s changing right before our eyes.\u201d\nSome changes are more subtle. Summers have always been short here, and marked by tormenting swarms of black flies. But Paula McLean-Sheppard, a Nunatsiavut government employee, said she has been startled to see the insects arriving earlier and earlier in the spring.\n\u201cI was driving my truck last year and there was this big black cloud that suddenly appeared on the windshield. I had to use my wipers to clear it, I didn\u2019t know what it was,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the flies. It used to be the end of June before you saw your first fly. Now they\u2019re coming in May.\u201d\nRigolet\u2019s fishermen say new species are arriving in the bay, from cormorants to sharks to sea turtles, chasing warming waters and the food that comes with it. Seals, a key source of food and skin for waterproof clothes, are moving further and further up the bay as the sea ice vanishes. Others blame the decline of the region\u2019s caribou herd on the changing climate, too.\nSome of the changes are harder to see. McLean-Sheppard worries that as coastal Labrador\u2019s sea ice becomes increasingly unreliable, it\u2019s causing more anxiety among Inuit who feel stuck and unable to travel to catch their food. This past winter, the ice in the bay didn\u2019t freeze up until February, months later than normal. \n\u201cIt\u2019s especially hard on the hunters and providers because they can\u2019t get out on the land. They feel stuck,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re like an island, really. We need the ice to connect us.\u201d\nLiving off the land is still a big part of life in Labrador\u2019s coastal communities. Hunters provide meat to community freezers for sharing with seniors and others who can\u2019t catch their own food. The freezers are filled with Labrador\u2019s wild buffet, from partridge berries and Arctic char to moose, duck and goose meat. Each year the Rigolet community is allowed to kill two polar bears, and the meat is divided up for families up and down the rugged coastline.\nScientists say the impact of climate change on the Inuit psyche is significant, and only just beginning to be understood. Social workers worry it is leading to increased rates of drugs and alcohol abuse, in a place where the suicide rate far outstrips the national.\n\u201cThe land is not just the land for them. It\u2019s family, it\u2019s kin, it\u2019s part of you. Every aspect of Inuit culture grows from the land,\u201d said Ashlee Cunsolo, director of the Labrador Institute in Happy Valley-Goose Bay.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re the first generation that can\u2019t do that any more, that can\u2019t follow your ancestors on to the land, think about how devastating that can be from a cultural standpoint. It\u2019s a disruption to cultural traditions that have endured for hundreds of years.\u201d\nCunsolo is one of the leading researchers into the links between climate change and mental health. She says the rapid changes happening in coastal Labrador are causing the Inuit to feel increased feelings of anxiety, depression and grief. They sense something is being lost, she said.\n\u201cThese changes are disrupting hundreds of years of knowledge and wisdom and connection to the land. That\u2019s a scary thing for humanity,\u201d Cunsolo said.\nMany of the Inuit in Rigolet are just a generation removed from the government relocation programs of the 1960s, when families were forced to abandon their nomadic ways and settle in larger communities. They say it\u2019s in their blood to travel out into the wilderness. Inez Shiwak, who is working to preserve local Inuit culture in Rigolet, smiles when she says getting away from the village and into the wild is \u201clike taking your first breath when you were a baby\u201d.\nHer father Jack Shiwak, the village\u2019s mayor, said elders have noticed that the wind whipping in from the ocean is getting more severe. It can cause blinding snowstorms, and some people have been lost on snowmobile trails because of it. The unpredictable weather is causing some Inuit to reduce trips to their remote cabins, a tradition that dates backs to the days when fur trapping was a major industry in the region, he said.\n\u201cUntil five years ago, we\u2019d hardly miss a week of going to the cabin. We haven\u2019t been there is two years. It\u2019s just the weather,\u201d Shiwak said. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange feeling. We know things are changing, but you realize you can\u2019t stop it. The question is how we adapt.\u201d\nBack out on the frozen shoreline a few miles outside of the village, Martin Shiwak stops his snowmobile again and looks out over the bay. The sun is shining now and the hunter unzips his coat, remarking this is one of the mildest Marches he\u2019s ever seen.\nHe knows this wild land intimately. But lately he\u2019s starting to recognize it less and less. This is the first winter Shiwak couldn\u2019t cross nearby Lake Melville to go trapping because he couldn\u2019t trust the ice.

They were first published by the New York Times.\nSign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon \nFrom an Australian perspective, they give insight into Pruitt\u2019s proposed agenda and schedule. They discuss focusing on promoting \u201cinnovation deregulation\u201d, federal-state relations and how to counter potential disagreements with Australian officials about climate change. The EPA administrator rejects mainstream climate science and worked closely with fossil fuel companies to reduce environmental regulation when he was Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general.\nFreedman suggested that Pruitt meet several members of the Australian government including the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull (listed as \u201cMalcomb\u201d), the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, the trade minister, Steve Ciobo, and the then resources minister, Matt Canavan, along with Frydenberg.\nHe said an initial step should be to get a better sense of any US-Australian environmental agreements and whether they should be \u201cchanged or updated or cancelled and replaced with others\u201d. There is nothing in the emails to indicate that Australian officials agreed with this agenda.\nThe documents include an email from the executive director of the Institute of Public Affairs, John Roskam, in which he proposes a two-hour roundtable for Pruitt with IPA-affiliated researchers who disagree with the scientific consensus on climate change. They included a James Cook University geophysicist, Prof Peter Ridd and the IPA senior fellow Jennifer Marohasy, who has accused the Bureau of Meteorology of corrupting the temperature record and whom Roskam described as \u201cAustralia\u2019s authority on temperature and climate variability\u201d.\n\u201cAll of these people are excellent and I know Scott and his team would learn a great deal from a discussion with them,\u201d he wrote to Freedman.\nRoskam also recommended Pruitt meet Maurice Newman, a former chair of Tony Abbott\u2019s business advisory council who has described global warming as \u201ca delusion\u201d, the former Productivity Commission head Gary Banks and the economist Henry Ergas.\nThe IPA head wrote that he had spoken to the then Minerals Council chief, Brendan Pearson, who was \u201cworking with the [US] embassy\u201d on the trip. Pearson resigned from the council late last year after its biggest member, BHP, objected to the lobby group\u2019s advocacy for new coal plants under his leadership.\nIn emails to Pruitt\u2019s staff, Freedman described the IPA as a \u201cvery strong group for the administrator\u201d and a potential co-host of the trip. He said Pruitt\u2019s office had agreed invitations should be sought from the Turnbull government, the business lobby group the American Australian Council (of which Freedman is the treasurer) and Australian non-government organisations, including the IPA. \nThe consultant said discussions with the government would inevitably turn to matters on which the Trump administration differed from Australia, giving the example of climate change. He said it was important to be able to say \u201cwe agree to disagree\u201d on it. He recommended before the meetings that Pruitt get a briefing on the destruction of coral reefs by the Chinese to have as \u201ca good talking point\u201d when protection of the Great Barrier Reef came up in discussions with Australian officials.\nFreedman recommended that Pruitt meet the Victorian Labor government so that he could say he had met \u201cboth sides\u201d. He said visiting the state also made sense because it was \u201copen for business\u201d and doing creative things that could lead to US tech companies setting up headquarters there.\nHe said he would take advice from Frydenberg\u2019s office on meeting the federal opposition. He had been in direct contact with the minister and had had conversations with his office and the embassy.\nA spokesman for Frydenberg said the minister had invited Pruitt to Australia when they met in the US last year.\n\u201cThe administrator expressed an interest and was keen to learn more about Australia\u2019s cooperative federalism and \u2018one-stop-shop\u2019 environmental approvals process,\u201d he said in an emailed response. \u201cGiven Mr Pruitt cancelled his trip to Australia, no meetings reached final confirmation.\u201d\nThe spokesman said Frydenberg and Freedman knew each other through the Australian-American Leadership Dialogue.\nRoskam said Freedman, the US embassy in Canberra and the US consulate in Melbourne had approached the IPA about Pruitt\u2019s potential visit. He said the organisation had welcomed the chance to \u201cwork closely with the world\u2019s leading advocate for cutting environmental red tape\u201d.\nThe emails released to the Sierra Club include tourist and dinner recommendationssuch as a trip to Uluru and breakfast at the Boathouse restaurant in Sydney, which Freedman said was owned by the former trade minister Andrew Robb, whom the ex-lobbyist described as \u201ca good friend\u201d.\nPruitt faces 11 federal investigations in the US, including into his spending on travel and his business relationships with lobbyists. Freedman worked on national security-related issues for Trump\u2019s transition team but was removed after using a personal email address to conduct government business.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/epa", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/josh-frydenberg", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/institute-of-public-affairs"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Scott Pruitt\u2019s cancelled trip would have promoted \u2018innovation deregulation\u2019, emails released under FoI show", "date_published": {"$date": 1525399857000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1533706791000}, "authors": ["Adam Morton"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change scepticism", "US Environmental Protection Agency", "Australian politics", "US news", "US politics", "Environment", "Climate change", "Australia news", "Josh Frydenberg", "Institute of Public Affairs"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/04/climate-sceptic-group-ipa-suggested-as-co-host-of-australian-visit-by-trumps-environment-chief", "og:description": "Scott Pruitt\u2019s cancelled trip would have promoted \u2018innovation deregulation\u2019, emails released under FoI show", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/794fe4e09e81a82fdf16a54aba62a05aa05fac90/509_447_2967_1781/master/2967.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=4170bd7fdf0bfbb70a52a8fc71bbd53d", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Climate sceptic group IPA suggested as co-host of Australian visit by Trump's environment chief"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/794fe4e09e81a82fdf16a54aba62a05aa05fac90/509_447_2967_1781/master/2967.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=58d4cf3583bcd5cba2d4d6cec92866a2", "width": "2967", "height": "1781", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/794fe4e09e81a82fdf16a54aba62a05aa05fac90/509_447_2967_1781/master/2967.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5de44835b11bbe99274a2cc68c1e5727", "description": "An organiser of Scott Pruitt\u2019s Australian visit suggested the Institute of Public Affairs should be a co-host.\nPhotograph: Aaron P Bernstein/Reuters"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07dcea2c3613145ed8e3b"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/04/weatherwatch-why-does-antarctic-ice-melt-in-the-depths-of-winter", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Scientists have long known that the amount of ice in the Antarctic is steadily decreasing. They were surprised, however, to discover recently that up to a quarter of the melting occurs in the depth of winter, when the average temperature is 15C below freezing. The melting is caused by a phenomenon called the f\u00f6hn effect.\nThe f\u00f6hn or foehn wind was first noted in the Alps, and occurs when a wind blowing over mountains descends on the far side. The increase in pressure at lower altitude causes the mass of air to warm up by about one degree per hundred metres. Such a wind blowing down from a high mountain range can easily rise above freezing. The Chinook wind in the Rocky Mountains is sometimes called \u201csnow eater\u201d for its capacity to strip snow from the slopes.\nThe winter Antarctic ice melt was discovered by a team led by Peter Kuipers Munneke of Utrecht University, using data from satellites and unmanned weather stations. It was presented to the European Geosciences Union in Vienna in April. The Antarctic has the highest elevation of any continent, and consequently fierce f\u00f6hn winds.

All 10 were reference books or scientific articles. The updated world map of the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification boasted 2,830,341 citations, easily surpassing what came in at No 2, a paper published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry that had 21,350 citations.\nFinlayson said the popularity of the paper emphasised the importance of open science, which is the concept that data and findings should be openly and freely available so that others can use and benefit from them. Wikipedia operates on a similar concept, and credible citations are crucial to the encyclopaedia\u2019s reliability.\n\u201cThe journal we originally published the paper in is free and open access, and we chose the journal for that reason,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople noticed and said, \u2018Hey, we have an updated climate map, we\u2019ll use that\u2019, and then it spread.\u201d \nAt the time, open access journals were rare.\n\u201cI have always been a supporter of open science,\u201d Finlayson said. \u201cResearch is no good to anyone locked in a cupboard, or published in a journal you have to pay a lot of money to access.\u201d\nHe said he first began working with paper co-author McMahon in 1981, and that they got to know Murray, who is \u201ca fair bit younger,\u201d when he became one of their PhD students. \n\u201cHe did his PhD on global hydrology and kept working with us in that area over the years, and we are all still very good friends and kept publishing together,\u201d Finlayson, now 73, said. \u201cWe agree on most of the serious things and then every now and then we have differences of opinion. So we talk about it, and then we set out to test who is right, and write a paper on the results.\n\u201cIf you want to form an academic group of people who work together well, the fact that they\u2019re friends helps a lot.

Tragically we are still in Eurovision. \nBut as coal becomes as loathed as whale harpooning, Australians are subject to drone attack at home and assassination abroad because we are blamed for the immense death tolls in Bangladesh and other low-lying countries now subject to regular inundations. That has lead to an alliance of ASEAN nations blockading us, and Jihadists across South East Asia attacking us for our folly. What did we do wrong? We failed to give up our addiction to coal. We built more coal fired power stations when Abbott returned as PM in 2018, we locked ourselves in. We failed to commit to the scientific reality of global warming, we kept clearing land, and driving huge SUV's. We pretended it wasn't happening...until it was too late. Too late for the Reef, too late for the Pacific Islands, too late for the Gold Coast, too late for Calcutta. \nSometimes the Australian insistence on no worries is the stupidest denial of all.

We need firmer action. But increasing the government levies on air travel \u2013 forcing up prices to get people to fly less \u2013 isn\u2019t the answer. This would have little impact on the most affluent travellers, while hitting the poorest in society.\nInstead we should look to carbon trading schemes for inspiration. In schemes running in the EU and some areas of the US, international organisations or governments sign up to a total limit on carbon emissions. They then issue companies with permits that allow them to emit a certain amount of carbon. It\u2019s then up to the companies to trade the permits. Companies that want to emit more can buy permits from those that manage to reduce their carbon emissions.\nWe could develop a similar system for flights. Everyone could be given an air mile allowance \u2013 say enough for one long-haul return flight a year, or three short-haul flights, so people with families on the other side of the world could see them once a year. If you don\u2019t want to use your allowance, you could sell it off in a government-regulated online marketplace. If you\u2019re keen to do a holiday a month, you\u2019ll have to buy your allowance from someone else.\nThis would be far preferable to increasing tax on airline tickets. It would be redistributive: everyone gets a certain number of air miles, but if you\u2019d rather get the thousands of pounds you could command for them on the online marketplace, you\u2019re free to sell them. Same if you\u2019re just not that bothered about going abroad. But if you want to go over your allowance, it will be at a cost.\nOf course there would be lots of practical objections. Businesses would hate this \u2013 but they, like individuals, could be assigned a certain number of miles that they could supplement or sell, and it might encourage them to actually invest in the technology that can facilitate meetings between people continents apart. Perhaps the hardest aspect would be getting some sort of agreement on an international scale. But we\u2019re only going to make a dent in climate change by doing something pretty radical.\nCutting global air travel may be only part of the solution but an individual cap on air travel \u2013 that people can trade with each other as they wish \u2013 could help reduce the impact flying has on our environment. It\u2019s certainly better than the alternatives \u2013 crossing our fingers and hoping people suddenly discover an environmental conscience even if it does mean missing out on that weekend in the sun, or whacking up green taxes in a way that adversely affects less affluent families.\n\u2022 Sonia Sodha is the Observer\u2019s chief leader writer", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbonfootprints", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ethical-living", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/flights", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "An individual cap on air travel, that people can trade, would help th reduce the impact of flying, says Sonia Sodha, Observer chief leader writer", "date_published": {"$date": 1525852842000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1525858198000}, "authors": ["Sonia Sodha"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Air transport", "World news", "Environment", "UK news", "Climate change", "Carbon footprints", "Ethical and green living", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Flights", "Travel"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/09/cut-emissions-flights-air-travel-flying", "og:description": "An individual cap on air travel, that people can trade, would help th reduce the impact of flying, says Sonia Sodha, Observer chief leader writer", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf6843ac0ebdd1d9f46269463b9304e685a1314a/0_239_3681_2209/master/3681.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=c37577f6782b7f8b4a41b07cb2c1ad4e", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "A radical way to cut emissions \u2013 ration everyone\u2019s flights | Sonia Sodha"}, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf6843ac0ebdd1d9f46269463b9304e685a1314a/0_239_3681_2209/master/3681.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=037de8a5a3689fbdf516175757e6fa65", "width": "3681", "height": "2209", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf6843ac0ebdd1d9f46269463b9304e685a1314a/0_239_3681_2209/master/3681.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ec64f0c1f0f559e4d7e4aa893dde92d8", "description": "\u2018We\u2019re only going to make a dent in climate change by doing something pretty radical.\u2019\nPhotograph: Alamy"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07de0a2c3613145ed8e44"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2018/may/11/should-vegan-rise-podcast-contribute", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Supporters\u2019 voices are essential to our monthly podcast, We Need to Talk About\u2026, whether our subject matter is Brexit, nationalism or the environment. In our next podcast, we\u2019ll consider the rise of veganism as a lifestyle choice \u2013 why are so many are opting to go vegan, and what are the implications for society?\nSince Guardian columnist Decca Aitkenhead wrote about her own vegan experiment, and we published a long read on the topic, we have had a huge number of responses \u2013 from readers, academics, experts and others. Defying naysayers\u2019 predictions that it was yet another hipster food fad, adopting a plant-based lifestyle is becoming a popular choice for people for many different reasons. We\u2019ve invited Decca into the studio to host our next podcast and we\u2019d love you, the Guardian\u2019s supporters, to pose questions to her for the discussion. \nHave you or a family member recently adopted a vegan lifestyle? Have you been driven by ethical, health, environmental or financial factors? If the factors are environmental, are you concerned mostly with deforestation, biodiversity loss, or something that affects you more locally? If you made the choice for health reasons, have you noticed the benefits and have you found it easy to eat a balanced diet? Is it a decision you made alone or as a family? Is it something you tried but later decided against? Perhaps you are a lifelong vegan and you are relieved to see it becoming more mainstream?\nAnother point for discussion could focus around the role of social media in the rise of veganism. There are a number of Netflix documentaries on the subject; there are Instagram influencers and prominent academics who are becoming vegan. Perhaps it works for them, but is it for everyone? There have also been concerns that veganism provides a socially acceptable cover for disordered eating. You might want to discuss the potential issues around this surge in public curiosity. Or explore how your consumption and habits have changed in recent years. Are you sceptical about the rise of veganism, or inspired by it? How can farmers and food producers adapt to better cater to the change in demand? \nPlease do get in touch, wherever you are in the world: we would like to hear your questions, views and experiences. To get involved, send an email to weneedtotalkabout@theguardian.com, including your question or comment, your name, and a phone number so we can call you to make a recording. \nIf you\u2019d like to catch up with the podcast and previous discussions, you can do so at gu.com/talk-about.\n*As of 2pm on Wednesday 16 May, we are no longer accepting submissions for this podcast.

Glacier National Park in Montana has seen some of the most dramatic recorded losses, with glaciers set to disappear from the park as early as 2030.\nGlobally, glaciers have lost around 400bn tons in mass a year since 1994, which is raising concerns for the millions of people and animals that rely upon glaciers for melt water. The retreat of huge glaciers in Antarctica and Greenland is also driving sea level rise.\nThe decline of glaciers has previously been illustrated by comparative pictures showing how the modern ice masses looked several decades previously, and more recently. But individual images of modern glaciers can also contain evidence of retreat, according to Lisa McKeon, a physical scientist at the US Geological Society.\n\u201cPictures don\u2019t really show the loss in ice volume but they can show the loss of area,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can see previous moraines, which are rocks pushed by a glacier\u2019s movement, far from the current edge of the glacier.\u201d\nMcKeon has previously exhibited her own collection of comparative photos of glacier retreat at various galleries, where she left a comment book for visitors to log their thoughts.\n\u201cI\u2019ve perused the comment book for the past two years or so, there\u2019s a lot of sadness there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s change. It evokes a sense of loss.\u201d \nFisher\u2019s book contains 177 pictures, many of them taken in precarious conditions, as the wind tossed the 69-year-old Piper PA11 plane that Fisher\u2019s grandfather refurbished after he found it in a dilapidated condition in a North Carolina barn in the 1980s.\n\u201cI learned to fly in this plane,\u201d said Fisher, who is from New York state but has spent a lot of time in Colorado and studied Rocky Mountain National Park there. \u201cThere is no heat, the door had to be open when taking pictures so there was an ungodly cold. The plane only has 100 horsepower but when you get to 15,000ft it only has around half of that. I would just go off on my own and hope the engine didn\u2019t fail.\u201d\nFlying over Glacier National Park, in Montana, was the most challenging because of the \u201cmost absurd terrain, the extreme wind, the concentration of grizzly bears if I did have to land \u2013 I really didn\u2019t want to go down there,\u201d Fisher said.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/global/us-national-and-state-parks", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Glaciers, which are vast masses of snow and ice, are receding at varying rates around the world due to rising global temperatures", "date_published": {"$date": 1526464857000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1526469148000}, "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Glaciers", "Climate change", "Environment", "US national and state parks holidays", "US news", "Climate change"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/16/rocky-mountain-glaciers-melting-climate-change-photos-garrett-fisher", "og:description": "Glaciers, which are vast masses of snow and ice, are receding at varying rates around the world due to rising global temperatures", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/160a4f9edb5ddcbce0f385422273f8424bfe5c52/0_34_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=1bb8b51df148ed44c9905aab7605e172", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "One man's race to capture the Rocky Mountains glaciers before they vanish"}, "headline": "O", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/160a4f9edb5ddcbce0f385422273f8424bfe5c52/0_34_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=723d201cf2b5dd20a54c74a2e81c9447", "width": "1000", "height": "600", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/160a4f9edb5ddcbce0f385422273f8424bfe5c52/0_34_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b2695fa2e2311d03675071fb2e398ed5", "description": "Mammoth Glacier, Wind River Range in Wyoming.\nPhotograph: Garrett Fisher"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0292f3c1d09bae976a5c9b8c26a3258b0fb6e43d/0_66_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e1f9a18716135416dc6eaa5811654423", "width": "1000", "height": "600", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0292f3c1d09bae976a5c9b8c26a3258b0fb6e43d/0_66_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7813fa9a1f1a7597b8c84f52126f8a41", "description": "Wind River Range in Wyoming contains several major rivers that provide water for a large surrounding area.

Questioning scientist Phil Duffy of the Woods Hole Research Center, Brooks postulated that silt and mud washed by rivers into the ocean caused water levels to rise as it settled on the sea floor. \u201cNow you have got less space in those oceans because the bottom is moving up,\u201d he said. \nHe went on: \u201cWhat about the White Cliffs of Dover \u2026 [and] California, where you have the waves crashing against the shorelines, and time and time again you have the cliffs crashing into the sea? All of that displaces water which forces it to rise, does it not?\u201d\nDuffy answered: \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure on human timescales, those are minuscule effects.\u201d\nThe questioning went on as Brooks argued the Antarctic ice sheet was actually growing. A recent study reported that the ice sheet had shrunk by 1,463km from 2010 to 2016.\nDuffy disagreed, noting that \u201cwe have satellite records clearly documenting a shrinkage of the Antarctic ice sheet and an acceleration of that shrinkage\u201d, citing \u201cthe National Snow and Ice Data Center and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u201d for his data.\nHowever, Brooks insisted: \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got a Nasa base in my district, and apparently, they\u2019re telling you one thing and me a different thing.\u201d\nBrooks said: \u201cThere are plenty of studies that have come that show with respect to Antarctica that the total ice sheet, particularly that above land, is increasing, not decreasing. Now, you could make a different argument if you want to talk about Greenland or the Arctic.\u201d\nBrooks, a graduate of Duke University and University of Alabama School of Law, was first elected to Congress in 2010 from his North Alabama district.

George Monbiot (The UK government wants to put a price on nature \u2013 but that will destroy it, 15 May) suggests that in efforts to save\u00a0the natural world there are\u00a0grave dangers in putting a \u201cprice\u00a0on nature\u201d.\nYet one reason we are failing to do what is necessary is because nature is still seen as \u201cnice to have\u201d, rather than essential in sustaining our health, wealth and security. Many companies, economists and governments regard environmental destruction as a regrettable but inevitable consequence of economic growth \u2013 the \u201cprice of progress\u201d. If we don\u2019t change this mindset, then there will be little prospect for the revolution in ideas that is needed to avoid a mass extinction event and disastrous climatic changes.\u00a0\nNature underpins our economy, society and very existence. Talking\u00a0about the economic contribution of the natural world does not lead to a price on nature, but rather it helps explain its hidden\u00a0values. Talking about how we rely on healthy nature does not require conservationists to abandon their love of nature, their spiritual connections with it or the\u00a0moral case for action. It does, however, add one more crucial argument for the kind of changes we need to secure.Tony JuniperDirector of advocacy and campaigns, WWF\n\u2022 George Monbiot says trying to account for the value of nature will inevitably lead to its commodification and destruction. But our global economic system already places economic values on the natural world \u2013 and has done so for centuries. The problem is that the price placed on ecosystems and biodiversity is effectively zero. Our economies see these things as worthless because we have failed to measure, understand and account for the true value of nature\u2019s riches. Markets remain largely blind to these benefits, and thus we consume them to the point of destruction.\nMonbiot is incorrect when he says that \u201cprice represents an expectation of payment, in accordance with market rates\u201d. In fact, price represents the attribution of economic value. Natural capital does not prepare nature for sale; it calls attention to the worth of what is lost. We have argued that all human prosperity rests on nature, and Monbiot is correct to point out that many natural resources are irreplaceable. Unfortunately, until we place a proper value on natural capital, the global economic system will continue to merrily saw away at the branch we\u2019re all sitting on. Decades of well-intentioned conservation have done little; a new approach is required. Properly valuing the huge, irreplaceable natural contributions that we all depend on is a good place to start.Cameron Hepburn Professor of environmental economics, Smith School, University of Oxford, and director of economics of sustainability, INET, Oxford Martin School, Alex Teytelboym Associate professor, Department of Economics, University of Oxford, Francois Cohen Senior research officer, INET Oxford Martin, Kirk Hamilton Visiting professor, Department of Geography and Environment, LSEGreen Economy Coalition \n\u2022 I would certainly agree that calculating the value of nature only in economic terms is sterile and meaningless. However, in dealing with a government that demonstrates its only values are driven by economic considerations, the Natural Capital Committee has been a consistent supporter of environmental causes and gained the support of many environmental groups such as the Woodland Trust and Green Alliance. No doubt some conservatives would want the committee to take a narrow approach to their terms of reference, but they have clearly taken as wide an approach as possible and support many of the causes that Monbiot holds dear. Using economic and financial arguments for environmental causes, as Mr Monbiot often does himself, should not be seen as a threat, but as a source of vital support.Ira UnellNottinghamshire\n\u2022 George Monbiot rightly cites Michael Sandel\u2019s excellent book What Money Can\u2019t Buy. I have found Sandel\u2019s analysis to be enormously helpful in my work with city leaders. After the financial crash of 2008 many advocated new laws to rein in greed and force bankers to act more responsibly. These steps are still needed. But, as Monbiot affirms, Sandel identified an even bigger challenge: \u201cThe most fateful change that unfolded during the past three decades was not an increase in greed. It was the expansion of markets, and of market values, into spheres of life where they don\u2019t belong.\u201d Making a stand against market values is now more important than ever.Robin HambletonEmeritus professor of city leadership, University of the West of England\n\u2022 Jason W Moore in Capitalism in the Web of Life argues that appropriating \u201ccheap nature\u201d (raw materials, energy, food, labour, including women\u2019s reproductive labour) is the fundamental condition allowing capital to extract its surplus from the production process. Forcing up the price of \u201cnature\u201d is therefore one of the best strategies for hastening the demise of capitalism, an outcome devoutly to be wished for all on the green left.\nTrue, putting up a \u201cThis is not for sale\u201d notice (fencing off rewilded land, leaving oil in the ground) is one of the best tactics for pushing up prices. But we still need to eat, to reproduce, and to produce the means of subsistence, and sometimes an exorbitant price (for example, on pollinating insects, on childcare or on clean water) might work better. So maybe the best approach is purely tactical: keep both critiques, incompatible as they are, in mind, and apply whichever is more likely in particular circumstances to achieve the desirable outcome.\nThis approach best reflects the point that actually there is no natural world separate from the sphere of human endeavour; each is the creation of the other, and both market values and intrinsic values are human constructs for us to manage as best we can.Richard MiddletonCastle Douglas, Dumfries and Galloway\n\u2022 I think George Monbiot may have missed the point. What if we valued nature at replacement cost? What if we charged palm oil producers the cost of restoring the environment so that numbers of orangutans returned to former levels? What if we valued nature generally at what it would cost to regenerate the passenger pigeon, the dodo, or countless other species of animals, birds, fish and plants \u2013 and the ecology on which they would depend? In practical terms, since we have no idea how to do that, the cost and therefore the value would be infinite. Let economists put that in their models and see what happens.Robert DimmickReading, Berkshire\n\u2022 If the government and conservation organisations continue to insist that monetary values be ascribed to woodland and wildlife, the risk is that a development scheme that can create value \u00a31 in excess of the supposed worth of your local woods will be economically compelling and will inevitably go ahead, replacing \u201cnatural capital\u201d with housing capital or retail capital. Perhaps a solution would be to say that many natural \u201cassets\u201d are of infinite value, being unique locally or having an indefinite past and future (if left alone). People could be encouraged to list their local meadows, riverbanks, etc as being infinitely valuable, and then it would be impossible to mount an economic argument that they should be built upon.Dominic RaynerLeeds\n\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/animals", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/plants", "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/economy", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Letters: Readers respond for and against George Monbiot, including Tony Juniper of WWF", "date_published": {"$date": 1526658013000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1526677224000}, "authors": ["Letters"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Wildlife", "Environment", "Animals", "Plants", "Economic policy", "Politics", "Economics", "Climate change", "Conservation", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Michael Sandel"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/18/will-putting-a-price-on-nature-devalue-its-worth", "og:description": "Letters: Readers respond for and against George Monbiot, including Tony Juniper of WWF", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb59b577ed0b38b8dae1ed1d8fd34a19c8190968/0_143_4281_2569/master/4281.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=cfb16b6685ed2ff781aa09f089656a5e", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Will putting a price on nature devalue its worth? | Letters"}, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb59b577ed0b38b8dae1ed1d8fd34a19c8190968/0_143_4281_2569/master/4281.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ff99f4a0202f3a47104767c32b2caa50", "width": "4281", "height": "2569", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb59b577ed0b38b8dae1ed1d8fd34a19c8190968/0_143_4281_2569/master/4281.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1416acb5eed1ca0e35801c2cfa469c0d", "description": "\u2018What if we charged palm oil producers the cost of restoring the environment so that numbers of orangutans returned to former levels?\u2019, asks Robert Dimmick.

But the criticism by government members highlighted yet again the Liberal party\u2019s policy of pretending to care about something while simultaneously doing everything to work against it.\nPeter Dutton and Tasmanian senator Eric Abetz bought into the issue of the ABC\u2019s coverage of the royal wedding off the back of erroneous reporting in News Corp papers suggesting the ABC had flown hosts Annabel Crabb and Jeremy Fernandez to London in business class. Abetz, who is never one to miss an opportunity to slight the ABC, echoed Dutton\u2019s thoughts when he suggested he would \u201cwould like to see the justification for flying those two over when there is a crew permanently in London\u201d.\nIt is the standard operating procedure of the Liberal party: cut funding to the ABC that in effect is designed to ensure it struggles to do a professional job, then either criticise it for not being up to scratch or, when it does something professionally, criticise it for wasting money.\nIt\u2019s the cannot-win argument. Had the ABC taken the cheaper option, Abetz and his ilk would have screamed about how the ABC disrespected the monarchy and Australians by not treating the event with the appropriate level of attention.\nBut really, all this talk about the ABC from Abetz and Dutton is just a continuation of the long run of the Liberal party being disingenuously concerned about things it is actively against.\nTake the gender \u200bgap in parliament. There are a lot of furrowed brows within the Liberal party at the moment after the \u200b dumping of frontbencher Jane Prentice as a candidate at the next election, and challenges to Victorian senator Jane Hume and NSW MP Ann Sudmalis, have made it rather all too clear just how few women they have in the parliament.\nOnly 13 of the 76 Liberal party MPs are women \u2013 rather a long way from its target of having 50% of women contesting \u201cwinnable seats\u201d by 2025.\nAnd yet, rather than introducing a quota to achieve this target, which has been proven to work (as the ALP has done and which now has women accounting for 47% of its MPs), it has instead chosen to throw money at the problem.\nKelly O\u2019Dwyer has established a fund to help financially support \u200bfemale candidates. And while no doubt the aim is good, even this very market-based option has been attacked by those within the Liberal party.\nDemonstrating the strong inherent bias against doing anything to improve the gender gap, \u200b Eric Abetz (yes, once again) suggested the fund was not \u201cnecessarily consistent with the Liberal philosophy\u201d.\nActually the fund is very much in keeping with that philosophy \u2013 it will do nothing to overcome the systemic bias against women but it looks like they\u2019re trying to do something about it.\nWe get a policy that barely looks like they\u2019re trying to achieve something and which is designed not to achieve its aim\nIt\u2019s much like their position on climate change.\nMany in the Liberal party wish to do nothing about it, and those who do are mostly content to do something that looks like something while studiously avoiding the one solution that has been shown to work.\nThe latest greenhouse gas emissions data released by the Department of Environment last week showed that during the carbon price period emissions continually fell, and since its end they have continually risen.\nAnd yet Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg \u2013 in the spirit of the Liberal party philosophy \u2013 have to come up with a policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that avoids not just putting a price on carbon but even looking like doing so. Thus we get a policy that barely even looks like they\u2019re trying to achieve something and which is clearly designed not to achieve its aim.\nAnd of course, economic policy is not excused from the pretence of care or accompanying lack of policy.\nThe latest wage growth figures showed yet again that wages have not risen in real terms in the past year. This is a problem for the government because, while the Liberal party has long been a champion of keeping wages growth down in the name of \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d, its budget is very much in favour of it.\nThe budget\u2019s predictions for strong income tax growth in 2020-21 and 2021-22 are based on wages growth returning to 3.5%. Were that to occur, the budget predicts real wages would grow by 1% in those years.\nAnd yet how is this to be achieved? Right now the only wages policy is company tax cuts in the hope that increased investment will improve productivity, which will then (eventually) flow through into stronger wage growth.\nBut in the meantime, the Liberal party has actively sought to reduce workers\u2019 collective bargaining power through increased intervention in union activity, cheered the removal of penalty rates, and strenuously argued against any government intervention that might see a greater increase in the minimum wage.\nAnd add to that their long history of criticism whenever a union either seeks or achieves a decent pay raise.\nBack in January 2014, the then minister for employment, Eric Abetz (yes, again), warned that unless businesses stood up to unions\u2019 pay demands, we risked seeing a \u201cwages explosion\u201d. At the time, overall wages were growing at just 2.7% and not one industry had annual wages growth above 3.5%, which is now the target for all wages for three years\u2019 time.\nShould wages growth ever actually reach the optimistic levels predicted in the budget, you can bet Liberal party MPs will decry the unions destroying our competitiveness and seek to implement ever more interventionist policy to reduce what power they have left.\nAnd no doubt, in the tradition of the cannot-win argument, they will then criticise unions for failing to deliver for their members.

After all, aren't companies just unions of capital. People come together to pool their resources for a better bargaining position. Why should labour be discouraged from doing the same?As much as I admire the progress you have made in recognising that structural poverty and structural extreme wealth are indeed built into the system by rules and laws (as two sides of the same coin) it is interesting that you still seem fixed on the idea that minimum wages cannot increase. Is that because the system simply cannot pay people enough to get them out of poverty? It would break, meaning poverty is deeply embedded in the system as an essential component? If it can pay them enough then why doesn't the government encourage just that, instead of opposing it? The question is still there Felix. Housing along with transport, energy, food and health is an essential and inflation amongst them is at 3.5%, well above wage rises.This mean the lowest paid who spend nearly all their income on essentials are going backwards fast.", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "116021139", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "you are correct in suggesting changing the rules", "effect": "that is ok you know"}, {"cause": "the system simply can not pay people enough to get them out of poverty", "effect": "is that"}]}, {"id": "116036226", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1526851559000}, "author": "Izaalien", "author_id": "16378023", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Landry told the ABC she was \u201ctotally appalled\u201d by the move and said she had been contacted by despairing young women members wanting to quit the party.\nWomen in the L/NP can now realise that they don't belong to a political party.They belong to an arrogant \"Old white school boys private club\" and women are merely token window dressing to fool the general public.", "recommendation_count": "11", "in_reply_to": "116035832", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "116036041", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1526850829000}, "author": "reinhardpolley", "author_id": "16020012", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Thanks for the heads-up, it was actually a double error as the worst hypocrites are Liberal dries, not the wets..", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "116008310", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "116024081", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1526823017000}, "author": "familygardener", "author_id": "14346031", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "The right will never forgive him for his support for marriage equality.He is one of the few true Liberals left in that cabal.", "recommendation_count": "2", "in_reply_to": "116023400", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "116035997", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1526850651000}, "author": "nuthin2seehere", "author_id": "16519776", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Ja?

It seems as though disputing established climate science is House Republicans\u2019 favorite hobby. This time, it was Philip Duffy\u2019s turn to spend two hours playing whack-a-mole with the committee Republicans\u2019 endless supply of long-debunked climate myths.\nRep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) claimed that sea level rise is due to the White Cliffs of Dover tumbling into the ocean (yes, really), and his colleagues argued that scientists in the 1970s were predicting global cooling, that Earth is just returning to its \u201cnormal temperature,\u201d that Antarctic ice is growing, and sea levels are hardly rising. \nNice rejoinder to yesterday's silliness about rocks (and not melting ice) raising sea-level. You need an 8 mile diameter, 6 quadrillion pound rock (every year) to reproduce the observed sea-level rise. that's a really big rock! https://t.co/MQgTaYpdlq https://t.co/N8kmIgBDLh\nThose last two claims originated from a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) editorial entered into the Congressional record by Chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX), written by Fred Singer. As the group Ozone Action documented, Singer has been a lifetime contrarian on virtually every scientific subject imaginable - acid rain, nuclear winter, nuclear waste, nuclear war, ozone depletion, secondhand smoke, amphibian population loss, and even minimum wage benefits. In recent decades he\u2019s worked for a plethora of fossil fuel-funded think tanks, denying established climate science.\nSinger\u2019s WSJ editorial is difficult to follow, largely because it contradicts itself several times, saying:\nthere is also good data showing sea levels are in fact rising at an accelerating rate ... to keep the rate of rise constant, as observed...\nObviously if sea level rise is accelerating, it\u2019s not increasing at a constant rate. The WSJ later \u201ccorrected\u201d that first sentence, thus removing one of the few accurate statements in the editorial - sea level rise is indeed accelerating.\nThe article has been updated from \u201cdata showing sea levels are in fact rising at an accelerating rate\u201d to \u201cin fact rising at a constant rate\u201dwhich doesn\u2019t make it more correct.@WSJopinion @jamestaranto why the quiet update? pic.twitter.com/l9IftFNpSB\nSinger\u2019s explanation for why the accelerating sea level rise isn\u2019t accelerating likewise contradicts itself:\nthe temperature of sea water has no direct effect on sea-level rise \u2026 accumulation of ice on the Antarctic continent has been offsetting the steric effect [sea level rise due to warming temperatures] for at least several centuries.\nHere, Singer first claims that the basic physics of thermal expansion is wrong, or at least somehow doesn\u2019t apply to ocean water, but then argues it is real and is merely being offset by ice growth on Antarctica. The latter claim is of course also wrong \u2013 Antarctica has been losing land ice and a recent study found that it\u2019s responsible for 8% of sea level rise since 1993 (thermal expansion is the biggest contributor, at 42%). \nAs one sea level researcher at Climate Feedback described Singer\u2019s editorial, \u201cIf this were an essay in one of my undergraduate classes, he would fail.\u201d The whole thing is complete nonsense, denying basic physics, and yet was published in the WSJ and entered into the congressional record. This is the material that House Republicans and their conservative media allies who reject climate science and oppose all climate policies find most compelling. That says a lot about the state of climate denial on the American right today.\nLatest #WallStreetJournal op-ed \"The Sea Is Rising, but Not Because of Climate Change\".Stay tuned for these great followup @WSJ op-eds:\"Objects are falling, but Not Because of Gravity\"\"Continents are moving, but Not Because of Plate Tectonics\"..https://t.co/GW7NHaZamT\nAround the same time, Politico ran a story written by Jonathan Lesser, who\u2019s an energy industry consultant with the Koch-, Mercer-, tobacco industry-, and Exxon-funded Manhattan Institute (which Politico failed to mention). It claims, based on a Manhattan Institute report written by Lesser, that \u201cmore electric cars and trucks will mean more pollution.\u201d\nThis conclusion rests upon a number of shaky assumptions. First, it considers not today\u2019s power grid mix, but rather the US Energy Information Administration (EIA)\u2019s projections out to the year 2050. The EIA is notorious for underestimating the growth of clean energy, and projects that coal will continue to supply 22% of US electricity 32 years hence. To put this in perspective, the share of US electricity supplied by coal fell from 51% in 2008 to 31% in 2016. According to an analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists, nearly half of the remaining coal plants will likely retire or convert to natural gas in the near future. In short, the EIA is unrealistically bullish on fossil fuels.\nElectricity generated by burning coal produces significant air pollution, and so using these assumptions, Lesser concludes that American electric cars will generate more air pollutants that are harmful to human health than gasoline-powered cars. But if the electricity generated to charge electric vehicles is cleaner than in his assumptions \u2013 a near-certainty \u2013 the conclusions won\u2019t hold.\nLesser also admits that even with these conservative assumptions, carbon pollution emissions from electric cars would be at least 70% lower in 2050 than those from gasoline-powered cars. He dismisses this result by claiming \u201cthe [carbon pollution] reductions will have no impact on climate\u201d (because it\u2019s a small change relative to the carbon pollution from all American power generation), but this argument could apply to any individual effort to cut carbon pollution (it\u2019s called a \u2018Tragedy of the Commons\u2019). In fact, transportation currently accounts for close to 30% of US carbon pollution, so switching to electric cars is a critically important step to tackle America\u2019s large contribution to climate change.\nThe cleanliness of an electric car depends on the source of its electricity, and that varies greatly by region. The Union of Concerned Scientists created an interactive tool to check this based on US zip code. Currently, half of American electric cars are sold in California, where in many areas they achieve an equivalent of 130 miles per gallon. And about one-third of households buying electric cars today also have solar panels to charge them, producing zero-pollution fuel.\nIn short, yes, electric cars are green and global warming is causing sea level rise. It\u2019s not a coincidence that arguments to the contrary are made by individuals whose paychecks and campaign donations are supplied by the fossil fuel industry.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/electric-cars", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/sea-level", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oceans", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ethical-living", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/travel-and-transport"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Dana Nuccitelli: Republicans paid by the fossil fuel industry deny these realities", "date_published": {"$date": 1526896822000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1526896941000}, "authors": ["Dana Nuccitelli"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Electric", "hybrid and low-emission cars", "Sea level", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "Oceans", "Ethical and green living", "Travel and transport", "Climate change", "Science", "Wall Street Journal", "Republicans"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/may/21/yes-evs-are-green-and-global-warming-is-raising-sea-levels", "og:description": "Dana Nuccitelli: Republicans paid by the fossil fuel industry deny these realities", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9cba2f89f895f816f6e1de2a7fc1d9144d26b19/0_92_4928_2959/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=9dbc2a2344a96378e60350d7fbe394ca", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Yes, EVs are green and global warming is raising sea levels | Dana Nuccitelli"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9cba2f89f895f816f6e1de2a7fc1d9144d26b19/0_92_4928_2959/master/4928.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=91a1f8f01caa882f1f718c6c3428d921", "width": "4928", "height": "2959", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9cba2f89f895f816f6e1de2a7fc1d9144d26b19/0_92_4928_2959/master/4928.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=22f9b8bc46580ae7a2eda61ea0d724f2", "description": "A Volkswagen e-Golf electric car stands in the front of the Volkswagen AG (VW) factory on May 8, 2018 in Dresden, Germany.\nPhotograph: Jens Schlueter/Getty Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b179a00050b51e77cb4657a54522c9bce3b1380/0_0_1409_957/master/1409.png?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7477f5ffa8a78480664edc6a6016eb68", "width": "1409", "height": "957", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b179a00050b51e77cb4657a54522c9bce3b1380/0_0_1409_957/master/1409.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f3185ced66f0f93da840a6dba40b8095", "description": "US Energy Information Administration data on carbon pollution from the transportation and power sectors since 1973 (2017 estimated from the first 9 months of data) Illustration: Dana Nuccitelli"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556126290580}, "comments": [{"id": "116325194", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1527499876000}, "author": "Monkeybiz", "author_id": "2445553", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Well, it's more likely to product hydrogen than it is to produce chlorine....", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "116211145", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "116320918", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1527491124000}, "author": "ComfortablyPlumb", "author_id": "14842422", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "This comment was removed by a moderator because it didn't abide by our\ncommunity standards.\nReplies may also be deleted.

Wrong again, I said the figures are from the panel metrics, net of system losses because we were discussing insolation/efficiency.\nYou say that you're an expert, but the fact that you believe that unrelated system losses should be included in panel efficiency indicates otherwise.\nBut FYI: My system of solar+batteries and generator with auto charge control (which we have to override in specific circumstances) means that we cannot calculate a specific system cf because there are times, such as running the washer/dryer when cooking, that we have to run an 11kw generator.And as that doesn't use appreciably more fuel between 20 and 80% load, we save up and do it all at once to keep generator running to a minimum and so charge the battery banks at 120+amps and dump the solar o/p into the calorifier.Hence no simple system cf is calculable, therefore the other reason for direct panel only reading from the MPPT software, not the battery controller/inverter system metric.\nYour attacks on the offgrid community are wearying Marty -

So using CO2 as an indication of energy use [as a neat comparison]So 2 tonnes of CO2 to produce an ICV and 3 tonnes to produce an EV- in lifetimes the EV doing 100,000 miles [i.e. 10 years, the average life expectancy of both EVs and ICVs is 13] - such as a Tesla S will consume about 4,000 kWh [4 MWh] over the year, 40,000 kWh [40 MWh] over its life.\nIn energy/CO2 terms this from wind would be [using plumb's IPCC link] 12 grams / kWh, and for solar 40 grams/kWh [although the location varies the amount from 8 grams to 80 grams]- 12g/kWh = 1.2kg MWh x 40 is about a half a tonne, and for solar near 2 tonnes.\nA petrol or diesel of that size is doing between 100g and 200g a mile x 10,000 miles meaning it is producing 1.5 tonnes a year and 15 tonnes over its life.\nThe g/km are based on simply the CO2 produced in combustion- However oil requires energy to extract and process so saudi oil is lower in CO2 content because it requires less energy to extract and process, Canadian tarsands is 25% more CO2 because of the processing and extraction inputs. One of the missing pieces of data is the processing cost in energy and CO2 of refining and capex.\nMaterial requirements of renewables and batteries is not an issue yet- there is plenty of lithium, it can be recycled as can cobalt and rare [not rare] earth metals- and the auto makers are gaining energy density by reducing the material content.\nAnd at some point non fossil fuel energy will be producing all the energy to make more wind turbines and solar panels. Steel making is a problem- recycling can be done with electric [and it is a cheaper method] but ore needing the oxygen to be stripped out will always produce CO2 and the need for CCS.\nHowever the point I make is that oil is quickly becoming energy intense as well.On a grid level other forms of storage make sense- like pumped, batteries are great in domestic, business, and transport use, just as laptops are very useful.

Most of the US has old sub critical power plants.They are cheap to run because they were paid for decades ago and they got a get out clause to allow them not to have clean up their pollution.\nIn China all new coal power plants are either super critical or ultra supercritical - i.e. they get more energy out of a tonne of coal than subcritical. The US is mainly old plants built before 1990 - and they are inefficient effectively burning 20% coal than they need to- which means the buyers of coal are looking to keep the price super low, and they are the only customer so they can set the price.\nBy 2050 most of the US coal power station fleet will need replacing.Add to this the huge debt coal mining companies carry- because the buyers have driven down the profits- debt is based on the notion that things will get better and that a return will happen.\nSo rising costs, low quality, and competition is destroying the industry.", "recommendation_count": "8", "in_reply_to": "116185455", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "it 's based on shaky assumptions", "effect": "if 22 % is wrong"}, {"cause": "simply coal comes in various energy densities ranging from lignite up to hard anthracite", "effect": "the same bang for buck-"}, {"cause": "they were paid for decades ago", "effect": "they are cheap to run"}, {"cause": "the buyers have driven down the profits- debt", "effect": "add to this the huge debt coal mining companies carry-"}]}, {"id": "116216792", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1527248623000}, "author": "JulesBywaterLees", "author_id": "4738374", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "pretty desperate stuff when you resort to trolling- thought of actually entering a discussion- or are you going to rest your entire opinion on typo on another website?please get an argument rather than following me around.", "recommendation_count": "8", "in_reply_to": "116208608", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "116235010", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1527275009000}, "author": "glennmr", "author_id": "17680035", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Sorry, but now you are starting to discuss with an ideology rather than science.

So I'll stick to the general consensus.As for Mackay- WOHA is an interesting book, it is just a book, it is not a paper.My criticism is more in presenting arguments- for instance if W/M2 is the best way to measure energy generation then nuclear wins. But if we looked at calories to the hectare then sugar cane would win [and no one is suggesting we survive on sugar].\nIt's a bit like Top Trumps of my youth- the winning card was not always the best bike or car or plane.So for w/M2 it doesn't matter if vast offshore waters are used for energy- they are not being used for much else. And they provide cheap energy [now at \u00a365 MWh], reefs and fish protection areas [and the EROI is very good]. Likewise if a solar roof is similar in price to a tile roof why not have both the protection of a roof and energy- it is not as if the sq metres are being used for anything else.\nBut my biggest complaint is the final 'can we survive on renewables page' 18- where a staggering 195 kWh per person per day is presented as the challenge for renewables to meet. it includes the current petrol/diesel fuel consumption of 40 kWh [4 ltrs a day per person] air travel, imports etc etc.It may be a really good example of energy intense lifestyle but does not represent the energy generation renewables could provide or our actual needs. If it were 'can nuclear provide our energy needs ?' then 195 kWh per person would mean 300 new nuclear power stations to be built before 2050.We use about 15-20 kWh per person per day [according to Mackay in the ref] And renewables only need to provide that- still a challenge.\nAnd the energy future is not going to be 40 kWh of personal car energy- it will be 10 kWh of EV electrical energy.

All of your concerns are answered in using the PVGIS site to look at actual generation. The figures I have given clearly showing that 400kWh/kWp pa are fine are from PVGIS which has proven to be extremely accurate over the 7yrs of generation that I've compared it too.\nAlso the generation figures it gives are AC output (not DC input) so include all system losses such as inverters. In fact many PV'ers find the figures slightly pessimistic as the default losses of 14% are probably too high these days with inverters (such as mine) in the 98-99% efficiency range lifting real generation.\nSo, just to recap, I gave a breakdown of the 400kWh/kWp figure, the one you said is just not reasonable, to show that it's actually quite reasonable today, and certainly reasonable by 2030.\nRegarding your other issues, they are irrelevant. The article and maps are there to show people that the often claimed 'there isn't enough land' statement is complete BS.\nFor the UK, to generate the equivalent of all of our leccy from PV, we'd need to cover approx 2% of England with 15% efficient PV. And of course most of the PV could go on rooves, car park canopies etc, or co-located on low value sheep grazing land. But again, this is just a thought exercise to help the nay-sayers eliminate any land issues from their concerns.\nIn the same vein we can look at reality concerning off-shore wind, and see that in a high leccy future, allowing for a large transition of demand for space heating and transport onto leccy, the UK could still provide between 10 and 100 times as much generation from off-shore wind as we would actually need.

Yet in the past half-century nearly a fifth of it has been cut down. The felling and burning of millions of trees is releasing massive amounts of carbon, in turn depleting the Amazon\u2019s capacity to be one of the world\u2019s largest carbon sinks \u2013 the natural systems that suck up and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\nRecently, 25 children brought a lawsuit to end the deforestation and its devastating impacts on the environment and their own wellbeing. The case made its way to Colombia\u2019s supreme court, which issued its decision last month. While deforestation is hardly a new issue in this region, the court\u2019s response to the lawsuit certainly was. Commenting that environmental degradation \u2013 not only in the Amazon but worldwide \u2013 is so significant that it threatens \u201chuman existence\u201d, the court declared the Colombian Amazon a \u201csubject of rights\u201d.\nIn 1972 the law professor Christopher Stone published a seminal article, Should Trees Have Standing?, that explored the possibility of recognising the legal rights of nature. He described how women and slaves had long been treated as rightless in law, and suggested that just as they had eventually attained rights, so trees and other nonhuman living things should also do so.\nToday, environmental laws regulate the human use and destruction of nature. They legalise fracking, drilling, and even dynamiting the tops off mountains to mine coal. The consequences are proving catastrophic: the die-off crisis of the world\u2019s coral reefs, accelerating species extinction, climate change. Finally, though, this is changing. In 2006 the first law recognising the legal rights of nature was enacted in the borough of Tamaqua, Pennsylvania, in the United States. The community sought to prevent dredging sludge laden with PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl) being dumped in an abandoned coalmine. The organisation I work for, the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund, helped the council draft the law, transforming nature from being rightless to possessing rights to exist and flourish. It was the first such law in the world. Communities across more than 10 US states have now followed suit, including New Hampshire, Colorado and Pittsburgh.\nAfter the decision to grant legal rights to nature in Pennsylvania, representatives of my organisation met Ecuador\u2019s constituent assembly in 2008, which was elected to draft a new constitution. We discussed the rights of nature, and why communities all over the world find themselves unable to protect nature under laws that authorise its exploitation. The assembly\u2019s president, Alberto Acosta, told us: \u201cNature is a slave.\u201d\nIn 2006 the first law recognising the legal rights of nature was enacted in the borough of Tamaqua, Pennsylvania\nHowever, that year Ecuador enshrined the rights of nature \u2013 or Pachamama (Mother Earth) \u2013 in its constitution, the first country to do so. Since then Bolivia has put in place a Law of Mother Earth. Courts in India and Colombia have similarly ruled that ecosystems possess rights. In Mexico, Pakistan, Australia and other countries, rights-of-nature frameworks are being proposed and enacted.\nColombia\u2019s supreme court was asked to consider the climate-change impacts of Amazon deforestation in the lawsuit that led to its groundbreaking ruling. Similarly, in Nepal the Center for Economic and Social Development is working to advance rights to protect against climate change. The Himalayas \u2013 known as the world\u2019s third pole \u2013 are experiencing warming faster than any other mountain range on earth. With the melting of ice and snow, a Sherpa told us, \u201cthe mountains are turning black\u201d. But now a constitutional amendment has been developed that would, if adopted, recognise the rights of the Himalayas to a climate system free from global-warming pollution. It would for the first time provide a platform for Nepal to hold major climate polluters accountable for violating the rights of the mountains.\nLaw today divides the world into two categories: persons, capable of having rights; and property, unable to possess rights. While there is no universally agreed upon definition of \u201clegal person\u201d, it is generally understood to mean an entity capable of bearing rights and duties. The problem that the rights-of-nature movement is now encountering is that this definition is predictably problematic when it comes to rivers, forests or nature more broadly.\nIn 2017, for example, the state high court in Uttarakhand, India, ruled that in order to protect the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, they should be considered legal persons with \u201call corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a living person\u201d. In a subsequent appeal to India\u2019s supreme court, the state government asked whether, if the rivers flood, leading to the death of a human being, a lawsuit could be filed for damages. Could the Uttarakhand chief secretary of state, named by the court as one of several officials in loco parentis, be held liable on the river\u2019s behalf? In this case, the supreme court decided not.\nCan we hold a river accountable for flooding, or a forest for burning? Of course not. Yet existing legal systems force us to think of nature in terms of human concerns rather than what concerns nature. With the past three years the warmest in recorded history, and as we face what has been called the sixth great extinction, lawmakers and judges appear increasingly to agree that it is time to secure the highest form of legal protection for nature, through the recognition of rights.\nTo make progress in this area, we must break away from legal strictures that were never intended to apply to nature, such as legal personhood, and establish a new structure that addresses what nature needs. Perhaps we can call this framework legal naturehood. A recent symposium at Tulane Law School, in New Orleans, brought together academics, lawyers and activists to develop a set of guidelines for recognising and enforcing legal rights of nature, known as the rights-of-nature principles.\nThese define the basic rights that nature needs, including rights to existence, regeneration and restoration. Further, they call for monetary damages derived from violations of these rights to be used solely to protect and restore nature to its pre-damaged state. In addition, they outline a means for nature to defend its own rights \u2013 like children unable to speak for themselves in court \u2013 by being the named \u201creal party in interest\u201d in administrative and court proceedings.

Obviously. Where else would it exist, if not in consciousness, which operates on many levels, dreaming and waking being the most obvious example. Existence and consciousness are one and the same. An electron \u2018knows\u2019 that it's an electron, and what to do, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be able to do it, and you would have to invent an exterior knower which knows on its behalf - like God - which I suspect you would be reluctant to do, quite understandably.

You can even see this effect somewhat among families with only a few kids as opposed to larger families - and not because people don't care, it just seems to be the effect on family lifestyle.The other element I think is that culturally and economically we don't really encourage moderation. We tend to think moderation in one area is unrelated to another, but I suspect that isn't the case. While some individuals are less inclined to certain types of excess, generally the ability to be moderate can be transferred to some extent to other areas of life, it's about habit building and learning how to manage your own behaviour.

Lawyers claim there is a case for this in article 263 of the treaty on the functioning of the EU.\nIn 2015, a court in The Hague ordered the Dutch government to cut its emissions by at least 25% within five years, ruling that its plans to cut emissions by 14-17% compared with 1990 levels by 2020 were unlawful, given the scale of the threat posed by climate change. The government has appealed the decision, which will be heard in The Hague on Monday.\nMaurice Feschet, 72, a lavender farmer in Grignan, Provence, told the Guardianhe became involved in the action against the EU after losing 44% of his harvest in six years because of climate change.\nHe said: \u201cMy family has been farming here since the 1800s. I am taking this action for my 38-year-old son who lives on the farm. We want him to continue to be able to farm, but it is not going to be easy. There must be more done.\u201d\nAlfredo Sendim, 52, an organic farmer in central Portugal, said the irregularity of the climate in his area raised serious doubts about the long-term sustainability of his business. He said: \u201cLast year we had almost the entire year without a drop of rain. Then we had two weeks and all the rain that we should have had fell.\u201d\nIn Sweden, the traditional Sami way of life herding reindeer is said to be under pressure from rising temperatures that threaten the size of herds. Warmer winters mean less snow and more rain freezing into ice, making it harder for the animals to reach the plants they need to eat. \nSanna Vannar, 22, the chair of S\u00e1minuorra, said: \u201cIf we lose the reindeers, the Sami culture will be lost. Many of the Sami youth want to stay with their families and be reindeer herders, but they cannot see a future. This is mostly due to the threat of climate change. This must be urgently addressed for the safety of our generation and the next generations.\u201d\nRoda Verheyen, the lawyer acting on behalf of the families, said: \u201cClimate change is already an issue for the courts in the European countries and around the world.\n\u201cThe plaintiff families are putting their trust in the EU courts and legal system to protect their fundamental rights of life, health, occupation and property which are under threat of climate change. The EU courts must now listen to these families and ensure that they are protected.\u201d\nScientists from the thinktank Climate Analytics are providing expert evidence to the families\u2019 lawyers. The German non-governmental organisation Protect the Planet is bearing all the costs related to the legal case.\nClimate Action Network (CAN), Europe\u2019s largest NGO working on climate and energy issues, is also supporting the action.\nWendel Trio, CAN\u2019s director in Europe, said: \u201cThis is part of a strategy to get the EU institutions to increase their targets. In 2015, as part of the Paris agreement, countries agreed to pursue efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\u201cYet, it is clear that the existing EU 2030 climate target is not enough to respect the commitments taken in the Paris agreement and should be increased. The EU needs under the agreement to confirm its target by 2020. This legal action initiated by normal families impacted by climate change is underlining the urgency and the necessity to increase it.\u201d ", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/emissionstrading", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/france", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/sweden", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/farming", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Litigants from eight countries claim EU institutions are not protecting fundamental rights", "date_published": {"$date": 1527157557000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1527195657000}, "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Emissions trading", "Environment", "Climate change", "European Union", "France", "Sweden", "Farming", "Europe", "World news", "Business"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/24/families-take-eu-court-climate-change-emissions", "og:description": "Litigants from eight countries claim EU institutions are not protecting fundamental rights", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5baa45e2dc50fa8121b1521bbe65fae795ed05aa/0_208_5496_3296/master/5496.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=1fcca2cd17e0731cd92295ed202fd9b9", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "'We can't see a future': group takes EU to court over climate change"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5baa45e2dc50fa8121b1521bbe65fae795ed05aa/0_208_5496_3296/master/5496.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c040c5a636273de6487aaa4fa3974159", "width": "5496", "height": "3296", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5baa45e2dc50fa8121b1521bbe65fae795ed05aa/0_208_5496_3296/master/5496.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=32301b993f409a3240fdd96946e009de", "description": "Maurice Feschet, 72, a lavender farmer from Provence, says he lost 44% of his harvest in six years because of climate change.\nPhotograph: Gerard Julien/AFP/Getty Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a136e2b1e28da1a1c57e6fc05e1ec4feb8035183/0_33_5126_3075/master/5126.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=aa8748daf11faccb2431d0aeffff074a", "width": "5126", "height": "3075", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a136e2b1e28da1a1c57e6fc05e1ec4feb8035183/0_33_5126_3075/master/5126.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6bb04a3e63cf2666eb66371fd8183248", "description": "A herd of reindeer.

The government says it has signed contracts to prevent 124m tonnes of emissions through vegetation projects \u2013 mostly repairing degraded habitat, planting trees and ensuring existing forest on private land is not cleared. \nBased on the average price paid by the government for a tonne of carbon dioxide, the projects will receive about $1.48bn from taxpayers as they deliver their cuts over the next decade.\nMeanwhile, forest-clearing elsewhere in the country has released more than 160m tonnes of carbon dioxide since the emissions reduction fund began in 2015. Emissions projections data estimates another 60.3m tonnes will be emitted this year \u2013 equivalent to more than 10% of national emissions.\nAn analysis by the Wilderness Society suggests the official figures underestimate the rate of land-clearing, and in reality the projects paid for from the Direct Action emissions reductions fund would have had their work nullified in even less time.\nThe Wilderness Society climate campaign manager, Glenn Walker, said other data sources suggested the projections data was almost certainly an underestimate.\nHe said the government\u2019s forest-clearing emissions counted areas felled for farming, mining and other industry, but not those from native forest logging for timber, which are absorbed into another category. Australian National University scientists have estimated native forest logging may contribute another 38m tonnes a year.\nWalker said the official forest-clearing figures also underplayed the amount of mostly agricultural land-clearing in Queensland. State data showed that 395,000 hectares were felled in 2015-16, releasing 45m tonnes of emissions from that state alone.\nThe Wilderness Society estimates suggest 600,000ha of land were cleared across the country in 2016, an area equivalent to about half of greater suburban Sydney, and the most in a decade.\nWalker said the government had shown it wanted mass land-clearing to continue, pointing to evidence that federal environment department notices asking Queensland landholders to explain suspected illegal clear-felling on their land had been withdrawn after lobbying by Liberal National MPs and senators.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace that there is a massive public investment going into tree planting while the government sits back and not only watches but encourages the mass destruction of forests,\u201d Walker said.\nThe environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, did not directly respond to questions about how the rate of land-clearing squared with the government\u2019s emissions goals. He said a departmental review of climate policies last year confirmed that Australia had a comprehensive set of emissions reduction policies, and that the emissions reduction fund was internationally recognised as one of the world\u2019s largest domestic carbon offset markets.\nLand-clearing spiked in Queensland after the former Liberal National premier Campbell Newman relaxed laws preventing mass deforestation. The Palaszczuk Labor government has repealed the changes to restore earlier protections but legacy clearing permits remain for about 115,000ha.\nThe federal government is resisting calls that it should use national environmental laws to stop land-clearing that threatens endangered species, saying it is a state responsibility. Frydenberg is currently considering a draft department of environment recommendation that a Queensland farmer be allowed to clear most of a 2000ha block of Cape York forest that is home to endangered species. Scientific advice suggests allowing it would likely increase sediment runoff on to the Great Barrier Reef.\nThe government is also facing calls that it make changes to the emissions fund. It has committed $2.28bn on what it says is 191m tonnes of abatement, but questions remain over whether some types of projects backed by the fund \u2013 such as capturing methane from decomposing rubbish at landfill sites to convert into electricity \u2013 are actually limiting emissions or just being rewarded for what they would have done anyway. \u201cAvoided deforestation\u201d projects \u2013 paying farmers to not clear land \u2013 are also contentious.\nHabitat restoration and tree-planting projects have broader support. In a recent paper in the journal Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, University of Queensland research fellow Dr Megan Evans found that well-designed incentives could encourage landowners to back reforestation on otherwise agricultural land, with broad benefits for the environment and community.\nBut she found that Australia\u2019s reforestation program was being undermined by land-clearing elsewhere on the continent. \nShe said people were likely being held back from signing up for reforestation projects by inconsistent messages from government.\n\u201cIf, as a society, we have a goal to reduce emissions, we need to ideally point all the policy messages towards that goal,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately this hasn\u2019t been happening.\u201d\nAustralia\u2019s total national emissions continue to rise. The most recent national greenhouse accounts showed a 1.5% increase last year. The government has pledged to cut emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2030.\nEmissions from what is known as \u201cland use, land use change and forestry\u201d \u2013 a vast category that takes in forest-clearing, native logging, tree planting and the natural impact of and recovery from disasters such as fire, flood and drought \u2013 rose by 0.5%. The 60m tonnes from forest-clearing cancelled out what would have otherwise been an emissions sink.\nThe next emissions reduction fund auction is scheduled for 6 and 7 June.\n\u2022 Support our independent journalism with a one-off or monthly contribution", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/forests", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/business-australia", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/logging-and-land-clearing", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Official data shows forest-clearing released 160m tonnes of carbon dioxide since 2015", "date_published": {"$date": 1527530400000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1527552762000}, "authors": ["Adam Morton"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Emissions trading", "Environment", "Trees and forests", "Business (Australia)", "Climate change", "Logging and land-clearing", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Australia news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/29/land-clearing-wipes-out-1bn-taxpayer-funded-emissions-gains", "og:description": "Official data shows forest-clearing released 160m tonnes of carbon dioxide since 2015", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29701624c28813c3143be76afa0b7fd683951139/69_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=3c01dee308594cbb77310efab2a95024", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Land-clearing wipes out $1bn taxpayer-funded emissions gains"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29701624c28813c3143be76afa0b7fd683951139/69_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2baa97a85215c2fae6dfa7068f1fef17", "width": "1800", "height": "1080", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29701624c28813c3143be76afa0b7fd683951139/69_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b6f443fcb6840276ee02998a827de9c0", "description": "Emissions projections data estimates more than 60.3m tonnes will be emitted this year \u2013 equivalent to more than 10% of national emissions."}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556126343867}, "comments": [{"id": "116440057", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1527757516000}, "author": "daveinbalmain", "author_id": "4163450", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Sorry Ross I suspect you're wasting your breath.

The catch is, that these landowners could not afford to clear this land anyway, or had no intention of clearing the land because they could not afford to develop the land with crops or livestock. Yet then, by paying these landowners hundreds of thousands of tax payer dollars, these landowners COULD then afford to clear the land they promised NOT to clear, and so they DID then clear the land, albeit illegally.\nIn effect, tax payers have paid farmers to clear their land, that the farmers could not, without tax payer dollars, afford to clear.\nSo the Direct Action Plan has in fact, funded increasing emissions, eroding of native forests, and extinction of vital species, using tax payer dollars that are supposedly to be used to reduce emissions and improve Australia's environmental resilience to climate change.\nSince the LNP came to power Australia has been going backwards with regard to carbon emissions. But the LNP rationalise that when a Labor government finally comes to power, it will, like the Rudd/Gillard government did, do all the heavy lifting to ensure Australia meets its Paris commitments, while the LNP will pillory the Labor Party every day in question time about how their carbon emissions reduction strategies are killing the Australian economy.\nFirst we had Howard who didn't just undermine the negotiation of the Kyoto Protocol at the Kyoto Conference, but then used tax payer money to send his Ministers all over the world trying to get other countries to withdraw from the Protocol, after the Kyoto Protocol had been agreed to. Then, even though Australia had negotiated for the ONLY deal for any advanced country to continue to emit increasing carbon emissions, and carved out every special concession they wanted, that no other country received, in the Kyoto Protocol, Howard then refused to sign it.\nRudd and Gillard then tried to do the best they could to put Australia on a path to reducing the necessary emissions, to help keep global warming below 2 degrees celcius. Abbott and the LNP gave them hell for doing the right thing. It worked - not only did Rudd back off and try to introduce a pathetic plan that had been watered down to suit the LNP, but as a result of Gillard's strong policy that did pass the Senate, and that was NEVER ever a carbon tax, Abbott's constant 'Juliar' accusations resonated with an ignorant Australian public and undermined her government to the point where Rudd took over again. The Labor Party never recovered, despite them having done the right thing. The liar, was in fact, Abbott, not Gillard, yet he was elected as PM. Both Abbott and Peta Credlin, made up the whole 'carbon tax' label, and the media and ignorant Australian people fell for it.\nThen the LNP took over again, and undid every good emissions policy introduced by the Gillard government.\nAustralia has the highest carbon emissions per capita of any country in the world. We may only emit 1.5% of all current world emissions, but so do numerous other countries. If the emissions of all countries that only account for 0.5% - 1.5% of all world carbon emissions never reduce their emissions, based on the LNP logic that 1.5% of emissions is negligible, then 25% of all carbon emission will never be reduced and will keep growing as a percentage of world emissions. To keep global warming to below 2 degrees, the world cannot have 25% of all carbon emissions not being reduced. And why should countries whose emissions are only 0.5% of world carbon emissions, reduce their emissions when Australia's emissions are higher than theirs, and Australia, far from reducing emissions, is currently increasing emissions?\nSo if every country in the world adopted the LNP logic, the Earth will end up burning itself and all life on it, to death!\nThis LNP are criminals and are knowingly and deliberately contributing to the genocide of entire nations, and even greater hardship for the already poor, disadvantaged, and hungry.

The bold plan to fix the reef will cost billions but is already facing funding cuts.\nThe new focus on fine sediment pollution coincides with dramatic footage received by Background Briefing of run-off from banana plantations in the Johnstone River catchment of the Wet Tropics, south of Cairns.\n'The footage is quite damning. You can dance around it all you like but the reality is banana farming in the Wet Tropics is the wrong thing to do if you want to protect the river systems and the future of the Great Barrier Reef.\n'If you continue to farm bananas (the way) they're farmed today, in my opinion we stand to lose some of the most important that things this country has and that includes the Great Barrier Reef.'\nDoug Phillips, the chair of the Australian Banana Growers Council, rejected Cunningham's claims the Johnstone River had 'died' and that banana farming was the cause.\nBackground Briefing showed the drone footage to the Queensland minister for the Great Barrier Reef, Steven Miles.

The New South Wales Environmental Defenders\u2019 Office (EDO) had sought its release.\nThe proposal to keep such information secret flies in the face of recommendations by an independent inquiry headed by Ken Matthews, who was commissioned to urgently investigate the culture and performance of NSW\u2019s water bureaucracy.\nHe concluded that \u201ca systemic fix\u201d was required and that key to that change was more transparency and independence.\n\u201cAccordingly, changes proposed include enabling the public to readily access from a single source all details of individuals\u2019 water entitlements, licence conditions, meter readings, water account balances and trading activities,\u201d Matthews wrote in his report.\nWaterNSW has since announced it is prosecuting Peter and Jane Harris for illegally taking water from the Barwon Darling, eight months after the allegations were originally aired in July 2017 by Four Corners.\nBut WaterNSW has inspected the Harris property and another facing water theft allegations just once. According to answers provided to NSW parliament last week, the two properties of the two people charged with water theft this month were visited once \u2013 in the immediate aftermath of Four Corners.\nRumleigh, owned by the Harris family, was inspected on 18 August last year. Burren Downs, owned by the Barlow family, who are also being prosecuted, was inspected on 2 August 2017.\nThe EDO has been separately pursuing a civil case against Peter Harris, demanding he return more than 5bn litres of water he is alleged to have \u00adillegally taken from the Barwon-Darling river.\nEDO is also embroiled in a case before the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal (Ncat) over release of Peter Harris\u2019s water usage data. While WaterNSW agreed to the release of the data, it is being resisted by Peter Harris who was consulted as a third party, as he is entitled to be.\nThe state\u2019s water administration is also under investigation by the NSW ombudsman, which has been highly critical of WaterNSW\u2019s record of enforcing the water laws. Earlier this month it issued a stinging report after WaterNSW provided inaccurate figures about its record in taking prosecutions.\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/28/waternsw-boss-told-cotton-grower-of-bid-to-keep-his-usage-data-from-being-released\nFarmers....a breed of their own.", "recommendation_count": "6", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "116347133", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1527549179000}, "author": "SyntaxErrorz", "author_id": "18297528", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "You mean export for profit.\nWe already produce surplus food for our own population.", "recommendation_count": "4", "in_reply_to": "116346798", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "116348307", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1527553110000}, "author": "Leadguitar", "author_id": "17456691", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\"Something does not add up here.\"\nYes, that's the same feeling I get with EVERY one of your inane comments Timmy...!", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "116345401", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "116346611", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1527547574000}, "author": "Lesm", "author_id": "4054543", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "This kind of Doublethink is what we have come to expect from a government many of whose members reject science and prefer to rely on \"gut feelings\" and a native inductive reasoning that goes directly from unwarranted assumptions to foregone conclusions.

The body is focused on business cooperation.\nBy its own description, the foundation \u201cstarted with a small group of businessmen chatting at the airport while waiting for their flight, wanting to do something to help the Great Barrier Reef\u201d. When asked, the government was not immediately able to say who these businessmen were.\nThe move to direct more than $443 million to this small foundation was so left-field it caught even its beneficiaries off guard. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019ve won lotto,\u201d chief executive Anna Marsden told Fairfax\u2019s Peter Hannam. \u201cWe\u2019re getting calls from a lot of friends.\u201d\nMarsden said the organisation was seeking advice on how to cope with the sudden influx of funds.\nBQEND\nLabor has lodged a freedom of information request. \nOthers have pointed to the foundation\u2019s links to corporate Australia, including fossil fuel behemoths BHP, Shell and Peabody Energy, as well as key banking figures.\n\u201cGod help the Barrier Reef,\u201d was the blunt response of Professor Terry Hughes, the director of the Australian Research Council\u2019s Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, who has been indefatigable in his scorn for untested scientific solutions such as sun-shields, underwater fans and anything that fails to address the core issues of global warming and immediate decarbonising of the economy.\nSimilarly, acting chief executive of the Climate Council Dr Martin Rice described the focus on water quality and culling starfish as \u201ca golden Band-Aid solution, because it\u2019s not really getting to the root cause of the problem with the bleaching, and that\u2019s climate change.\n\u201cWhen you look at emissions, we\u2019ve had three years of emissions rising in Australia, and any true test of effective climate policy comes down to whether our emissions are going up or down. So there is no credible energy or climate policy in Australia \u2026 [Our] emission reduction targets of 28 per cent are woefully inadequate; they\u2019re not aligned with the science,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf the world was to go with Australia\u2019s Paris commitments, we would be on target for a 3 to 4 degree [increase in temperature], and that\u2019s devastating. We\u2019re not going to see our iconic Great Barrier Reef survive that. And that\u2019s not just an environmental issue; it\u2019s an economic one.\u201d\nTen days before the government\u2019s announcement, the scale of the threat to the Great Barrier Reef \u2013 and the calamity it has already experienced \u2013 was brutally spelled out in a new paper published by Nature, which The Atlantic described as \u201ca kind of autopsy report for the debacle\u201d.\nTerry Hughes was the lead author of a team of 16 international researchers.\nHughes has stated in preliminary findings that one in every two corals had died. \nUsually, this happens slowly. When subjected to heat stress, coral species expel the algae that both provides them with their colour and with nourishment. If the algae don\u2019t return quickly to recolonise the corals, they starve.\nIn the waters around and north of Port Douglas, previously the most pristine section of the park, the water was so hot that the corals died more or less instantly. \u201cThey cooked,\u201d Hughes said.\n\u201cYou could say it has collapsed. You could say it has degraded. I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s wrong,\u201d Hughes told The Atlantic. \u201cA more neutral way of putting it is that it has transformed into a completely new system that looks differently, and behaves differently, and functions differently, than how it was three years ago.\u201d\nSignificant questions remain about the Turnbull government\u2019s motivations and its processes. \nThe funding allocation remains deeply curious.\n Again we see the federal government outsourcing what would normally be the work of a government agency to a private body. \nhttps://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/environment/2018/05/26/who-the-group-awarded-443m-save-the-reef/15272568006280", "recommendation_count": "4", "in_reply_to": "116346344", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "it \u2019s not really getting to the root cause of the problem with the bleaching and that \u2019s climate change", "effect": "similarly acting chief executive of the climate council dr martin rice described the focus on water quality and culling starfish as \u201c a golden band aid solution"}]}, {"id": "116346406", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1527546933000}, "author": "Notjimdewar", "author_id": "3962644", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nthe politicians and wealthy so they can spend more time jetting around the world on taxpayer funded junkets\nBQEND\nYou are describing the current mob of deplorables to a T - as well as their current behaviour.", "recommendation_count": "2", "in_reply_to": "116343614", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "116347014", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1527548807000}, "author": "OvlovS60", "author_id": "18394471", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "no, its a pity you didn't but that all conservative politicians didn't conserve their spermatzoa.

It\u2019s a phrase from eco-philosopher Timothy Morton, who calls out the human effect on the planet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s to bring attention to the issue from another angle, to look at what humans are doing to provoke climate change,\u201d says Lawrence. \u201cWhen we think of asteroids, we think of something that will doom the earth, but in this case, it\u2019s actually coming from our own human activity.\u201d\nAnother piece is by the protest art group Dear Climate, who have created 20 banners around the site. They\u2019ve called it General Assembly and have fashioned the flags to match the circle of world flags outside the United Nations Headquarters in New York City.\nOne flag says \u201cSay hello to hurricanes\u201d, while others read \u201cSee the sea levels\u201d, \u201cGive me luxury or give me breath\u201d and \u201cHeed your greens\u201d.\n\u201cThey\u2019re meant to be both serious and funny, but to ask people to think about the issue,\u201d says Lawrence. \u201cMost of their works are downloadable from their website, so they can be distributed beyond an art center like us.\u201d \nThe exhibition is not necessarily didactic; it\u2019s meant to offer a variety of opinions and outlooks. \u201cWe wanted to make this an artist-forward exhibition,\u201d says Lawrence. \u201cClimate change isn\u2019t one thing with one way of looking at the world. We wanted to look at climate change like a syndrome with different factors that taps into something larger, because not every artist is approaching it from the same angle.\u201d \nAlong the stunning landscape of Storm King \u2013 about 60 miles north of New York City \u2013 one thing stands out: the palm trees, of all things. They were planted there by artist Mary Mattingly for her artwork Along the Lines of Displacement: A Tropical Food Forest. There is a set of three tropical fruit trees, including coconut palms and a ponytail palm, which were shipped from Florida. Since an expected temperature rise of 4C is expected across the globe in the years to come, could residents ever harvest a palm tree in upstate New York?\n\u201cThis piece asks us: \u2018What are the opportunities that climate change could bring our way? And how can we be ready?\u2019\u201d asks Lawrence. \u201cAre there ways we might be able to harvest certain crops in the future? And in a place like Alaska, if we are dealing with climate change, what kind of opportunities will there be to harvest if the ice is melted?\u201d\nAnother piece is by Tavares Strachan, who shows a neon-lit blue wall piece, which reads: Sometimes Lies Are Prettier. It taps into our own misleading thoughts about climate change. \u201cIt might be more pleasant to be inside of air conditioning than think about its affect,\u201d says Lawrence. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to think about nature [as something] that is always there for us than something we need to tend to.\u201d\nOne artwork is more like a treasure hunt. Permanent Field Observations, by David Brooks, puts art enthusiasts on a mission to find his 30 bronze sculptures, each of which look stunningly real, amid Storm King\u2019s forested area.\n\u201cDavid spent time finding moments in the woods that aren\u2019t permanent, moments he wanted to cast into bronze; a stick with a bunch of mushrooms on it, leaves, a stone, branches,\u201d says Lawrence. \u201cThe bronze piece will outlast the original works of nature, so the artist asks people to imagine they\u2019re on a scientific expedition and to think like a scientist.\u201d\nThe exhibition is not to only ponder climate change, but also to consider our actions. \u201cIt\u2019s to find new ways to think about our environment and climate change and our own place in all of that,\u201d says Lawrence. \u201cArt asks us to change the way we look at the world, where we are in life and what our responsibilities are.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/art", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "At the Storm King Art Center in New York, a group of artists has come together to showcase works that cover a growing, and often ignored, issue", "date_published": {"$date": 1527674448000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1527682290000}, "authors": ["Nadja Sayej"], "article_section": "Art and design", "article_tags": ["Art and design", "Art", "Climate change", "Culture", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/30/climate-change-exhbition-storm-king-new-york", "og:description": "At the Storm King Art Center in New York, a group of artists has come together to showcase works that cover a growing, and often ignored, issue", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25e31070b02a4e35549d6abe9493a99f44c088af/0_196_7221_4333/master/7221.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=f09187390cc3e525143162e6d52fc6a8", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Artists on climate change: the exhibition tackling a global crisis"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25e31070b02a4e35549d6abe9493a99f44c088af/0_196_7221_4333/master/7221.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=80f6594c0a4875f013e8ef6d7cca98b4", "width": "7221", "height": "4333", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25e31070b02a4e35549d6abe9493a99f44c088af/0_196_7221_4333/master/7221.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=99f3b335465777e03245c37fe2942de4", "description": "We are the Asteroid by Justin Brice Guariglia, at Storm King in New York.\nPhotograph: Jerry L Thompson"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c138e22fdd778fc5acd7ab43fbed75cc8f00cf24/0_0_5077_4476/master/5077.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b99a7dd56366e5f985d6814a3533125b", "width": "5077", "height": "4476", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c138e22fdd778fc5acd7ab43fbed75cc8f00cf24/0_0_5077_4476/master/5077.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7877ff3cacc66ebdc664547a2f4d7108", "description": "General Assembly by Dear Climate.

I don't dismiss the possibility that we are having an effect, even possibly the majority of the effect.  I don't know. But as I understand it, there is no way to adequately separate cause from correlation. The temperature might have already been going up. It all depends on scale. It all depends on what you use as your baseline. Anybody having studied EIA knows this is the deepest problem: what is the base state in a constantly shifting environment? How do you isolate cause and effect in complex, constantly moving multivariable environments? How do you explain the fact that CO2 rises have always followed global temperature rises?\nFrom the same 2001 IPPC report: https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/501.htm\n which was forecasting dangerous global warming:\n\"The climate system is a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore the long-term prediction of future climate states IS NOT POSSIBLE\" Huh? What? Read that again.\nNow, this incredible statement might have meant to suggest that they cannot predict how badAGW will be. I'm just guessing that's what they meant. But that presumes an a priori, deterministic assumption that AGW  is occurring and what the effects will be. That is NOT how science is supposed to work! In reality, that statement simply points to what other scientists have been saying all along. That the models are wrong, and that some circumspection is needed. As a parent, do I prefer circumspection and scepticism to the 'We're all fucked' scenario? Yes. Gee, I wonder why? And what about time scales again? As 99% of all species that have ever existed are extinct, are we sure that we are actually in control? That if we created the perfect climate and Utopia, earth wouldn't just shrug us all off anyway?\nFrom my reading, this is the state of the climate debate. One end of the scale says we are facing catastrophic global cooling; in the middle there are the moderates who say we are facing either some cooling, or some warming, but no big deal; then at the other end, we have the global warming catastrophists. The extremes at either end agree on catastrophic climate change with a sort of religious ecstasy. Ah, judgement day! Then there's all of us; the little people, trying to get on with our small little lives. Most people say they agree with AGW, and agree 'Yes! Isn't it terrible. We must do something about it'. We have a generation of anxious young people (why are they cutting themselves?) who just get told about how generally vile humans are, about gloom and doom and global annihilation every day.

It takes 30 years to measure the temperature of the global climate. The change in the yearly global temperature is not the same thing as the change in the global climate temperature. The first is measured over one year for example over 2016 or 2018, the latter is measured over the 30 years leading up to that year and including that year for example 1989-2018 or 1987-2016.\nThe yearly global temperature varies largely in response to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) which changes phase around the middle of each calendar year. 2015-16 was an extreme El Nino, 2016-17 was on the borderline between neutral and La Nina while 2017-18 has been a weak La Nina. These ENSO phase changes have caused global yearly temperatures to drop over the last few years. Global climate temperature represents the long term trend which reflects.\nIncreasing levels of CO2 mean more heat is retrained each year but only 6% to 7% of that extra heat goes to warm the atmosphere resulting in the the global climate temperatures we see. During La nina and neutral years heat moves from the atmosphere to the oceans resulting in a cooler gobal temperature compared to a preceding El Nino year. This is what happened from 2015-16 through 2016-17 to 2017-18.\nIs the temperature of the global climate changing?

For a while, in those zones, this will likely result in more cloud and rain, less and less frequently punctuated by blistering heatwaves. \nWhen the poles rise in temperature enough to halt the cycles of tide and weather systems, from the equator outwards, temperate zones will probably just be permanently grey and stormy. From space the Earth will look like a blue and grey striped ball. \nSo no, upstate New York is unlikely to get a tropical climate, unless half the land mass of the Earth, around the middle, has been turned to desert.

There can be consensus on a particular theory, but that theory must be open to testing and challenge, otherwise it's not science, it's religion. \nNo amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong Einstein\nWhat should frighten everybody is the bullying and shouting down of scientists who do not agree with the models or predictions (many of which have failed miserably). And no, despite their dismissal and vilification as lunatics or in the pay of big oil, most of them are simply humble scientists. I want to understand opposing views and arguments. Certainly none of the dire predictions by the James Hansens and Al Gores of the world have materialised within the time frames they gave with such certainty. That means their theories/models were wrong. Global temperatures dropped between 2016 and 2108, despite CO2 going up. Does this mean the whole thing is baloney?

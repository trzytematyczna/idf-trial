It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal.\u201d\nThe talks have centred on devising a rulebook for implementing the 2015 Paris agreement and raising countries\u2019 level of ambition to counter climate change, but progress has been slow on several key issues and divisions have emerged between four fossil fuel powers \u2013 the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait \u2013 and the rest of the world.\nThe UN believes China could play a stronger role in the absence of leadership from the US. Sources said Guterres would make a telephone call to Xi to ask for his help in nudging talks forward.\nThe EU also wants China, which is a key member of the block of 77 developing countries, to step up to ensure that countries all follow the same rules in being transparent over their greenhouse gas emissions.\nCampaigners praised the decision by the High Ambition Coalition group of countries, made up of the EU and four other developed countries, including Canada and New Zealand, as well as the large grouping of least developed countries and several other developing nations, to scale up their emissions-cutting efforts in line with a 1.5C temperature rise limit.\nWendel Trio, director of the Climate Action Network Europe, said: \u201cThe spirit of Paris is back. The statement will boost greater ambition at the crunch time of these so far underwhelming talks. For the EU this must mean a commitment to significantly increase its 2030 target by 2020, even beyond the 55% reduction some member states and the European parliament are calling for. We call upon the countries that have not signed the statement so far to stop ignoring the science.\u201d \nGuterres, in a pointed criticism aimed at the four countries that have been refusing to \u201cwelcome\u201d the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s special report on 1.5-degree warming, said rejecting climate science was indefensible.\nHe added: \u201cThe IPCC special report is a stark acknowledgment of what the consequences of global warming beyond 1.5 degrees will mean for billions of people around the world, especially those who call small island states home. This is not good news, but we cannot afford to ignore it.\u201d\nFrank Bainimarama, the prime minister of Fiji and the outgoing chair of COP23, amplified Guterres\u2019 message. He told delegates they risked going down in history as \u201cthe generation that blew it \u2013 that sacrificed the health of our world and ultimately betrayed humanity because we didn\u2019t have the courage and foresight to go beyond our short-term individual concerns: craven, irresponsible and selfish\u201d.\nThe former US vice-president Al Gore told delegates they faced \u201cthe single most important moral choice in history of humanity\u201d.\nBehind the scenes, delegates said there had been strong progress on finance thanks to a doubling of commitments by Germany and Norway to help poorer nations adapt to climate change and build institutions capable of monitoring emissions. Nicholas Stern, the author of a landmark review on the economics of climate change, praised \u201cthe level of ideas and cooperation\u201d.\nBut others said there were still many disputed brackets in the negotiating text on transparency and other elements of the rulebook.\n\u201cThere has been some progress, but it\u2019s a very worrying time. There is still a lot more on the table than we hoped for at this stage,\u201d said Helen Mountford, vice-president of the World Resources Institute. \u201cThe secretary general is coming in to make sure this COP can land in a good place. He will hold a summit next year to raise ambitions. If he wants success there, then here we need a robust rulebook and clear signals on ambition and finance.\u201d\nJanos Pasztor, the former climate adviser to Ban Ki-moon, told the Guardian that Guterres was doing the right thing by intervening at a crucial stage. \u201cHe needs to make clear what the IPCC has described as a major challenge, and that we have to deliver on that,\u201d he said.\nPasztor added: \u201cWe are talking about the need for massive emissions reductions, that have to happen now, not in the future. It is very daunting. The secretary general has reminded the world of what is at stake, and the political significance of that.\u201d\nThe contrasts with the Paris climate summit, in terms of the political atmosphere, were striking. David Leva\u00ef, who was part of the French government team that helped to broker the successful 2015 conference, said the geopolitical winds were far less favourable today. Globally, the rise of nationalists such as Donald Trump in the US and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil has tilted power towards fossil fuel and agribusiness interests.\nHe said: \u201cIn the year before Paris, all countries made clear that they wanted an agreement. Now, there are repeated attacks on multilateralism, and this has empowered groups that take negative actions.\u201d\nLeva\u00ef, who is at the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations, expressed hope that the secretary general might make a difference. \u201cThe fact that he has come back shows he feels a need to whip countries into order,\u201d he said.\nThere has been some criticism of the pro-coal government of Poland for failing to press governments to raise their ambitions. But it joined Fiji as co-chair of the Talanoa phase of the negotiations to issue a call for action that recognised the importance of the 1.5C report as the basis for more urgency and ambition.\n\u201cThe window for action is closing fast. We need to do more and we need to do it now,\u201d said the document, which would form part of the official statement from this conference.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/china", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/asia-pacific", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "EU, Canada, New Zealand and developing countries pledge action to keep level of global warming below 1.5C", "date_published": {"$date": 1544648378000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544705513000}, "authors": ["Fiona Harvey", "Ben Doherty", "Jonathan Watts"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "United Nations", "Fossil fuels", "Xi Jinping", "World news", "Environment", "China", "Asia Pacific", "Energy", "Poland"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/12/un-chief-antonio-guterres-attempts-to-revive-flagging-climate-change-talks", "og:description": "EU, Canada, New Zealand and developing countries pledge action to keep level of global warming below 1.5C", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c2de1e41d12080760e88d7231f7c4fd7b562648/0_215_5013_3007/master/5013.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=451cd206600bf6e03415f77653dcd463", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Climate change talks lead to heightened pledge to cut emissions"}, "headline": "m", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c2de1e41d12080760e88d7231f7c4fd7b562648/0_215_5013_3007/master/5013.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f96513d1487e7474a082c198da6d44fd", "width": "5013", "height": "3007", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c2de1e41d12080760e88d7231f7c4fd7b562648/0_215_5013_3007/master/5013.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=02dcf4544aec56b355d6e551cd7a5bc2", "description": "The Katowice talks are centred on raising countries\u2019 level of ambition to counter climate change.\nPhotograph: Fehim Demir/EPA"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7541daf7c9bc7fa3ec4de902c9098e98bf6aebd/0_61_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ecc6694cf0405b31a3dfbe1cef2d0d2e", "width": "3500", "height": "2101", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7541daf7c9bc7fa3ec4de902c9098e98bf6aebd/0_61_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=348ef49306207a5d17a4e73a38344a69", "description": "Al Gore at the COP24 UN climate change conference 2018 in Katowice, Poland.

Although these industries are the main source of the carbon emissions that are causing global warming, the speakers boasted the US would expand production for the sake of global energy security and planned a new fleet of coal plants with technology it hoped to export to other countries.\nThe event featured prominent cheerleaders for fossil fuels and nuclear power, including Wells Griffith, Donald Trump\u2019s adviser on global energy and climate, Steve Winberg, the assistant secretary for fossil energy at the energy department, and Rich Powell, the executive director of the ClearPath Foundation, a non-profit organisation focused on \u201cconservative clean energy\u201d. The only non-American was Patrick Suckling, the ambassador for the environment in Australia\u2019s coal-enthusiast government.\nNone of the US participants mentioned climate change or global warming, focusing instead of \u201cinnovation and entrepreneurship\u201d in the technological development of nuclear power, \u201cclean coal\u201d and carbon capture and storage.\nTen minutes into Griffith\u2019s opening speech, he was interrupted by a sudden, sustained, loud volley of laughter by several dozen protesters that was then followed by a single shout of \u201cIt\u2019s not funny\u201d, and then a series of chants of \u201cKeep it in the ground\u201d and \u201cShame on you\u201d.\nSeveral campaigners read statements. \u201cThere is no such thing as clean coal. Coal is deadly from the beginning to the end. They talk about the life cycle of coal, I talk about it as a death march. My father died of black lung, and I am in this struggle with others whose fathers and husbands are dying of black lung right now,\u201d said Teri Blanton of Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, which represents Appalachian coal workers in North America.\nAfter the protesters were led away by security guards, Griffiths said: \u201cIn the US our policy is not to keep it in the ground, but to use it as cleanly and efficiently as possible\u201d.\nThis statement was contradicted by climate analysts, who noted the US environment agency estimates that 1,400 more deaths per year will result from Trump\u2019s proposal to replace the Clean Power Act.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous for Trump officials to claim that they want to clean up fossil fuels, while dismantling standards that would do just that,\u201d said Dan Lashof, the director of the World Resources Institute. \u201cSince taking office, this administration has proposed to roll back measures to cut methane leaks from oil and gas operations, made it easier for companies to dump coal ash into drinking water, and just days ago proposed easing carbon pollution rules for new coal-fired power plants.\u201d\nGriffith boasted the US had the largest coal reserves in the world and was producing more petroleum than ever. \u201cTo achieve economic growth and eradicate poverty, all energy uses are important and they will be utilised unapologetically,\u201d he said.\nEchoing a claim often made by Trump, Griffiths said the US would not be subject to agreements that hamstrung domestic growth, while allowing China to operate with high emissions.\nThis was the second consecutive year that the Trump team was heckled after promoting fossil fuels and nuclear power at the climate talks, underscoring how the US position has shifted since the president took power in 2017.\nThe US was a key player in forging the Paris agreement in 2015, but its standing has steadily eroded since. In 2017, Trump announced he would pull the US out of the global accord. This year, his representatives have taken a still more destructive stance by aligning with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to try to downgrade a key report by the world\u2019s scientists that warned of the dangers of global warming moving beyond 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\nNone of the panelists would be drawn on the study, but Griffith spoke out against \u201calarmism\u201d that, he claimed, displaced pragmatic solutions to address environmental concerns with prescriptive regulations that put jobs at risk and raised costs for consumers. In fact, scientists say their forecasts about climate impacts have been too conservative, while economists say the shift to renewables has resulted in cheaper energy for many users.\nWinberg said the US government was planning to support a new fleet of small, modular coal plants that he claimed would be energy-efficient and have near-zero emissions if combined with carbon capture technology. After initial development in the US, he said they could be exported to other countries. \u201cThey offer opportunity for developing nations to access tomorrow\u2019s coal technology to improve energy security,\u201d he said. He also proposed more pipelines to oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico.\nDespite this public commitment, the US use of coal is declining because renewables are cheaper, according to Nathaniel Keohane, the senior vice-president for the Environmental Defense Fund nonprofit group.\n\u201cTrump is playing politics, but it\u2019s not changing the facts on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cCoal usage in the US just hit a 39-year low. If we really want to protect our economy, we\u2019ll move aggressively toward 100% clean energy.\u201d\nAn alternative, non-official US delegation has backed a faster transition to renewables. Made up of city- and state-level governments, business executives and religious leaders, the \u201cWe\u2019re still in\u201d group is staging dozens of events in a bid to show action is still possible without White House support.\nNonetheless, many observers at the official US panel were ashamed at the position of their federal government. \u201cI was completely embarrassed to be an American\u201d, said Leo McNeil Woodberry of the Climate Action Network. \u201cEverything they proposed was absolutely wrong. I can\u2019t believe they are putting profits over the planet, and profits over people.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/poland", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/protest", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Official event praising coal, oil and gas met with laughter and chants of \u2018shame on you\u2019", "date_published": {"$date": 1544458887000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1552563429000}, "authors": ["Jonathan Watts"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Coal", "Fossil fuels", "US news", "Poland", "Energy", "Environment", "Europe", "World news", "Protest", "Trump administration", "United Nations", "US politics"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/10/protesters-disrupt-us-panels-fossil-fuels-pitch-at-climate-talks", "og:description": "Official event praising coal, oil and gas met with laughter and chants of \u2018shame on you\u2019", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc1d9d7e6354240dbf4eb372fccfecc1a140d4f2/0_269_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=aba49c42d2eb5a4635fe439a40437924", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Protesters disrupt US panel's fossil fuels pitch at climate talks"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/816b70b3bdff595028ff0631eeffdc8150013a13/0_0_3546_2364/master/3546.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a7f2443f95b956c8d97b4a022398d2b9", "width": "3546", "height": "2364", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/816b70b3bdff595028ff0631eeffdc8150013a13/0_0_3546_2364/master/3546.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0236d1a4f38880383fcde358ef786976", "description": "Protesters disrupt US panel with chants of \u2018Keep it in the ground\u2019 and \u2018Shame on you\u2019.

A small beetle was devouring large swathes of the region\u2019s valuable pine forests, leaving millions of trees dead as infestation spread. The government waited anxiously for cold winters \u2013 which would kill the beetles \u2013 but year after year the cold never came.\nBy 2008 the decimation of the forests, along with a series of intense storms walloping the province, prompted British Columbia to take action on climate change. The provincial government introduced a carbon tax, putting a price on fossil fuel emissions. And, crucially, all the money raised was returned to the people in tax cuts.\n\u201cIt was groundbreaking,\u201d said Karen Tam Wu of the Pembina Institute, an environmental thinktank. \u201cIt was the first one in the world that was revenue neutral.\u201d\nA decade later, as climate scientists and policymakers converge on UN talks in Katowice, Poland, urgently seek mechanisms to rein in carbon emissions in a bid to halt the inexorable rise of global temperatures, the British Columbia experiment with the tax is setting an example to others.\nEconomists and environmentalists have voiced support for it; the World Bank has called it a \u201ctextbook\u201d way of developing environmental policy. Earlier in October, the economist William Nordhaus, winner of this year\u2019s Nobel Prize for economics, threw his support behind the British Columbia model as an ideal model for export to other economies.\nBritish Columbia is a province known for its environmental lean: yoga and hiking are the region\u2019s main cultural exports. For many Canadians, it seems fitting that the continent\u2019s most progressive carbon tax would originate amid mountains, surf and forest.\nEver wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?\nThis series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.\nReaders can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com\nBut the man who helped to usher it in, the former premier Gordon Campbell, rejects the notion that love for the environment is unique to the region.\n\u201cIf you talk to people in rural communities, in urban communities, in Ontario or Alberta, and they all care about the environment,\u201d Campbell told the Guardian. \u201cThey all want to go to pristine places.\u201d\nTroubled by the compounding effects of climate change he saw both at home and abroad, Campbell and his government believed a carbon tax represented the most effective way to address the problem \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t a time to point fingers.\n\u201cAre we willing to do something to try to stop [climate change] from taking place, to slow it down?\u201d he said. \u201cEven for people who say: \u2018It wouldn\u2019t matter, Canada could have all of the emissions in the world and it wouldn\u2019t make any difference.\u2019 That\u2019s not the point. We should do our bit.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a shame that in some places, carbon tax is seen as four-letter word\nThe carbon tax isn\u2019t anything new. The world\u2019s best known carbon tax to carry that name began in the European Union in 2005, with the Emissions Trading System. With initial success the price of pollution permits reached more than \u20ac20 ($22/\u00a318) for the right to emit a ton of carbon. But heavy lobbying by industry led to a massive oversupply of permits and a price crash to \u20ac3 in 2013 \u2013 far too low to drive carbon cuts. Reforms have taken the price back above \u20ac20 in recent weeks.\nChina has seen the attraction of carbon markets as an efficient way of delivering the biggest carbon cuts at the lowest cost. Its carbon market is being established and will, on completion, be the world\u2019s biggest.\nIn the world\u2019s second biggest polluter, the US, 10 east coast states have had a \u201ccap and trade\u201d system for carbon emissions since 2009, under which companies have their greenhouse gas emissions capped and then must trade any surplus or deficit with others. But Barack Obama, while president, was unable to pass a nationwide system. Some prominent Republicans have backed a revenue-neutral carbon tax, but with little success.\nMany fossil fuel companies claim to back carbon taxes, notably in Australia, where climate policy rows have toppled prime ministers. The oil giant BP is among the supporters of carbon taxes, yet recently spent $13m (\u00a310.22m) in helping to defeat a proposal in Washington state.\nIn the rest of Canada, despite the success story in British Columbia, other provinces are dragging their heels. The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has legislated to impose a carbon levy on reluctant provinces, generating a storm of opposition.\nOntario\u2019s premier Doug Ford, who recently repealed the province\u2019s carbon tax, has called it \u201cthe worst tax ever\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that in some places, carbon tax is seen as four-letter word,\u201d said Wu. \u201cIt\u2019s really a key tool in the toolkit to incentivise the transition to a low carbon economy and curb carbon pollution. In British Columbia, it has definitely worked.\u201d\nNonetheless, the outlook for carbon taxes looks bright: 88 nations, representing more than half of global emissions, say they are or will uses carbon pricing to tackle climate change. Furthermore, some states have suggested they would impose carbon border levies on imported goods from nations that do not tax carbon.\nBy design, the British Columbia plan was simple: it slapped a tax on any fossil fuels used for heating, electricity and transportation. Each person and business was expected to shoulder the burden of pricing pollution; no loopholes, no exemptions.\nIn everyday life prices ticked up, most noticeably at the gas pump. Companies with emissions-intensive work passed their increased costs on to consumers.\nThe tax was leading edge at the time. And, unfortunately, 11 years later, it\u2019s still leading edge\nBut the critical selling point of the plan \u2013 the tax\u2019s revenue neutral design \u2013 was unprecedented. With a revenue-neutral tax, the government keeps none of the money collected from the levy. Instead, it redistributes all of it \u2013 close to $1.8bn in its first three years \u2013 back to taxpayers in the form of tax cuts.\nAs a result, the increase in energy costs for residents was offset by a tax cut of roughly equal value. Anyone willing and able to change their behaviour to reduce emissions would end up in the black.\n\u201cThe nice thing about the revenue-neutral carbon tax was that it didn\u2019t judge people: if you want to buy something that emits more than somebody else, you\u2019re going to pay more tax,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cPeople who wanted to have their taxes actually reduced had to change a little bit of their behaviour, and their tax load would have been reduced.\u201d\nLow-income residents, as well as those living in rural areas that relied more heavily on fossil fuels, received extra tax and cash benefits.\nThe tax began as a $10/ton levy on carbon emissions, eventually reaching $30/ton by 2012. In speeches touting the tax, Campbell said the reduction in emissions would equate to removing 750,000 cars from the road in the province.\nThe move \u2013 the first of its kind \u2013 placated both conservative economists and environmentalists. And, it worked.\n\u201cWe saw fossil fuel consumption decrease by more than 17% and in the rest of Canada fuel consumption increased by more than 1%,\u201d Wu said of the four-year period between 2008 and 2012, when the first tranche of increases went into effect.\nFears that the tax would have a negative impact on the economy quickly melted away when the numbers came in, she said. The province grew its economy by 16%, far outpacing any other region of the country.\n\u201cIt was leading edge at the time,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cAnd, unfortunately, 11 years later, it\u2019s still leading edge.\u201d\nBy 2012, when the tax reached its first maximum level ($30 per ton), 64% of the population supported it. By 2016, it garnered the support of nearly 70% of residents.\nIn Victoria, the province\u2019s capital, residents remain unfazed over the constant increases \u2013 a testament of how the tax has drifted into the background. Devon Crosby, who has worked in the oil and gas industry for much of his career, said he has little patience for the current feud across the country. \u201cLook, I\u2019d rather pay an extra 15% on gas for a cleaner and nicer British Columbia.\u201d\nFor others, the tax cuts outweigh any increased costs. \u201cMoney talks,\u201d said resident Kim Hollingsworth. \u201cPeople need incentives to change their behaviour.\u201d She based her decision to buy a new, more energy efficient heater on the climate rebates \u2013 part of the suite of climate policies Campbell introduced.\nThe revenue-neutral aspect of the tax is novel but has frustrated some environmental groups, who feel the tax does not do enough to reduce emissions. Others felt it was too onerous: between 2012 and 2016 Campbell\u2019s successor as premier, Christy Clark, froze the tax and repealed a number of environmental policies.\n\u201cWhen the carbon tax was frozen, we saw emissions go back up,\u201d said Wu.\nBy 2021, the tax is slated to reach $50/ton, but the current British Columbia government is examining modifying the revenue-neutral aspect of the programme in order to allocate funding for green infrastructure, deviating from its original revenue neutrality \u2013 a move Campbell feels defeats the purpose of the tax in the first place: \u201cI\u2019m not happy when we say it\u2019s going to be revenue-neutral carbon tax and it isn\u2019t really. Don\u2019t play that game with people.\u201d\nHe remains optimistic that the current feud in the country will dissipate over time. Too many people, he says, are on the defensive, feeling the problems of climate change are not directly their fault.\n\u201cI think the relevant question is: are we willing to do something about it when it\u2019s happening?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we can help, are we willing to?\u201d\nThe numbers that are fuelling international concerns about global warming and climate change are stark. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by a third over the past 100 years, to more than 400 parts per million.\nThat has happened as a result of sharp rises in annual emissions of greenhouse gases, which have roughly doubled since 1971, to 53.5m tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. (CO2 from industrial processes and from forestry and other land uses makes up about three quarters of greenhouse gases; methane comprises another 16% and nitrous oxide about 6%).\nAnnual global emissions flatlined for three years from 2014-2016, but rose sharply again last year.\nMeanwhile, over the past century, average global temperatures have risen more than 1C.\nThe one bit of good news is the exponential rise in renewable power supplies, which have surged over the past 20 years to comprise more than 8% of global electricity generation.\nUnder the 2015 Paris agreement, signatories are supposed to rein in carbon emissions so as to keep global temperatures from rising to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. But the 1.5C threshold is now looming, mechanisms for implementing Paris are still weak, and many observers are predicting that rises of 3C or more are now far more likely by the second half of this century.\nThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

For years the Greens had been using the term carbon tax for a proposal of a price on carbon which they considered better than a carbon trading scheme. Tony Abbott also called the price on carbon a carbon tax for political obscurantist reasons. His then Chief of Staff has since admitted that this was the wrong term to use for a price on carbon. The price on carbon was not designed to keep on increasing - instead it was designed to transition into a carbon trading scheme the cost of which would be decided by the market. If that had been allowed to occur the price would have dropped as the cost of renewable energy dropped. Both Tony Abbott and the Greens were opposed to market mechanisms.\nThe old coal fired plants were built by state governments using taxpayers funds to replace privately owned plants which were proving inadequate. Power bills were a cost compared to average weekly earnings in the 50s and 60s and supply was not reliable. Later they were sold at loss by number of state governments to corporations who neglected their maintenance while making good profits. Over the last few decades the retail price of electricity has increased greatly due to increases in the network cost to cover the cost of its delivery - amounting to 54% of the retail cost. Generation costs amount to less than 20% the retail cost of electricity. New South Wales and Victoria have the oldest now privately owned power stations, some of which have now closed and many of which are approaching retirement.

If the BC economy is growing, how is that affecting all emissions due to its economy, including emissions that occur outside BC but are for goods and services consumed in BC? I did try to find some of this data and the story didn't appear to be as rosy as made out here, but that was some time ago. I'd love to see the full picture, not just anecdotal evidence as it's hard to see how a revenue neutral tax would have as much of an impact as some hope.

The text of the speech the former prime minister ultimately delivered on Tuesday morning, now uploaded on his website, did not address the impact of Labor\u2019s higher target.\nBut an earlier draft of the speech, did.\n\u201cLabor has announced it will adopt the Neg but with a higher emissions target,\u201d the early draft, seen by Guardian Australia, said. \u201cOurs, as you know, was 26% which was only just above business as usual so it obviously had no adverse impact on prices.\n\u201cThere is some modelling already from Frontier Economics which suggests that Labor\u2019s 45% target will not result in higher prices,\u201d the early draft said. \u201cThat assertion deserves sceptical assessment, but it is also important regularly to review these models in the light of the latest technology and market information.\n\u201cA great deal depends too on whether a 45% reduction means simply that emissions in 2030 \u2013 in that year \u2013 should be 45% less than in 2005. If that were the case, implying a hockey stick, the additional cost may not be as high as it would appear.\u201d\nTurnbull issued the following statement to Guardian Australia about the unauthorised disclosure of his draft speech to the energy conference. \u201cThe notes were obtained by Guardian Australia without my authority.\n\u201cThey are incomplete draft material.

He said higher emissions reduction targets needed to be guided by \u201cengineering and economics\u201d.\nWhen the general comments Turnbull made about reviving the Neg fuelled a Labor attack on the government\u2019s energy policy in question time, the former prime minister took to social media to stress that he had not endorsed Labor\u2019s 45% target.\n\u201cI have not endorsed Labor\u2019s energy policy,\u201d the former prime minister said on Twitter. \u201cThey have adopted the Neg mechanism but have not demonstrated that their 45% emissions reduction target will not push up prices.

These cuts and a series of other measures are also needed to prevent catastrophic climate change, it says.\nMore than 50% more food will be needed by 2050, according to the World Resources Institute (WRI) report, but greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture will have to fall by two-thirds at the same time. The extra food will have to be produced without creating new farmland, it says, otherwise the world\u2019s remaining forests face destruction. Meat and dairy production use 83% of farmland and produce 60% of agriculture\u2019s emissions.\nIncreasing the amount of food produced per hectare was the most critical step, the experts said, followed by cutting meat-eating and putting a stop to the wasting of one-third of food produced.\n\u201cWe have to change how we produce and consume food, not just for environmental reasons, but because this is an existential issue for humans,\u201d said Janet Ranganathan, vice-president for science and research at the WRI.\nTim Searchinger, of the WRI and Princeton University, said: \u201cIf we tried to produce all the food needed in 2050 using today\u2019s production systems, the world would have to convert most of its remaining forest, and agriculture alone would produce almost twice the emissions allowable from all human activities.\u201d\nThe new report, launched at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, follows other major scientific analyses showing that huge reductions in meat-eating are \u201cessential\u201d to avoid dangerous climate change. Another found that avoiding meat and dairy products was the single biggest way to reduce  an individual\u2019s environmental impact on the planet, from slowing the annihilation of wildlife to healing dead zones in the oceans.\nThe world\u2019s science academies concluded last week that the global food system was \u201cbroken\u201d, leaving billions of people either underfed or overweight and driving dangerous global warming. Another new report concluded that the global food system required \u201cradical transformation\u201d if climate change and development goals were to be met, including \u201cwidespread dietary change\u201d.\nAfter increased productivity, the WRI report focuses on meat from ruminant animals. The digestion of cattle and sheep produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Beef provided 3% of the calories in the diet of US citizens but was responsible for half the emissions, the WRI said.\nThe report recommends that 2 billion people across countries including the US, Russia and Brazil cut their beef and lamb consumption by 40%, limiting it to 1.5 servings a week on average. Most of the world\u2019s citizens would continue to eat relatively little beef in the WRI scenario.\nBut Searchinger said: \u201cThe world\u2019s poor people are entitled to consume at least a little more.\u201d The 40% reduction is a smaller cut than in other studies. \u201cWe think that is a realistic goal,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the US and Europe, beef consumption has already reduced by one-third from the 1960s until today.\u201d\nTobias Baedeker, of the World Bank, said farmers would require a lot of support to make the changes required but that redirecting the world\u2019s huge subsidies could be a \u201cgame-changer\u201d. Subsidies of more than $590bn (\u00a3460bn) a year are given to farmers in 51 nations, representing two-thirds of global food output, according to the OECD. In the US, these subsidies halve the current price of beef, the WRI says.\nThe sophisticated marketing and behaviour-change strategies that food companies already used to influence customers could help shift diets, said Ranganathan, as could governments encouraging less meat in schools, hospitals and other public institutions.\nOther changes to farming that are needed, according to the WRI, include better feed to reduce methane production from cows, limiting biofuels made from food crops, managing manure and fertiliser better and cutting energy use by farm machinery. It also said the overall demand for food could be cut, with policies to curb population growth such as \u201cimproving women\u2019s access to education and healthcare in Africa to accelerate voluntary reductions in fertility levels\u201d.\nThe WRI report was launched at the UN climate summit in Poland where almost 200 nations are aiming to turn the carbon-cutting vision set out in Paris in 2015 into reality. The rapid ramping up of action is another key goal.

This suggests the ice sheet becomes more sensitive as temperatures go up.\n\u201cGreenland ice is melting more in recent decades than at any point in at least the last four centuries, and probably more than at any time in the last seven to eight millennia,\u201d said the lead author Luke Trusel, of Rowan University.\n\u201cWe demonstrate that Greenland ice is more sensitive to warming today than in the past \u2013 it responds non-linearly due to positive feedbacks inherent to the system. Warming means more today than it did even just a few decades ago.\u201d\nThe researchers used ice core data from three locations to build the first multi-century record of temperature, surface melt and run-off in Greenland. Going back 339 years, they found the first sign of meltwater increase began along with the industrial revolution in the mid-1800s. The trend remained within the natural variation until the 1990s, since when it has spiked far outside of the usual nine- to 13-year cycles.\nGreenland currently contributes about 20% of global sea-level rise, which is running at 4mm per year. This pace will probably double by the end of the century, according to the most recent models used by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. How the new study affects those projections will be the subjects of future study by the authors. If all the ice in Greenland melted, it would raise sea levels by seven metres. At the current pace that would take thousands of years, but the ongoing acceleration could bring this forward rapidly.\n\u201cAt some point, sea-level rise will be too fast for us to adapt to, so we really have to avoid this situation by reducing emissions,\u201d said the study\u2019s co-author Michiel van den Broeke of Utrecht University. \u201cI think this is one of the many wake-up calls that we have had in the last few decades. It clearly links manmade global warming to sea-level rise.\u201d\nThe research comes out as policymakers from around the world are attending UN climate talks in Katowice, Poland, where governments are trying to set new rules to keep global warming to between 1.5C and 2C. The authors said the paper underlined the dangers of exceeding even the lower figure.\n\u201cOn a personal level it is worrying to see this \u2013 along with the vast array of other scientific evidence showing that we\u2019ve entered unprecedented or exceptional times,\u201d said Trusel.\n\u201cThe ice has no political agenda \u2013 it either grows or melts. Today it is melting as humans have warmed the planet. The ice sheets have tipping points, and how quickly they impact our livelihoods through sea level rise depends on what we do now and in the very near future.\u201d\nOther academics, uninvolved in the paper, said the new study was an important confirmation of what scientists have long suspected: that the recent increase in ice melt is ominously unusual.\n\u201cThe Greenland ice sheet is like a sleeping giant who is slowly but surely awakening to ongoing global warming, and there are surprises in its response. However, the response may be more rapid than previously believed,\u201d said Edward Hanna, professor of climate science and meteorology at the University of Lincoln.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/greenland", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oceans", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Run-off from vast ice sheet is increasing due to manmade global warming, says study", "date_published": {"$date": 1544033972000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544037003000}, "authors": ["Jonathan Watts"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Sea level", "Greenland", "Environment", "Oceans", "World news", "UK news", "Climate change"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/05/sea-levels-may-rise-more-rapidly-due-to-greenland-ice-melt", "og:description": "Run-off from vast ice sheet is increasing due to manmade global warming, says study", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b0daa94b7797a3620ca348aae21e2c913b13f92/0_235_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=f0754218a3c65a86e37b84a3d4011e1c", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Sea levels may rise more rapidly due to Greenland ice melt"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b0daa94b7797a3620ca348aae21e2c913b13f92/0_235_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f7e7b31aa36f17c68d6351cd71e113a3", "width": "3072", "height": "1843", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b0daa94b7797a3620ca348aae21e2c913b13f92/0_235_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=84ecacb67a9913f412141431d29b5bce", "description": "A meltwater canyon on the Greenland ice sheet.\nPhotograph: Sarah Das/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution/PA"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556125020117}, "comments": [{"id": "123479062", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1544289967000}, "author": "loco_p_man", "author_id": "13126382", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "You're a top fellow, glacier.

And this is undoubtedly going up, and the global rise in meat consumption is known to be a big contributer.\nThen you give a further deeply spurious argument about Californian wildfires. Yes, if/when they happen much carbon is emitted. But overall, plant growth is the most efficient form of carbon sequestration we have, and allowing tree growth - particularly where wildfires are rare (like cooler/wetter countries) - is therefore essential. Instead, having large herbivores chomping away at that growth, releasing it as methane, so that we can then eat them and then release even more methane is absolutely pushing us in the wrong direction. I say this as an omnivore who is cutting back on meat, not as a 'vegan zealot' of some people's imagining!\nWe really need to stop clutching at straws because the truth is hard to stomach.", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "123380286", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "it is the global contribution to carbon emissions from agriculture that matter", "effect": "then you cherrypick a factoid about uk farming is irrelevant"}, {"cause": "the truth is hard to stomach", "effect": "we really need to stop clutching at straws"}]}, {"id": "123474498", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1544273111000}, "author": "Snaga", "author_id": "3060949", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Broadly speaking, knowing what to do is not the issue. The how would be a massive massive challenge. More on that in a moment. Because we could rise to a massive massive challenge, but our leaders lack the political courage/will to do it. It can only happen when 'we, the people' demand it of them. At present, politicians simply do not believe people want or would accept what is needed. So we will have to go the brink before they step up. The question is, can the 'political brink' come soon enough that we are not already over the 'climate brink'. If we wait much longer, we will be over the edge and the social and economic consequences will degrade our collective capacity to act.\nThis is where recognising the collective scale of the challenge is essential. If you took as a case study, a typical UK local authority which might have say, 50 schools, 1000 council homes, 50 office/workplace type buildings and maybe 200 commercially rented buildings they are responsible for. They would be the MOST amenable to decarbonising, at least in theory. They would need to go in and replace every boiler and insulate and reglaze them all, introduce solar and/or district heating solutions and switch to green energy. They would need to go to LED lighting and put in energy saving devices. I can't price that up accurately but you probably are looking at \u00a350-100m easily. Do they have that money or borrowing capacity? No.\nThen scale that up across the entire public sector. Then ask how you get the private sector to follow suit. \nSo financially, it can't happen in a business-as-usual environment. You have to go onto a war footing. Furthermore, you have to anyway, because to even remotely attempt this, you have to overcome a yawning gulf between our current construction-related workforce and what you would need to achieve it.\nAnd in case you haven't noticed, I haven't even touched on transport, energy production, or agriculture.\nSo then ask yourself about the mindset change required from politicians brought up with laissez-faire assumptions, who have an ingrained preference for the nudge or 'enabling change'. And the civil service whose lack of capacity has been brutally exposed by brexit. Or our failure so far just to remove ACM cladding post Grenfell.\nCan we generate the unity, the resolve and the capacity to do this? Honestly, it would be a miracle.

The same climate science that told you about carbon. \nRemember, when Svante Arrhenius did his studies in the late 1800s - he was not primarily focusing on the heating effect of CO2 - he was looking more into the cooling effect under reduced CO2 levels - as an explanation for ice-ages (that was deducted to have occurred back then - long before one could date when that past was time was). \nIt took almost a century longer - when all the evidence of Earth orbit and inclination and ice-cores sampling and albedo-feedbacks etc got the data lined up for the current understanding - of an orbital pace-maker with direct physical CO2 and albedo-feedback. Now described physically to the extent that if one dial in max ice-age orbital configuration, albedo and CO2 - climate models do \"spit out\" an ice age naturally. \nIt is climate science that has told you about hot Plicocen and Eocen and Holocene Optimum and Eemian. It is climate science that has told you about extreme events such as the Younger Dryas or Marine Isotope stage 4. \nCo2 levels is always a thing. One simply can not make an ice-age with 400 ppm CO2, for example. The energy balance budget does not allow for it (remember - day after tomorrow was a Hollywood disaster film of the type that also allow science to drill to the Earth core because it is unstable (the Core) and similar fun-flicks). \nIt is science that tell you that unstable tectonic conditions over hundreds or thousands or millions of years could push the planet out of \"snow-ball\" Earth conditions. Or to spike the global temperature and isotopic levels of the planet for \"brief moments\" in the geological record. \nPlease remember, there is nothing \"artificial\" about the CO2 we humans produce. We take carbon - and make it react with oxygen - (what we call \"burning\") - and that reaction cause CO2 as exhaust. \nIf one light up coal seams around the planet directly - the result would be the same. CO2. \nBut not quite as efficient as we do. Because we open up mountains and expose gigatons of coal every year. Crush the coal. And burn the coal in special-built factories for max burn-rate (or efficiency if you like). \nThis exotermic way to make CO2 is simple. \nThe internal storage of free CO2 itself is way more complex (what happens when global CO2 naturally fall by ca 100 ppm during an ice-age) . A part of it is \"fizzy drink\" chemistry (not too complex). But the dynamic part of it - that fluids flow in 3D on our planet) is more complex. \nPoint of all this that GHG-gasses was always involved in \"everything that happened\" naturally. During LGM CO2 was trending ca 100 ppm below what we call \"natural\" - (the Holocene when human culture emerged). A way to think about this is that for the past 2 million years, CO2 was naturally varying between ca 180 and 280 ppm. In other words, CO2 was mostly below the 280 preindustrial value of the Holocene. \nTo be above 300 ppm is causing klaxons and red alarm-lights to go off like crazy. There is absolutely nothing normal about that. Until one start to budget in the amount of carbon being reported dug out and light up by companies since 1700 AD. \nSimilarly, natural fast CO2 exchange happens by a rate of ca 0.01 ppm per year - not by 3 ppm per year. \nLots of people on the internet tell us that 400 ppm is just 0.04% of the atmosphere. So they use the little argument. And then there are the guys who studied a bit of physics in the 1930\u00b4s or whatever, who say that the atmosphere is already saturated - and demonstrate that by physics. Sure. If one calculate the radiative effect of the atmosphere as one layer on the molecular level, kind of right. But the atmosphere is an \"infinite\" layer problem. It can not be solved by a uni-directional back-scatter approach - since the problem is omni-directional. \nPaleo-science has always been leaning to the side of higher sensitivity - not lower. Because when we calculate conditions locally, we could not close the equations with what models said back in the days. \nThe NASA model Hansen used 4 decades ago was more than good enough for the message. You can run this model on a laptop from 1995 - it is called Edu-ECM. \nLook at figure 6 here and compare it to the present discussion about 1.5 degree targets and 4 degree warmings. \nhttps://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1981/1981_Hansen_ha04600x.pdf\nA lot of great science has been done since.

Only 8% of over-65s agree, whereas 21% of 25 to 34-year-olds think that should happen.\nThe split between older and younger adults emerged in a survey of public attitudes by Populus. It carried out online polling of 2,096 UK adults for the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA).\n\u201cThe NHS can\u2019t afford to keep mitigating our failure to invest in what leads to good health: a welfare system that promotes economic security; investment in early years, education and skills; and better quality jobs for all,\u201d said Ed Cox, the RSA\u2019s director of public services and communities.\nYounger people have very different priorities than older age groups, Cox stressed. \u201cAside from a shared commitment to tackling inequality there is neither a clear consensus on tax increases nor agreement on how any extra money is spent.\n\u201cThe younger generations who\u2019ll pay for increased spending see climate change and technological adaptation as greater challenges than the ageing society,\u201d he added.\nSocial care illustrates the chasm of opinion between the age groups. While 54% of over-65s see increasing taxation as the best solution, fewer than one in four of those aged 18 to 44 agree.\nA third of 18 to 24-year-olds think that much greater use should be made of volunteers, while just 14% of those of pensionable age concur.\nCaroline Abrahams, the charity director of Age UK, stressed that while volunteers play a hugely important role, \u201cthey cannot and should not be asked to replace the vital work of trained care workers\u201d and could not plug the gaps in the social care workforce.\n\u201cSocial care, just like the NHS, is an essential public service providing highly skilled support to people who are often living with complex needs or coming to the end of their life.\n\u201cIt needs sustainable funding, a well-trained and committed workforce and the capacity to work closely with health, housing and other vital services.

It is sold alive, with its claws banded shut, on docks, at highway rest stops and supermarkets. Cooked, it is served everywhere from seaside shacks to the finest restaurants.\nLobster attracts tourists, feeds locals and is a lifeblood for coastal towns.\nIts importance has even swelled in recent years as lobsters have been caught in record numbers. Lobster landings \u2013 or the amount of lobster caught \u2013 have risen fivefold in the past three decades. Lobster has become a half-billion-dollar industry in Maine. And the reason for the boom, according to scientists, is climate change.\nThe Gulf of Maine is warming faster than 99% of the world\u2019s waters, rising at three times the global average. That warming has created optimal conditions for lobsters to reproduce and survive into adulthood.\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually been really positive for us. We\u2019ve seen probably the most favourable environmental conditions for lobsters ever,\u201d said Patrice McCarron, the executive director of the Maine Lobstermen\u2019s Association, which represents more than 1,000 members of the state\u2019s lobster industry. \nBut while the warming waters have resulted in a lobster bonanza, scientists say climate change will ultimately bring a bust to the boom: As the Gulf of Maine continues to warm, that temperature sweet spot for lobsters will continue to move north. That could result in a similar spike in lobsters in Canada, but leave Maine\u2019s industry broken.\nAccording to a report released earlier this year from the Gulf of Maine Research Institute (GMRI) in Portland, while the lobster population has risen over 500% along Maine\u2019s coast over the past 30 years, the population is expected to drop by between 40% and 62% by 2050.\nClimate change has already hit lobster populations in states south of Maine, seeing once-robust lobster fisheries in Massachusetts, Rhode Island \u2013 and even Connecticut, New Jersey and New York \u2013 decline.\nAndrew Pershing, chief scientific officer at GMRI, says it is tempting to think that lobster populations are migrating with temperature, but that is not the case.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more that the populations that are here can become more or less productive. So lobsters in southern New England, they just can\u2019t produce baby lobsters at the same rate our lobsters can and they have higher mortality, so fewer of them survive to reproduce,\u201d he said. \nWhile a drop of 40% to 62% would return Maine to levels of lobster landings it saw before the boom, the decades after 2050 could spell disaster.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get carbon under control and we\u2019re looking at three degrees [celsius] of warming by the end of the century, Maine starts to feel like best case Rhode Island and worst case New Jersey,\u201d said Pershing. \u201cAnd nobody is putting lobsters on license plates in New Jersey.\u201d\nClimate change is politically divisive in America, where the president has called it a hoax and said he did not believe his own government\u2019s national climate assessment, which found that climate change could greatly damage the US economy. But in places like Stonington, a tiny lobster town in southern Maine on remote, wind-lashed Deer Isle, climate change is something one can see and feel.\n\u201cWe can see the effects. We can see different species coming up in the traps,\u201d said Genevieve McDonald, a Stonington lobsterman. \u201cClimate change is real. If you work on the water you can see it. Data is real, science is real, temperature is real.\u201d\nMcDonald was early in her lobstering career when the number of lobsters soared in the waters off Stonington.\n\u201cAll of the sudden we had lobsters everywhere, places there were never lobsters before,\u201d she said. \u201cIn every nook and cranny and crevice and type of bottom there were lobsters. It was awesome.\u201d\nIt isn\u2019t just the lobsters and the foreign species showing up off Stonington\u2019s shores that make residents think of climate change. On Tuesday, storm surge saw cars and trucks navigating through seaweed and sea water on the narrow, low-lying causeway, the only road leading off Deer Isle.\nIn Stonington, lobsters are life. The town has pulled more lobster from the frigid waters than any other Maine port in recent years. Nearly everybody seems to work in the lobster industry or have a role supporting the fishermen. \n\u201cWe live in a lobstocracy,\u201d says Carla Guenther, chief scientist at the Maine Center for Coastal Fisheries in Stonington. \u201cIt\u2019s central to our politics, our social structure, everything.\u201d\nLosing the industry would be devastating. Previously, Stonington had other fisheries \u2013 such as for groundfish like cod, haddock and flounder. Ted Ames, a retired Stonington fisherman, saw all of those fisheries collapse over the decades, but when they did, fishermen always turned to something else to make a living. Today, lobsters are everything.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re stuck with one fishery, you\u2019re good until it hiccups and then you\u2019re out of business. This time around there isn\u2019t any other option,\u201d he said. \nMaine and its lobstermen have worked hard to conserve the lobster population and take pride in their efforts. The number of lobstering licenses is capped and the number of traps is restricted. Lobster licenses are only issued to owner-operators, meaning that there is no industrial lobstering. Small lobsters, big lobsters and egg-bearing females are all tossed back. Traps are equipped with a biodegradable ring that eventually disintegrates, allowing lobsters to escape and survive in case a trap is lost on the ocean\u2019s floor.\nBut despite their conservation efforts, the fate of the fishery is probably out of the hands of lobstermen.\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so much our lobstermen can do,\u201d said GMRIs Pershing. \u201cIf the rest of the world doesn\u2019t get a handle on carbon, the coast of Maine is going to look really different in 2080.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/maine", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "When lobsters are life, environmental change affects livelihoods, and warming waters will ultimately bust the lobster industry", "date_published": {"$date": 1544266843000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544287375000}, "authors": ["Josh Wood"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "Maine", "US news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/08/we-live-in-a-lobstocracy-maine-feeling-effects-of-climate-change-lobster-fishing", "og:description": "When lobsters are life, environmental change affects livelihoods, and warming waters will ultimately bust the lobster industry", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e49e6a93127486c54776d35a78c6ec5bdf805c40/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=f66d9eefb98fbd5e30035381c5d4c152", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "'We live in a lobstocracy': Maine town is feeling the effects of climate change"}, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e49e6a93127486c54776d35a78c6ec5bdf805c40/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=16ab3b13b065b23d31bc9b8f21dbdc9d", "width": "3000", "height": "1800", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e49e6a93127486c54776d35a78c6ec5bdf805c40/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=af613297efe3571dd7a36b0aa93d3d2e", "description": "Illustration: Joey Yu/Joey Yu for Guardian US"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3804d8fc32865b684b091a1bd9d41c3c83a23ad7/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=613de54f731e2b5b20679999f19c3295", "width": "3000", "height": "1800", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3804d8fc32865b684b091a1bd9d41c3c83a23ad7/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f4428724e2cc93625b4b6cf6ea9fbd9d"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07948a2c3613145ed8c81"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/09/australias-rainforest-under-threat-as-bushfires-rage-in-the-tropics", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "When Michelle Ready first moved to the cane farm she owns with her husband in Queensland nine years ago, it sounded like a jungle at night. \u201cIt was lush and green and wet,\u201d she says.\nA week after a \u201cfrightening\u201d fire ripped across their property in Finch Hatton, a small township in the subtropical region of Mackay, better known for its humid, rain-drenched summers, it\u2019s obvious that things have changed.\n\u201cIt has been unbelievably dry here \u2026 the last few years we\u2019re just not getting the rain and then, when we do, it\u2019s often associated with a cyclone.\u201d\nThis year, early summer heat broke all-time records for Queensland. In Cairns, the tropical port city in the state\u2019s far north, 1,600km (1,000 miles) north of Brisbane, the previous highest temperature in November was 37.2C, set in 1900. On Monday 26 November, the mercury hit 42.6C.\nBushfires are common in Australia but they mostly flare in the south-eastern states of New South Wales and Victoria, where summers can be hot and dry.\nBut Queensland, much of which is located in the tropics, joins other parts of the globe, such as California and Greece, where unusually hot and dry conditions have fuelled catastrophic fires which are forcing a rethink of what such regions can expect in the future.\nBut climate change is not only bringing searing heat. Two cyclones in as many years, including the destructive tropical cyclone Debbie in 2017, have left the region\u2019s tropical rainforest exposed and unable to act as a natural firebreak.\nTypically, rainforest should be able to self-protect during fire, with closed canopies that allow little sunlight to the forest floor and that keep the vegetation moist. But the cyclones have shredded the canopies, leaving an excess of fuel from debris on the ground, and a lack of rain meant the forest was dry.\nSince 22 November, more than 1m hectares has been burnt across Queensland, much of which lies in the tropics. Since the beginning of its bushfire season in August, more than 3.6m hectares have been destroyed.\nThe most recent fires occurred on a magnitude never before seen in the state. Over a period of 12 days, the Queensland fire and emergency service said it had attended more than 1,200 fires, with help from crews from every state and territory in Australia.\nAndrew Piccone, a nature campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation, who did his studies in rainforest ecology, said that Australia would have to consider the future impact of warming conditions on a range of plant, animal and insect species in the wet tropics.\n\u201cIf catastrophic fire conditions are going to burn the rainforest in Queensland, what that means for the future of the wet tropics world heritage area could be quite concerning,\u201d he said.\nOn the day the fires took off, Michelle Ready said there was a feeling in the air of \u201ceverything crisping up\u201d.\nFor weeks, small fires had been burning in bushland around the property. She and her husband, Viv Dodt, had prepared by building fire breaks around the home. They were ready when the heatwave hit, taking temperatures to the mid-40sC and bringing with it high winds and low humidity of the kind rarely seen in an area known for its lush forests.\n\u201cThe only heat that\u2019s come anywhere near it that I\u2019ve experienced was in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt,\u201d Ready said. \u201cThe winds \u2013 it felt like opening a fan-forced oven. It was frightening.\u201d\nThe property became surrounded to the south, west and north. Ready watched from the verandah as a fire took off down the mountain, followed by another.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d she said.\nTheir early work fire-proofing saved the house. But eucalypt bushland at the back of the farm was lost and macadamias they had been experimenting with in pots before investing in farming them burnt and split from the heat.\nThe fires took in a region known as the Clarke Connors range and localities including Finch Hatton, Dalrymple Heights and Eungella, a township noted for the national park and subtropical rainforest that surrounds it.\nAndy Houley is the rural fire inspector in Mackay and has been fighting fires for decades. He compared the fires to some of Queensland\u2019s worst fire seasons in 1994 and 1972.\n\u201cAreas we traditionally rely on to stop fires progressing from one valley to another were not reliable,\u201d he said.\nHe said 121,000ha around Eungella and Finch Hatton had been lost, including parts of the rainforest as well as dry bushland.\nParks and wildlife service workers will spend coming weeks doing detailed assessments to work out the precise level of damage.\nFortunately, popular tourist areas for local and overseas visitors, including the platypus viewing point in Eungella, appear to have remained relatively untouched.\nHouley said rural communities were resilient, but as cyclones increased and weather got hotter and drier, they needed to look more closely at how to adapt to fire danger.\n\u201cWe can do more planned burning to block areas from fire earlier in the year. We\u2019ve got to focus on that now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t change the cyclones but we can certainly adapt.\u201d\nPhilip Stewart, a fire ecologist with Queensland University\u2019s school of earth and environmental sciences, agrees. He said governments and communities would need to become more proactive in fighting fires and that current processes were too reactive.\n\u201cWe do need to look at firefighting in a different light,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cWe are a fire-prone country and more people are moving into fire-prone areas. We need to have an understanding of the danger of that and look at fighting fire with fire.\u201d\nHe pointed to traditional burning used by Indigenous communities as a model, where prescribed burning occurs on a larger scale than hazard-reduction burns, which focus on reducing fuel in specific areas.\nStewart said areas of rainforest impacted could take decades or even centuries to recover, adding that the next possible threat to those areas was mudslides as the wet season sets in.\n\u201cHigh-intensity fire tends to create a layer within the soil that is hydrophobic and therefore water repellent causing mass soil erosion,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe are seeing this very phenomenon in the USA at Malibu where mass soil movement has taken place due to the heavy rains that followed the high-intensity and severe fires there.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "As the weather gets hotter and drier, and cyclones increase, those living in Australia\u2019s north will need to adapt to the fire danger", "date_published": {"$date": 1544363632000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544380802000}, "authors": ["Lisa Cox"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Bushfires", "Climate change", "Environment", "Queensland", "Australia news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/09/australias-rainforest-under-threat-as-bushfires-rage-in-the-tropics", "og:description": "As the weather gets hotter and drier, and cyclones increase, those living in Australia\u2019s north will need to adapt to the fire danger", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a60f73ba6702048e032f5701e7600e49041f2e9c/0_93_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=fe2a90b422d6ca0a137d054965294822", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "'Like opening a fan oven': Australia's rainforest threatened by bushfires"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a60f73ba6702048e032f5701e7600e49041f2e9c/0_93_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fb1514d9603b7b61075dbbf681d173fa", "width": "2835", "height": "1701", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a60f73ba6702048e032f5701e7600e49041f2e9c/0_93_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=af1f974892c8f6accd55fb8024cde07b", "description": "Unusually hot and dry conditions in Queensland have fuelled \u2018frightening\u2019 fires that are forcing a rethink of what the region can expect in the future.\nPhotograph: Rob Griffith/AFP/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc0794fa2c3613145ed8c85"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/09/act-now-to-prevent-an-environmental-catastrophe", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "In our complex, interdependent global ecosystem, life is dying, with species extinction accelerating.

This desperate situation can\u2019t continue.\nPolitical leaders worldwide are failing to address the environmental crisis. If global corporate capitalism continues to drive the international economy, global catastrophe is inevitable.\nComplacency and inaction in Britain, the US, Australia, Brazil, across Africa and Asia \u2013 all illustrate diverse manifestations of political paralysis, abdicating humankind\u2019s grave responsibility for planetary stewardship.\nInternational political organisations and national governments must foreground the climate-emergency issue immediately, urgently drawing up comprehensive policies to address it. Conventionally privileged nations must voluntarily fund comprehensive environment-protection policies in impoverished nations, to compensate the latter for foregoing unsustainable economic growth, and paying recompense for the planet-plundering imperialism of materially privileged nations.\nWith extreme weather already hitting food production, we demand that governments act now to avoid any risk of hunger, with emergency investment in agro-ecological extreme-weather-resistant food production. We also call for an urgent summit on saving the Arctic icecap, to slow weather disruption of our harvests.\nWe further call on concerned global citizens to rise up and organise against current complacency in their particular contexts, including indigenous people\u2019s rights advocacy, decolonisation and reparatory justice \u2013 so joining the global movement that\u2019s now rebelling against extinction (eg Extinction Rebellion in the UK).\nWe must collectively do whatever\u2019s necessary non-violently, to persuade politicians and business leaders to relinquish their complacency and denial.

His nameplate bore a US flag.\n\u201cActions speak loudly,\u201d he said, \u201cand as we\u2019ve been hearing, the United States has been a powerhouse \u2026 in different approaches to energy security while seeking emissions reductions.\n\u201cAustralia has a technology-neutral approach to emissions reduction. It\u2019s important that we do so, we need to pull every lever to reduce emissions. We need to be open to innovation and new technologies providing multiple pathways for energy security and emissions reductions.\u201d\nSuckling said Australia would continue to invest in low-emissions innovations, including doubling its innovation investment by 2020. But he said carbon capture and storage \u2013 \u201ca proven technology\u201d \u2013 was important in any model for emissions reduction, and that the technology had broad applications across industries.\nBut Simon Bradshaw, Oxfam Australia\u2019s climate change policy adviser, said it was \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d to see Australia line up behind the US in pushing a pro-coal ideas.\n\u201cIt is a slap in the face of our Pacific island neighbours, for whom bringing an end to the fossil fuel era is matter of survival, and who are working with determination to catalyse stronger international efforts to confront the climate crisis. And it is firmly against the wishes of an overwhelming majority of Australians.\u201d\nBradshaw said continuing to use coal was not only uneconomic, but would \u201cbe measured in more lives lost, entrenched poverty, rising global hunger, and more people displaced from their land and homes\u201d.\nHe said the advice of the IPCC showed emphatically there was no space for new coal and that Australia\u2019s position on coal was isolating it from the rest of the world.\nThe Climate Vulnerable Forum, a group of 48 countries most acutely affected by climate change, has committed to achieving 100% renewable energy production by the middle of the century at the latest. Other developed countries, including the UK, France, Canada and New Zealand, have committed to phasing out coal power by 2030.\nWells Griffith, a Trump administration adviser speaking alongside Suckling on the panel, said the US would continue extracting fossil fuels, and warned against \u201calarmism\u201d about climate change.\n\u201cWe strongly believe that no country should have to sacrifice their economic prosperity or energy security in pursuit of environmental sustainability,\u201d he said.\nBut the panel\u2019s premise \u2013 that fossil fuels can be made \u201cclean\u201d through innovation \u2013 stands at odds with the recommendations of climate scientists who argue that countries should transition to renewable energy sources as soon as possible or risk catastrophic levels of global warming by the end of the century.\nAlso at the UN climate talks in Poland, two new reports have cast Australia as a global laggard on addressing climate change.\nThe Climate Change Performance Index, compiled by the Climate Action Network, ranked Australia 55 out of 60 countries for its actions on climate change. The index ranks countries according to their climate policies, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.\nSweden and Morocco are the leading countries on the list, though no nation is clearly on a below-2 degrees pathway. India, ranked 11, and China, ranked 33, both improved their rankings significantly, having significantly increased their use of renewable energy. The US and Saudi Arabia are 59th and 60th respectively on the list.\n\u201cAustralia is at the bottom of the class when it comes to climate policy performance,\u201d said Richie Merzian, climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute. \u201cAfter four years of rising emissions, and a relative absence of climate policy, it is no surprise.\u201d\nMerzian said the government was \u201copenly and unapologetically defending the coal industry\u201d despite overwhelming scientific consensus that rapid decarbonisation needed to occur worldwide.\nSeparately, the Climate Action Tracker has updated its assessment of Australia\u2019s efforts, saying the country\u2019s \u201cclimate policy has further deteriorated in the past year, as it focuses on propping up the coal industry and ditches efforts to reduce emissions\u201d.\n\u201cThe Australian government has turned its back on global climate action by dismissing the findings of the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C and announcing it would no longer provide funds to the Green Climate Fund,\u201d the assessment said.\nEmissions from fossil fuels and industry have been increasing by about 2% a year since 2014 in Australia. The assessment argues that Australia\u2019s Paris agreement target was \u201cinsufficient\u201d but Australia still won\u2019t meet it.\n\u201cWhile the federal government continues to repeatedly state that Australia is on track to meet its 2030 target \u201cin a canter\u201d the Climate Action Tracker is not aware of any scientific basis, published by any analyst or government agency, to support this. \u201d\nAssociated Press contributed to this report\n", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Country\u2019s stance described as \u2018a slap in the face of our Pacific island neighbours\u2019", "date_published": {"$date": 1544479705000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544515676000}, "authors": ["Ben Doherty"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Global climate talks", "Fossil fuels", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Australia news", "United Nations", "Climate change", "US news", "Environment", "Energy", "Coal", "Poland", "Activism"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/11/australia-only-nation-to-join-us-at-pro-coal-event-at-cop24-climate-talks", "og:description": "Country\u2019s stance described as \u2018a slap in the face of our Pacific island neighbours\u2019", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be4342a9e33383e91bb9ebb6e4afa3b145c95081/0_137_4112_2468/master/4112.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=5803e0076e0b2731bc2b816b4e0cf0bb", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Australia only nation to join US at pro-coal event at COP24 climate talks"}, "headline": "O", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be4342a9e33383e91bb9ebb6e4afa3b145c95081/0_137_4112_2468/master/4112.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3cf8ae8c55a99426a8330e71a479caa8", "width": "4112", "height": "2468", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be4342a9e33383e91bb9ebb6e4afa3b145c95081/0_137_4112_2468/master/4112.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4e7b7f29f41c6d99229242626137a8df", "description": "Patrick Suckling (sitting on panel right), Australia\u2019s ambassador for the environment, waits as protesters disrupt an event at the COP24 climate change summit in Katowice, Poland.\nPhotograph: \u0141ukasz Kalinowski/Rex/Shutterstock"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07954a2c3613145ed8c89"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/11/climate-change-politicians-un-summit", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Two great dramas are unfolding. One concerns the future trading status of a small, rich country, and is marked by febrile debate, political histrionics and inflated egos. The other sees the rest of the world trying to control climate change.\nThe differences between the two shows could not be starker. The UN summit in Katowice, Poland, is a challenge for civilisation, for the benefit of the common good, an existential thriller for 7.5 billion people and all of nature which is being played out in relative calm. In contrast, in Westminster we are witnessing the culmination of a long-running political schism that is of much less consequence to the planet.\nMajor studies have in the past few weeks made it clearer than ever that we are facing, in David Attenborough\u2019s words at the opening of the summit last week, \u201ca manmade disaster of global scale \u2026 our greatest threat in thousands of years\u201d.\nFirst came a UN climate change special report, which showed how we may have only 12 or so years left for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which the risks of floods, drought and extreme heat will increase, and food shortages and poverty are likely for hundreds of millions of people. Then came a Global Carbon Budget study, which showed that, at current trends, the world is heading towards a catastrophic 3C of warming by 2100.\nAn unseen revolution is taking place: from denial and inaction just two decades ago, countries now dare to think big\nTo add gloom to the pessimism, some of the world\u2019s biggest investors issued a stark warning to governments at the Katowice summit that failure to act urgently would result in financial catastrophe. And the UN\u2019s World Meteorological Organization has provisionally confirmed that the past four years have been the hottest on record, and that extreme weather caused by manmade climate change now affects all continents.\nTaken together, these reports show conclusively that we are on the edge of climate breakdown, and that governments are failing to prevent it. Factor in the dramatic but linked decline in biodiversity, and the potential for collapsed ecosystems and mass extinctions, and we can see we are at an existential crossroads, heading inexorably towards a fatally denuded Earth.\nSome leaders, such as the US president, Donald Trump, and the incoming president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, say in wilful ignorance that all this science is wrong and that nothing needs to change \u2013 indeed forests must be felled and fossil fuels be further subsidised and promoted as \u201cclean coal\u201d. Others, such as the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, do not deny the science but coldly calculate how much they would lose and try to water down commitments.\nIn the middle at Katowice are the 10,000 government negotiators and NGOs trying to make rich countries reduce emissions and help poor countries adapt to inevitable climate change. But these UN climate talks depend on the consensus of all countries, so the progress appears incremental, even glacial. And because they do not involve adversarial politicians, they are considered unimportant by most of the world\u2019s media.\nBeyond Katowice, though, are many millions of people who expect their leaders to act in the interests of all, and who are increasingly dismayed that the global economic system threatens everyone\u2019s future. We are now in a race against time to address climate change. We have started late, the signs are not good, and the gap between high-level rhetoric and action to reduce emissions is widening. Fury is now building against governments, with the Extinction Rebellion climate protest group taking non-violent direct action, which has spread to 35 countries in just a few weeks.\nThere are, however, lots of reasons to believe we can meet the challenge. This year, Trump\u2019s decision to pull the world\u2019s second-biggest carbon emitter out of the Paris agreement to cut emissions has backfired. Not only did US emissions fall in 2018, many US states, cities and businesses said they intended to fulfil their Paris obligations.\nThe transition to a less carbon-intensive energy system is also gathering pace. The share of renewables in meeting global energy demand is expected to grow by at least one-fifth in the next five years . By 2020 it should be cheaper to build new renewable energy plants in most countries than to keep coal or fossil fuels burning. Countries can already save money by retiring coal plants and substituting wind and solar. Soon only subsidies worth around \u00a35tn a year will keep coal alive in many countries. Even more optimistically, the world\u2019s largest developing countries are now in the forefront of the transition to lower emissions. India and China, with nearly a third of the world\u2019s people, are at the forefront of the next solar revolution and, like Europe, are firmly on the path to decarbonisation.\nAn unseen revolution is taking place in the way we power the world. From denial and inaction just two decades ago, countries now dare to think big. China is to build a giant solar park in the Gobi desert big enough to power 1 million homes; a single project in India will be even larger, covering 10,000 acres of Rajasthan, and one in the desert near Aswan in Egypt should deliver as much power as two nuclear power stations.\nThe world is full now of major initiatives. Spurred by the commitments made at the Paris climate meeting in 2015, many countries, for example, are furiously planting trees; carbon capture and storage to take the emissions of fossil fuels is becoming a reality; millions of rice farmers have adopted the system of rice intensification which halves the water needed and reduces methane emissions from rice cultivation by up to 50%. These and many others are, so far, only incremental initiatives, coming far too slowly to even brake the warming. These are the seeds of change, lifting ambition, inspiring hope and showing the potential for change on a planetary scale. They also help politicians and bankers understand that getting to net zero emissions in just 40 years is technically and financially possible, and the best investment any country can ever make.\nBy the end of the week, Britain may have weathered another political storm and people may be able to see a little clearer what is happening.

That hints at underlying ocean influences that have been incredibly strong in West Antarctica. Now we might be finding clear links of the ocean starting to influence East Antarctica.\u201d\nIce in West Antarctica is already in serious retreat, with scientists reporting a threefold acceleration in recent years, meaning it is vanishing faster than at any previously recorded time.\nIn April, researchers found that hidden melting beneath the ocean surface was also increasing, putting Antarctica on track to overtake Greenland as the biggest contributor to sea-level rise.\nWithout big cuts in carbon emissions, the melting will continue for thousands of years.\nCatherine Walker, at Nasa\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Centre, in Maryland, used ocean temperature measurements from seals who had been tagged with sensors, as well as computer modelling, to show that the heat delivered to the glaciers in Wilkes Land and Vincennes Bay had increased. Changes in winds and the extent of sea ice are thought to have altered currents.\nEast Antarctica is extremely remote and relatively little studied. What happens to the glaciers will depend on how exposed to warmer water they are, and that depends on the shape of the land beneath them and the sea bed ahead of them.\n\u201cHeightened attention needs to be given to these glaciers,\u201d said Gardner. \u201cWe need to better map the topography and the bathymetry. Only then can we be more conclusive in determining whether these glaciers will enter a phase of rapid retreat or stabilise.\u201d\nThe discovery could mean much higher sea level rises than anticipated, said Chris Fogwill, a professor at Keele University in England, who was not part of the Nasa research.\n\u201cThe finding has very serious repercussions for climate change and particularly sea-level rise. It has the potential to mean that our sea-level projections could be [in] an order of magnitude higher than we\u2019re anticipating.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/glaciers", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/poles", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/sea-level", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oceans", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Nasa detects ice retreat probably linked to ocean changes in region once thought stable", "date_published": {"$date": 1544542972000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544547525000}, "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "article_section": "World news", "article_tags": ["Antarctica", "Glaciers", "Polar regions", "Sea level", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Oceans", "Science", "Environment", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/11/east-antarctica-glacial-stronghold-melting-amid-climate-change", "og:description": "Nasa detects ice retreat probably linked to ocean changes in region once thought stable", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b33a3669eea1acaa23b94b18d77446453af87d7a/0_0_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=a564e80ef11b0bc20d291c1bb8cc2ea9", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "East Antarctica glacial stronghold melting as seas warm"}, "headline": "m", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b33a3669eea1acaa23b94b18d77446453af87d7a/0_0_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=faa88aa01980c131cef6239034cd5c69", "width": "1024", "height": "614", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b33a3669eea1acaa23b94b18d77446453af87d7a/0_0_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=811d0ade8d8265145dbb894543a7a41c", "description": "The Totten glacier, East Antarctica.\nPhotograph: Esmee van Wijk/Australian Antarctic Division"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07966a2c3613145ed8c92"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/12/as-climate-change-bites-in-americas-midwest-farmers-are-desperate-to-ring-the-alarm", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Richard Oswald did not need the latest US government report on the creeping toll of climate change to tell him that farming in the midwest is facing a grim future, and very likely changing forever.\nFor Oswald, the moment of realisation came in 2011.\nThe 68-year-old lives in the house he was born in and farms 2,500 acres with his son, some of it settled by his great-great-grandfather. The land sits where the Missouri river valley is about four miles wide.\nGrowing up, Oswald heard tales of a great flood in 1952 which prompted the army to construct levees.\n\u201cThe next flood wasn\u2019t for another 40 years, in 1993. Heavy rains day after day after day after day until the runoff water and the rain just overpowered the river and the levees,\u201d said Oswald. \u201cBoth the \u201952 and \u201993 floods lasted three weeks. They were abnormal.\u201d\nThen came the big Missouri river flood in 2011.\n\u201cHeavy rains and heavy snow in the Dakotas and Montana created a huge amount of water. That flood lasted here almost four months. More rain than anybody really ever has any memory of coming down the river,\u201d he said.\nOswald\u2019s farm was underwater for much of that time and the corn lost. Missouri declared a state of emergency. Crops were ruined or never planted. Grain prices surged.\nThe flooding was memorable in its own right but Oswald also sees it as marking a shift in weather patterns which has forced him to farm differently.\n\u201cWhen I was a kid, my dad would say an inch of rain was a good rain. That\u2019s just what we needed. Now we get four inches, five inches, six inches in one sustained wet spell that lasts two or three days. I don\u2019t ever remember that as a boy. I\u2019ve never seen the sustained wetness in the land that we have now. Even though the river hasn\u2019t gone on the land it\u2019s raised the water table so that the rains that we\u2019ve had this fall, which have been unusually heavy, make it muddy. Continually muddy,\u201d he said.\nOn 23 November, the National Climate Assessment warned of \u201csubstantial damages\u201d across the US in the coming years from increasing wildfires in the west to flooding in the east. But the sharpest rise in temperatures will be between the coasts as the midwest endures longer and hotter summers, heavier rains and droughts that collectively are predicted to significantly reduce US agricultural production.\n\u201cExpected increases in challenges to livestock health, declines in crop yields and quality, and changes in extreme events in the United States and abroad threaten rural livelihoods, sustainable food security, and price stability,\u201d said the 1,600-page report, the work of 13 federal agencies.\nClimate change is likely to make it harder to grow crops, and to make those that do grow more vulnerable to diseases and pests because of rising humidity. The report said heat and diminishing air quality will take its toll on livestock. Farmers will collectively have to spend billions of dollars to adapt. The effects are already seen from prolonged drought in Kansas and torrential rains in Iowa.\nBefore the flood in 2011, Oswald, a Missouri river valley crop farmer, was skeptical about the warnings that rising temperatures heralded a more difficult future. Since then, the routines of planting and harvesting that his family has pursued on the same land for five generations have given way to a haphazard cycle governed by waves of extreme heat and intense rains.\n\u201cThe changes have become more radical. The way the rains come down and the temperatures. You\u2019re constantly trying to manage it,\u201d said Oswald, a former president of the Missouri Farmers Union. \u201cThere\u2019s so much unknown about the weather now that it\u2019s pretty hard to do much about it.\u201d\nAs his son, Brandon, works a combine harvester up and down a field, Oswald kicks the soil with his foot.\n\u201cIf you look at this, it\u2019s pretty dry right on top but not too far down it\u2019s mud. Two weeks ago there was water standing here from all the rain and the inability of the soil to absorb that much moisture because the level of the river was such that the water level was pretty close to the top of the ground here,\u201d he said.\nThat mud makes it difficult to plant and to harvest. The rains narrow the number of days when Oswald can get a crop in the ground. If it forces him to delay planting the corn, that means the soybeans will go in late. Worst of all, Oswald said, is that it is all so unpredictable. Where planting was typically spread over the same few days in spring and summer every year, now it can vary by weeks.\nGene Takle, one of the authors of the climate change report and director of the climate science programme at Iowa State University, traces the sharply increased rainfalls to rising temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico. He said that for centuries, the gulf\u2019s waters have been carried as moisture into the midwest and delivered consistent rainfalls that made the region America\u2019s breadbasket.\nBut as temperatures have risen so has the amount of moisture in a dome of vapour over the Gulf of Mexico. Takle said that at the same time climate change has moved a pressure centre in the Atlantic, known as the Bermuda high, westwards and closer to a band of low pressure over the Rocky mountains creating higher windspeeds across parts of the midwest. That, in turn, has intensified the flow of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe result is heavier rains dumping huge amounts of water on to fields, alongside rising temperatures.\n\u201cHumidity is the the key, the smoking gun, for the increase in our rainfall,\u201d said Takle, a professor of agronomy and of geological and atmospheric sciences.\nTakle said that heavy rains in 2013 forced farmers in north-western Iowa to abandon planting altogether on more than 700,000 acres, more than 10% of the state\u2019s land. That came a year after Iowa was hit by widespread drought that also hit the crop harvest.\nSome farmers are installing drainage systems to cope with the higher rainfalls, a sign that they know climate change is here to stay. Others are buying expensive new equipment that allows them to plant more seeds in the narrowing windows between rains.\nTakle, who grew up on a farm and whose brother still farms in Iowa, said the intense rains have a long-term impact, too. Scientists calculate that dry soil is unable to absorb the water from a rainfall of more than about 1.25in over 24 hours. After that the water starts to erode the soil.\n\u201cYou start to get excess water moving down slope surfaces and carrying with it any nutrients and nitrogen and phosphates or soil particles,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting more of the soil erosion promoting rainfalls. Farmers are using cover crops in the spring period to have some some residual vegetation on the surface to protect it from these extreme events.\u201d\nStanding amid his soybeans, Oswald nods north toward the hills on the edge of the valley.\n\u201cWe farm some upland fields up over that hill a couple of miles,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re rolling hills and they\u2019re terraced. They have structures on them to help control the runoff of the water. But when you have those big rains, none of the terraces or the dams can keep up with that as well as they should. So you have more erosion.\u201d\nThe size of harvests is already falling. This year, heavy rains have hit soya bean crops, delaying planting or washing out the plants in parts of the midwest, including Iowa.\nAlongside the rains are increasing temperatures.\n\u201cThis year we saw 100-degree temperatures in May which is very unusual,\u201d said Oswald. \u201cI don\u2019t ever remember that in my lifetime or even heard about it. That\u2019s a first ever.\u201d\nThe Missouri Climate Center recorded that temperatures were above average throughout the spring and summer this year, with September on average 3F warmer than during the 20th century\nIn the short term, higher temperatures have had some benefit because in parts of the region they extended the growing season and contributed to bigger harvests.\n\u201cIn the midwest we have about nine days more now than we did 50 years ago,\u201d said Takle. \u201cPart of the increase in yields that we\u2019ve been experiencing over the last 20 or 30 years definitely has been due to the earlier planting and the longer growing season.\u201d\nBut Takle said those benefits are being lost, and will be reversed in the coming years, as rising temperatures combine with the heavy rains to make growing ever more difficult. He said corn is vulnerable to high temperatures during pollination.\nA decade ago, Oswald was on the fence about climate change.\n\u201cAt a certain point you just have to look at what\u2019s going on in your own world and try to decide what you think the impacts of that are,\u201d he said.\nAs Oswald\u2019s thinking changed, so did his determination to persuade others of the reality of climate change. As president of the Missouri Farmers union, he had some success in getting a discussion going among its members. But he said climate change is politically charged among farmers in part because some see it as a stick to beat them over their practices.\n\u201cOne of the problems farmers have is when we start talking about environment, a lot of times Sierra Club comes to mind and Sierra Club is pretty radical in their approach. When you have a group that says cows are the problem, you need to get rid of all the cows, and raising corn is a problem, we need to get rid of all the corn, then you\u2019re not going to have a lot of farmers who want to join in and follow you,\u201d he said.\nStill, Oswald believes that denial is in retreat. Where farmers, including him, were once skeptical they now see the change with their own eyes. The problem is what to do about it.\n\u201cA lot of them will say there\u2019s nothing we can do about it so we might as well not worry because we can\u2019t have an impact, we just have to live with it,\u201d he said.\nBut he said as climate change bites, farmers are increasingly accepting of the science as they are forced to spend more money on equipment and seeds to maintain current crop yields.\n\u201cIt\u2019s become almost an annual assault on their ability to produce good crops. So they are now starting to ask questions and I think are listening a little more to what the scientists are saying about the potential future.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-weather", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/agriculture", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "\u2018The changes have become more radical\u2019: farmers are spending more time and money trying to grow crops in new climates", "date_published": {"$date": 1544612419000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544644885000}, "authors": ["Chris McGreal"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "US weather", "Agriculture", "US news", "Missouri"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/12/as-climate-change-bites-in-americas-midwest-farmers-are-desperate-to-ring-the-alarm", "og:description": "\u2018The changes have become more radical\u2019: farmers are spending more time and money trying to grow crops in new climates", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/722b8ab2d5f9e3d1abfeab988ebf74e0faf3f354/0_484_2527_1515/master/2527.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=715926ce57c088a9209de0895e21991e", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "As climate change bites in America\u2019s midwest, farmers are desperate to ring the alarm"}, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/722b8ab2d5f9e3d1abfeab988ebf74e0faf3f354/32_581_2402_1440/master/2402.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9a618db68ec519bacb764cd66614b0a9", "width": "2402", "height": "1440", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/722b8ab2d5f9e3d1abfeab988ebf74e0faf3f354/32_581_2402_1440/master/2402.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9529e590da33f1fbb58d5f00b7be590a", "description": "Richard Oswald stands in a frozen puddle surrounded by unharvested corn.

Australia is outside that bloc now.\nOn Wednesday, 27 countries and the EU in the High Ambition Coalition called for significantly increased targets for carbon emissions reductions by 2030, in response to a dramatic 1.5C warming report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that has dominated negotiations in Poland this week.\n\u201cWe call on other governments \u2026 to join us in striving to step up ambition by 2020 in response to the special report on 1.5C,\u201d it said.\nThe environment minister, Melissa Price, gave Australia\u2019s formal address to the UN climate talks on Wednesday, saying Australia would \u201cmeet and beat\u201d its 2020 Kyoto protocol target and was on track to achieve its Paris goal.\n\u201cWe are confident that we will meet our 2030 target, which represents a halving of emissions per person,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAround the world, countries are laying the foundation for a low-emissions global economy \u2013 Australia is no different. We have policies to align strong economic growth with emissions reduction. We are moving towards a new energy future, while ensuring energy remains affordable and reliable.\u201d\nBut Price\u2019s speech was silent on commitments beyond Australia\u2019s current 26% to 28% Paris pledge for 2030, despite significant pressure from its former coalition partners to lift its target. The Paris agreement was struck with a commitment built in that countries would regularly review and increase their targets.\nHer speech did not mention the government\u2019s nascent policy to underwrite power generation with taxpayer money, including of new and existing coal plants.\nAlso absent was mention of the IPCC\u2019s 1.5C warming report, recognition of which has become the rallying cry for countries urging greater carbon cuts.\nThe Paris agreement targets, if met, put the world on a 1.5 to 2C warming path, but the 1.5C report warned that the upper end of that range would significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people.\nThe UN climate talks in Katowice, Poland, have hit a significant impasse, with fierce disagreement over the text for a global \u201crulebook\u201d to implement the 2015 Paris agreement.\nProgress has been slow on several key issues, and divisions have emerged between four fossil fuel powers \u2013 the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait \u2013 and the rest of the world. Australia is seen as closely allied to the US, having appeared at a US-government pro-fossil fuel event this week.\nThe UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, flew back to the talks in Katowice on Wednesday, telling delegates: \u201cWe are running out of time. To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal.\u201d\nPrice, who has kept a low profile during the conference, told delegates the Paris agreement was demonstration of how the international community could work together to address climate change.\n\u201cAustralia believes that effective international action requires a clear understanding of what countries are committing to, and whether those commitments can be met,\u201d she said. \u201cParis is premised on parties working together, collectively and transparently \u2026\n\u201cAustralia calls on all parties to work together to secure a comprehensive, robust, rulebook. Common rules, will lead to action to achieve our shared goals.\u201d\nPrice said Australia\u2019s natural resources would provide \u201cthe low-emissions fuels of the future\u201d.\n\u201cOur liquefied natural gas exports could save importing countries around 130m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year.\u201d\nPrice did not comment on whether Australia would use carryover carbon credits from the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods to meet its Paris targets, but it appears almost certain to use the controversial practice.\nUsing carryover credits \u2013 which would allow Australia to claim surplus carbon credits banked during the Kyoto period, largely through land use changes \u2013 has been derided as \u201cfake action\u201d by climate analysts, and criticised by countries such as New Zealand.\nAustralia\u2019s address to the climate talks was criticised by observers and analysts in Katowice.\nThe Australia Institute\u2019s climate and energy program director, Richie Merzian, said the only things Australia had brought to the UN climate talks were rising emissions and fossil fuel exports.\n\u201cTo demonstrate Australia\u2019s climate credentials, minister Price\u2019s speech relied almost entirely on policies her government tried to kill off or water down,\u201d Merzian said.\n\u201cIt was rich of minister Price to rehash [former prime minister Malcolm] Turnbull\u2019s $1bn climate finance pledge, after prime minister Morrison trashed and cut support for UN\u2019s key climate finance body, the Green Climate Fund.\u201d\nSimon Bradshaw, Oxfam Australia\u2019s climate change policy adviser, said Australia\u2019s statement would undermine the Pacific\u2019s confidence that it was serious about addressing climate change.\n\u201cAustralia cannot hide the fact that our emissions are rising and that our addiction to coal is undermining our region\u2019s future,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn September, Australia joined other members of the Pacific Islands Forum in reaffirming that climate change is the single biggest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific.

A very tight timeframe is also proposed, with proponents having to put their hands up by January 23.\nThe environmental groups have told the banks the evidence is in on climate change, and an urgent response is required to combat the risks.\nThe groups have told the banking chiefs they risk providing finance for stranded assets if they finance new coal projects. \u201cWe strongly believe that the provision of finance from your financial institution for any new coal generation project or any retrofit to extend the life of an existing coal generator, would be inconsistent with your public position on climate change, counter to the concerns of your customers, and unmindful of the high risk of any new coal investment resulting in a stranded asset.\u201d\nThe Investor Group on Climate Change \u2013 an organisation representing more than 70 Australian and New Zealand institutional investors with more than $2 trillion of funds under management \u2013 has raised similar concerns with Taylor.\nThe IGCC has told the energy minister subsidising high-emission electricity generation is inconsistent with the objectives of the Paris agreement and exposes the assets to substantive carbon price and transition risks.\n\u201cFor around a decade, investors and banks have been expressing no appetite for exposure to new coal fired generation assets in Australia and investors are unlikely to provide any capital towards new high emission generation assets moving forward,\u201d the IGCC\u2019s letter to Taylor says.\n\u201cInstitutional investors would strongly oppose any policy that indemnifies new generation from current and future carbon risk\u201d.\nThe IGCC also advises the government not to set itself up as the \u201ccentral planner of generator investment\u201d. It says if the government pursues policies that \u201ceffectively nationalise part of the electricity market at short notice\u201d there will be significant impacts on investor confidence and market efficacy.\nWhile progressive groups have moved into overdrive at confirmation that coal is in the mix, the lobby group representing Australia\u2019s resources giants has welcomed the government\u2019s move.\nTania Constable, the chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia, said on Thursday the immediate focus of the underwriting program should be ensuring that investors are able to replace Liddell power station\u2019s capacity \u201cwith a technology mix that will maintain reliability and security at the lowest sustainable cost\u201d.\nGovernment conservatives are focused on Liddell, and have wanted Taylor to use his much vaunted \u201cbig stick\u201d divestiture powers to extract the ageing power plant from AGL, its current owner. AGL plans to retire the plant and replace it with a mix of gas and renewables.\nBut the \u201cbig stick\u201d legislation cannot be passed before budget week next year, and it appears to lack the necessary support to clear the Senate.\nLabor and the Greens are opposed to any taxpayer support for coal projects, and will continue efforts once parliament resumes next year to try to frustrate the Coalition\u2019s program, potentially by attempting to amend the divestiture bill, which stalled in the final sitting week, to include a prohibition on power companies receiving commonwealth support.\nThe MCA said any contracts agreed under the underwriting program needed to be honoured by a future government.\nThe government\u2019s policy document suggests phase one of the underwriting program is anticipated to commence in the first quarter of 2019 \u2013 which puts some of the decision making pre-election in the event the government goes to the polls in April.\nLabor has attempted to warn market participants it does not support taxpayer support for coal projects, but has a policy at the federal level of honouring contracts.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/energy-australia", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/scott-morrison", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Activist groups warn providing finance for coal-fired power stations is inconsistent with banks\u2019 commitments to Paris agreement", "date_published": {"$date": 1544684536000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544684642000}, "authors": ["Katharine Murphy"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Australia news", "Coal", "Energy", "Environment", "Australian politics", "Scott Morrison", "Climate change", "Liberal party", "Coalition", "Labor party", "Australian Greens"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/13/banks-urged-not-to-fund-coal-power-as-government-moves-to-underwrite-projects", "og:description": "Activist groups warn providing finance for coal-fired power stations is inconsistent with banks\u2019 commitments to Paris agreement", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07ee0641e5476a23c09e2402e236cc2e41f36266/0_730_1977_1186/master/1977.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=852384e28ad879d99a8a06c1067bc03c", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Banks urged not to fund coal power as government moves to underwrite projects"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07ee0641e5476a23c09e2402e236cc2e41f36266/0_730_1977_1186/master/1977.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=91c6e5e02012a4e52c3ce2b3d1aa3de9", "width": "1977", "height": "1186", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07ee0641e5476a23c09e2402e236cc2e41f36266/0_730_1977_1186/master/1977.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=69bfdcf37586200ebd5226e0197a96bf", "description": "Government conservatives are focused on the Liddell power station and want to use new \u2018big stick\u2019 powers to extract the ageing plant from its owner AGL.\nPhotograph: Dean Lewins/AAP"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07990a2c3613145ed8c9e"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/14/pacific-nations-under-climate-threat-urge-australia-to-abandon-coal-within-12-years", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Pacific countries vulnerable to climate change have urged Australia to abandon coal power generation within 12 years, and to prohibit new coal plants or expansion of existing plants.\nThe call from 15 small Pacific island states came one day after the Australian government called for expressions of interest in new power generation projects, indicating it would be prepared to use taxpayer money to underwrite new coal plants.\nLeaders warned Australia\u2019s relations in the Pacific were being eroded by a perceived intransigence in Canberra over coalmining.\nAs the COP24 UN climate talks in Poland remained stalled over an unwillingness from major emitters to commit to further carbon emissions cuts, frustrated Pacific states, traditional allies of Australia, said the world must abandon coal-powered energy generation.\nThe Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, the outgoing president of COP23, said: \u201cWe call on all OECD countries to quickly phase out their use of coal by 2030 and for all other countries to phase out their use of coal by 2040. There must be no expansion of existing coal mines or the creation of new mines.\u201d\nAustralia and the US have both this week said publicly they have no plans to begin phasing out coal-generated power.\n\u201cThe United States has an abundance of natural resources and is not going to keep them in the ground,\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s international energy and climate adviser, Wells Griffith, told a US-government-run panel discussion on fossil fuels at the UN climate talks.\nAustralia\u2019s ambassador for the environment, Patrick Suckling, told the same panel: \u201cFossil fuels are projected to be a major source of energy for a significant time to come.\u201d\nAsked whether the Pacific declaration on abandoning coal was directed specifically at Australia and the US, Bainimarama was curt but diplomatic: \u201cWe request that everybody increases their ambition \u2013 that goes for everyone, all countries.\u201d\nThe prime minister of the Cook Islands, Henry Puna, told the Guardian the phase-out of coal was critical to the survival of Pacific island states.\n\u201cWe have made that call,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not directed at any one country, but it applies to all. We know that coal power plants are a significant cause of the climate change we see affecting the whole world.\u201d\nThe Tuvalu prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, cited the Boe Declaration, which Australia signed in Nauru in September, stating that climate change was the single greatest threat to the security and wellbeing of Pacific peoples.\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that we are hearing that Australia might continue to go on coalmining, opening up new mines, [such as] the Adani project [for the Carmichael mine in Queensland],\u201d Sopoaga said.\n\u201cI was in Canberra last week. I spoke to PM Scott Morrison, and the understanding I got from him was that, yes, they are seriously looking into coal efficiency \u2026 and also relooking at the proposal for the Adani project. I said, \u2018Prime minister, our partnership onwards, bilateral or regional, in this period of the Boe Declaration, will be centrally influenced by coalmining in Australia and I hope you set a pathway to move away from coalmining and focusing on renewable energy\u2019.\u201d\nSopoaga told the Guardian he proposed an annual high-level meeting between Australia and Pacific partners, specifically focused on countering climate change in the region.\nBill Hare, director of climate analytics and former Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report lead author, said the Pacific states were right to be concerned about coal.\n\u201cTheir call for an end to coal by 2030 \u2013 including new mines \u2013 is highly relevant to Australia \u2013 their regional neighbour,\u201d Hare said. \u201cThe timing is important, just as the government announces plans to underwrite a new coal-fired power station. I hope Australians will listen, even if their government won\u2019t.\u201d\nThe Pacific island states also called for the establishment of an international protection regime to protect people displaced by climate change.\nWhile Australia has publicly positioned itself with the United States, representatives from several countries say it has played a constructive role inside the negotiating rooms at the climate talks, where the \u201crule book\u201d for the implementation of the 2015 Paris agreement is being hammered out.\nThe environment minister, Melissa Price, met the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, after the secretary general flew back to Poland, concerned the talks had reached an impasse.\nA spokesman for the minister said, as a courtesy, she would not be discussing details of her meetings at the COP.\nPrice told the Guardian: \u201cAustralia takes a technology-neutral approach to our electricity generation. We are focused on reducing emissions through a range of technologies while maintaining the stability and reliability of our grid and keeping electricity prices down.\u201d\nBut Australia\u2019s schism with the Pacific islands over climate change is a diplomatic discomfort. As China has rapidly increased its involvement and influence across the Pacific through massive infrastructure projects and loans, Australia has sought to buttress its position as the regional hegemon, with a new commitment of $2bn for infrastructure.\nBut its perceived political intransigence on climate, particular its commitment to maintaining, and even expanding, coal power generation, is alienating it from Pacific neighbours \u2013 historic allies, many of which are low-lying atoll nations experiencing the effects of climate change most acutely.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carmichael-coalmine", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/adani-group", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/global-climate-talks", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/asia-pacific", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/mining", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Frustrated leaders appeal to \u2018all OECD countries\u2019 to phase out use as Australia signals support for new plants", "date_published": {"$date": 1544742394000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544742514000}, "authors": ["Ben Doherty"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Carmichael coalmine", "Adani Group", "Global climate talks", "Australia news", "Asia Pacific", "Environment", "Business", "Mining"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/14/pacific-nations-under-climate-threat-urge-australia-to-abandon-coal-within-12-years", "og:description": "Frustrated leaders appeal to \u2018all OECD countries\u2019 to phase out use as Australia signals support for new plants", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60972412c90076649b5717e47d4f14697b490564/0_257_4064_2437/master/4064.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=93fd8faada58f47910dd2d5d5db1d534", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Pacific nations under climate threat urge Australia to abandon coal within 12 years"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60972412c90076649b5717e47d4f14697b490564/0_257_4064_2437/master/4064.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6065ef9ef8329e3cab977811a14dd658", "width": "4064", "height": "2437", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60972412c90076649b5717e47d4f14697b490564/0_257_4064_2437/master/4064.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d21d23520af80bb6bbdb88b97a7f7586", "description": "Tuvalu, under acute threat from climate change, joins other Pacific nations to call on Australia to end coal-powered energy generation.\nPhotograph: Warming Images/REX/Shutterstock"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24b404bb1f62f631126f052bacb97bb14f4c3f94/0_35_2986_1792/master/2986.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4dc1a828a80e60e59492f69857b86ff5", "width": "2986", "height": "1792", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24b404bb1f62f631126f052bacb97bb14f4c3f94/0_35_2986_1792/master/2986.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a99b5f4e1ae3821e92958a8403c613f4", "description": "Fijian PM Frank Bainimarama and Cooks Islands counterpart Henry Puna at Katowice.

Every time I cornered a fly, I pictured goo marks left on the wall \u2013 spots splayed with tiny black guts and twisted legs. My halfhearted swats gave even the most sluggish fly time to escape.\nThat I genuinely couldn\u2019t hurt a fly might have been something I picked up in church. I grew up attending a Mennonite congregation in Indiana. We weren\u2019t the bonnet-wearing, buggy-riding sort, but we embraced some traditions, like the Anabaptist teaching of nonviolence. This sometimes expressed itself in an instinct for conflict avoidance.\nSo I was surprised when violence crept into my speech three years ago when I started working as a journalist covering climate change. Some ancient spirit took hold of me, and I found myself deploying the narrative of war. Carbon tax proposals were \u201cbattles\u201d to be fought. Greenhouse gas emissions had to be \u201cslashed\u201d. \u201cEco-warriors\u201d and \u201cclimate hawks\u201d were leading the charge.\nComing from a pacifist background, and obsessed with linguistics, I\u2019ve grown uneasy with the way war shapes our words\nI\u2019d adopted the language of the climate movement\u2019s leaders. The only way to overcome climate change inaction, the environmentalist Bill McKibben once wrote, \u201cis to adopt a wartime mentality, rewriting the old mindset that stands in the way of victory\u201d. Hillary Clinton reportedly wanted to equip the White House with \u201ca situation room just for climate change\u201d. Other activists are calling for mobilization against global warming on the scale of the second world war.\nThe whole \u201cfighting climate change\u201d frame rests on the assumption that opposition is the best way to get things done. But that\u2019s not always the case, as the linguist Deborah Tannen wrote in The Argument Culture: Stopping America\u2019s War of Words in 1998. Military and sports metaphors train us to see everything in terms of conflict \u2013 this side versus that side \u2013 and that perspective limits our collective imagination about what we can do to fix complex problems.\nComing from a pacifist background, and obsessed with linguistics, I\u2019ve grown uneasy with the way war shapes our words. The thought struck me earlier this year: by pitting one group against another, do war metaphors undermine our ability to address the complex problem of climate change, the biggest global crisis we face? Are there other ways to frame our predicament and convey the sense of urgency that\u2019s needed \u2013 without dividing us?\nMy gut feeling was that talking about climate change as a battle between rivals would ensure our ultimate defeat. But the reality might be more complicated.\nWar narratives are everywhere, so prevalent that they usually pass unnoticed. Politicians and the media have declared wars on poverty, drugs, obesity, and terror. These wars were declared against concepts, trends, and tricky issues with no simple solutions. And none of them have been won.\nReading Tannen\u2019s book, I saw these metaphors in a new light. There\u2019s a \u201cpervasive warlike culture\u201d in the US that leads us to approach just about any major issue as if it were \u201ca battle or game in which winning or losing is the main concern\u201d, she wrote. That tendency has shaped politics, education, law, and the media.\nHostility is definitely in fashion. Anger spreads faster across social media networks than any other emotion, as studies have shown (and anyone who\u2019s spent more than one minute on Twitter can attest). Cable news has devolved into shouting matches. \u201cAmericans on both the left and the right now view their political opponents not as fellow Americans with differing views, but as enemies to be vanquished,\u201d wrote Amy Chua and Jed Rubenfeld in a recent Atlantic essay.\nHere\u2019s the important thing about this war on climate change: we\u2019re losing it. Scientists have sounded the alarm bells for 40 years; the window to address the problem is shrinking; drastic action on greenhouse gas emissions keeps \u2026 not happening. The future of humanity is at stake. \n It\u2019s an aggressive moral appeal, explicitly trying to arouse an emotional reaction and a commensurate commitment. The enemy is coming. Are you with us?\nI get that this war message works for some people. In a study published in the journal Environmental Communication last year, participants read one of three articles about the effort to reduce carbon emissions, which was framed as either a \u201cwar\u201d, a \u201crace\u201d, or an \u201cissue\u201d. Those who read the war version perceived the most \u201curgency and risk\u201d and expressed \u201cgreater willingness to increase conservation behavior\u201d.\nThat\u2019s the spirit behind the Climate Mobilization, a group that invokes the war mentality in the service of climate action. The organization\u2019s director, Margaret Klein Salamon, takes inspiration from the history of the second world war.\nShortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the US had overhauled its economy and society for the war effort. Government spending soared from 30% of the economy in 1941 to 79% at the peak of the war in 1944. With a shared sense of national purpose, people made sacrifices for the common good. They planted victory gardens, bought war bonds, and rallied to produce the tanks, planes, and machine guns needed to fight a global war.\nKlein Salamon said climate change was such an enormous threat to the planet that it demanded similar sacrifices. \u201cThat\u2019s really the challenge we face now,\u201d she told me. \u201cCan we achieve the mentality we had as a species that we had [achieved] only exclusively during wartime?\u201d\nHer organization has had some success. Cities in California, New Jersey, and Maryland have declared a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d and committed to an all-hands-on-deck, wartime-like response. Oakland aims to \u201creach zero net emissions at emergency speed\u201d. \nBut what about places where people aren\u2019t deeply concerned about climate change?\nA full 30% still don\u2019t think it\u2019s a thing, despite the overwhelming scientific consensus behind it. And Americans who accept the obvious generally prefer to avoid the subject. Is war rhetoric the right way to bring a divided nation together?\nMy sister once got into a heated argument with my uncle about the Iraq war in 2003. Pacifism is a core Anabaptist belief, my sister argued, so how could you be a Mennonite and support a war? She vividly remembers him saying, \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe in good and evil, well, I\u2019ve seen the other side \u2026\u201d in reference to a near-death experience. That may have been the point when we stopped talking politics with the extended family. It felt like arguing would only make family get-togethers more awkward while accomplishing nothing.\nThe good news is that there\u2019s a way to break through seemingly intractable disputes\nPsychologists call this sort of fruitless argument an \u201cintractable conflict\u201d. An us-versus-them narrative turns people away from logic and into the realm of emotion and values. As the conflict drags on without resolution, partisans become increasingly bewildered by the other side\u2019s beliefs and actions.\nA recent study showed how two-sided narratives drive public opinion on climate change. Psychologists from the University of California at Santa Barbara and the University of Colorado at Boulder found that most Republicans believed climate change was real, but didn\u2019t support policies to address the problem simply because they thought Democrats did. Climate change, in other words, has been packaged together with issues such as immigration and gun control, and positions have turned into symbols of opposing sides. Why? \u201cThe study suggested that the discrepancies were likely the result of a media landscape that emphasized conflict,\u201d Newsweek reported.\nSo all those headlines I\u2019d been writing about pipeline fights and carbon tax battles could have been making things worse. Labeling people \u201cclimate hawks\u201d or \u201cdeniers\u201d only reinforced divisions. I wondered whether the act of picking an enemy \u2013 even an abstract one, like climate change \u2013 inevitably made enemies of other people.\nIn the search for an opponent, climate activists have landed on several suspects: climate deniers. Reluctant politicians. Capitalism. The blame points in every direction. \nIt reminds me of something I noticed in high school, listening to my classmates yell insults at rival teams during football games.While they called it \u201cschool spirit\u201d, I deemed it \u201czip-code loyalty\u201d: we had been pitted against one another by outside forces, and we really weren\u2019t different from the supposed \u201cenemy\u201d. \nThe good news is that there\u2019s a way to break through seemingly intractable disputes. As the journalist Amanda Ripley wrote, the key is not to avoid conflict, but to complicate it.\nRipley pointed to a study hatched at the Difficult Conversations Laboratory at Columbia University, where researchers sat down people who disagreed with each other in a windowless room, then recorded their uncomfortable exchanges. Participants with opposing views on abortion, gun control, or other hot-button issues were paired together and asked to write a joint statement on the subject in 20 minutes.\n\u201cOver time,\u201d Ripley wrote, \u201cthe researchers noticed a key difference between the terrible and non-terrible conversations: the better conversations looked like a constellation of feelings and points, rather than a tug of war.\u201d\nWhat the participants read before the conversation made a difference. Some were handed an article that presented only two sides to a polarizing argument. Others read a more nuanced version that focused on the complexity of the debate and considered several points of view. Surprise, surprise: people who read the more complex story beforehand were more likely to come up with better ideas for their joint statement and leave more satisfied with the experience.\nHundreds of other studies have shown that the best way to get people to stop demonizing each other is to introduce them to the actual human beings they disagree with. A few months ago, I happened to meet a retired Chevron executive. Considering how often I write about politics and the evils of oil money, our conversation could have gone very badly. It didn\u2019t. I mentioned my work as an environmental journalist, but we mostly talked about food, travel, and family. \nIn a similar vein, labor and environmental groups that often squabbled over issues in the past have come together to start talking climate policy. At the Colorado Climate, Jobs, and Justice Summit this fall, union members who work in the fossil fuel industry shared their perspectives on taking care of communities who depend on the industry.\n\u201cFor many in the environmental community, it was the first time they had heard those stories,\u201d wrote Dennis Dougherty, executive director of the Colorado AFL-CIO, in a column in the Denver Post. \u201cAnd in turn, it was the first time many workers got to interact face-to-face with folks from the environmental movement and learn how diverse and compassionate its members could be.\u201d\nAs for getting rid of war metaphors themselves, well, it\u2019s not easy. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to express the kind of action that\u2019s needed in peaceful terms,\u201d Bhikkhu Bodhi, a Buddhist monk and climate advocate, told me.\nIt\u2019s certainly going to require some imagination. Perhaps Earth is running a fever, and we need some wind-turbine ibuprofen to bring down the heat. Or maybe it\u2019s a sinking boat, and instead of scooping water out, our crew needs to patch the hole where it\u2019s rushing in. \nWhatever you choose, I\u2019m putting down my metaphorical weapons and fighting for \u2026 no, adopting more peaceful metaphors. And instead of turning differences into fights, I could frame the climate discussion in positive terms \u2013 discussing how a shift to renewable energy creates jobs, for example.\nCharles Eisenstein, author of Climate: A New Story, agreed that framing an important problem like climate change as a fight stokes partisanship. \n\u201cThere is a time and a place for resolving problems by fighting,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut it\u2019s kind of taken over everything.\u201d\nThis story originally appeared in Grist", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/science/language", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "description": "When we talk about saving the planet, we employ the narrative of war.

Since then it has grown rapidly and XR branches have sprung up in more than 35 countries.\nIn the letter, a version of which will be delivered to the BBC on Monday, campaigners request a meeting with the director general, Tony Hall, to \u201cdiscuss how the corporation can tell the full truth on the climate and ecological emergency\u201d.\nThey also call on the BBC to make the crisis its \u201ceditorial and corporate priority by adoption of a climate emergency strategic plan, at the level of urgency placed on informing the public about the second world war\u201d.\nThe group, which launched at the end of October with a blockade of Parliament Square in London, said it would hold a peaceful demonstration outside the BBC on Friday.\nThe rapid spread of XR comes as frustration rises with policymakers who are failing to slow perilous levels of global warming and biodiversity loss. There have been a flurry of reports on the scale of the climate crisis , including one from the UN which said there were only 12 years left to limit some of the most devastating impacts.\nDuring UN climate talks in Poland this month, David Attenborough said that unless action was taken \u201cthe collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon\u201d.\nSeveral cities in the UK, including London, have now declared a climate emergency.\nXR is calling on the government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and establish a \u201ccitizens assembly\u201d to devise an emergency plan of action, similar to that seen during the second world war.\nDuring a second wave of civil disobedience this weekend, thousands of people staged peaceful direct action protests in towns and cities around the UK.\nThe latest XR group to set up internationally was in New York, where activists announced plans at their first meeting this weekend for a US national day of action on 26 January.

The species, it turned out, is the asexual form of a known fungus called Cordyceps subsessilis. In its sexual state, C. subsessilis is a parasite that takes over the muscles of scarab beetles, and doesn\u2019t have much value for human health. In its assexual state, however, T. inflatum produces a group of compounds called cyclopeptides that Borel discovered, through tests on lab mice, seemed to suppress the exact immune cells involved in organ-transplantation rejection.\nhttps://qz.com/1144322/modern-heart-transplants-owe-their-origins-to-a-fungus-found-in-the-dirt/\nThis should remind us every day about the disaster that loss of \"lower\" lower lower ecosystems mean.

From Pete Seeger\u2019s 1959 rendition of the African American gospel We Shall Overcome, which became an anthem for the civil rights movement, to Dick Gaughan\u2019s Ballad of \u201884, a clarion call for the Scottish miners\u2019 strike, the combination of one singer and their guitar has had a potent effect on galvanising activists.\nNow, folk is turning its attention to the bees.\nBees are responsible for pollinating around 80% of plantlife in the UK and over a third of crops globally, yet from 1985 to 2005 the number of honeybee colonies in the UK fell by 53% and wild honeybees are now thought to be almost extinct across Britain. This is due to a variety of reasons including climate change, infectious diseases, the use of harmful pesticides, and the reduction of natural habitats. These worrying developments have led some to claim that if the bees become extinct, humanity would only have four years left to survive.\nThe stakes are high and 25-year-old fiddle player Rowan Piggott believes that folk is the answer. \u201cThe environmental crisis is one of the biggest issues of my generation,\u201d he says. \u201cAll of our political and economic problems pale in comparison, since they tend to go in cycles, whereas we have done irreversible damage with climate change.\u201d\nA waifish presence in a tweed jacket, Piggott is surprisingly optimistic about the future. \u201cPeople\u2019s knowledge of the crisis is very general,\u201d he says, \u201cand they often don\u2019t know what they can do to effect a meaningful change, so that\u2019s why I started the Songhive project, to give people chances to get involved with the bees.\u201d\nSince Piggott\u2019s father is an acclaimed traditional Irish folk musician and his mother is a beekeeper, the project seemed inevitable. Piggott noticed an accumulation of folksongs about the plight of the bees, such as Lau\u2019s 2012 instrumental Save The Bees, and decided to create an online archive to raise awareness.\n\u201cI thought it\u2019d be a nice way of reminding people that for thousands of years we\u2019ve had a healthy respect for bees as part of our life-cycle and now that people are more distanced from the process of producing food, we have forgotten that and bees have become a mild annoyance,\u201d he says.\nWith the archive up and running and the folk community responding, Piggott decided to up the ante. \u201cI always had the idea for making a record,\u201d he says, \u201calthough I initially thought it would be a compilation of already-recorded music from the archive.\u201d Due to costly licensing fees, the record became a collection of 11 songs written and recorded especially for the project. Piggott invested \u00a31,000 of his own money and raised a \u00a32,000 grant from the English folk dance and song society to print the finished CDs.\nFeaturing Piggott himself and some of the British folk scene\u2019s young stars, such as Rosie Hodgson and Georgia Lewis, as well as more established acts such as singer Nancy Kerr and songwriter Nick Burbridge, the album combines traditional folk instrumentation with bee-themed lyrics in the service of this environmental cause. Even the bees themselves are almost present, as their buzz is imitated by a shruti drone on Burbidge\u2019s Queen\u2019s Dream of Lost Fields, while Kerr\u2019s Dark Honey addresses the production of honey from the sugary remnants of discarded Coke cans.\nSince the CD was released in March, half of its 1,000 copies has been sold, raising \u00a35,000 for a Friends of the Earth campaign, the Bee Cause. Piggott has also been encouraging his audience to learn and perform bee folksongs from the archive and sign petitions. One such petition, to ban the use of the harmful insecticide neonicotinoid, was successful and passed the EU in April.\n\u201cThe response has been great,\u201d he enthuses, \u201call ages have gotten involved. The older fans buy the record and the younger ones are active in spreading the message.\u201d\nRosie Hodgson, 26, contributed two compositions to Songhive and believes folk is the perfect vehicle for the environmental message. \u201cFolk music was mostly created and performed by those who were in positions of vulnerability,\u201d she says, \u201cinjustice is a common theme and it harnesses the power of a personal story, so one well-placed tale will inspire sympathy for a cause in a way that talking about the cause as a whole will not. There\u2019s a magic that binds people when they sing together, especially in times of hardship.\u201d\nAnother contributor, Nancy Kerr, has made environmental awareness an integral part of her writing in recent years, with her last album, Instar, comprising folksongs about nature and conservation. For Kerr, born to a family of traditional musicians involved in protest music, folk is an activist\u2019s genre. \u201cThe act of relating a narrative that stems from the experiences of disenfranchised people is an act of protest,\u201d she says, \u201cand that makes me view folk music as intrinsically political.\u201d\nWith CD stock expecting to be sold out by the end of the year, Piggott is looking towards a second album, perhaps widening the scope beyond the bees. \u201cIt\u2019s not just bees, it\u2019s other pollinators like butterflies that are in danger \u2013 everything\u2019s in trouble,\u201d he says.\nFor now, though, he is planning a Songhive tour with Rosie Hodgson and some of Songhive\u2019s other musicians. They are currently booking venues that have links to conservation, even hoping to serenade the bees in a wildflower meadow.\n\u201cBees are the perfect species to drive meaningful action because we feel so positively towards them. They are a linchpin species,\u201d Hodgson says.\nFor Piggott, the bees are a vehicle for optimistic action and a means for folk to be refocused to its political roots. \u201cFolk music here isn\u2019t the people\u2019s music anymore,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s become commercialised and the general public don\u2019t know what it should sound like. This project is about tapping back into that heritage and aiming it towards a cause that people can actively change right now, today.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bees", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/insects", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/animals", "https://www.theguardian.com/music/folk", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Where folk songs were once about miners and civil rights, the plight of the environment provides rich material for today\u2019s artists", "date_published": {"$date": 1545285625000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1545294877000}, "authors": ["Ammar Kalia"], "article_section": "World news", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Bees", "Environment", "Wildlife", "Insects", "Animals", "World news", "Music", "Folk music", "Culture"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/20/can-folk-music-save-the-honeybee", "og:description": "Where folk songs were once about miners and civil rights, the plight of the environment provides rich material for today\u2019s artists", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492b7ceda61698d5f38cc4af84f462b6e60f3d6b/0_3_3863_2318/master/3863.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=5c5fd50901c164881dd9ac2297b17166", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Can folk music save the honeybee?"}, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492b7ceda61698d5f38cc4af84f462b6e60f3d6b/0_3_3863_2318/master/3863.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dd3fa783ada1fc3a15b295fa22c3cff3", "width": "3863", "height": "2318", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492b7ceda61698d5f38cc4af84f462b6e60f3d6b/0_3_3863_2318/master/3863.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ebe8cdaf4155064cf88087bba4de7880", "description": "Bee happy \u2026 a honeybee lands on blooming ivy.\nPhotograph: Thomas Kienzle/AFP/Getty Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae1c9f65fcc5ee536b3605e980bc7c992ba8b51d/0_0_3434_5144/master/3434.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b2e4299a033f0a2f5c5a5c4ff330ff1d", "width": "3434", "height": "5144", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae1c9f65fcc5ee536b3605e980bc7c992ba8b51d/0_0_3434_5144/master/3434.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=50199155b0b9bd17c7b048ec4bbd6d43", "description": "Folk singer Rowan Piggott Photograph: Voy Okuszko/Handout"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c569b464378701fdd8808159303c812d806d4c14/0_957_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b0afa53c9f874195ffda185cd92769c2", "width": "3813", "height": "2287", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c569b464378701fdd8808159303c812d806d4c14/0_957_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2435b5fcf1ce0a71ab0b38eb49399b40", "description": "Rowan Piggott with Rosie Hodgson Photograph: Voy Okuszko/Handout"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbae98fc52999be05778c7791133cc5c1e46f98f/0_0_888_800/master/888.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fc3f31862d67e8038cecdb68659db2f2", "width": "888", "height": "800", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbae98fc52999be05778c7791133cc5c1e46f98f/0_0_888_800/master/888.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7d647a58523a56b0b307953919340279", "description": "Photograph: Handout"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c99ff425313c270786fb0a128ef1284c78d0e9b2/0_19_682_787/master/682.png?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f137c5ccd18f28b1a536686a7b229002", "width": "682", "height": "787", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c99ff425313c270786fb0a128ef1284c78d0e9b2/0_19_682_787/master/682.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0098119185b457c2a5642128619aaece", "description": "Nancy Kerr.

It then cross-referenced the 30 types of shift to examine the impacts they might have on one another and human society.\nOnly 19% were entirely isolated. Another 36% shared a common cause, but were not likely to interact. The remaining 45% had the potential to create either a one-way domino effect or mutually reinforcing feedbacks.\nAmong the latter pairings were Arctic ice sheets and boreal forests. When the former melt, there is less ice to reflect the sun\u2019s heat so the temperature of the planet rises. This increases the risks of forest fires, which discharge carbon into the air that adds to the greenhouse effect, which melts more ice. Although geographically distant, each amplifies the other.\nBy contrast, a one-way domino-type impact is that between coral reefs and mangrove forests. When the former are destroyed, it weakens coastal defences and exposes mangroves to storms and ocean surges.\nThe deforestation of the Amazon is responsible for multiple \u201ccascading effects\u201d \u2013 weakening rain systems, forests becoming savannah, and reduced water supplies for cities like S\u00e3o Paulo and crops in the foothills of the Andes. This, in turn, increases the pressure for more land clearance.\nUntil recently, the study of tipping points was controversial, but it is increasingly accepted as an explanation for climate changes that are happening with more speed and ferocity than earlier computer models predicted. The loss of coral reefs and Arctic sea ice may already be past the point of no return. There are signs the Antarctic is heading the same way faster than thought.\nCo-author Garry Peterson said the tipping of the west Antarctic ice shelf was not on the radar of many scientists 10 years ago, but now there was overwhelming evidence of the risks \u2013 including losses of chunks of ice the size of New York \u2013 and some studies now suggest the tipping point may have already been passed by the southern ice sheet, which may now be releasing carbon into the atmosphere.\n\u201cWe\u2019re surprised at the rate of change in the Earth system. So much is happening at the same time and at a faster speed than we would have thought 20 years ago. That\u2019s a real concern,\u201d said Peterson. \u201cWe\u2019re heading ever faster towards the edge of a cliff.\u201d\nThe fourth most downloaded academic research of 2018 was the Hothouse Earth paper, which considered how tipping points could combine to push the global climate into an uninhabitable state.\nThe authors of the new paper say their work goes beyond climate studies by mapping a wider range of ecological stress points, such as biodiversity loss, agricultural expansion, urbanisation and soil erosion. It also focuses more on what is happening at the local level now, rather than projecting geo-planetary trends into the future.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at things that affect people in their daily lives. They\u2019re things that are happening today,\u201d said Peterson. \u201cThere is a positive message as it expands the range of options for action. It is not just at an international level. Mayors can also make a difference by addressing soil erosion, or putting in place social policies that place less stress on the environment, or building up natural coastal defences.\u201d\nRocha has spent 10 years building a database of tipping points, or \u201cregime shifts\u201d as he calls them. He urges policymakers to adopt a similar interdisciplinary approach so they can better grasp what is happening.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to connect the dots between different research communities,\u201d said Rocha. \u201cGovernments also need to look more at interactions. They should stop compartmentalising ministries like agriculture, fisheries and international relations and try to manage environmental problems by embracing the diversity of causes and mechanisms underlying them. Policies need to match the scale of the problem.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little depressing knowing we are not on a trajectory to keep our ecosystem in a functional state, but these connections are also a reason for hope; good management in one place can prevent severe environmental degradation elsewhere.

Brazil was constantly involved in negotiations to ensure COP24 delivered a workable toolbox to limit global warming. So we warmly welcome the positive outcome of COP24, including the agreement to keep working on a stronger global market mechanism for emission reductions.\nUnfortunately, there have been several misrepresentations made about Brazil\u2019s positions (Encouraging signs \u2013 but new rifts also exposed by hard-won deal at climate talks, 17 December), which do not help in the work ahead for all countries.\nBrazil is absolutely opposed to double counting when it comes to carbon credits, and has consistently supported efforts to prevent double counting. We believe that emissions reductions generated under the sustainable development mechanism must be additional to the emissions-reductions targets made by the country where the reductions are generated.\nThis means that if the private sector develops a project and sells additional emissions reductions to any country, those reductions should be counted only towards the national targets of the purchasing country, with no impact on the targets of the country that hosted the project. If the purchasing country then on-sells those emissions reductions, they should absolutely be required to make an adjustment in respect of their national emissions targets. Otherwise, double counting will occur, which is exactly what Brazil and many other countries have sought to prevent.\nAccurate representation of all countries\u2019 positions is vital if the world is to make the necessary progress on climate change. Brazil of course has been a leader not just in global discussions on climate change, but also through its actual actions. We are already meeting our pre-2020 targets in 2018, and look forward to all parties who made pre-2020 commitments to deliver on them, as Brazil has done.Thiago de Araujo MendesSecretary for climate change and forests, environment ministry, Brazil\n\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

Most people just want to know how their life is going to be improved.\n\u201cSo it is important for us to position ourselves as a party that is going to tackle climate change but turn that into an economic opportunity for the vast areas of this country that have seen decades of underinvestment and provide jobs for the future and provide that revitalisation that communities want to see.\u201d\nCorbyn put a radical green agenda at the forefront of his conference speech this year and a senior source in the leaders office said both he and McDonnell were \u201c100% committed\u201d to implementing the transformative agenda laid out by Long-Bailey as soon as Labour were in office.\nThe party\u2019s current target is to get 60% of the UK\u2019s energy from renewable sources by 2030 and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by the middle of the century.\nBut Long-Bailey said they needed to be \u201ceven more ambitious\u201d and set targets for areas of the economy beyond energy, from heavy industries like iron, steel and chemicals to agriculture and land use.\n\u201c[Tackling climate breakdown] is one of the central pillars of our industrial strategy \u2026 it will take a huge amount of work and we know it is ambitious \u2013 but we also know it is not ambitious enough in light of what we heard from the IPCC report \u2013 so we know we have got to move very, very quickly on this.\u201d\nLabour has brought together a team of experts including leading industry figures, engineers, scientists, consultants and academics, who will report back with a comprehensive plan in the new year, outlining what a sustainable energy mix would look like, how to achieve it \u2013 and what benefits in terms of jobs and investment it would bring.\nInitial findings from the group suggest that to meet its current targets, Labour would by 2030 need to:\nincrease the UK\u2019s installed offshore wind capacity sevenfold\nbring all 24m homes in the UK up to the highest efficiency standard\ntriple the UK\u2019s installed solar capacity\nBut Long-Bailey said this was just the start, with next year\u2019s report likely to add a raft of new radical policy proposals.\n\u201cThey are working on a very detailed report at the moment about what our future energy mix needs to look like to hit these targets \u2013 we are talking about offshore and onshore wind and solar \u2013 but it is obviously going to go much further than that.\n\u201cThis is about so much more than just the energy supply, it is about developing the supply chains and the manufacturing base so we can export our expertise around the world.\u201d\nLong-Bailey, seen as a rising star in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party, said the influx of new, often younger members, had energised the party\u2019s environmentalism and said it could no longer be viewed as \u201cluxury item\u201d, to be dealt with as a separate policy issue.\nInstead it was \u201cnow embedded into the DNA of every of every single department and every single economic decision we make\u201d.\n\u201cIt can no longer be a message that if you want to help the climate it is enough to buy sustainable products or source your energy from renewable providers \u2013 we have gone beyond that.\n\u201cIt is critical that our entire society and our entire economy is centred around this mission to tackle climate change \u2026 and the really exciting thing is if we do it right we can also improve the long-term prospects of people in this country.\u201d\nPart of the challenge, Long-Bailey said, is to paint a picture of the positive future that is possible if society successfully meets the challenge of climate breakdown, as well as being honest about the potentially disastrous consequences of

\u2026 \u201cWow, I could be a scientist or an explorer.\u201d\nShe said it was time to create that excitement and optimism about the future again.\n\u201cSo in Salford we need to be telling people that by tackling climate change we can have a factory that is going to create wind turbines, is going to manufacture parts for offshore wind and show them that their child in the local school can become an engineer, that they will get proper pay and be in a job that is secure, well valued, with trade unions involved so they have that security and a collective voice,\u201d she said.\n\u201cUltimately people need to know that their kids can have a really good, full and interesting life if we get this right.\u201d", "keyword_urls":

Artificial intelligence, migration and a healthier old age mean countries no longer needed booming populations to hold their own, she points out. We would like to emphasise the major benefit, briefly pointed out in your article, that having one fewer child reduces a parent\u2019s carbon footprint by 58 tonnes of CO2 a year. In fact, the most important contribution of a reduced birth is its long-term contribution towards mitigating global warming by reducing CO2 emissions. One major challenge to reducing worldwide CO2 emissions is the large variation between nations: 45 tonnes per capita per year in Qatar, compared with 16.5 in the US, 7.5 in China, 6.5 in the UK, 6.4 in the EU, 1.8 in Indonesia, and 0.3 in least developed countries, according to UN classification.\nReducing global carbon emissions while the developing world industrialises will require both convergence toward rates achieved in the most efficient industrialised countries and a global reduction in these rates, a strategy that the IPCC called \u201cconverge and contract\u201d. But this strategy, with realistic levels of contraction, appears to fall far short of what is needed, especially with the recent recognition that the previous goal reducing global warming to 2C is insufficient to avoid major adverse impacts. It is here that population decline from falling birthrates can play a key synergistic role with the \u201cconverge and contract\u201d strategy, perhaps to the point of making the need for geoengineering for sustainability only temporary.Harold M Hastings, Tai Young-Taft and Chris CogginsBard College at Simon\u2019s Rock, Barrington, Massachusetts, USA\n\u2022 I am a grandmother, and the last thing I would do is book any flight for my grandchildren (How Gatwick drone saga broke my family\u2019s hearts, Letters, 22 December). I would love to leave my grandchildren the world I grew up in, but given current circumstances that can\u2019t happen. I applaud the people who flew drones over Gatwick, perhaps checking by a tiny amount the advance of global warming. If we don\u2019t act differently soon, the chaos at Gatwick this Christmas will be as nothing compared to the catastrophe we seem to be refusing to face.Diana HeeksLlanrhystud, Ceredigion\n\u2022 Please tell me that the aerial shot of Gatwick (Financial, 29 December) was not taken by a drone camera.Allan McRobertDunfermline\n\u2022 Re William Westermeyer\u2019s article (In 1993 my agency warned of climate change. In 1995 it was abolished, 27 December), among all the manufactured and empty complexities of human life, it\u2019s easy to forget that we are all just clinging, white-knuckled and terrified, on to this fast-spinning Earth together. In truth, no single one of us has any more idea than anyone else of how best to cling, or why to even bother continuing. Our only real choice comes down to whether we boot our fellow travellers into the void, or help them find a firmer grip \u2013 until perhaps this ruined planet shifts and rolls and belches its sorry self free of the whole damned lot of us.Laura CloutIvy Hatch, Kent\n\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

The screenplay, written by Ben Elton, follows the playwright\u2019s return to Stratford-upon-Avon in 1613 after the Globe theatre burns down.\nOn stage, the pure-voiced Olivier award-winner Sheila Atim, who starred in Girl from the North Country, has written the music for Ch\u00e8 Walker\u2019s Time Is Love/Tiempo es Amor which opens, with Atim starring, at London\u2019s Finborough theatre in the first week of January.\nPitzhanger Manor &amp; Gallery in Ealing, the Regency era country home of the architect Sir John Soane, reopens to the public in March after a \u00a312m restoration project. Architecture will also mark 100 years since the founding of the Bauhaus movement with a book by Fiona MacCarthy about Walter Gropius, due this summer.\nThe astonishing notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci are to be gathered under the British Library\u2019s roof in June, with his Codex Leicester on display for the first time in Britain since it was bought by Bill Gates. And, while the biggest drum roll in the gallery world this winter is reserved for the Van Gogh show arriving at Tate Britain in late March, a fresh take on another troubled painter comes out in print the same month when the Norwegian author Karl Ove Knausgaard launches his book, So Much Longing In So Little Space: The Art of Edvard Munch. On television, there will be a long-awaited second instalment of Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s tragicomic Fleabag, promised for BBC Two in the new year with the addition of Andrew Scott. Meanwhile, the men behind Sherlock, Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat, are breathing life into a new creation, Dracula, for 2019.\nAt Covent Garden, the Royal Opera House sees a return of Richard Eyre\u2019s staging of Verdi\u2019s La Traviata. And American band the Flaming Lips have announced that their next album, King\u2019s Mouth, out in April, will feature a liberal helping of the Clash\u2019s Mick Jones.\nStudents of British music history await singer Tracey Thorn\u2019s new memoir, Another Planet: A Teenager in Suburbia, published early in February. But before then bookshops will be piling up apocalyptic thriller The Last, by 28-year-old Hanna Jameson, which sold for a six-figure sum in America.\nFor the more poetic soul, novelist Joe Dunthorne\u2019s debut poetry collection, O Positive, is out in April.\nOne to watch: Kieran Hodgson, the mercurial young actor/comedian who managed to beguile Edinburgh audiences last year by talking about the origins of Brexit. His hit one-man show, \u201975, comes to London in January. VT\n2019 could be the year Apple cements its reputation as the \u201cnew Microsoft\u201d \u2013 a company with a massive valuation that has ceased to innovate. Iterations of the iPhone still account for the majority of its revenue, and with an entry point device costing \u00a3749, it feels increasingly like a company aimed at wealthy baby boomers. Throwing $100bn at next year\u2019s revamp of Apple TV doesn\u2019t feel like a new paradigm.\nMoreover, despite some recent deals with Amazon to get its services on Alexa devices, Apple has fallen behind and priced itself out of the burgeoning market for connected gadgets and digital assistants. Google Home or Alexa-based devices are increasingly embedded in homes (and cars) and often don\u2019t play well with iPhones.\nWhether you are wired in to Apple, Google or Alexa has become like choosing a football team \u2013 you can only support one and it\u2019s impossible to swap.\nMeanwhile, Facebook will be hoping its declining popularity in Europe doesn\u2019t turn into a stampede if the EU\u2019s investigations about data sharing result in enormous fines, the advertising it is introducing to WhatsApp in 2019 doesn\u2019t prompt users to join other messaging services, and the cloning of Instagram\u2019s Stories format by Facebook and YouTube doesn\u2019t divert revenue and readers to other platforms.\nWell worth a read will be The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight For A Human Future At The New Frontier of Power by Shoshana Zuboff, a Harvard professor. At 704 pages, you\u2019ll certainly have to throw away your phone so that you can concentrate on finishing it without any distractions, which is a start.\nOne to watch: Byte \u2013 Twitter bought then closed down Vine but that isn\u2019t stopping the video looping network\u2019s co-founder Dom Hofmann from launching a replacement. IT \nThe football year will pivot around the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup in France over the summer, with the USA favourites to retain their title, and England, Germany and France among the pack on their heels. Around the same time, an as-yet-undecided host will stage the Africa Cup of Nations. And, in Portugal, England\u2019s men will hope to win the inaugural Uefa Nations League, a triumph that could yet signify the end of 50-odd years of hurt, depending on the current tournament exchange rate for agonising nostalgia.\nThe year in cricket will be dominated by the 50-over World Cup in England, followed almost directly by the Ashes, an epic-scale domestic double-bill that offers the summer game a chance to either dig its talons back into the national consciousness or confirm its own shift to the pay-TV periphery.\nThen there\u2019s the Rugby Union World Cup, a gruelling 42-day jamboree that kicks off in Japan at the start of September. New Zealand will be favourites because, well, they\u2019re New Zealand. But Ireland and England will also fancy their chances.\nElsewhere, boxing will try to cash in on the sudden wealth of star power in the heavyweight division. The spring could see Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder in an eliminator to face Anthony Joshua, creating in the process the greatest pay-per-view spectacle ever staged in the UK.\nBeyond the pitch it seems likely that Football Leaks will continue to dish up further evidence of murky practice. And that Fifa\u2019s entanglement with Qatar and the ineffectiveness of Wada and world doping authorities will continue to come into closer focus.\nOne to watch: Alexander Zverev. Men\u2019s tennis really does need a new star. Time for the next-best next-biggest thing to start hoovering up the grand slams. BR\n1 January 2019 will \u2013 so the government says \u2013 be the last New Year\u2019s Day that the United Kingdom spends as a member of the European Union. Both Theresa May and the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn insist we must honour the result of the 2016 referendum and end our membership on 29 March. That is in just under 13 weeks\u2019 time.\nBut whatever they say, the only thing that really is certain in British politics is that nothing is certain at all. Few new years have approached with so much up in the air. Much will be determined by what happens on Brexit \u2013 yet no one can be at all sure how Brexit will turn out.\nWill it go ahead as planned, be delayed, or stopped in its tracks? With parliament deadlocked and a no-deal outcome looming into view, there is increasing talk of pushing back the date, or holding another referendum to break the impasse. The other possibility is another general election.\nMay clung on as prime minister before Christmas despite more than a third of Tory backbenchers in her deeply divided party saying they have no confidence in her. But, if she fails to get her own Brexit deal through parliament in January and if any of the three scenarios outlined above happen, it is hard to imagine how she could survive.\nLabour, too, is divided on Brexit. For the first time since becoming leader in 2015, Corbyn is coming under fire within his party for refusing to oppose Britain leaving the EU and throw his weight behind a new public vote.\nThe centre ground, meanwhile, is wide open. Increasingly there is talk of discontented Labour and Tory MPs, perhaps backed by Liberal Democrats, forming a new centrist party from the political rubble left by Brexit.\nOne to watch: Amber Rudd. She is now back in the cabinet as work and pensions secretary. Although she is a strong Remainer, few are better placed to succeed Theresa May if she does not survive 2019 as prime minister. TH\nThe new year gets off to an ominous start with the inauguration on Tuesday of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who wants to accelerate mining and agribusiness exploitation of the Amazon, the world\u2019s biggest rainforest. Scientific attention may also be focused on the Arctic, where meteorologists will be watching to see if last winter\u2019s high temperatures were a one-off or a disturbing new trend caused by a weakened polar vortex.\nIf weather forecasters are correct, 2019 could also be another El Ni\u00f1o year, which means many parts of the world could also be in for another summer of heatwaves, droughts, hurricanes, coral bleaching and forest fires. This will be a crucial year to determine how fast humanity can respond to the growing threat.\nOn 23 September, the UN secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres will convene a climate summit to urge government leaders to raise their emissions-cutting ambitions, followed on 11 November by the next regular conference of the climate talks, hosted by Chile. Environmental issues will increasingly shape and be shaped by politics. Buffeted by the gilet jaunes protests, the French president Emmanuel Macron has promised to put climate and biodiversity high on the agenda of the G7 summit he will host in Biarritz from 25-27 August.\nIf the fossil-fuel championing Donald Trump survives the arrests of his former aides, he is likely to push back against a new bipartisan climate bill and continue unravelling pollution controls for national parks.\nIn China, President Xi Jinping\u2019s promise to create an \u201cecological civilisation\u201d will be tested by the massive infrastructure investment of the Belt and Road Initiative. Globally, the big question will be whether emissions can finally start to fall after two years of rapid growth. If not, expect fiercer protests by groups such as Extinction Rebellion and 350.org.\nOne to watch: Greta Thunberg. In September the Swedish teenager began a solo climate protest by going on strike from school, and more than 20,000 students around the world have joined her.\nWho knows what she\u2019ll do next \u2013 but you can be sure it\u2019ll make the headlines. JW \nForecasters have struggled to achieve a consensus about the prospects for 2019. The International Monetary Fund has warned that it could be a terrible year with much of the postwar financial infrastructure being torn apart.\nWashington\u2019s policy initiatives threaten to jam the cogs of international trade, making companies circumspect about pushing into new markets. Uncertainty over a Brexit deal, the US-China trade tariffs stand-off \u2013 which could escalate in the coming weeks after a 90-day moratorium ends \u2013 and the battles between Brussels and Italy\u2019s new radical right administration also threaten the old order.\nSince the 2008 crash, the west has relied on the emerging economies of China, India, Brazil, South Africa and Turkey to drive growth, but each is going through political upheaval and struggling to maintain momentum.\nChina, in particular, borrowed heavily from its own banks and the more shadowy elements of the financial sector to fund investment. After a crackdown on easy money, it\u2019s not clear how strong the economy\u2019s growth will be in the future. Yet the IMF, which failed to predict the last crash, stands accused of over-reacting to every morsel of poor economic news. Analysts at Oxford Economics are among many who predict 2019 as a period of steady if unspectacular growth. In this outlook, Donald Trump is more bluster than action, China gets back on track and British politicians will secure a deal or a delay for another referendum vote. The Italian government is already on the road to patching up its differences with Brussels. The worst is already in the past.\nOne to watch: Jerome Powell, the US central bank chief. If Fed rates continue to rise in 2019, money will be sucked into the US from across the world. Developing countries will struggle to find the funds they need to grow. Markets will become more volatile and global growth will slow. If Powell eases back, it will look like he has capitulated to Trump\u2019s bullying, and the Fed\u2019s independence will be in question. Whatever he does, it will have huge implications. PI\nRobert Mueller\u2019s FBI inquiry into Donald Trump\u2019s alleged collusion with Russia during and after the 2016 US presidential election is expected to conclude in 2019. A key question is to what extent Trump may have lied and conspired to obstruct justice.\nFaced by similar accusations, Richard Nixon resigned in 1974, rather than be impeached. But Trump may try to brazen it out. Newly empowered Democrats in Congress will increase the pressure, just as the race for the 2020 election kicks off. Expect fireworks.\nEurope faces great uncertainty. EU parliamentary elections in May may produce further gains for far-right populist and Eurosceptic parties. Key \u201cmainstream\u201d leaders such as Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel and France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron begin the year in a weakened state; the former has been replaced as leader of the CDU by Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. If there is no Brexit deal, April in Britain could be the cruellest month.\nBashar al-Assad\u2019s vow to retake \u201cevery inch\u201d of Syrian territory implies an all-out assault is coming on Idlib, the last hold-out province. Many Syrians in Turkey and Jordan appear poised to return home \u2013 if the war ends. But the unresolved problem of migrants travelling via north Africa will stoke tensions in Europe. The terrorist threat from Islamic State may intensify as it regroups in Iraq and the Sahel.\nEfforts to halt the Saudi-Iranian proxy conflict in Yemen will be a race against time. The UN says millions face famine and disease. Much may depend on what happens to Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince implicated in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo shows signs of becoming an emergency. China will exploit the geopolitical vacuum caused by America\u2019s distractions as trade tensions persist. Elections are due in India, Afghanistan, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria, Canada, Argentina and Israel.\nNorthern Syria, Taiwan, Venezuela, Cameroon, and Israel\u2019s borderlands are likely 2019 hotspots. Russia-Ukraine enmities will cause more trouble.\nOne to watch: Iran is in Trump\u2019s cross-hairs, and he could escalate confrontation in 2019 to shift attention from his domestic troubles. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is facing bribery and corruption allegations, and the Saudi leadership is under withering fire over Yemen and the Khashoggi affair. Both might welcome a chance to bolster their positions by settling scores with Tehran. If hardliners in Iran gain the upper hand and resume nuclear activities banned in 2015, the consequences will be unpredictable \u2013 and dangerous. ST\nThe new year will begin in spectacular scientific style when the US probe New Horizons sweeps past the tiny world of Ultima Thule. It will have travelled 4 billion miles to reach the piece of rock about 20 miles in diameter, left over from the birth of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago. The data from New Horizons could revolutionise our understanding of planet formation.\nFurther space adventures for 2019 will include the launch of China\u2019s Chang\u2019e 5, a robot mission to collect rocks from the moon, while the US will return to putting humans in space when Elon Musk\u2019s Space X company launches its manned capsule Dragon, and Boeing puts its CST-100 Starliner into orbit. Both will carry crew to the International Space Station. Next year should also see the results of efforts by scientists working on the Event Horizon project to produce images of the super-massive black lurking hole at the centre of our galaxy.\nThe chief medical officer, Sally Davies, has been instructed by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, to produce guidelines in the spring on the maximum time young people should spend on social media. Given the lack of research in this area it will be interesting to see what her recommendations will be.\nOne to watch: He Jiankui. The Chinese scientist shocked the world this year when he claimed to have created the world\u2019s first genetically edited babies. He is now under pressure to reveal details of his work, which created an outcry because of the ethical questions it raises.

It will be a familiar experience for many. For 24 years the annual UN climate conference has served up a reliable diet of rhetoric, backroom talks and dramatic last-minute deals aimed at halting global warming.\nBut this year\u2019s will be a grimmer affair \u2013 by far. As recent reports have made clear, the world may no longer be hovering at the edge of destruction but has probably staggered beyond a crucial point of no return. Climate catastrophe is now looking inevitable. We have simply left it too late to hold rising global temperatures to under 1.5C and so prevent a future of drowned coasts, ruined coral reefs, spreading deserts and melted glaciers.\nOne example was provided last week by a UN report that revealed attempts to ensure fossil fuel emissions peak by 2020 will fail. Indeed the target will not even be reached by 2030. Another, by the World Meteorological Organization, said the past four years had been the warmest on record and warned that global temperatures could easily rise by 3-5C by 2100, well above that sought-after goal of 1.5C. The UK will not be exempt either. The Met Office said summer temperatures could now be 5.4C hotter by 2070.\nAt the same time, prospects of reaching global deals to halt emissions have been weakened by the spread of rightwing populism. Not much to smile about in Katowice.\nNor will the planet\u2019s woes end in 2100. Although most discussions use the year as a convenient cut-off point for describing Earth\u2019s likely fate, the changes we have already triggered will last well beyond that date, said Svetlana Jevrejeva, at the National Oceanography Centre, Liverpool. She has studied sea-level rises that will be triggered by melting ice sheets and expanding warm seawater in a world 3-5C hotter than it was in pre-industrial times, and concludes these could reach 0.74 to 1.8 metres by 2100. This would be enough to deluge Pacific and Indian Ocean island states and displace millions from Miami, Guangzhou, Mumbai and other low-lying cities. The total cost to the planet could top \u00a311trillion.\nEven then the seas will not stop rising, Jevrejeva added. \u201cThey will continue to climb for centuries even after greenhouse-gas levels have been stabilised. We could experience the highest-ever global sea-level rise in the history of human civilisation.\u201d\nVast tracts of prime real estate will be destroyed \u2013 at a time when land will be needed with unprecedented desperation. Earth\u2019s population stands at seven billion today and is predicted to rise to nine billion by 2050 and settle at over 11 billion by 2100 \u2013 when climate change will have wrecked major ecosystems and turned farmlands to dust bowls.\nUnfortunately many experts believe Earth\u2019s population will actually peak well beyond 11 billion. \u201cIt could reach 15 billion,\u201d said Sarah Harper, of Oxford\u2019s Institute of Population Ageing. \u201cAll sorts of factors suggest women, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, will still want to have relatively high numbers of children and this might keep the world\u2019s population approaching 15 billion rather than 12 billion.\u201d\nThe world will have double its present numbers \u2013 but with hugely reduced areas of fertile land to provide food. We will be living in a shrunken, scorched planet bursting with human beings. Somaliland gives a grim vision of this future.\nIn the past few years climate change has killed 70% of its livestock and forced tens of thousands of families to flee from its scorched interior to live in refugee camps. \u201cYou can touch it, the climate change, in Somaliland. It is real. It is here,\u201d the country\u2019s environment minister, Shukri Ismail Bandare, said in the Financial Times last week.\nSudan and Kenya are also victims of a drought that has dried the Horn of Africa faster than at any other time in the past 2,000 years. Similarly, in Vietnam, thousands a year are abandoning the once fertile Mekong Delta as rising seawater pollutes paddy fields. By 2050, the World Bank says more than 140 million will become climate refugees.\nIt will be bad for humans, but catastrophic for Earth\u2019s other inhabitants. Arctic ice loss threatens polar bears, droughts imperil monarch butterflies, and koala habitats are being destroyed by bush fires. In all, about a sixth of all species now face extinction, say scientists, although in the end no creature or plant will be safe. \u201cEven the most resilient species will inevitably fall victim as extreme stresses drive ecosystems to collapse,\u201d said Giovanni Strona of Europe\u2019s Joint Research Centre in a report last week on climate change.\nScientists warned more than 30 years ago that such a future lay ahead, but nothing was done to stave it off. Only dramatic measures are now left to those seeking to save our burning planet, and these can have grim political consequences. In France, for example, President Macron\u2019s new levies on fossil fuels, introduced to cut emissions and to fund renewable energy projects, triggered riots. Had only modest changes been enacted a few decades ago there would be no trouble today, say analysts.\nBut the most telling example is provided by the US, which has emitted about a third of the carbon responsible for global warming. Yet it has essentially done nothing to check its annual rises in output. Lobbying by the fossil fuel industry has proved highly effective at blocking political change \u2013 a point most recently demonstrated by groups such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Heartland Institute, which helped persuade President Trump to pull out of the Paris agreement, thus dashing the planet\u2019s last hope of ecological salvation. \u201cThe coalition used its power to slow us down precisely at the moment when we needed to speed up,\u201d said the environmentalist Bill McKibben in the New Yorker. \u201cAs a result, the particular politics of one country for one half-century will have changed the geological history of the Earth.\u201d\nNo region of the US has more to lose from climate change than southern Florida. If scientists\u2019 worst predictions are realised, an entire metropolitan area, currently inhabited by more than six million people, is likely to be swamped by a 1.5-metre sea-level rise before the end of this century, a rise that could see the tourist mecca of Miami simply disappear.\nIt\u2019s a doomsday scenario that has united the leaders of Miami-Dade county and the cities of Miami and Miami Beach in an attempt to find solutions to the most severe effects of rising oceans before it is too late. Their plan to combat the physical, economic and social challenges of climate change, as part of the global 100 Resilient Cities programme, will play a key role in determining whether the low-lying region will still be habitable in the coming decades or surrendered to the ever-rising Atlantic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a problem that can be managed, it\u2019s not a problem that can be fixed and you walk away from,\u201d said Susanne Torriente, chief resilience officer for Miami Beach, where hundreds of millions of taxpayers\u2019 dollars have already been spent elevating roads, constructing higher sea walls and investing in modern, high-capacity pumps and stormwater drainage systems.\n\u201cEvery generation will add to the work that we have begun,\u201d Torriente says. \u201cWe are always learning, it\u2019s a constant process of learning, re-evaluating and improving.\u201d\nUp to a million Florida homes, worth an estimated $371bn (\u00a3290bn, are at risk of tidal flooding by 2100, one recent study calculated, but the threats facing the greater Miami region are not just coastal. Hurricanes are becoming more powerful because of global warming, say scientists, who point to the destruction wrought by Hurricane Michael in October, while the combination of a low water table and high \u201cking\u201d tides \u2013 occurring in autumn \u2013 causes regular inland flooding even on dry days.\nThis means that the new joint action plan being worked on by city and county officials has to be further-reaching than anything that has preceded it, Torriente says. \u201cOur resilience journey began with the climate work, the storm water, [but] this strategy will be much broader and will be defining resilience not only in terms of climate and flooding, but also mobility and housing, property, and how to recover quickly in the event of a hurricane in south Florida.\u201d \nThese moves reflect the sense of urgency being felt in Florida, where the state leadership has been criticised for neglecting the environment. Its newly elected senator, Rick Scott, banned staff from using the term climate change during his time as governor of Florida, and will be a close Washington ally of President Donald Trump, who took the US out of the Paris climate agreement.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be much more successful if we have more cooperation and more attention at all levels of government, [because] it\u2019s a problem for all of us,\u201d Torriente says. \u201cBut we do what we can. Everything we are doing is funded locally, so we can continue to invest.\u201d\nRichard Luscombe, Miami\nIt\u2019s a 45-minute canoe journey along the coast from regional capital Morombe to Kivalo in south-west Madagascar. Children frolic in the water, palm trees sway, and fishing nets hang along the beach. This tranquillity is deceptive, however \u2013 for Madagascar is ranked as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Higher temperatures, extended drought periods in the south, intensification of cyclones and rising sea levels are all forecast. For good measure, the country\u2019s pervasive poverty restricts its capacity to adapt to such changes.\nIn Kivalo, this is already a familiar picture. \u201cThe southern wind used to start in January and last until July,\u201d says Bikison Thomas, a fisherman. \u201cBut it\u2019s still going now in November.\u201d On very windy days, he cannot put out to sea. \u201cThere is also more fog,\u201d he adds. Overfishing, higher sea temperatures and the loss of mangrove, a crucial habitat for fish stocks, are also reducing catches.\nThe Madagascar government is aware of the country\u2019s vulnerability and has ratified the Paris agreement. Climate change is listed in every major policy document but budgets usually fall short of producing effective measures, a point that is demonstrated dramatically down the coast in the town of Morondava, where hotels are grappling with sea-level rise.\nTwo years ago, Chayune Badouraly bought the Coco Beach hotel. It had a few bungalows and a lovely beach. Badouraly added more bedrooms, a reception area and a restaurant.\nBut in September, powerful tides destroyed two of his bungalows, and the sea has not returned to its previous level. \u201cWe used to have 150 metres of beach,\u201d he says bitterly. \u201cNow it\u2019s minus five.\u201d \nAlthough there are plans to build sea defences, Badouraly says that could take months, even years, so he\u2019s taken the problem into his own hands and built a 60-metre-long sea wall, a mixture of stone blocks, steel rods and sandbags. \u201cI knew we had coastal erosion problems, but I didn\u2019t think it would be that bad,\u201d he adds. \u201cI would never have bought.\u201d\nEmilie Filou, Madagascar\nIt is hard to get a grip of the sheerscale of the Thwaites glacier in west Antarctica. It\u2019s more than 300 miles long and 200 wide \u2013 and more than a mile thick. It drains an area of ice that is larger than England and stealthily slides towards the sea by several metres every day. Only from satellite images have we understood the shape and power of this ice monster.\nThese now show the beast is waking up. Thwaites\u2019s uptake of falling snow was once matched, fairly finely, by snow and ice being lost as icebergs. Now it has begun to flow faster, along with some of its neighbouring glaciers. More ice is being lost into the ocean than is being replaced, speeding up global sea-level rise.\nThe cause of the disruption at Thwaites is straightforward, researchers have discovered. Increasing amounts of warm ocean water coming from the north have been melting the floating parts of the glacier and this, in turn, is letting the inland glacier run more quickly into the sea. This much we know, but we have still to understand how this process is likely to accelerate. At present, Thwaites contributes around 4% of observed sea-level rise, but it is widely agreed that this could grow exponentially. Indeed, some glaciologists believe that a complete collapse of the Thwaites glacier over coming centuries is now inevitable \u2013 and that would raise global sea level by several metres, drowning coastal ecosystems around the world, damaging coastal investments and displacing millions of people.\nResearch on the ice and frigid waters around Thwaites Glacier is urgently needed but carrying that out is tough. Even by Antarctic standards, this area is cold and remote. I have been working in Antarctica for more than 30 years, and I\u2019ve never managed to reach Thwaites. However, the UK and US governments have agreed to send in scientists as part of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration. We are finally going to get the chance to understand this waking monster. At the moment, it is merely yawning and stretching. The question we must answer, urgently, is whether it is about to wake up and roar.\nDavid Vaughan, British Antarctic Survey\nCoral reefs cover a mere 0.1% of the world\u2019s ocean floor but they support about 25% of all marine species. They also provide nature with some of its most beautiful vistas. For good measure, coral reefs protect shorelines from storms, support the livelihoods of 500 million people and help generate almost \u00a325bn of income. Permitting their destruction would put the planet in trouble \u2013 which is precisely what humanity is doing.\nRising sea temperatures are already causing irreparable bleaching of reefs, while rising sea levels threaten to engulf reefs at a faster rate than they can grow upwards. Few scientists believe coral reefs \u2013 which are made of simple invertebrates related to sea anemones \u2013 can survive for more than a few decades.\nYet those who have sounded clear warnings about our reefs have received little reward. Professor Terry Hughes, a coral expert at James Cook University in Queensland, Australia, recently studied the impact of El Ni\u00f1o warmings in 2016 and 2017 on Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef, the world\u2019s largest coral reef and its largest living entity \u2013 and wept when he saw the damage.\n\u201cThe 2016 event killed 30% of corals, the one a year later killed another 20%. Very close to half the corals have died in the past three years,\u201d he said recently.\nFor his pains, Hughes has faced demands from tourist firms for his funding to be halted because he was ruining their business. \u201cThe Australian government is still promoting new developments of coal mines and fracking for gas,\u201d Hughes said, after being named joint recipient of the John Maddox prize, given to those who champion science in the face of hostility and legal threats. \u201cIf we want to save the Great Barrier Reef, these outdated ambitions need to be abandoned. Yet Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are rising, not falling.

The rules to govern the deal are due to be agreed at the next United Nations climate change conference in the coal-mining town of Katowice in south-west Poland in December. With the clock ticking, diplomats have gathered in the former West German capital for mid-year talks. Things are not going well.\nNegotiators rush in and out of adjoining rooms. In years gone by, Biniaz would have been at the centre of these meetings. From 1989 to early 2017, she was a deputy legal adviser at the US state department and its leading climate lawyer. She personally drafted key passages of the 2015 Paris accord. In global warming diplomacy, few are more respected. She still attends UN climate meetings, but only as an observer, with limited access to the behind-doors wrangling. So in Bonn she stands in a visible spot and the meetings come to her.\n\u201cHi Sue!\u201d calls out Chinese negotiator Xiang Gao, who is standing alongside Andrew Rakestraw, a Trump state department official and Biniaz\u2019s former colleague. Beside these sharp-suited hotshots, Biniaz is an elder: rimless oval spectacles, grey hair loosely pulled back. They fill her in, cracking jokes and sounding hopeful about the stream of talks they are co-chairing. Biniaz writes something down.\nBiniaz left the department in 2017 and took up teaching in the law schools of Columbia and Yale as well as a fellowship with the UN Foundation, a Washington DC philanthropic institution. She did so partly because she thought nothing as professionally enthralling as the Paris agreement could ever happen to her again. She also predicted, correctly, that the new president, Donald Trump, would renege on the deal. \u201cI just did not want to be part of an administration that was going to take the position that this was a terrible agreement, because I don\u2019t agree with that,\u201d says Biniaz.\nAt the UN Foundation she shares an office with two former colleagues from the Obama state department climate team: Julie Cerqueira and Jen Austin.\nBetween them, Biniaz, Cerqueira and Austin cover the three arms of climate politics outside federal policy: international talks, local and state government, and the business sector. Austin is policy director for the We Mean Business coalition. Cerqueira leads the US Climate Alliance, an umbrella office for \u201csubnational\u201d governments who want to coordinate efforts to combat climate change.\nTurnover between administrations is a great Washington tradition, as party devotees slip into the private sector, thinktanks or lobbying firms. But the exodus from the state department climate team has been different, says Biniaz.\n\u201cThe number of people who have left has been kind of extraordinary and it\u2019s definitely been not just because the administration changed, but it changed into an administration that was very hostile to both the Paris agreement and climate change action more generally,\u201d she says.\nCerqueira says: \u201cA lot of civil servants gave up their nice state department or [Environmental Protection Agency] job or whatever because they are so committed to addressing climate change as fast as possible.\u201d She loved her state job and regrets deeply the change in policy that drove her out.\n\u201cYou stay in the federal government as long as you feel like you can make a difference and as long as you feel like you can act in good faith and uphold your oath to the constitution,\u201d she says, \u201cand at some point you realise that you can\u2019t do that any more.\u201d\nAs a result, the most effective diplomatic and legal outfit ever assembled in global climate politics is now spread through the thinktanks and environmental organisations of Washington DC.\n\u201cSome people have been calling it climate diaspora,\u201d says Biniaz. \u201cIt\u2019s not an organised group. But to varying degrees we keep in touch because our work is related. Well, we keep in touch socially too of course, just because we are friends.\u201d\nThe 2015 Paris accord drew up the global system to bring down greenhouse gas emissions in only the broadest strokes. At just 27 pages long, it represents what could be agreed at the time. But interpreting the agreement into a concrete set of rules is proving an immensely complicated task. For example, the Paris deal asks all countries to submit their plans to fight climate change. But much is left open as to what those plans should cover, or how often they should be updated, using which metrics and baselines, and how much leeway should be given to poor countries with bad data. These questions can all be split into increasingly finer details, with such eventual complexity that in many negotiating parties, the lead diplomat has only a rudimentary understanding of what their staff are working on. Consensus is proving difficult to find.\nIf it is ever agreed, the \u201cParis rulebook\u201d will iron out these technical, in some cases toxic, details. Without it, the deal will collapse.\nIt is over these troubled waters that Biniaz keeps watch in Bonn. Using intelligence harvested from old contacts, she keeps track of which parts of the talks are in most trouble. When they become stuck, Biniaz arranges small, informal gatherings of key negotiators to try to unblock them.\nOne evening Biniaz held an after-dinner session. \u201cPeople are in a better mood when they are fed,\u201d she says. Diplomats sat behind nameplates bearing their own names, instead of the name of their country. These meetings are private and completely off the record. Biniaz believes the relaxed setting can help adversaries \u201cinch toward a point of view\u201d.\nBiniaz has hosted at least five such meetings, held with the assistance of the Paris-based Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI), on the margins of the busy 2018 negotiating calendar. These have usually focused on the area of the talks Rakestraw and Xiang oversee, which covers what information countries must provide as they report their efforts to cut carbon pollution. The role is neutral, but there is one ironclad principle under which she operates: the deal cut in Paris is not up for negotiation.\nThere is an undercurrent at the talks that is disturbing the former US diplomat, who says there are serious attempts afoot to write rules Biniaz thinks \u201cignore the language\u201d agreed in 2015.\nBased on legal language Biniaz helped to draft, Barack Obama and Xi Jinping agreed to universal rules that gave flexibility for the poorest countries. That compromise is credited with making Paris possible. It was good for small, vulnerable nations that feared China\u2019s gigantic future emissions. But for emerging, coal-dependent economies it was hard to swallow. Hence their efforts now to reverse the deal and the possibility that a dual deal could be reached in Poland under which China is subject to different rules than the US.\nA group of developing countries, spurred by US betrayal and most likely coaxed on by China, are now trying to create one set of rules for the rich and one for the poor. This approach would govern China\u2019s massive emissions more loosely, which would be unacceptable to the US and EU. If talks fail to produce a rulebook in Katowice over the coming weeks, it will be over this.\nIt does not help that US diplomatic influence over climate change has collapsed under Trump. Just three years ago the Obama state department, with Biniaz as its lieutenant, ran the show. The Trump administration diplomats who still turn up to negotiate are tolerated, but their power has evaporated.\nAs an Obama diplomat, Cerqueira built alliances between countries with similar interests. In her new job, the international experience has come in handy. As cooperation and dialogue on climate change with the US federal government has dried up, other \u2013 usually European \u2013 nations have sought diplomatic connections with governors and mayors across the US. Cerqueira is often their first call.\nWhen the UK and Canadian governments began gathering names for a global pact to end coal power, she says, \u201cthey wanted to coordinate on the recruitment of states into the alliance and so we are like a natural fit\u201d. So far, seven US states and two cities have signed up.\nA short ride across town from the UN Foundation is the Brookings Institution, where Todd Stern has taken up a fellowship. If Biniaz was the driving intellectual force behind US efforts in Paris, Stern, as Obama\u2019s special envoy for climate change, was its voice and face. His relationship with China\u2019s lead negotiator and government minister Xie Zhenhua was a crucial factor when talks hit the skids in the final hours. The final draft contained a single word \u2013 some claimed it was a typo \u2013 the US found unacceptable. As the talks threatened to unravel, Xie stepped in, backed the change the US demanded and the gavel came down.\nUnlike many of his staff, Stern had no intention of staying on after the Paris deal was struck. He had had enough of the constant travel, the time away from his three children. He began packing up his offices and in May 2016, after striking a final bargain with his old friend Xie for the US and China to ratify the agreement together, he departed. Like Biniaz, he had agreed to teach a course at Yale. He was thinking about writing a book: the story behind the global accord. He was not thinking much about the ongoing negotiation of the Paris rulebook; certainly he didn\u2019t imagine getting involved. Then Trump won.\n \u201cI really had been assuming that Clinton was going to win,\u201d he says. Initially, Stern thought \u201cwiser voices in the room\u201d would convince Trump to remain in the Paris agreement. \u201cObviously that changed over time.\u201d But he knew immediately that \u201cit wasn\u2019t good and we weren\u2019t going to see anything like a bona fide climate change effort internationally or domestically\u201d.\nIn September 2017, a few months after Trump had announced his intention to leave the Paris deal, Stern travelled to New York to talk to old contacts as they gathered for the UN general assembly. He wanted to find out what other countries were thinking. How would the negotiations on the Paris rulebook, so critical to its function, be conducted with US leadership stripped away?\nWord of the binary system being pushed by China and its allies was circulating. This was something Stern and Biniaz believed they had buried in Paris. If US climate diplomacy has had a defining theme over years and across presidencies, it is that its great rival China must be bound by the same conditions. If December\u2019s talks deliver a dual rulebook, it could stop the US rejoining the deal under a different president, says Biniaz. Neither Stern nor Biniaz denies that making sure this doesn\u2019t happen is guiding their involvement. Six current and former non-US diplomats interviewed for this story said they thought this was at least partly their goal.\nCertainly, Stern heard enough in New York to continue turning up. Over the past two years he has dropped in to most major meetings. He lunches and listens and tactfully gives his views. His book has made little progress.\nHis travels have included a visit to Beijing in May this year, where Xie hosted him at Tsinghua University. The two spent a lot of time together, says Stern, talking about the state of the negotiations.\n\u201cMy lodestar is: what is the way in which we stay faithful to the Paris agreement?\u201d he says. \u201cNot what does the US want or not, because I can\u2019t speak for the US, and it won\u2019t come as a surprise to you that people aren\u2019t all that interested about what the US likes or doesn\u2019t right now.\u201d\nA senior diplomat from a developing country told the Guardian, speaking under condition of anonymity: \u201cSome would say Todd and Sue are trying to keep the whole thing from crumbling. Others would say they are trying to keep some soft power for the US. Others could say they want to still feel relevant, or make sure that their vision of what the Paris agreement should be prevails.\u201d\nThe US vision of the Paris deal is, broadly, what Obama\u2019s state department got from Paris. They wanted voluntary targets, rather than ones that were in line with their historical responsibility for creating climate change. Once set, countries\u2019 pledges could not be legally binding, or the US Senate would reject them. The world accepted the rule of the Senate. These priorities arguably weakened the power of the deal to cut emissions. Certainly the current paucity of these voluntary efforts (which are supposed to increase over time, at a pace determined by each government) means the world remains on a path to warming well beyond 2C.\n Meanwhile, Trump has argued that Paris \u201cdemeaned\u201d the US; that Obama was stitched up; that China will go on building coal plants (it will) while the US cannot (it can, but doesn\u2019t need them).\nDespite Trump\u2019s radical reversals of domestic climate policies and threat to withdraw from the deal, his state department still turns up to the negotiations. The US cannot formally leave the Paris agreement until 2020, coincidentally on the day after the next US election. \nThe state department continues to advocate the same positions it has for years: common rules, non-binding, voluntary targets. A US department spokesperson said its priority was \u201cto ensure a level playing field\u201d \u2013 code for tying China to the same rules as all others. Of course, by flagging his intention to leave, Trump has significantly weakened his diplomats\u2019 chances of protecting these goals.\nBecause of this, Obama\u2019s most senior climate advisers, who devised great chunks of the Paris accord, are now working in the shadows to defend a vision of the deal that is broadly in line with the efforts of the defanged Trump state department. \n\u201cIt\u2019s stupid to think that we would regard them [Stern and Biniaz] as the progressives,\u201d says a former negotiator for a small island nation, noting that in Paris the US had been forceful in cutting off the most vulnerable countries on Earth from any form of reparation for damage they will incur from climate change. \nWhen countries meet in Katowice this month, Biniaz and Stern will be there. In the final days of the two-week marathon, negotiators will hit a wall. Issues they cannot agree on will be handed to ministers. At that point Chinese and US intransigence could hamper the Paris agreement. \u201cWho will China\u2019s climate chief Xie turn to in that moment?\u201d asks Greenpeace adviser Li Shuo. Stern\u2019s old job at the state department no longer exists. The US delegation will not have anyone at Xie\u2019s ministerial level who knows the deal like Stern. \nFor the most vulnerable nations on Earth, Trump\u2019s election has had a little recognised, but insidious impact. In climate terms, it has shifted the emphasis away from improving the Paris agreement to defending it. Stern and Biniaz may well help rescue the deal, but will they want to make it more just?\nKarl Mathiesen is editor of Climate Home News.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/global-climate-talks", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "There was an exodus of climate experts from the White House after the 2016 election \u2013 but they still turn up to UN talks", "date_published": {"$date": 1543816817000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1543847105000}, "authors": ["Karl Mathiesen"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Paris climate agreement", "Climate change", "Science", "Climate change", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "Donald Trump", "US news", "COP 21: UN climate change conference | Paris", "Global climate talks", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/03/save-paris-climate-agreement-from-trump", "og:description": "There was an exodus of climate experts from the White House after the 2016 election \u2013 but they still turn up to UN talks", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0b818aa885ab068f925a9f51c232f9eb885cd32/265_687_4597_2762/master/4597.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=41a888082c6ea19fedcad085a04c790b", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "The 'climate diaspora' trying to save the Paris agreement from Trump"}, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0b818aa885ab068f925a9f51c232f9eb885cd32/265_687_4597_2762/master/4597.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3a0450ad399e557fd71c848cbc4f1954", "width": "4597", "height": "2762", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0b818aa885ab068f925a9f51c232f9eb885cd32/265_687_4597_2762/master/4597.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2ff090e2a2562b9c0a06ec435e30be46", "description": "The Eiffel Tower during the United Nations climate change conference in Paris, December 2015.\nPhotograph: Francois Mori/AP"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/747594a30e8835fa19f39bf9a326f9ed7b8ef273/0_0_1280_868/master/1280.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a400787cea49056975bc17c0e709b839", "width": "1280", "height": "868", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/747594a30e8835fa19f39bf9a326f9ed7b8ef273/0_0_1280_868/master/1280.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7862b1358dc802e8b738e02e54f6e67", "description": "Sue Biniaz, the State Department\u2019s lead attorney in climate negotiations, in Chicago.

The loss of share value and company profits are also mentioned. But nowhere do you discuss this in the wider terms of climate change. If the downturn in the economy means that there is less consumerism, then that is a good thing for the planet. The only way we are going to tackle the rising temperature and the ensuing disastrous results is to live simpler lifestyles; this means consuming much less of everything and not being so dependent on a capitalist society where a drop in sales is seen as a disaster.\nIt is sad that it has taken the mismanagement of this government to reduce consumerism; but more needs to be done with regard to education, enforcement and information about the effects of shipping produce all around the world. Until a drop in the retail market is seen as a benefit, there is no hope.Jackie JonesBrighton\n\u2022 Michael Gove\u2019s proposals for waste (Packaging producers to pay full recycling costs under waste scheme, 18 December) could progress faster, but they are welcome. However, the processing of currently non-recyclable plastic is not properly addressed. This is \u201call the other plastic crap that we burn\u201d, as a senior manager in the recycling industry once told me. Included in this are toothpaste tubes, used Biros, crisp and chocolate wrappers, bits of toys, disposable razors, \u201cstring\u201d bags for satsumas and onions etc. Every kilo burned creates three kilos of CO2, but it\u2019s technically recyclable using a process called pyrolysis, which takes any plastic waste and converts it into diesel fuel or new plastic.\nThe items are small; scaled up, the volume is large. I have filled a two-litre drinks bottle every week. In developing countries, people cram it into plastic bottles with a stick to make ecobricks for construction. There\u2019s limited potential for these as building material in the UK, but they could be brought into our recycling stream. I\u2019m doubtful that current sorting processes can extract these bits and pieces, but if households were to change their habits and always have a plastic bottle on the go, they could be collected weekly as a clean source of renewable material that is easy to handle. Furthermore, children love doing it. Schools could make it part of every school day and receive incentives or rewards for the carbon captured and hydrocarbon reused.

Campaigners also held Skype workshops for activists in Berlin, after training sessions in the US, Australia, Canada, Ireland, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Ghana and Poland.\n\u201cIn the two months since our first action, we have expanded more than we imagined,\u201d Liam Geary Baulch, an environmental activist, said. \u201cWe are now planning to change our structure so it can accommodate up to 2 million people.\u201d\nExtinction Rebellion rose to prominence last month when thousands of activists blocked five London bridges, glued themselves to public buildings and disrupted traffic with \u201cswarming\u201d protests that led to dozens of arrests.\nThis form of direct action has struck a chord in other countries. The Dutch activist Sjoerd de Koning said he would be among 60 people starting a chapter of the movement in The Hague next week.\n\u201cWe saw what was going on in London and thought this is what we have been looking for for a long time \u2013 peaceful civil disobedience targeted at politicians,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of energy in this movement and it\u2019s global.\u201d\nIn Poland, most environmental campaigns until now have been locally focused on issues such as smog in Silesia, deforestation in Bia\u0142owie\u017ca and wetland destruction in Rospuda, but activists are starting to sign up to Extinction Rebellion, which some see as a potential umbrella organisation.\n\u201cWe can all unite under this and make our voice heard,\u201d said Izabella Mier, a member of a food sovereignty group. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly inspiring to bring different organisations together for a common goal. We\u2019re looking for a way not just to be worried about climate change but to do something.\u201d\nThe Warsaw chapter held its first meeting two weeks ago, when about 50 people watched a video about the bridge blocking actions.\nWiktor Kotowski, a wetland scientist at the University of Warsaw, signed up online and then printed his own Extinction Rebellion T-shirt, which he wore while speaking at a side event during the climate talks.\n\u201cAfter I heard the Polish president open the conference with a bullshit claim that we can protect the climate by burning coal, I thought I had to do something,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a moment when scientists should get more active in society. I\u2019ve been thinking this for a couple of years.\u201d\nThe movement has received mixed levels of support from other international climate campaign groups. The US-based 350.org \u2013 which has organised direct action protests against gas and oil pipelines \u2013 has been an enthusiastic backer, while Greenpeace has so far offered help only behind the scenes.\nExtinction Rebellion organisers say it will be necessary for chapters in each country to adapt tactics according to the local political situations.\nThe challenge was highlighted in Poland by the government\u2019s initial refusal to allow entry into the country by 350.org campaigners, reportedly on the grounds that they were a \u201cthreat to national security\u201d. \nUnlike anti-World Trade Organization protesters, black-bloc anarchist groups or gilets jaunes demonstrations against austerity and fuel-tax rises in France, environmental campaigners say their actions have focused on non-violent civil disobedience.\nOn Sunday, 100 academics and other prominent backers of Extinction Rebellion called for people around the world to rise up and organise against the \u201cparalysis\u201d of political leaders.\n\u201cWe must collectively do whatever\u2019s necessary non-violently, to persuade politicians and business leaders to relinquish their complacency and denial,\u201d the open letter stated, which was signed by Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein, Bill McKibben, and the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, among others.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/global-climate-talks", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/poland", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "UK activist group using climate talks in Poland this week to widen 35-country network", "date_published": {"$date": 1544437759000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1555338099000}, "authors": ["Jonathan Watts"], "article_section": "World news", "article_tags": ["Protest", "Global climate talks", "Climate change", "Environment", "World news", "Poland", "UK news", "Europe", "Extinction Rebellion"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/10/extinction-rebellion-goes-global-international-civil-disobedience-climate-talks-poland", "og:description": "UK activist group using climate talks in Poland this week to widen 35-country network", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/084e67e2d60f1c1ce8a12b7db6ee15268a3b25de/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=39553b24646fd17cb45e9af411ddff8f", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Extinction Rebellion goes global in run-up to week of international civil disobedience"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/084e67e2d60f1c1ce8a12b7db6ee15268a3b25de/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6bd5de9d21b9864df29b5d7b74e74357", "width": "6000", "height": "3600", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/084e67e2d60f1c1ce8a12b7db6ee15268a3b25de/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7dc1973a35ac9ba957010e9690ab9407", "description": "Extinction Rebellion activists at a sit-in on Westminster Bridge in November to demand urgent action on the environment.\nPhotograph: Amer Ghazzal/Barcroft Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc078f5a2c3613145ed8c5f"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/10/environmental-fines-are-ideological-says-brazil-minister-ricardo-salles", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Brazil\u2019s new environment minister believes that global warming is \u201csecondary\u201d, that many environmental fines are \u201cideological\u201d and has been accused of altering plans for an environmentally protected area in order to favour businesses.\nRicardo Salles, the former environment secretary for S\u00e3o Paulo state, was recommended for his new role by business and agribusiness groups and announced as minister in a tweet on Sunday by the far-right president-elect, Jair Bolsonaro.\nEnvironmentalists said the appointment was a serious setback to protection at a time when deforestation and illegal mining in the Amazon were on the rise.\nBolsonaro has said protected Amazon areas hold up development, has advocated commercial farming and mining on indigenous reserves and attacked the \u201cfines industry\u201d of Brazil\u2019s environmental agencies.\nMarcio Astrini, the public policy director at Greenpeace Brazil, said Salles was \u201cnot chosen for his history of environmental protection. He was chosen because he accepts Bolsonaro\u2019s agenda.\u201d Astrini said neutering environmental agencies and reducing protected areas could make deforestation \u201cexplode\u201d.\n\u201cThis is not an environmental agenda. It is an agenda of threats to the environment,\u201d he said.\nSalles told the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper on Sunday that Brazil suffered from a \u201cproliferation\u201d of environmental fines that had an \u201cideological character\u201d. He questioned figures showing the highest deforestation in a decade and called the global warming debate \u201cinnocuous\u201d.\n\u201cThe discussion over whether there is or isn\u2019t global warming is secondary,\u201d he said. Asked if the new government, which takes office on 1 January, could exit the Paris climate deal \u2013 a threat made by Bolsonaro during campaigning, on which he later backed down \u2013 Salles said it would \u201clook item by item at the most sensitive points \u2026 remembering that national sovereignty over territory is not negotiable\u201d.\nA lawyer who specialised in company administration, Salles was environment secretary of S\u00e3o Paulo state under the conservative governor Geraldo Alckmin. In 2017, S\u00e3o Paulo state prosecutors sued Salles for \u201cadministrative improbity\u201d.\nProsecutors alleged in court documents that Salles took part in altering maps delineating an environmentally protected area in S\u00e3o Paulo state \u201cwith the clear intention of benefiting economic sectors, notably mining\u201d.\nSalles denied the accusations in his Folha interview and said he had highlighted \u201ccrass mistakes\u201d in the \u201cideological work\u201d that had been done in the environmental protection area concerned, adding that the state environment council had approved the plan. The case continues.\nHe stood unsuccessfully for Congress in October\u2019s elections for the business-friendly New party, and has argued that Brazilian agribusiness is \u201cunder threat\u201d and criticised the Landless Rural Workers Movement.\nSalles was recommended for his new role by the Brazilian Rural Society \u2013 an agribusiness group, which aligns him with the new agriculture minister, Tereza Cristina, formerly president of the powerful agribusiness lobby in Congress.\nThe Climate Observatory (Observat\u00f3rio do Clima), a non-profit environmental network, said his appointment effectively fulfilled another Bolsonaro campaign promise to subordinate the ministry of environment to the ministry of agriculture. It warned of potential boycotts to Brazilian agricultural products if the country dismantled its environmental protection.\n\u201cModern agribusiness will pay the price when markets close to our commodities,\u201d it said.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/americas", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/amazon-rainforest", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/deforestation", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/forests", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Appointed by president-elect Bolsonaro, Ricardo Salles calls environmental fines \u2018ideological\u2019", "date_published": {"$date": 1544464362000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544469557000}, "authors": ["Dom Phillips"], "article_section": "World news", "article_tags": ["Brazil", "Environment", "Climate change", "Americas", "World news", "Amazon rainforest", "Deforestation", "Conservation", "Trees and forests"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/10/environmental-fines-are-ideological-says-brazil-minister-ricardo-salles", "og:description": "Appointed by president-elect Bolsonaro, Ricardo Salles calls environmental fines \u2018ideological\u2019", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5000099032bcbd1a459defdbebb9798f1fde0eb5/0_717_2062_1236/master/2062.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=92f0021b6348268f9a8ed0bf059c4e2c", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Climate change a 'secondary' issue, says Brazil's environment minister"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5000099032bcbd1a459defdbebb9798f1fde0eb5/0_717_2062_1236/master/2062.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ba11b1557bfde933e194cbdb387a553f", "width": "2062", "height": "1236", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5000099032bcbd1a459defdbebb9798f1fde0eb5/0_717_2062_1236/master/2062.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b43f68b144a2c05eb26b7f863943cfe9", "description": "Ricardo Salles questioned figures showing the highest deforestation in a decade and called the global warming debate \u2018innocuous\u2019.\nPhotograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc078faa2c3613145ed8c62"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Action to fight global warming is coming whether world leaders like it or not, school student Greta Thunberg has told the UN climate change summit, accusing them of behaving like irresponsible children.\nThunberg began a solo climate protest by striking from school in Sweden in August.

On Monday, Sir David Attenborough told the summit that without action \u201cthe collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon\u201d.\nThunberg, who had a meeting with the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, on Monday, said: \u201cWhat I hope we achieve at this conference is that we realise that we are facing an existential threat. This is the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced. First we have to realise this and then as fast as possible do something to stop the emissions and try to save what we can save.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Guterres said: \u201cOur younger generations will have to help drive, and complete, the work we start today. We need to harness their energy, invention and political power to raise climate ambition.\u201d\nToby Thorpe, a school student from Hobart, Tasmania, who took part in the recent school strikes in Australia and is also at the UN summit, said: \u201cWe are in this together. Together we are strong and we will not give up.\u201d Australia\u2019s resources minister, Matt Canavan, had dismissed the school strike \u2013 \u201cthe best thing you\u2019ll learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole queue\u201d \u2013 but the Senate later approved a motion in support of the students.\nThunberg said the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world was amazing. \u201cIt proves you are never too small to make a difference,\u201d she said. Her protests was inspired by US school students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of school shootings. But initially her classmates refused to join in: \u201cI had to do it alone.\u201d\nThe first two weeks of Thunberg\u2019s strike were spent protesting outside the Swedish parliament. Now she spends every Friday on strike. \u201cI like school and I like learning,\u201d she told the Guardian. She said her strike would end when Sweden begins cutting its carbon emissions by a dramatic 15% a year: \u201cSweden is such a rich country and we have high per capita emissions, so we need to reduce more [than others].\u201d\nShe also had a message for other school students: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to school strike, it\u2019s your own choice. But why should we be studying for a future that soon may be no more? This is more important than school, I think.\u201d\nThunberg\u2019s father, Svante, said: \u201cAs a parent you cannot support your child striking from school. I said to her you have to go out and do it for yourself.\u201d But he added: \u201cIt\u2019s OK in the holidays.\u201d\nThe Thunbergs are descendants of Svante Arrhenius, the Nobel-prize-winning scientist who in 1896 first calculated the greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide emissions. Thunberg\u2019s father was named after him, and said much of Arrhenius\u2019s work has stood the test of time, but not everything. \u201cHe thought we\u2019d be [at today\u2019s levels of warming] in 2,000 years\u2019 time,\u201d said Svante Thunberg.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/sweden", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Greta Thunberg, 15, told UN summit that students are acting in absence of global leadership", "date_published": {"$date": 1543921839000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1552566802000}, "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "United Nations", "World news", "Sweden", "Europe", "Greta Thunberg"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit", "og:description": "Greta Thunberg, 15, told UN summit that students are acting in absence of global leadership", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93a951c99558b9b2ed9305b6f97b6534aa189bd9/0_143_4130_2477/master/4130.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=e47d9739304ebd60730631bdbc06e3b1", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "'Our leaders are like children,' school strike founder tells climate summit"}, "headline": "O", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93a951c99558b9b2ed9305b6f97b6534aa189bd9/0_143_4130_2477/master/4130.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=41cf40b7b365dda55d1ba35300d53abb", "width": "4130", "height": "2477", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93a951c99558b9b2ed9305b6f97b6534aa189bd9/0_143_4130_2477/master/4130.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1814a41fa6eefa6910e3c67e62feefea", "description": "Thunberg during her Friday climate change protest.\nPhotograph: Hanna Franzen/EPA"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc078fca2c3613145ed8c63"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/bernie-sanders-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-climate-change-town-hall-green-new-deal", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "A star-studded progressive town hall on climate change drew thousands of viewers online and hundreds in person \u2013 but offered little insight into how the US left might overcome Republican opposition and lay the groundwork to limit rising temperatures.\nThe Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, a potential 2020 presidential candidate, and Democratic socialist congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who campaigned on a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d, elicited cheers with promises of an economic boom from massive investment in renewable power.\n\u201cWhat we are trying to do tonight is be part of the revolution in terms of the need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and to not only save the planet but create millions of good-paying jobs in the process,\u201d Sanders said.\nOcasio-Cortez said the climate movement was \u201cgoing to be the Great Society, the moonshot, the civil rights movement of our generation\u201d.\nSpeaking at the US Capitol, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez blamed corporations for taking advantage of people and oil and gas companies for ravaging the environment.

Almost all of those companies ignored or dismissed climate change as a financial risk to their business.\n\u201cDirectors are legally required to consider climate risk. Failure to do so may constitute a breach of their legal duties,\u201d Market Forces campaigner Rachel Deans said.\n\u201cIt appears directors are openly admitting to breaking the law at their shareholder meetings and Asic seems to be well aware of it.\u201dAt the Prairie Mining AGM, chairman Ian Middlemas was asked whether the board supported the Paris agreement targets. \u201cIt\u2019s not on our radar,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI think they are the sort of questions that are for people that are producing product and have got an actual operation.

As Sir David Attenborough told the UN climate change conference in Poland, \u201cthe collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon\u201d. We have even worked out, with scrupulous care, what we must do to avoid this or to mitigate the effects of climate change. We know what to do. We can see how to do it. There\u2019s only one problem: we do almost nothing.\nFigures released today by the University of East Anglia for the conference in Katowice show that global carbon emissions will be higher than ever before this year. In fact they will rise by nearly 3%, an astonishing and terrifying annual figure at a time when the need to diminish them has never been more urgent. The main driver of this growth has been the increased use of coal, which is rapidly approaching its previous peak level, from 2013. There is a particular irony in that this conference is being held in Poland, a country that still derives 80% of its electricity from coal, even if this is less grossly polluting than it was in the Communist era. In fact emissions there are down 30% from their peak in 1988. But far more must be done. To limit global warming to the Paris agreement goal of 1.5C, CO2 emissions would need to decline by 50% by 2030 and reach net zero by around 2050.\nAll this destructive activity far outweighs the progress that has been made on the use of renewable resources. That is considerable, but so long as renewables are understood only as a pastime for the rich, they will be wholly insufficient to meet the problems before us. The Paris goal often looks like a drunkard\u2019s resolution that everything will be different as soon as tomorrow comes. Everything has stayed much the same, and the balance of expert opinion is that three degrees is now more likely than the target figure of half that.\nIt\u2019s not just coal. China is now the biggest emitter of carbon, followed by the US and the EU as a whole, then India, Russia, and Japan. Oil use continues to grow. The worldwide demand for energy is outpacing efforts to deal its climate-altering side effects. In a characteristically greedy and destructive way, the Trump administration proposes to destroy one of the last great Arctic wildlife reserves in order to drill for oil there. The great oil-producing nations of Saudi Arabia and Iran both figure among the top 10 carbon-emitting countries despite having hardly any other components to their economies. Add to this the effects of deforestation in the Amazon, which will accelerate under the Bolsonaro government, and the future looks unimaginably grim. Climate change will exacerbate, as it already does, the world\u2019s existing political and economic divisions.\nThe most worrying feature of the latest UN report is the suggestion that the relatively good performance of the years 2014-16 in reducing carbon emissions was the result of an economic slowdown. The political consequences of the resulting discontent are with us still. They produced Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro and gravely weakened the EU. All those factors make a sane policy on climate change less likely. The purely physical feedback loops that drive climate change, such as the reduction of reflective ice surface, are now well enough understood. But it may be that the long-term message of the years since the Paris summit is that this understanding is not enough. We must also learn somehow to disrupt the political and economic feedback loops which are driving our civilisation to the brink of catastrophe.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/david-attenborough", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oil", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/editorials"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Editorial: We are losing the war against climate change; the use of fossil fuels is driving higher carbon emissions when they need to be coming down", "date_published": {"$date": 1544034489000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544039703000}, "authors": ["Editorial"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "David Attenborough", "Energy", "Oil", "Fossil fuels", "Coal", "Renewable energy", "Donald Trump", "Arctic", "Jair Bolsonaro"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/05/the-guardian-view-on-climate-change-too-much-too-soon", "og:description": "Editorial: We are losing the war against climate change; the use of fossil fuels is driving higher carbon emissions when they need to be coming down", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c794626b8900a3446c0261cd12f5e904b2ff067/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=b41478e5ddcf397868321340afb11647", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "The Guardian view on climate change: too much, too soon | Editorial"}, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c794626b8900a3446c0261cd12f5e904b2ff067/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1a5c2cb5614d767683c4315b0f325cbc", "width": "5472", "height": "3283", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c794626b8900a3446c0261cd12f5e904b2ff067/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b52c13d47b7835682ff1cfa1682be0a2", "description": "Steam and smoke rise from the coal-fired Belchatow power station in Poland.\nPhotograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07927a2c3613145ed8c75"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/06/trump-rolls-back-climate-change-rule-that-restricted-new-coal-plants", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "The Trump administration is rolling back a climate change regulation that restricted new coal plants.\nThe change is mostly symbolic \u2013 but nevertheless sends a strong signal. Companies in the US are not building plants that burn coal because burning natural gas is cheaper and creates less pollution. Renewable power has also eaten into coal\u2019s market share.\nBut the Obama-era rule for new coal plants has long been a target of the industry. It would have effectively required technology to capture the carbon dioxide that traps heat on earth and causes climate change. That technology is not in use on a commercial scale. A draft replacement rule would allow new coal plants that meet certain efficiency requirements.\nThe acting Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Andrew Wheeler, said the Obama administration was \u201cdisingenuous\u201d when it decided coal-plant carbon capture technologies were adequately demonstrated. He said the change to require efficiency efforts instead of carbon capture will encourage \u201cclean coal\u201d in the US and worldwide through technology exports.\n\u201cYou will see a decrease in emissions worldwide because of an increase in investments in new energy technologies,\u201d Wheeler argued.\nThe EPA\u2019s own economic analysis contradicts him. It concludes that the rollback will not do anything to boost coal power in the US because any new fossil fuel plants will burn natural gas, not coal.\nWheeler argued affordable energy benefits low-income people most and invited the National Black Chamber of Commerce to speak as a supporter. Experts say, however, that coal plants are shutting down because they aren\u2019t as affordable as other options.\nMichelle Bloodworth, CEO of the coal industry group the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, said ahead of the event that \u201cthere is no silver bullet when it comes to developing new coal units in today\u2019s marketplace but in announcing this proposal the EPA has outlined a regulation that both follows the law and allows new more efficient coal plants to be a viable option in the future.\u201d\nNixing the rule could invigorate coal backers worldwide, sending a message to negotiators of an international climate pact in Poland that the US is trying to bolster the future of the fossil fuel. Trump, who has questioned manmade climate change, has said he will exit that pact, the Paris agreement.\nDavid Doniger, a climate director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move \u201cwill be judged harshly by future generations\u201d.\n\u201cThe science is clear: operating large fossil fuel plants without carbon capture and storage is a disaster for the climate. What we need instead is swift and decisive action to curb dangerous climate change,\u201d Doniger said.\nFifteen health and medical groups, including the American Lung Association, opposed the EPA announcement.\nAcross the federal government, Trump agencies have sought to slash rules for fossil fuel production and use. The environmental protection agency is also rescinding an Obama rule that aimed to shift the US away from coal use and toward more natural gas and renewable power. And the agency is expected to roll back a standard requiring coal plants to limit their toxic mercury pollution. Many plants shut down in 2015, in part so that they wouldn\u2019t have to spend money to comply with that rule.\nThis year, coal use in the US is expected to be at its lowest point since 1979, according to the energy information administration. Coal consumption has fallen 44% since its peak in 2007, the agency said.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/epa", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "EPA says change to require efficiency efforts instead of carbon capture will encourage \u2018clean coal\u2019 in the US and worldwide", "date_published": {"$date": 1544125744000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544131782000}, "authors": ["Emily Holden"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Coal", "US news", "Environment", "Climate change", "US Environmental Protection Agency", "Trump administration", "Energy", "Fossil fuels", "US politics"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/06/trump-rolls-back-climate-change-rule-that-restricted-new-coal-plants", "og:description": "EPA says change to require efficiency efforts instead of carbon capture will encourage \u2018clean coal\u2019 in the US and worldwide", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4a6a924047ddc79312fd6bbdd369990f3e2c7b5/0_283_4443_2666/master/4443.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=d660ee0844b731326cf911a2c2de4e11", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Trump rolls back climate change rule that restricted new coal plants"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4a6a924047ddc79312fd6bbdd369990f3e2c7b5/0_283_4443_2666/master/4443.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=748a8cb2dccca9380ba0c05926c91443", "width": "4443", "height": "2666", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4a6a924047ddc79312fd6bbdd369990f3e2c7b5/0_283_4443_2666/master/4443.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0bf55a9d71ce11c444210f648272c44e", "description": "The EPA\u2019s draft replacement rule would allow new coal plants that meet certain efficiency requirements.\nPhotograph: J David Ake/AP"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc0792fa2c3613145ed8c79"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/07/democrats-trump-infrastructure-deal-climate-change-schumer", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Democrats will only support an infrastructure deal with Donald Trump if it includes measures to combat climate change, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, has warned.\nIn an op-ed in the Washington Post and a letter to Trump, the New York Democrat said that his party \u201cwill have an extraordinary opportunity to force action on climate change\u201d after taking control of the House of Representatives in the recent midterm elections.\nInfrastructure has been viewed as one area \u2013 perhaps the only area \u2013 where Trump and Democrats could strike a deal to advance significant legislation.

And he said a package should fund energy-efficient upgrades to public buildings, and restrict methane emissions from power plants.\nSchumer cited the wildfires that have ravaged California and damaging hurricanes this season as evidence that climate change is an \u201cexistential threat\u201d.\n\u201cClimate change is real, caused by humans, and its impacts are already being felt in communities across the country,\u201d he said. \nIf it does not include at least some of the climate proposals, the minority leader said Trump\u2019s infrastructure bill \u201cshould not count on Democratic support in the Senate\u201d.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usdomesticpolicy", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "description": "Trump seeking $1bn package to upgrade road, rail and bridges but Senator Chuck Schumer issues condition for Democrat support", "date_published": {"$date": 1544201726000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1549986304000}, "authors": ["Erin Durkin"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Democrats", "Donald Trump", "US Congress", "US Senate", "Environment", "US news", "US domestic policy", "US politics"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/07/democrats-trump-infrastructure-deal-climate-change-schumer", "og:description": "Trump seeking $1bn package to upgrade road, rail and bridges but Senator Chuck Schumer issues condition for Democrat support", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93deccf41ced4af0887936b500286320fcccac9d/657_18_2809_1685/master/2809.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=c05f5da7cffce7d20a01d7d92dd0225c", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Any Trump infrastructure deal must tackle climate change, Democrats warn"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93deccf41ced4af0887936b500286320fcccac9d/657_18_2809_1685/master/2809.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2ee58ddf6cbf4ee2e87e3883556e792f", "width": "2809", "height": "1685", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93deccf41ced4af0887936b500286320fcccac9d/657_18_2809_1685/master/2809.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=162c15fd9f2ed16ca806e27318c66f84", "description": "Senator Chuck Schumer wrote to the president, saying: \u2018For too long, Congress has failed to act in a meaningful way to combat the threat posed by climate change.\u2019\nPhotograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07932a2c3613145ed8c7c"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/08/age-lacks-gravitas-brexit-coverage", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "What is a national crisis? Eighty years ago the social researchers Charles Madge and Tom Harrisson decided it was \u201cone of those things, like epidemics and earthquakes, which suddenly arrive to threaten the security of ordinary lives. In the ordinary way, the interest of private people in public events is fitful and vague: at times of crisis it extends and increases.\u201d As the founders of the Mass Observation project in 1937, the first crisis Madge and Harrisson and their hundreds of volunteer diarists had examined was the fallout from the abdication in December 1936 of Edward VIII. But then in September 1938 came Munich, and Neville Chamberlain\u2019s three trips to meet Hitler to avert the outbreak of war. This was a crisis of a different order: the United Kingdom experienced nothing like it again in peacetime until the present post-referendum years of bitter division and anxiety.\nSome of the personal reactions recorded by Mass Observation in 1938 feel remarkably familiar. \u201cIt\u2019s a fucking mess, ain\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cNo one knows what\u2019ll happen.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t understand it properly, but it doesn\u2019t seem too good to me.\u201d In London at the height of the crisis, a 38-year-old woman writes: \u201cWe don\u2019t bother much about it \u2026 not because we are not thinking about it. Life\u2019s too short to keep on with war, war, war.\u201d And another woman adds: \u201cOh, when I see the paper I turn the page over. Suppose it\u2019s because I\u2019m windy \u2026\u201d\nIf we want to see the world differently and, just possibly, avert the collapse, we need different kinds of information\nI catch sight of my own behaviour in these last two reactions: my need to escape what passes for reality by switching off shows such as BBC1\u2019s Question Time, or exchanging Radio 4\u2019s Today programme for music on Radio 3. On Thursday\u2019s edition of Today an unrepentant leave voter in Bedford gave Nick Robinson a biscuit analogy (perhaps inspired by the comedian Peter Kay) in which the UK had behaved like \u201ca soggy rich tea\u201d in its negotiations with the \u201csolid Hobnob\u201d that was the EU. \u201cIf we\u2019d have sent a Hobnob with chocolate on we\u2019d have won,\u201d he said, suggesting Alan Sugar as the best man for the job. All of this was said seriously. He might have been the 40-year-old chauffeur who in 1938, when asked his opinion on what should be done, replied: \u201cKeep out of foreign entanglements, that\u2019s best. Old England\u2019s the best country in the world.\u201d Certain feelings endure.\nWhat has changed is the media\u2019s tone. In 1938, another world war was certainly a more frightening prospect than the national belittlement that faces us now; even so, the coverage of Brexit deserves a register that has gone missing. Gravity may be the word. We have forgotten how to be grave.\nIn 1938, Mass Observation saw its primary purpose as drilling through the patriotic rhetoric of Fleet Street newspapers to the land that Irish poet Louis MacNeice described as \u201cthe kingdom of individuals\u201d. Newspaper editorials spoke confidently and generally. According to the Daily Mail: \u201cThe British nation unreservedly places its complete trust in the prime minister, Mr Neville Chamberlain.\u201d A London evening paper, the Star, began an editorial: \u201cENGLAND SPEAKS. The country remains admirably calm in these hours of deepening crisis \u2026 It is the steady spirit of a nation that has made up its mind and faces the future unafraid.\u201d\nMadge and Harrisson noted that the trouble with this kind of statement wasn\u2019t that it was true or false \u2013 the trouble was the assumption on the newspaper\u2019s part that it didn\u2019t need to find out. \u201cMore subtle,\u201d they wrote, were the statements that appealed to facts without establishing the facts objectively. It was here that the fabulous figure, the Man in the Street, played a key role. According to one writer, the Man in the Street had made up his mind that Hitler was \u201cthe supreme menace to the peace of the world\u201d and until he was \u201cin some way disposed of\u201d nobody could sleep easy. Other Men in the Street backed Chamberlain\u2019s approach and believed it would save Europe from war. Only when Madge and Harrisson did some elementary research did a much more complicated picture emerge of fear, bewilderment, anger, resolve and ignorance, in proportions that changed among the public as the crisis advanced.\nThe writers blamed the British press\u2019s inadequate and almost mendacious coverage of British public opinion on the people they described as \u201cthe Intellectual Few\u201d; editors who rarely met \u201cordinary people\u201d or, when it came to big political questions, encouraged their reporters to discover what they felt. Similar criticism is directed today at the \u201cmetropolitan liberal elite\u201d. In 1938, Mass Observation could differentiate between newspapers committed to foreign and political and news coverage for \u201cthe administrative and professional classes\u201d and the mass-circulation papers for which \u201ca plane crash in Edmonton is front-page news, when a war in Spain is crowded right out of the paper\u201d.\nIn their irreverence and sentimentality, and their interest in celebrity and the sensational, British newspapers and the broadcast media are now much closer to the audiences they pursue. News \u2013 including political news \u2013 has become a kind of entertainment. How many ministers will resign today? Did you see Corbyn mess up again? It may be no less informative, but in the telling a formal style of address has almost vanished, to be heard occasionally and eccentrically in the announcements of royal birthdays that come before the early-morning bulletins. And sometimes formality is desirable, as a way to dignify our grief or apprehension: not for nothing do undertakers wear black.\nThe present crisis will shrink soon enough. Compared with other crises circling in the stack and waiting to land \u2013 species extinction, human population growth, mass migration, resource exhaustion \u2013 Brexit is small stuff, a pointless distraction. But how can news bulletins cope with these things? How should they be ranked? A bearded man carrying a sandwich board \u2013 \u201cThe End is Nigh\u201d \u2013 was once a familiar character in cartoons, but now the joke falls flat. \u201cCollapse of civilisation is on the horizon\u201d was how the Guardian headlined its report of David Attenborough\u2019s speech this week to the UN\u2019s climate summit in Poland. It appeared on the front page, though it was not the lead item.\nIf we want to see the world differently and, just possibly, avert the collapse, we need different kinds of information. What has mattered until now is money. The indices that appear without fail \u2013 fixed on the printed page and changing on the screen \u2013 show the fluctuations of the FTSE 100, the Nikkei, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq and the currency exchange rates. Imagine if instead the same little boxes showed the average global temperature, the extent of Arctic sea ice, the rise in sea level and the parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere. Day by day, the changes would be tiny \u2013 consoling in their minuteness. Comparison with the same set of figures for the same day 20 years before would be needed to show their ominous development.\nThere they would be: sober, factual, grave and rarely consulted; but always warning against the ultimate crisis, like an old-fashioned sermon on hell.\n\u2022 Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/media/newspapers", "https://www.theguardian.com/media/television", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The Brexit coverage has become entertainment \u2013 but there\u2019s something to be said for a sense of formality, says Guardian columnist Ian Jack", "date_published": {"$date": 1544248839000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544294820000}, "authors": ["Ian Jack"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Brexit", "Climate change", "Media", "Newspapers", "Television industry", "European Union", "Politics", "UK news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/08/age-lacks-gravitas-brexit-coverage", "og:description": "The Brexit coverage has become entertainment \u2013 but there\u2019s something to be said for a sense of formality, says Guardian columnist Ian Jack", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c7758caea3996b767f2ce77bc587b5923110ba6/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=c09630d14b332abafbf3625fb6b2d44f", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Our age lacks gravitas.

That\u2019s why we cannot deal with crisis\"\nPowerfully appropriate observation.\nAs the 20th C developed through the darkest pit of depravity, faced unimaginable man-made horror, there were great figures and great minds to plot a course. Lloyd George, Keynes, Churchill, all had weight and reach. Churchill for all the flaws, and there were many (given to psychotic 19th C public school indifference to suffering in the name of national greatness), had a ballast keel purchase in the storm and could always foresee beyond the immediate difficulty (he knew Britain had a 50/50 chance of surviving as an island fortress through aerial ability, and had long read the trumped up dictator's next move as inevitably throwing the Wehrmacht's mighty dice into the mouth of the Russian bear and losing. \nToday there are no great figures to face the impending catastrophe of the Anthropocene. No leadership at all. When was the last time you heard a Churchillian speech about facing the challenge of this millennium? May and Corbyn whittling on about Brexit or austerity, Trump some 1950s claptrap about taking America back to being the workshop of the world, Merkel, well, what? Macron? What? Going back Obama? What? Being nice and fair to all folks? Bush, fighting poor terror groups by smashing them with a \"Hulk smash\" fist? There's nothing that sets the pulse racing, about how we can wake up and become what the Enlightenment once promised, a rational, wise, intelligent species, yes we can listen to physics, cosmology, NASA and the best of the world\u2019s academy, we \u201ccan\u201d make a better world unified by the collective challenge of global survival and create a much better, cleaner world. And why? Fear? The corruption and rot in the media and lobby system? legalized corruption in the West? a moral corruption that means our species is addicted to only incremental change based on a tame and servile leadership? Think of the White House. Someone like Obama who could talk, both he and his wife could write, he always kept his powder dry with incremental change on energy and pollution because he believed the leadership required was beyond him and his round of advisers. So there were no rousing speeches except now then almost off the cuff, because he believed his administration would have been murdered by the corruption in Congress, online and in the media as it was over healthcare. The global infrastructure of political-economic organization simply swamps the best of wills and puts out any flame. \nYet Trump proves that a radical wrecking ball to the system can in part succeed. The only problem is the man is a complete whack job moron who doesn\u2019t even know what millennium he\u2019s in and makes a Mussolini look like a genius. Imagine a Churchill in his place with a huge brain and fire in the belly for creating a new world of smart and clean growth, of forging a global pact to fight the corruption that hinders radical technological and innovative infrastructure change. Pie in the sky? Of course. Times have changed. Until someone really breaks the mould because it\u2019s ready to fracture.

Institutions remain in the grip of pitched battles between different groups with vastly different ideas about what it means to be democratic, socially responsible, progressive, traditional, and so on.\nYou won't find a 'left' you want to be part of unless you find individuals who you're willing to compromise with, and then expand that group until it's a movement.

CIRCA also excluded anyone who were solely focused on environmental issues as well as those who strongly agreed that there was too much government regulation related to environmental protection.\nThe report said environmental issues were important to participants generally and were placed in the top three or top five depending on other concerns, such as whether they saw environment issues as connected to issues such as health and future economic prosperity.\n\u201cThe first thing is people have assumed that the recent plateau in the Greens vote, given the intense dislike of the two major parties and range of issues, means the environment is not an important issue,\u201d Huntley said.\n\u201cHowever it\u2019s more that environment now encapsulates a broader suite of issues and it kicks in for people as to whether government is future focused, whether government can confront issues that are not straightforward and whether government can face the people [and companies] who give them money [political donors] at election times.\u201d\nHer comments come after independent Kerryn Phelps campaigned hard on climate change before winning Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s seat of Wentworth. Daniel Andrews Labor government was returned with an increased majority \u2013 a result which Liberal Senate president Scott Ryan said was a result of the Liberal party straying too far from its moderate \u201celectoral base\u201d in a clear nod to centrist voters.\nTony Abbott also faces a tough campaign in his blue ribbon Liberal seat of Warringah from a range of community groups and activists, who rank environmental issues as high on their agenda.\nAt the same time, the opposition is under pressure from the Labor Environment Action Network (Lean), which has warned the ALP ahead of its December conference that it will not give up on securing a significant overhaul of federal environment laws in the first term of a Shorten government.\nUnprompted, voters mentioned water health, waste and recycling and rapid urbanisation as their top environmental concerns in Huntley\u2019s research. Groups were also asked to rank their top concerns from a list and they nominated climate change and \u201cweak or ineffective laws\u201d over forest logging, threatened species, coal seam gas mining, coal mining and deforestation/tree clearing.\nTopics raised in a general environmental discussion included \u201cclimate change, rubbish in parks and national parks, decreasing wild life, and the impact of both rampant consumerism and rapid urbanisation on the environment\u201d.\n\u201cParticipants reflected on the deterioration of natural areas of personal importance to them over time,\u201d Huntley\u2019s report says.\nParticipants believed \u201cwhile all levels of government needed to play a role (ideally in a collaborative way) the federal government could provide the framework and was best placed to provide incentives for good environmental behaviour\u201d.\nAsked who were the worst environmental offenders, unprompted, participants listed fracking and logging industries, oil and fuel companies, \u201cbig business\u201d, manufacturing, transport and consumerism in general.\nThe CIRCA research found overall, participants believed federal governments had the the ultimate responsibility for protecting the environment.\nParticipants nominated trusted sources of information on the environment as high profile science communicators like David Attenborough, Brian Cox, David Suzuki, Karl Kruszelnicki, Steve and Bindi Irwin and Craig Reucassel\u2019s ABC program, War on Waste. The CSIRO remains the most trusted government body on environmental issues.\nSeparate analysis by the Wilderness Society of the 2016 Australian Electoral Study data by the Australian National University found 23.8% who identified the environment as \u201cextremely important\u201d in how they voted were not always loyal to one party. This equates to around 3.2 million non-loyal environmentally-concerned (NLEC) voters.\nAt the 2016 election, 22% of NLEC voters voted for the Liberal party; 33% for Labor, 2% for the National Party, 23% for the Greens and 19% for other parties or independents.\nThe NLEC 2016 Liberal voters self-identify as centrists in the AES data. When asked to locate the parties on the same left to right spectrum, these voters self-identify as sitting between the Liberal party and the Labor party, well to the right of the Greens.\nThe Wilderness Society\u2019s federal policy director Tim Beshara said the AES data showed Australians across the political spectrum were concerned about both climate change and the natural environment. But there are cohorts of swinging voters who were environmentally concerned and up for grabs.\n\u201cThere are some voters who self-identify as left-leaning and environmentally-concerned, and yet there are also another cohort who self-identify as centrist and environmentally concerned,\u201d Beshara said.\n\u201cThe former cohort is up for grabs over environment issues between Labor and the Greens, but the latter cohort is largely a competition between Labor and the Liberal party.\n\u201cSo, given the shift to the right by the government, this cohort has found themselves more ideologically distant from them and potentially up for grabs over environmental issues. The problem for Labor though is that, rightly or wrongly, most of these voters don\u2019t rate Labor highly on this issue, in the same way that say, they\u2019d rate them on Medicare.\u201d\nHuntley said the AES data analysis by the Wilderness Society reflects the same messages that come up in her focus groups.\nShe said one of the issues that was raised by voters in 2018 was the concern over relying on China to take recycling waste and relying on Tesla founder Elon Musk to solve the power storage problem in South Australia.\n\u201cThere is a weirdly patriotic vein to the views i.e. why are we relying on China?\u201d Huntley said.\n\u201cThere is a satellite of concerns around the environment that tap into a broad level of concerns for everything, which means there is an up-for-grabs voter. A Labor voter might go Green or it may push a conservative to say screw it, I\u2019ll go for an independent.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-greens", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Centrist voters are incrreasingly placing a priority on these issues at a federal level, according to research", "date_published": {"$date": 1544303480000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1551938469123}, "authors": ["Gabrielle Chan"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Australian politics", "Environment", "Labor party", "Coalition", "Australian Greens", "Climate change", "Australia news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/09/next-election-test-of-leadership-on-climate-and-the-environment", "og:description": "Centrist voters are incrreasingly placing a priority on these issues at a federal level, according to research", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cd9d0a3ae130bcd8a2365c35ed1e6fe9da1d808/0_0_5604_3362/master/5604.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=dde91e458e1834f3059096bc05e2e0ea", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Next election test of leadership on climate and the environment"}, "headline": "N", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cd9d0a3ae130bcd8a2365c35ed1e6fe9da1d808/0_0_5604_3362/master/5604.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=720c1dddeed651ccc554c9910d0f3d3e", "width": "5604", "height": "3362", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cd9d0a3ae130bcd8a2365c35ed1e6fe9da1d808/0_0_5604_3362/master/5604.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7be319708210b9ad8b0a67dedc3183bb", "description": "Social researcher Rebecca Huntley says her work shows voters broadly connect environmental issues with capacity for leadership.\nPhotograph: kristianbell/Getty Images/RooM RF"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc0794da2c3613145ed8c84"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/10/largest-ever-group-of-global-investors-call-for-more-action-to-meet-paris-targets", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "The largest ever group of institutional investors has called on governments around the world to urgently increase their efforts to meet the Paris climate change agreement goals.\nThe 414 global investors -

Trouble is, he\u2019s right. Goodwill seems pretty thin on the ground nowadays, wherever you look. Wars and rumours of wars, famine, drought, fires, floods, plagues among the people, pestilence among the beasts, it\u2019s all beginning to sound a tad apocalyptic. An end time has begun, or so it seems.\nEnd time is something on which we elders have authority: reminders of its imminence fill our days. As a life with any future purpose evaporates, dissatisfaction with the present becomes my lingua franca as I acknowledge my redundancy. I become, like Charlie, querulous and fault-finding as I lose touch with the world, its language, its mores, and its business.\nHowever, if I am honest, I am faced with a most inconvenient truth. If social literacy has morphed into narcissism, if civic ethics have been exchanged for consumer loyalty cards, that\u2019s my doing, because today\u2019s world is yesterday\u2019s creation and I am yesterday\u2019s man. I am responsible. But these are minor issues, a form of displacement activity to shield me from acknowledging my contribution to a darker crisis, for which my generation is largely responsible: the human obsession with growth, comfort and convenience that has poisoned the air, contaminated the seas, intoxicated the soil and barbarised its creatures.\nNowhere is our hubris better illustrated than by our describing the crisis as a planetary issue. It isn\u2019t the planet that\u2019s in crisis, simply its top predator. Our fellow inhabitants of Earth are praying for the end of the Anthropocene era \u2013 which is surely better described as the androcene, in recognition of its primary authority.\nWe have been here before. Our species spent 200,000 childhood years refining the social contract as subordinate residents. Then, around 17,000 years ago, we experienced our first episode of global warming when the thaw ended the ice age. It produced the same degree of societal and elemental chaos that will occur this time. We emerged to dominate the globe as tooled-up owner-occupiers. The next stage of our evolution will hopefully empower us as adults to be custodial tenants of our exuberant planet.\nThis is an evolutionary moment and how we address this prospect will be our legacy and that\u2019s where the crumbly perspective may be of use, because I am experiencing on a personal level what our species is facing on a global dimension. When my end comes, my legacy for those who survive me will depend on the manner in which I departed, either as curmudgeonly life-denier or gracious celebrant.

I feel exactly the same way, and am very remorseful about my profligacy. I can say 'I didn't know' when I was a child, but then I had little control over what I consumed. That was not true as I became an adult. I knew that the petrol I burned, the pesticides and herbicides I used were harmful. I didn't know that the plastics I embraced and the carbon from that petrol, were to doom us so quickly, if at all.\nI know better now. There is a great outcry for 'them', 'the government', and some 'others' to do what needs to be done, but I can only think of my personal responsibility now. We can't wait for 'them' for this, or for much else either.\nFor some reason I have been thinking a lot about the landscape of my childhood. The trees, grass, water and animals. I can see that it has changed a great deal, and that my grandchildren will never see what I saw.\nBQSTART\nGoodwill should be my legacy: like a dog, goodwill is for life, not just for Christmas, and I should bow out benevolently. \nBQEND\nGoodwill is a wonderful way to describe what I have thought of as 'mellowing'. I am less judgemental, less critical, and I hope, much kinder than I used to be. Not being caught up in a rat race of exhausting tasks anymore has helped, but perhaps it is a final realisation that we are all in this together.\nI hope that you and the other crumblies have a good Christmas at the centre, that you all have some moments where you feel warm and happy.\nBest wishes to you all.", "recommendation_count": "0", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "123643707", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1544617234000}, "author": "Pagey", "author_id": "1467460", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "I'd rather live in today's world than the one I was born into 50 years ago, where I survived despite the primitive (by today's standards) medical technology available, and the often-dismissive attitudes of the medical profession to an unexpected Disabled baby.

The Catholic Church has urged its followers to multiply for centuries - to have more future contributors to its coffers, no doubt!\nAbout growth itself, the problem is with the type of growth we are obsessed with. The Industrial Revolution shifted power away from monarchs and their territorial conquests to increase revenues and towards manufacturers and manufactured profits. It has been they who have pushed materialism and because it was and still is profitable to them.\nNow they face losing future profits because of contaminating over - production today. It would be in their interest to develop non-material, non-destructive ways of making profits. And there is a way to do this. \nThrough a humanised money supply. When I give informal talks on this I often give the example of an Electorate who greatly value people coming to the end of their lives in the best possible way, as dying is common to us all.\nWhat if this Electorate decide that those who care for dependent people generate both their salary and a profit? This salary plus added-on profit is the new money supply, which could kick start a \"green economy\". The investment of this profit could permit this safe economy to grow and take over a greater share of the overall economy, thereby reducing the dangerous non-green one.\nTalking about this idea of setting up a \"green economy\" in the community cafe could soften the remorse for a life-time of material indulgence through, at last, learning the lesson and being active in not only effectively combating climate change but also humanising the economy with work that turns on the quality of \"us\" rather than the quality, and quantity, of the things we possess.\nThink about it.

He accused central government of \u201cdragging its feet\u201d on dealing with these issues.\n\u201cWe are in the midst of a climate emergency which poses a threat to our health, our planet and our children and grandchildren\u2019s future,\u201d Khan told the Guardian. \u201cCity Hall is doing everything in our power to mitigate the risk in London but the stark reality is that we need urgent government action and funding.\u201d\nThe acknowledgement of the scale and nature of the ecological crisis by the leader of one of the world\u2019s major cities comes amid growing concern about the impact of climate change. A succession of scientific reports have laid bare the scale of the unfolding disaster, including one from the UN that said there were only 12 years left to avert the most extreme consequences of climate breakdown.\nOn Sunday 100 academics, philosophers and authors wrote to the Guardian to back a new civil disobedience group \u2013 Extinction Rebellion \u2013 and called for people around the world to rise up and organise against the \u201cparalysis\u201d of political leaders.\nKhan\u2019s intervention follows that of civic leaders in the UK and around the world. Last month Bristol declared a climate emergency and set a goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2030, while Manchester said it would become \u201ccarbon zero\u201d by 2038. Both are more ambitious than the UK\u2019s national target of an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050. It follows similar moves by several US cities.\nLondon\u2019s existing plan, unveiled by Khan in May, was for the city to be carbon neutral by 2050. But last week the London Assembly passed a motion saying that target should be brought forward to 2030 and called on Khan to draw up \u201ca specific emergency plan\u201d.\nCaroline Russell from the Green party, who proposed the motion, said it was crucial Khan backed a more radical target and called on the government to give him the appropriate powers and funding.\n\u201cCatastrophic climate breakdown might be as little as 12 years away,\u201d she said. \u201cThis would have profound impacts on every aspect of our lives in London from flooding and overheating in summers, disruption in our food supply chains as well as in the wider natural world.\n\u201cThe mayor needs to be at the forefront of this challenge, declaring a climate emergency and an urgent updating of his carbon reduction targets to make London carbon neutral by 2030, decades ahead of his current plans, setting a precedent for other major and world cities.\u201d\nKhan said he had already introduced a series of measures to tackle climate breakdown \u2013 from investing \u00a3500m in low carbon technologies to divesting pension funds from fossil fuels.\nBut he said a City Hall analysis due to be published on Wednesday showed London would need a huge programme of investment as well as new powers to bring forward its zero-carbon target to 2030. The cash would be used to:\n\u2022 Retrofit hundreds of thousands of homes and offices to make them more energy efficient.\n\u2022 Decarbonise the national grid.\n\u2022 Install low-carbon heating systems, such as heat pumps.\n\u2022 Move private and public transport away from diesel and petrol, and towards electric.\nKhan said: \u201cMy message to ministers is clear \u2013 stop dragging your feet and gambling with our future and give London and cities across the UK the real powers and funding needed to protect our future generations.\u201d\nThe Green party welcomed Khan\u2019s move and backed his call for more help from central government. But Russell said there was more that could be done now. \u201cSadiq should start this mission by cancelling the Silvertown road tunnel and fighting harder against things that will make the climate crisis worse.\n\u201cHe should call right now for a halt to climate-wrecking aviation expansion, including at Gatwick, and ask his C40 [global green city network] counterparts to join him.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sadiq-khan", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-offset-projects", "https://www.theguardian.com/society/localgovernment", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Exclusive: Sadiq Khan accuses government of dragging its feet and calls for investment to avert catastrophe", "date_published": {"$date": 1544545649000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544549783000}, "authors": ["Matthew Taylor"], "article_section": "UK news", "article_tags": ["London", "Climate change", "Sadiq Khan", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Carbon offsetting", "Local government", "Environment", "UK news", "Politics", "Society"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/11/london-mayor-sadiq-khan-city-climate-emergency", "og:description": "Exclusive: Sadiq Khan accuses government of dragging its feet and calls for investment to avert catastrophe", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8047be2189164701b4f65a697cc9861b98ba9efd/324_617_2587_1552/master/2587.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=43694ca556c02b1dd46143d195c0b1ab", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "London mayor unveils plan to tackle 'climate emergency'"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8047be2189164701b4f65a697cc9861b98ba9efd/324_617_2587_1552/master/2587.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4f435f9a95060469e33aa68cf69c91ef", "width": "2587", "height": "1552", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8047be2189164701b4f65a697cc9861b98ba9efd/324_617_2587_1552/master/2587.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9bbc729d79b3b5520e252584106fdeed", "description": "Sadiq Khan unveiled the world\u2019s first hydrogen-powered double-decker bus in November 2016.\nPhotograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e2c668d17d87c806a37b3b43ef0039da022b04f/264_481_4664_2799/master/4664.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5a05e3317f31ae1acb0cddf1337a0ab2", "width": "4664", "height": "2799", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e2c668d17d87c806a37b3b43ef0039da022b04f/264_481_4664_2799/master/4664.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a2c422ba21b592c024935367ede908b3", "description": "Justine Simons, London\u2019s deputy mayor, and Michael Bloomberg, the UN\u2019s special envoy for climate action, with part of Olafur Eliasson\u2019s Ice Watch melting glacier artwork on Tuesday.

Katowice is the centre of Poland\u2019s coal industry, and despite hosting a conference that represents the last chance saloon when it comes to taking meaningful action on climate change, local politicians pride themselves on the black stuff. Perhaps we could have expected no different when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change decided on such an inappropriate venue and to allow coal companies to sponsor the talks.\nIf we do make it through climate change with some form of civilisation intact, we will look back at some of the things we are doing now with the moral repugnance we feel towards slavery. There are legitimate parallels here. Climate change will most hurt those yet to be born. Our failure to make the dramatic changes needed to our economy and society means we are behaving as if we own the lives of future generations and have a right to steal their lives from them.\nArt plays a key role in recording contemporary life, but because it is exploratory and imaginative it also invites us to challenge the assumptions we live by. In Katowice there is a counter-exhibition on coal by art students, drawing attention to the \u201cdark side of coal\u201d. Meanwhile the campaign movement Art Not Oil, which has been pushing for an end to oil sponsorship of the arts, ran a parallel protest exhibition alongside the British Museum\u2019s I Object show in opposition to financial backing from BP \u2013 a company that proudly boasts it is one of the most significant corporate investors in UK arts and culture. Performers acted as \u201crebel curators\u201d, presenting objects to the public that represent BP\u2019s complicity in climate breakdown. Just as in Bristol, where the Green lord mayor, Cleo Lake, has banished paintings related to the slave trade from her office, so galleries should shun BP funding.\nMusicians are also challenging corporate sponsorship. Neil Young is due to play a large concert in Hyde Park next summer. Recently he criticised the event\u2019s sponsor, Barclays, declaring the bank a \u201cfossil-fuel-funding entity\u201d. Young said such sponsorship was incompatible with his beliefs about the climate, and that he was seeking to rectify the situation. Yesterday he claimed victory, saying the concert was now proceeding without Barclays as a sponsor.\nOthers need to follow his lead. And perhaps Young and other musicians concerned about climate change will also need to think carefully about the carbon footprint of performing concerts around the globe.\nThere\u2019s also a strong case against continued fossil fuel sponsorship from an economic perspective. The financial sector is rapidly divesting from fossil fuels, realising the smart money is in renewables and the green economy. Since the Paris agreement was adopted in November 2015, the sustainable finance agenda has moved rapidly.\nIn the European parliament I\u2019ve worked on legislation that requires all financial market players to give full information about how customers\u2019 money is invested. Since the EU has committed to phasing out fossil fuels by 2050, any pensions for people aged under 40 that contain assets based on fossil fuels could be claimed to have been mis-sold. So decisions not to throw money at fossil fuels are increasingly looking hard-headed and rational rather than purely moral.\nThere\u2019s also a growing divestment movement, and universities and colleges have been at the forefront. Almost half of UK universities have made divestment commitments. Students and academics of the arts can play a vital role in pushing this agenda, again using their talents to do this in creative ways.\nNo matter how much they are struggling for cash, galleries and arts promoters should be made to feel too ashamed to take money from the industries that are leading us to climate breakdown.

We are also seeing higher temperatures of heatwaves. The kind of thing we saw this year will happen more often.\n\u201cThe risks are compounding all the time. It stands to reason that the sooner we can take action, the quicker we can rein them in.\u201d\nHis views were echoed by Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, a professor of theoretical physics and founder of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. He said his recent Hothouse Earth report , which was one of the most widely quoted and downloaded studies of this year, had helped to change the language used to describe the climate crisis.\n\u201cGlobal warming doesn\u2019t capture the scale of destruction. Speaking of hothouse Earth is legitimate,\u201d he said.\nThe scientists expressed frustration at the slow pace of action by political leaders. In signing the 2015 Paris agreement, governments around the world aimed to keep global warming to within 1.5C to 2C above pre-industrial levels. But current commitments are far off track.\nThe Met Office upgraded its forecasts this week to show the planet is on track to warm by between 2.5C and 4.5C. \u201cWe have broadened out the range of possibilities,\u201d said Betts, who is conducting a risk assessment based on the new projections. In the UK, he said the trend was towards wetter winters with more floods, hotter summers with more droughts interspersed with increasingly intense rain.\nAt 3C of change, Schellnhuber said southern Spain would become part of the Sahara. Even 2C, he said, could not be guaranteed as safe.\nThe Paris pact was a firewall, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not helping us to keep the world as it is now. We\u2019ve lost this opportunity already. It\u2019s a firewall against climate chaos.\u201d\nJohan Rockstr\u00f6m, executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, said \u201ccracks\u201d were starting to appear in the climate system that were pushing nature from being a friend that absorbs carbon dioxide to an enemy that releases carbon dioxide. These concerns are fuelled by the growing intensity of forest fires, the effect of melting ice-sheets on the jet stream, and the rising risk of permafrost thaw, which would release trapped methane.\nAlthough he stressed it might not yet have passed a tipping point, he said the warnings were getting louder. \u201cThis shift from friend to foe is no doubt a scientific nightmare. That is the biggest worry that we have,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does terrify me. The only reason we sit here without being completely depressed is that we see we have policy measures and technology to move in the right direction.\n\u201cWe need to have a diagnosis just like a patient who comes to a doctor and gets a really bad diagnosis. But if the science is right, the technology is right, and the policy is right you can cure that very dire situation. There is no scientific suggestion that the door is shut.\u201d\nThis week\u2019s climate talks have crept forward with only small progress towards a new global rulebook, but emissions continue to rise and the planet continues to heat.\n\u201cThings are obviously proceeding very slowly,\u201d said Betts. \u201cAs a scientist, it\u2019s frustrating to see we\u2019re still at the point when temperatures are going up and emissions are going up. I\u2019ve been in this for 25 years. I hoped we\u2019d be beyond here by now.\u201d\nSchellnhuber concurred. \u201cI\u2019ve worked on this for 30 years and I\u2019ve never been as worried as I am today.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/uk/met-office", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/global-climate-talks", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "UK Met Office professor tells UN summit Earth\u2019s \u2018energy balance\u2019 is changing", "date_published": {"$date": 1544701738000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1545068551000}, "authors": ["Jonathan Watts"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "Met Office", "UK news", "Paris climate agreement", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "COP 21: UN climate change conference | Paris", "Global climate talks", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/13/global-heating-more-accurate-to-describe-risks-to-planet-says-key-scientist", "og:description": "UK Met Office professor tells UN summit Earth\u2019s \u2018energy balance\u2019 is changing", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4ff0f942c6f881cef31149f615bab1e2d2ab209/69_67_3867_2320/master/3867.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=88f56cd1b674b59b4483f0737f7c6b0c", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Global warming should be called global heating, says key scientist"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4ff0f942c6f881cef31149f615bab1e2d2ab209/69_67_3867_2320/master/3867.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ba04551ec1f691b6c90a2de50dc98963", "width": "3867", "height": "2320", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4ff0f942c6f881cef31149f615bab1e2d2ab209/69_67_3867_2320/master/3867.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=35c7198d1f578debab6f0f3246430649", "description": "The river Kennet near Marlborough.

Australia now imports over 1 million cars at a cost of US $29.4 b as well as $4.4b in spare parts which could have been made locally. Much the same applies for white goods, furniture, timber, tiles, electrical and electronic components required for the 220,000 houses we build every year. We are also importing far more food and a report from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) included the fact that our food imports have increased from $4 billion to $14 billion while food exports only increased from $21 billion to $37 billion over the period from 1990 to 2016. Imports of all types are growing along with population growth and increased consumerism but food imports are growing much faster than exports because of free trade agreements and government failure to protect farmers from cheap imports. There is also a marked decrease in our capacity to grow food particularly the fruit and vegetables that used to be grown on cities fringes but which have now been swallowed by urban sprawl. This suggest that not only are we at heading towards a loss of food self sufficiency but we are at risk from lower quality or contaminated foods as has occurred with berries, honey, olive oil, and orange juice.>> But herein lies the rub. To match these imports we must have equal or higher exports. In December 2017 there was a trade deficit which became a surplus of $0.98b in April this year and then $1.7b in June. But; Minerals and fuels now account for 45.5% of our exports. Food (grains, meat & primary products) are only 13.9% with manufacturing down to 11.8% (and shedding 122,400 jobs in a decade). The service sector contributed 21.9% most of which is education related and reliant on O/S students. Australia has thus been deliberately diverted into an economy with a high demand for imported goods with limited employment opportunities and sources of exports based mainly on resources, in other words, a quarry for the world. We have very few options, food production is unlikely to be expanded and may well shrink due to climate changes, manufacturing has been run down too far to rescue in the short term and the service industries face a problem as our education qualifications are declining. No politician could ever win an election with a promise of reinstalling tariffs, cutting back on consumerism or abandoning growth economics. Instead we will plod on because of the economists obsession with GDP growth - one will require not only continue with these practices but to increase them every year. The Adani mine will be allowed to proceed and this will be followed by more from mining magnate Genia Rinehart and Clive Palmer right until rising temperatures make mere survival more important than economic issues.>>", "recommendation_count": "1", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "free trade agreements and government failure to protect farmers from cheap imports", "effect": "are growing much faster than exports"}, {"cause": "climate changes", "effect": "may well shrink"}, {"cause": "the economists obsession with gdp growth", "effect": "instead we will plod on require"}]}, {"id": "123789164", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1544915672000}, "author": "Loanwolf1", "author_id": "17732359", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "The facts of life are Tories and Labour over 200 MPs each Green Party 1 MP.Its only the fanatics in the Green Party who are obsessed by Climate change,Global warning or Global heating.The bottom line is it\u2019s too expensive to do anything significant-nobody but the Green Party fanatics would ever give up the driving a car to \u2018save the plant\u2019MPs just regard climate change as an opportunity to virtue signal.In any event if we end up with a climate like Spain so what we will be Ok.", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "123762738", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "123788841", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1544914911000}, "author": "Loanwolf1", "author_id": "17732359", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Do you drive a car.", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "123779837", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "123786453", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1544910186000}, "author": "matt0931", "author_id": "17904992", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "No more \u2018proof\u2019 is required.\nThe science showing the effects of man made climate change is clear. \nIt\u2019s just people with capitalist/extreme religious/ right wing ideologies that refuse to listen or admit to the bleeding obvious", "recommendation_count": "3", "in_reply_to": "123696764", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "123779837", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1544898317000}, "author": "Barbearian", "author_id": "2134650", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Amazing to think that the fossil fuel and car industries are already guilty of genocide. \nHow many men, women and children have died as a result of breathing the poisonous gasses emitted by vehicles in cities around the world?

Genocide is not just a matter for the ICC. The Genocide Convention is now considered to be part of customary international law as well as conventional law. It applies to all actors and must be prosecuted by all states. However, genocide as presently understood would not cover failure to act over climate change. The Rome Statute of the ICC is widely regarded as codifying customary international law [but with exceptions]. \nGenocide does not require \u2018killing\u2019 as such. It may be committed by those \u2018causing death\u2019 and those aiding and abetting such death. It may also be committed by those \u2018causing serious bodily or mental harm\u2019 and those \u2018deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction\u2019 but in all these cases genocide requires an intention \u2018to destroy, in whole or in part, that national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such\u2019. [I shorten the description to assist in making a comment as short as possible.]\nSome crimes against humanity might involve environmental destruction if committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack. An example might be deliberate large-scale deforestation. In wartime, environmental destruction, deliberate or reckless, could be a crime.\nIn 2016, the ICC announced it was prioritising crimes that result in the \u201cdestruction of the environment\u201d, \u201cexploitation of natural resources\u201d and the \u201cillegal dispossession\u201d of land.As the law presently stands, in my view doing nothing about or even encouraging global temperature increases would not be actionable as international crimes. \nHowever, [and this is a big \u2018however\u2019] there are several hundred environmental civil cases covering a wide range of claim types presently before the courts. AND, international law is always slowly changing. Much depends on the ingenuity of lawyers and judges in making arguments based on national law and international as well as national versions of human rights. \nI would expect that somewhat late in the day for the planet, an international crime will be articulated that encompasses actions aggravating climate change. \nSorry for the length of the comment but it is difficult to compress such a large topic.", "recommendation_count": "3", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "that", "effect": "the \u201c destruction of the environment"}]}, {"id": "123725855", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1544772751000}, "author": "Drfish", "author_id": "17210000", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "I am disgusted with Australia's cop out, supporting the USA coal lobby and claiming, wrongly, that they have already met their requirements.

The sponsors include JSW, the EU\u2019s largest coking coal producer, and PGE, which runs the world\u2019s second-largest fossil-fuel power plant.\nIf that were not enough, the summit host, President Andrzej Duda, opened the summit with a boast that his country was sitting on 200 years\u2019 worth of coal supplies and \u201cit will be hard not to use them\u201d. To underscore that intention, PGG, the state-owned thermal coal producer, announced plans during the summit for a new $400m (\u00a3320m) shaft at Imielin, 12 miles from Katowice.\nYet for all of this, the single clearest fact that has emerged from this conference is that the world must break from this dirtiest of carbon fuels if we are to have any chance of avoiding dangerous levels of climate disruption.\n\u201cWe are seeing a coal renaissance. This is disastrous,\u201d said Ottmar Edenhofer, the deputy director at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. \u201cWe are really at risk. It is not enough to pray. We have to do something.\u201d\nIt is not just Poland. Coal is on the rise in Japan, Indonesia, India, Vietnam and Russia. In China, the world\u2019s biggest producer, output has increased after several years of declines.\nPlanned new coal investments in the world would add 330 gigatonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere, Edenhofer said. Added to existing infrastructure, this would use up all of the world\u2019s remaining carbon budget under the Paris agreement. \u201cIf we continue with these investments we close the door to 2C,\u201d he said, referring to the world\u2019s least ambitious climate target.\nBut there are signs of change. Campaigners are accelerating efforts to halt expansion plans \u2013 which lock in consumption for decades \u2013 and gradually replace existing collieries with alternative green energies, such as wind and solar.\nThis is even happening in the host country. This week, 17 Polish cities joined a zero-carbon coalition. A proposal to phase out coal by 2030 has the support of 69% of Poles, according to a survey last month by Greenpeace.\nThere is also increasing awareness about the true costs of coal, which have long been off the books. Thirty-six of the 50 most polluted cities in the EU are in Poland, mostly in the Silesian region, where visitors can smell the sulphur in the air as they arrive at the airport. Numerous studies have shown the dire health impacts, including an estimated 47,500 premature deaths. This has promoted a growing anti-smog movement.\nClimate impacts are also becoming more apparent. Poland suffered heatwaves and droughts this year that reduced harvests and impeded the country\u2019s ability to feed itself.\nWith the cost of coal likely to rise, Poland is investing heavily in renewables. Wind power, in particular, has risen sharply in the past two decades. The old jobs are now less attractive.\n\u201cIn the socialist era, the coalminer was a working-class hero, but young people don\u2019t want to work in the mines. The pay is not so good compared with jobs in other EU countries,\u201d said Irma Allen, an anthropologist writing a PhD on coal communities at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. \u201cLife with coal is now radically different than it was 20 to 30 years ago The costs now outweigh the benefits.\u201d\nEasing the pain of transition is a vital political task, say campaigners. Many pits were closed in the 1990s, destroying communities and leaving some laid-off miners\u2019 families so poor they have to scavenge for coal to heat their homes. Pessimism is rife. Miners are not intrinsically anti-environment, says Allen, but their futures are insecure.\n\u201cIf people were offered an alternative vision of what the region could be, they might be more hopeful,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they saw what happened with Thatcher in Britain in the 1980s and fear the same will happen here.\u201d\nKatowice has partly filled the gap by reinventing itself as a cultural centre, conference hub and university city, but the pushback has been fierce from the left and right of the old economy. The Solidarity union, which represents tens of thousands of Polish miners, has joined with the rightwing US lobby group, the Heartland Institute to dispute the science of climate change.\nThe conservative Duda claims coal is Poland\u2019s gift from God and made keeping pits open a question of national sovereignty.\n\u201cThis plays to the ultra-nationalist discourse in Poland and elsewhere, but it\u2019s hypocritical,\u201d said Ido Liven, of the CEE Bankwatch Network, one of the biggest environmental groups in eastern Europe. \u201cThe Polish president talks about coal as a national treasure yet imports are increasing. Close to 60% of imported coal is from Russia.\u201d\nPoliticians who have tried to introduce changes are struggling, says Mateusz Klinowski, the former mayor of Wadowice, the birthplace of Pope John Paul II. He lost office in an election this year after trying to cut pollution and wean the city off coal.\n\u201cI thought it was enough to build support from the bottom up; to show the facts on health, to talk about pollution, about the morality of change, but it didn\u2019t work. It\u2019s because people are told on TV that coal is a treasure,\u201d said Klinowski.\n\u201cBut even if I tell them the planet is dying and I will give them 50% of the the cost of a new heating system, they think it\u2019s just green bullshit and not necessary. We need to change the state government and do it at the top level.\u201d\nThe economics are moving in a different direction from the politics. The World Bank and other large international finance institutions are withdrawing from coal investments. Insurance companies are also pulling out.\nPoland\u2019s neighbours \u2013 Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic \u2013 have taken strides to cut coal subsidies and bring forward a phase-out date. Elsewhere in the world, there are strong signs the coal renaissance is winding down.\nThe UK has rapidly switched from coal to renewables with the help of a carbon tax on power supplies. Despite Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric, coal is plunging in the US. Germany, the biggest coal user in Europe, will conduct a review of its dependency next year that is expected to prompt a radical shift in policy. India is also building so much solar that some believe it may never need to commission another coal plant.\nThese moves prove the renaissance of coal can be stifled, say academics, businessmen and campaigners, but it needs to be done more quickly \u2013 and the main obstacle is at the top.\nAdair Turner, of the Just Transition Partnership, said it was possible to build a zero-carbon economy by 2060 at a cost of just half a percent of GDP. \u201cWith the technology and the economy I am more confident than I was three years ago, but I\u2019m now less confident about the politics,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get there, it will be because of special interests.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/poland", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/global-climate-talks", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Climate experts say the renaissance can be stopped but change must happen now \u2013 and the main obstacle is at the top", "date_published": {"$date": 1544793697000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544809503000}, "authors": ["Jonathan Watts"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Poland", "Paris climate agreement", "COP 21: UN climate change conference | Paris", "Europe", "Environment", "Global climate talks", "World news", "Coal", "Air pollution", "Energy", "Fossil fuels"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/14/poland-wean-coal-climate", "og:description": "Climate experts say the renaissance can be stopped but change must happen now \u2013 and the main obstacle is at the top", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/140ad3304c1ce98daeda88275eef19175535c1fe/0_59_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=9ec347af723b98ec938575675add86e6", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Can Poland wean itself off coal?"}, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/140ad3304c1ce98daeda88275eef19175535c1fe/0_59_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ea64e7bc32a9db568431f8e20d5b5b00", "width": "3500", "height": "2100", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/140ad3304c1ce98daeda88275eef19175535c1fe/0_59_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=29d528be81897472497527a13e88e351", "description": "Smoke and steam billow from Be\u0142chat\u00f3w power station in Poland, Europe\u2019s largest coal-fired plant.\nPhotograph: Kacper Pempel/Reuters"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ab88b0266556cb7d5fc4164794143ff50ba99a6/0_0_5238_3492/master/5238.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=10ceda1ce276c0f7537f7576617952ac", "width": "5238", "height": "3492", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ab88b0266556cb7d5fc4164794143ff50ba99a6/0_0_5238_3492/master/5238.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e1f38ecd575cd44ff9675f9602e3f895", "description": "A protester outside the climate conference in Katowice.

Your photograph showed a Christmas tree plantation on heather moorland, which proves my point. Heathland, one of the UKs priority habitats and home to many iconic species, has declined by as much as 90% over the last 200 years.\nThe insecticides sprayed on most Christmas trees against leaf-damaging aphids are washed into watercourses, where they not only contaminate potential drinking water but poison invertebrates in streams and rivers. Residues of these chemicals will later pollute the internal environment of the home, along with the antifreeze sprayed on the trees so they retain their leaves.\nMany of the trees grown in Shropshire and surrounding counties are transported to London for sale so that a large carbon footprint is added to the already burgeoning environmental cost.\nDue to these pollution and habitat issues we have in Shropshire and elsewhere, I welcomed the news that this is the year of the artificial Christmas tree. Plastic trees are not really the answer, though. The suggestion for growing your own tree in a pot is by far the best choice and, failing that, decoration of a collection of branches from any tree can be a stunning alternative.Fiona GomersallEcologist, Shropshire\n\u2022 The uncomfortable truth about the climate talks taking place in Poland is what isn\u2019t being discussed (\u2018We\u2019re running out of time\u2019: UN chief\u2019s dash to climate summit, 13 December). A new report about paying our fair share of the climate change debt compares the amount of money and effort going into combating the problem to the quantity of greenhouse gas pollution each country emits now and historically, and the ability of countries and people to respond. Something important is being side-lined, though: richer nations must cough up more.\nAsking poorer countries to pay for problems that they didn\u2019t cause \u2013 and that they are now bearing the brunt of \u2013 means climate breakdown is disproportionately affecting those who are the least responsible. After all, the poorest half of the world receives less than one tenth of the total global income, and generates virtually no emissions.\nUntil countries pay their fair share, we will fail to contain global temperature rises. We still have time \u2013 just \u2013 to reverse the worst effects of climate chaos. Now that we know that the cost of ignoring the problem is literally species-ending, isn\u2019t it time to pay up, and do it fairly?Rachel KennerleyClimate campaigner, Friends of the Earth\n\u2022 The 100 academics and others who signed the letter (10 December) about the all too real danger of an \u201cenvironmental catastrophe\u201d are undoubtedly erudite. But, apparently, they cannot see the significance of human numbers in the crisis. Thus their letter completely ignores population growth. This year, the human impact on the planet will be further aggravated by the addition of some 83 million to the rightly named human race. Sir David Attenborough has been much criticised in some circles for his \u201csoftly softly\u201d approach. But at least he had the insight and courage to state unequivocally that \u201call our environmental problems become easier to solve with fewer people, and harder \u2013 and ultimately impossible \u2013 to solve with ever more people.\u201d Some 42% of all births are estimated to be unwanted: that would be a good place to start. It would not only reduce unsustainable pressure on environmental systems but also create better lives for many women.Sandy IrvineNewcastle Green party\n\u2022 At the end of his opinion piece (Our era lacks gravitas. That\u2019s why we cannot deal with crisis, 8 December), Ian Jack identified our problem as being obsessed with money when it should be temperature or some other parameter of global warming. We can make a start on this in a painless and cost-free manner. We simply have to replace VAT with CAT, carbon-added tax. Activities are taxed according to the incremental amount of carbon they add to the atmosphere. Since most of this will come from the use of fossil fuels, it will actually be relatively easy to keep track of. Support this idea here. The rate of CAT can be sent so that the money take for the government is equal to that of VAT but it will reward those who purchase goods and engage in activities with a low carbon footprint.John HobsonDevizes, Wiltshire\n\u2022 Ian Jack is right to be asking for the media to provide information about climate change, but wrong to say that comparisons with 20 years before would be necessary. In the case of parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere, the safe level is said to be around 350 parts per million (ppm) and the current measure is 400ppm. The weather forecasts in print should simply place the seasonally adjusted measure of ppm of carbon next to the required level. On television, viewers could watch the carbon counter from the monitoring station at Mauna Loa moving in the wrong direction in real time.Daniel ScharfAbingdon, Oxfordshire\n\u2022 I read with interest Professor Henrietta Moore\u2019s article (In the face of climate change, ranking states by prosperity invites disaster,theguardian.com, 5 December). We welcome her observations that \u201cthere\u2019s much to be commended in assessing the impact of healthcare, education, the rule of law and personal and media freedom\u201d, and that the places at the top of rankings \u201care better than most at providing foundations for a good life for the majority of fortunate inhabitants\u201d. Professor Moore is also correct in observing that \u201cwhen it comes to building sustainable prosperity from which everyone can benefit in the future, we are all \u2018developing countries\u2019\u201d.\nHowever, we do not share the belief that ranking nations by prosperity invites disaster. The high correlation between GDP and aspects of governance, freedom, social capital, education, health and the quality of the natural environment can hardly be regarded as \u201cuncomfortable\u201d. It is the very quality of these that enables wealth generation. How resource-intensive such economic activity can and should be is a very important question, but should not be presumed to come at the expense of either institutional quality or social wellbeing.\nIt is important to celebrate that wellbeing has increased around the world. More children are educated than ever before, more people have a choice about their future, fewer people are impoverished. These are huge gains, which we need to recognise and understand how to sustain. Given the purpose of sustainability is to enhance the lived experience of future generations, we should not reject measuring that very experience for the current generation.Dr Stephen BrienDirector of policy, The Legatum Institute\n\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

To outsiders, UN climate talks may seem like a positive step. Unfortunately, this is COP24.\nFor 24 years, world leaders have annually talked at each other instead of to one another in hopes of reaching an agreement on how to mitigate the climate crisis. In all that time, they have barely scratched the surface of an issue that the world\u2019s top climate scientists say we now have 12 years to stop \u2013 and that is an optimistic estimate.\nThere\u2019s an urgency in my heart being here in Katowice, knowing that this negotiation process is supposed to protect my generation and ones thereafter. I am afraid of the lack of accountability in the space, knowing that the people with power will be patted on the back for simply coming together without making meaningful policy commitments.\nWhen the news stories come out about successful negotiations, we forget about when leaders pushed to leave \u201chuman rights\u201d out of policy wording, or stood on the floor advocating for fossil fuels as a solution (hint: they\u2019re not), all to placate to their own interest in power and maintaining it. They are voluntarily blind to the suffering their decisions cause. Homes will be lost, families will be torn apart by displacement and at borders, and the sea will encroach upon whole societies, exterminating cultures and livelihoods. Developed countries like the US, corrupted by fossil fuel interests, are to blame.\nUN negotiators have been trying to solve the climate crisis since before I was born. When will global leaders admit that this is a broken and dysfunctional charade instead of burying the reality under false solutions and jargon? What will be the catalyst for people in power to do what is right? Do millions of people have to be displaced? Do we have to be stealing a livable planet from people not even born yet? How many millions of people will have to die from climate damage such as drought, famine, superstorms and wildfires before world leaders commit to implementing real solutions to defeat this crisis?\nI\u2019ve been doing this work for five years and have given up a lot to do the things I know are right. I\u2019ve given up personal finances, friendships, a normal adolescence and more to get up on the global stage. I\u2019ve taken breaks from school, failed a few classes.\nYouth activists everywhere make personal sacrifices every day in order to protect the world we\u2019ll inherit and our governments can\u2019t do the same for us. The institutions meant to protect me don\u2019t seem to care as much as I do and it\u2019s a burden I carry everyday.\nI watch my government and governments around the world trade my future for profit. A future my mother fought hard to secure through sacrifice, when she made the journey to immigrate to the United States. There\u2019s a lot of anger and depression inside of me because of this, but I found happiness and reward in seeing the solutions, power and love in the climate movement.\nThough political institutions have fallen short, being on the ground here does offer hope: it proves the strength of people power. Politicians will never be the core of this movement. We need to highlight and uplift genuine grassroots movements that properly address the lived experiences of the people they protect. We need to turn our attention and our energy into communities that are helping themselves in the best ways that they can.\nThe marginalized communities on the frontlines know what it actually means to sacrifice in order to uphold future generations and young people. They understand giving up their own comforts to protect lives.\nWe have called on our political leaders to demonstrate a similar understanding. But resilience can\u2019t be taught, and it doesn\u2019t come from a president, minister or monarch: it comes from the adversity you have faced. This is why, to fight the powers that hand away pieces of our environment for profit, we must enlist the people who have lived on the margins of society. People power will always be stronger than the people in power.\nVictoria Barrett is one of the 21 plaintiffs, aged 10 to 21, in the high-profile Juliana v the United States lawsuit, which faulted the US government for failing to protect its citizens from climate change.

But difficult questions such as how to scale up existing commitments on cutting emissions, in line with stark scientific advice, and how to provide finance for poor countries to do the same, were put off for future years.\nIn the final hours, agreement was held up by a debate over the market in carbon credits, awarded to countries for their emissions-cutting efforts and for their carbon sinks, such as forests, which absorb carbon dioxide.\nBrazil wanted an amendment that would benefit the country for its large rainforest cover, but this was opposed by others as it could allow the double-counting of carbon credits, undermining the integrity of the system.\nThis question has now been pushed back to next year\u2019s annual conference. Brazil\u2019s stance, however, under incoming president Jair Bolsonaro, who also rescinded the country\u2019s offer to host next year\u2019s talks, presages troubles to come.\nBrazil has been a reliable supporter of the annual talks in the past, and has worked to broker deals between the developed and developing world. Without that support in future, the talks are only likely to grow more fractious.\nEven when Brazil\u2019s carbon-credits issue was postponed, a further obstacle was opened up by Turkey, which wants to be counted as a developing country rather than a developed one. Weary delegates finally filed into the closing session at nearly 10pm to hail the compromise agreement.\nDespite these hitches, the two-week conference \u2013 the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP24 \u2013 finally ended in clarity, at least on some of the key building blocks for putting the Paris agreement into action.\nDavid Waskow, of the World Resources Institute, said the final deal was \u201ca good foundation for countries to go about implementing the Paris agreement\u201d. He added: \u201cIt sets the direction of travel and will spur countries to take action. Now countries need to go home and do their homework, by increasing their commitments [on emissions].\u201d\nBut the key question of whether countries are doing enough to cut their emissions, in the light of the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report that predicted dire consequences if temperatures were allowed to rise more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, was left out.\nThe IPCC\u2019s report in October showed that the world must change course drastically in the next decade to avoid the consequences of a 1.5C rise, including the die-off of coral reefs, droughts and floods, and a decline in agricultural productivity over many areas.\nThis year has seen extreme weather across many parts of the globe, and the fourth highest global average temperatures on record, while the IPCC warning is the starkest yet to come from scientists.\nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, praised countries for coming to an agreement, but demanded more. \u201cThe approval of the Paris agreement work programme is the basis for a transformative process which will require strengthened ambition from the international community,\u201d he said.\n\u201cScience has clearly shown that we need enhanced ambition to defeat climate change. From now on, my five priorities will be: ambition, ambition, ambition, ambition and ambition.\u201d He cited the need for countries to toughen their emissions-cutting targets and to adapt their infrastructure to cope with the effects of climate change.\nJennifer Morgan of Greenpeace said: \u201cA year of climate disasters and a dire warning from the world\u2019s top scientists should have led to so much more. Instead, governments let people down again as they ignored the science and the plight of the vulnerable.\n\u201cWithout immediate action, even the strongest rules will not get us anywhere. People expected action, and that is what governments did not deliver.

This includes how governments will measure, report on and verify their emissions-cutting efforts, a key element because it ensures all countries are held to proper standards and will find it harder to wriggle out of their commitments.\nThere was a row over carbon credits, which are awarded to countries for their emissions-cutting efforts and their carbon sinks, such as forests, which absorb carbon. These credits count towards countries\u2019 emissions-cutting targets. Brazil, which hopes to benefit from its large rainforest cover, insisted on a new form of wording that critics said would allow double counting of credits, undermining the integrity of the system. This issue has been put off until next year.\nLargely absent from these talks, which had a technical focus, was the key question of how countries will step up their targets on cutting emissions. On current targets, the world is set for 3C of warming from pre-industrial levels, which scientists say would be disastrous, resulting in droughts, floods, sea level rises and the decline of agricultural productivity.\nThe key deadline is 2020, when countries must show they have met targets set a decade ago for cutting their emissions, and when they must affirm new, much tougher targets.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global body of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists, warned two months ago that allowing warming to reach 1.5C above pre-industrial levels would have grave consequences, including the die-off of coral reefs and devastation of many species.\nIf we extrapolate from the IPCC\u2019s findings, the world has little more than a decade to bring emissions under control and halve them, which would help to stabilise the climate.\nAfter years in which the world\u2019s carbon emissions appeared to be stabilising, they are on the rise again. Coal use continues and oil is still the engine of much of the world\u2019s economy. Clean energy is coming on-stream at a faster rate than many predicted, and the costs of it have come down rapidly, but its adoption needs to be speeded up.\nInfrastructure, such as energy generation plants, transport networks and buildings, is a central issue: infrastructure built now to rely on high-carbon energy effectively locks in high emissions for decades to come. Some people are also saying we need to invest in projects to remove carbon from the atmosphere, and a new focus of the talks is helping countries to adapt to the effects of climate change.\nThe US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait joined forces to prevent the conference fully embracing the IPCC\u2019s findings, watering down a statement to a weak commendation of the timing of the scientists\u2019 report. Australia joined with the US in a celebration of coal, and Brazil signalled its climate scepticism under Jair Bolsonaro by withdrawing its offer to host next year\u2019s talks.\nBut the EU, a handful of other developed countries and scores of developing nations including the poorest and most vulnerable affirmed that they would strive to meet the IPCC\u2019s advice on limiting warming to no more than 1.5C.\nThe UN will meet again next year in Chile to thrash out the final elements of the Paris rulebook and begin work on future emissions targets. But the crunch conference will come in 2020, when countries must meet the deadline for their current emissions commitments and produce new targets for 2030 and beyond that go further towards meeting scientific advice.\nThat conference may be held in the UK or Italy, both of which have bid to be hosts. The UK\u2019s intention in offering to host is to signal it will retain its role on the world stage after Brexit. The event may also provide a welcome change from wranglings over Brexit and intractable trade deals. But whoever hosts will have a diplomatic mountain to climb, if the fractious nature of this year\u2019s talks is anything to go by.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-offset-projects", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ethical-living", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/explainers"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Fractious UN climate change talks ended with a deal on putting the Paris agreement into practice \u2013 but much else left unresolved", "date_published": {"$date": 1544961846000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544983200000}, "authors": ["Fiona Harvey"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Paris climate agreement", "Carbon offsetting", "United Nations", "Ethical and green living", "World news", "Brazil", "Americas", "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)", "Global climate talks", "COP 21: UN climate change conference | Paris", "Carbon capture and storage (CCS)", "Energy"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/16/what-was-agreed-at-cop24-in-poland-and-why-did-it-take-so-long", "og:description": "Fractious UN climate change talks ended with a deal on putting the Paris agreement into practice \u2013 but much else left unresolved", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7a40698a153e0c5d40c3dd88fe4c9d9eab887d/0_47_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=3231b059f1a77e8a10cb7c84cfd753cb", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "What was agreed at COP24 in Poland and why did it take so long?"}, "headline": "O", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7a40698a153e0c5d40c3dd88fe4c9d9eab887d/0_47_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=776b316d4d9bc6ea145d5d6196c639cb", "width": "3500", "height": "2100", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7a40698a153e0c5d40c3dd88fe4c9d9eab887d/0_47_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b48aa86488cbf4eb74731a6ea43a3deb", "description": "Iran\u2019s Majid Shafiepour Motlagh, China\u2019s Xie Zhenhua and the COP24 president, Michal Kurtyka, smile after adopting the final agreement at the COP24 UN climate change conference 2018 in Katowice, Poland.\nPhotograph: Kacper Pempel/Reuters"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc079b8a2c3613145ed8cb1"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/dec/17/blackcurrant-crops-hit-by-milder-winters-study-shows", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Milder winters driven by climate change will hit blackcurrant crops, with plants producing fewer and lower quality fruit, according to a new study.\nLike many other fruit and woody plants, blackcurrants need a period of chilling before they start to grow in spring. This reduces the risk of frost damage to new buds and makes sure they burst rapidly in the spring and flower together when there are plenty of pollinators such as bees around.\nBut researchers at the James Hutton Institute said warmer winters can cause the plants to flower later in the year, produce fewer fruit and, over a number of years, reduce the lifespan of the plant.\nAnd they warned that although blackcurrants were particularly sensitive to changes, other fruit such as blueberries, cherries, apples and plums would be at risk as temperatures rose.\nKatharine Preedy from Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland said: \u201cBlackcurrants are like the canary in the mine.

It also reflected the harder miles and tougher battles to come over the next two years if the planet is to remain habitable.\nScientist after scientist told the conference that the decisions made by 2020 will determine whether global heating can be kept to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, after which the already apparent dangers of climate instability become far worse.\nThe toughest decisions, however, were pushed into the future, to a special climate summit next September called by the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, and the next two COP conferences \u2013 in Chile in December 2019, and then to the country chosen to host in 2020.\nKatowice showed that the multilateral system of global decision-making is still alive, but under growing threat from fossil fuel interests and the nationalist politicians they fund.\nDecision-making at the UN is painstakingly difficult at the best of times, because it requires a consensus among 195 nations. In Poland, 14,000 delegates took two weeks to debate the latest science and proposed policy instruments as they whittled down more than 2,800 areas of disagreement.\nThe result was a new global rulebook on emissions that requires nations to report every two years on their progress towardParis agreement commitments to keep temperature rises to between 1.5C and 2C.\nSeveral past obstacles were overcome. China accepted standards on transparency, and richer nations \u2013 particularly Germany and Norway \u2013 put their hands deeper into their pockets to provide more than $100bn (\u00a380bn) to help poorer nations adapt. A renewed division between the developed and developing world did not materialise as feared.\nBut more fundamental obstructions also came more sharply into focus. The malign role of fossil fuel interests has often been hidden in bureaucratic language or lost in the distractions of diplomatic spats, but in Katowice there were several moments of blinding clarity. Chief among them was the alignment of the world\u2019s top three oil-producing nations \u2013 the US, Russia and Saudi Arabia \u2013 to downplay scientific warnings about temperature rises beyond 1.5C. Soon after, an ambassador from Australia \u2013 a major coal exporter \u2013 joined Trump administration officials in a panel that promoted carbon fuels. Brazil was also accused of holding up talks with a highly contested carbon-accounting proposal that could have reshaped how emissions from the Amazon are calculated. The country\u2019s diplomats denied this but the issue has been kicked forward and it is unlikely the incoming nationalist president Jair Bolsonaro will make life easier for the negotiations.\nThere was also more clarity as a result of the recent protests in France, which prompted policymakers to think twice about the social implications of higher fuel prices. The leading energy economists Nicholas Stern and Ottmar Edenhofer said carbon taxes were still an important instrument to nudge economies away from fossil fuels, but that the transition has to be fair as well as fast, which means using the extra tax revenue for green infrastructure or redistributing it among poorer members of society who are often hardest hit by fuel tax rises.\nTensions will grow along with the stakes, as will frustration at the widening gap between the science and politics. More protests and lawsuits can be expected from climate litigation groups, financial divestment activists and a growing number of direct action campaigners, including 350.org, Extinction Rebellion and striking students such as Greta Thunberg. They, along with many scientists, say it is not enough to agree on rulebooks. After delaying action for so long, they argue the world now needs leaps rather than steps.\nAll of which suggests the next two years will be among the most fraught and crucial in the history of humanity. Investment decisions on power stations and infrastructure taken during this period will determine whether carbon emissions can be cut by the 45% needed by 2030 to give the 1.5C target a chance.\nIt would be fitting if the UK won the right to host the crucial climate summit in 2020. Done well, it would showcase how the world\u2019s first industrialised nation is shifting away from carbon faster than almost any other. Done badly, the UK \u2013 by then probably outside the EU \u2013 will highlight the folly of shifting away away from multilateralism just when when the world needs to pull together.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/analysis"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Decisions made from now to 2020 will determine to what extent Earth remains habitable", "date_published": {"$date": 1545069648000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1545087770000}, "authors": ["Jonathan Watts"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "United Nations", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/17/un-climate-talks-set-stage-for-humanitys-two-most-crucial-years", "og:description": "Decisions made from now to 2020 will determine to what extent Earth remains habitable", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f689ba926bacf0720366eeb23e5cc1d8d4a9f5d8/0_0_2186_1312/master/2186.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=72be47ac7a785c8fd4a5e26b5b92e446", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "UN climate talks set stage for humanity\u2019s two most crucial years"}, "headline": "N", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f689ba926bacf0720366eeb23e5cc1d8d4a9f5d8/0_0_2186_1312/master/2186.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7646e696826cb06fc5ecb7564d39c6c4", "width": "2186", "height": "1312", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f689ba926bacf0720366eeb23e5cc1d8d4a9f5d8/0_0_2186_1312/master/2186.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3f96c022641f6cfe787eb14c0ea10d39", "description": "COP24 in Poland highlighted the growing threat of fossil fuel interests and the nationalist politicians they fund.\nPhotograph: Koji Sasahara/AP"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c26363792267dacba8c7b750c81620a7dfffc6b7/0_0_3476_2085/master/3476.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e663006b72d755cc090d1df41126d835", "width": "3476", "height": "2085", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c26363792267dacba8c7b750c81620a7dfffc6b7/0_0_3476_2085/master/3476.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=20bb79028d3c845aa60eda2a948c6413", "description": "COP24 delegates applaud the agreement reached in Katowice.

Because by then low frequent AGW has reached a level where no part of the UK has the high amplitude weather-conditions that makes it white for a few days - at all. \nWhite Christmas in the UK was always a a risky bet - go here and check out number of days of snow during December 2006, for an example. Then check out 2010. \nThing is - the UK December weather is critical on a whole suit of systems. The North Atlantic Oscillation. The East Atlantic (ridge) pattern. The Arctic Oscillation. The position of the polar front. The speed of the circum-polar jet-stream. This list goes on. \nWhile these internal variable patterns certainly are affected by AGW - kids in UK will experience the odd thing when nature suddenly goes all white as a rare but not abnormal thing for decades and generations to come. \nSnow is a weird thing. Because when the ground temperature falls below ca +2 degrees, the normal drizzle suddenly change character - like a lot. \nA much bigger worry for the UK and other temperate regions is that the vegetation is fooled into thinking spring has arrived at the very wrong calendar data. Temperate vegetation has this built in frost-protection that most vegetation on the planet does not bother with. Most vegetation does not bother with the frost protection because it takes a lot of energy. \nSo biologists notice that plants get themselves into problems - because when they experience a small (and random) period of 10-15 degrees during mid winter they act like \"phew - time to open up those pores and start to pump some water into my cells and consider releasing the most energy-hungry process there is - to make them seeds ready for departure\"\nWhen the cold returns a week later - the poor plants have shut off all their frost-defence mechanisms - and filled themselves up with water again (and as many an Everest climber has learn - when fluids of cells freeze it is very very very destructive to cells). In addition - the seeds, so precious, are released at the wrong time - so that during the true spring they do not only manage to make a lower count of pollen. \nAnd this is a problem for insects. And a very big problem for birds - that hang out in the tropics during winter and does not know that the whole pollen thing is off up north - and that their food source - the insects are also off by a lot. Because the birds seems to run off the sun as timer. So when they come back up north and fall in love again and the eggs start to hatch - the pollen and insects have already left the peak-party time. So they try to raise a bird in austerity. \n(This is especially problematic for birds that live for a long time - as they have less evolutionary pressure). \nWeather anomalies is a \"cloud\" around the average. To have the below zero weather anomalies is not a problem for our life-forms. It is the increasing number of winter hotness that is scary. \nSo start to count the days when your plants wrongly assume spring has arrived and start to sprout buds wrongly. Because that is a bad sign. \nSnow is just humidity that is allowed to freeze due to favorable conditions.

In south-eastern Australia, April to October rainfall had fallen by 11%.\nThe report also highlights an increase in the number of extreme fire danger days in many parts of Australia, particularly in southern and eastern Australia.\nBraganza said there was a \u201cclear shift\u201d towards a lengthened fire season, more fire weather during that season and an increase in its severity.\n\u201cOften the worst fire weather occurs when you\u2019ve had long-term drought, long-term above-average temperatures, maybe a short-term heatwave and then the meteorology that\u2019s consistent with severe fire weather and the ability for fire to spread,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s those types of compound events that are going to be most challenging going forward in terms of adapting to climate change in Australia.\u201d\nDavid Cazzulino, the Great Barrier Reef campaigner for the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the report confirmed what many Australians already knew about the rising risks of climate change.\n\u201cThe big line around oceans warming one degree since 1910 is a huge wake-up call,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that warming oceans lead to more marine heatwaves, coral bleaching and coral mortality.\u201d\nHe said the impact of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef, and climate change policy generally, would be a key campaign issue ahead of the 2019 federal election.\n\u201cWe are running out of time to keep warming to a safe degree for the reef to have a future,\u201d Cazzulino said.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bushfires", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/great-barrier-reef", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "State of the climate report points to a long-term increase in the frequency of extreme heat events, fire weather and drought", "date_published": {"$date": 1545238807000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1545289300000}, "authors": ["Lisa Cox"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Australia news", "Environment", "Bushfires", "Great Barrier Reef"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/20/australia-experiencing-more-heat-longer-fire-seasons-and-rising-oceans", "og:description": "State of the climate report points to a long-term increase in the frequency of extreme heat events, fire weather and drought", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c6f2c64644d5ae72a1a0b14b483adbce7120c8a/0_99_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=5c52e9c486d7caf85b421684e6beb7e5", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Australia experiencing more heat, longer fire seasons and rising oceans"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c6f2c64644d5ae72a1a0b14b483adbce7120c8a/0_99_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6a487e9c0804911b302c34fc4c12c898", "width": "2048", "height": "1229", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c6f2c64644d5ae72a1a0b14b483adbce7120c8a/0_99_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=69942182b6e395e79bc5001280788de6", "description": "Australia\u2019s fire seasons are longer and more severe, the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO\u2019s state of the climate report has found.\nPhotograph: Qfes Media/PR image"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556125184381}, "comments": [{"id": "123974190", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1545289278000}, "author": "CommunityMod", "author_id": "2902769", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Comments here will close shortly at quarter past the hour, thanks for your contributions!", "recommendation_count": "0", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "123974189", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1545289277000}, "author": "ExSquadie", "author_id": "4526883", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Which country is NOW, among the hottest, driest on the Planet. ?

Mass unemployment, totalitarianism, war: a repeat of these horrors is to be avoided at all costs. Eighty years after Neville Chamberlain agreed to Hitler\u2019s demands over the Sudetenland, there is still no greater insult than to dub a politician an \u201cappeaser\u201d.\nThe determination in policy circles to avoid a return to the 30s helps explain why up until now it has never happened. Central banks slashed interest rates and turned on the electronic printing presses a decade ago because they feared a second Great Depression. Welfare states are more generous than they were when John Steinbeck was writing The Grapes of Wrath. Decades of growth have made societies wealthier; advances in medical science have made them healthier.\nThat said, the world is currently closer to a return to the 30s than it has ever been. The echoes are loud and getting louder.\nLet\u2019s start with the obvious. As it did in the period between the two world wars, something has gone seriously wrong with the global economy. The story of the past 20 years has been that of an unsustainable boom followed by a deep recession and the weakest recovery in history.\nCentral banks have applauded themselves for preventing Great Depression 2.0, but what they never admit is that they did so by creating asset bubbles. A prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing \u2013 the bond-buying process that boosts the supply of money \u2013 led to a speculative frenzy for commodities, shares and property. Those bubbles are now starting to pop. Oil prices are crashing, house prices are flat, shares on Wall Street are on course to have their worst December since 1931.\nIn the 1920s and early 30s, there was a reluctance to give up on a conservative model of political economy: the gold standard, balanced budgets, a limited role for government and a belief that markets would deliver the best of all possible outcomes if left unhindered. Eventually, stark evidence of failure forced a rethink. Starting with Britain, countries came off the gold standard. Franklin Roosevelt introduced the New Deal. John Maynard Keynes explained why it was possible for unemployment to remain high. The economic problems of the 20s had prevented the full flowering of the technologies that appeared in the first few decades of the 20th century. It required a paradigm shift to full employment, capital controls and a fairer division of the spoils for that to happen.\nNo such reassessment has taken place since the global economy\u2019s near-death experience of a decade ago. Governments are supposed to balance their budgets, money is free to go where it will, the banking system remains largely untouched, and the imbalance of power between capital and labour remains unaddressed. Growth has only been possible because of a buildup of debt. This proved unsustainable in the past and will do so again.\nTo make matters worse, the distribution of income and wealth has mirrored that of the period between the wars. Real wages \u2013 adjusted for inflation \u2013 have barely risen for those on low and middle incomes; such growth as there has been has been snaffled by the better off. If you own a home or own shares, the past decade has been good for you. If you are in a low-wage job with only modest savings, life has not been nearly so comfortable.\nAll these factors \u2013 economic underperformance, the return to business as usual and the sense that we are not all in this together \u2013 have given rise to a different sort of politics: nationalistic, populist and angry. People in the 30s were susceptible to the cult of the strongman leader because parties of the centre-left and centre-right seemed impotent in the face of a financial crisis, triggered by the Wall Street crash. Now that cult \u2013 Putin in Russia; Modi in India; Erdo\u011fan in Turkey; Trump in the US; Bolsonaro in Brazil \u2013 is back and for the same reason. Voters are no longer convinced that mainstream politics can deliver.\nProtectionism is back, and, although Trump\u2019s trade war with China is so far more of a trade skirmish, the direction of travel is clear. \u201cAmerica first\u201d is the modern-day equivalent of US isolationism in the 20s and 30s. Governments that pledge to look after their own \u2013 through tariffs or immigration controls \u2013 have tapped into a genuine sense of unease about how the fruits of globalisation have been divvied up.\nThe 40s and 50s saw the creation of a network of multilateral organisations designed to prevent a return to the beggar-thy-neighbour world of the 30s and to embed the new social democratic order. These institutions \u2013 the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization (conceived in the 1940s but created decades later) and the European Union \u2013 have all to a greater or lesser extent been captured by neoliberal ideology and by big business interests. Faith in international cooperation has frayed.\nOne seeming difference between the 2010s and the 1930s is the absence of an ideological clash. During the Great Depression, there were plenty of people in the west who saw Stalin\u2019s five-year plans as a credible alternative to free-market capitalism. That struggle ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the spread of the market to parts of the world where it had previously been off limits.\nIn fact, there is a challenge to free-market capitalism and it is coming from environmentalism. On the one hand, there is an ideology that prioritises growth; on the other a belief system that sees the obsession with growth as an existential threat to the planet.\nBritain\u2019s fixation with Brexit means it is easy to portray Theresa May as Chamberlain and to see the prime minister\u2019s recent abortive trip to the EU summit as her Munich. This, though, misses the bigger picture. Brexit is not the most important issue facing the world; it is not even the most important issue facing Britain.\nGovernments are aware of the risk posed by climate change. They know that they need to change the way their economies are run in order to hit targets for capping carbon emissions. They understand that time is not on their side. Yet at the UN summit in Poland they came up with an agreement they knew was inadequate to meet the challenge.\nKatowice was the real Munich and the feeble UN accord the equivalent of the piece of paper Chamberlain brought back home with him from his meeting with Hitler. Appeasement doesn\u2019t work and merely delays necessary policy action. That was true in the late 30s and it is true again today. Ultimately, policymakers have a choice. They can put their economies on an environmental war footing or they can continue to bottle it. In the 30s, they acted in time, but only just. For today\u2019s appeasers, the moment of truth is nigh.\n\u2022 Larry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/secondworldwar", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/austerity", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The UN climate accord is the equivalent of Chamberlain\u2019s piece of paper, says the Guardian\u2019s economics editor, Larry Elliott", "date_published": {"$date": 1545285623000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1545313024000}, "authors": ["Larry Elliott"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Economics", "Politics", "Climate change", "Second world war", "Austerity", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/20/1930s-politics-appeasement-un-climate-accord", "og:description": "The UN climate accord is the equivalent of Chamberlain\u2019s piece of paper, says the Guardian\u2019s economics editor, Larry Elliott", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c9b636ed63e3199e8a2b0f09deeb8c9c8d47cde/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=495182910461aa76b4beec3bba3b7bab", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "We\u2019re back to the 1930s politics of anger and, yes, appeasement | Larry Elliott"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c9b636ed63e3199e8a2b0f09deeb8c9c8d47cde/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=272cde815a45c6c16241b483abb0ab87", "width": "2560", "height": "1536", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c9b636ed63e3199e8a2b0f09deeb8c9c8d47cde/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=83c2a09e3be4a7e6a11bf34ff9fafe19", "description": "Illustration: Eva Bee"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ce0fd9b111d8e3951286893696e10db23494d20/0_0_2956_2201/master/2956.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=67af41ce92cdb73c082c9ff12e5205d8", "width": "2956", "height": "2201", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ce0fd9b111d8e3951286893696e10db23494d20/0_0_2956_2201/master/2956.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ea1f944833089f9bb7e2ed0f79447faa", "description": "\u2018Appeasement doesn\u2019t work.\u2019 British PM Neville Chamberlain during his 1938 \u2018Peace in our time\u2019 address.

track to meet its obligations \u201cin a canter\u201d, new government projections show.\nThe government published its 2018 emissions projections report on Friday, just before Christmas, in its now customary style of releasing greenhouse data just before a public holiday.\nThe report details how Australia is tracking towards its 2020 and 2030 emissions reduction obligations under the Paris and Kyoto agreements.\nIt projects total emissions in 2030 will be 563 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is an emissions reduction of 7% on 2005 levels.\nAustralia\u2019s targets under the Paris agreement are for a 26% to 28% emissions reduction on 2005 levels.\nThe report says emissions in 2030 are projected to climb 4% above 2020 levels driven by higher levels of liquefied natural gas production, growth in agriculture, increased transport activity and a drop in the amount of carbon reduction from activities such as reforestation in the land use sector.\nThe report projects emissions from all sectors, except for electricity, waste and land use, will grow by 2030.\nIt forecasts electricity emissions will fall to 2023 before starting to increase again.\nThe government\u2019s emissions calculations for 2030 also appear to suggest it intends to used carryover from overachievement of previous Kyoto targets to try to meet its Paris obligations, unless this is opposed through UN negotiations.\nClimate scientist and the chief executive of Climate Analytics, Bill Hare, said use of carryover would effectively mean the target Australia was aiming for was \u201cmore like 12% to 14%\u201d on 2005 levels by 2030.\n\u201cThey\u2019re as far away as ever from meeting the 2030 target,\u201d he said. \u201cThe underlying projections show a substantial deterioration because the key sectors including direct combustion of fuel, transport and industry have larger increases than last year and the power sector begins increasing again from 2023 significantly.\u201d\nThe report says Australia will beat its 2020 emissions reduction target of 5% on 2005 levels.\nIt says Australia will \u201coverachieve\u201d on the target by 367 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, if carryover from beating the first Kyoto target in 2012 \u2013 which allowed Australia to increase its emissions from 1990 levels \u2013 is included.\nIf carryover is not included, Australia would beat the target by 240 million tonnes.\nIn a statement released with the report on Friday, the environment minister, Melissa Price, focused on Australia\u2019s progress towards the 2020 target, describing it as \u201ca great result for the environment\u201d.\nShe said \u201cwe have also made significant progress to our 2030 target\u201d.\n\u201cWe have overachieved on our 2020 target and are well on our way to meeting our commitment to the Paris agreement 2030 target, all while maintaining a strong economy,\u201d she said.\nScientists and environment groups said it was clearly not the case that Australia was making progress towards 2030.\nThe Australian Conservation Foundation said the government had no policy to address Australia\u2019s climate pollution problem.\n\u201cPrime Minister Scott Morrison has repeatedly said Australia will meet its Paris agreement targets in a canter, but the government\u2019s own emissions projections tell a very different story,\u201d the ACF\u2019s economics program manager, Matt Rose, said.\n\u201cThe prime minister is not the only one having trouble accepting that Australia isn\u2019t on track to meet our Paris target.\n\u201cEnergy minister Angus Taylor released a misleading statement this week titled, \u2018National Electricity Market emissions to hit Paris target eight years early\u2019, and on Radio National Breakfast tried to pretend Australia\u2019s Paris target would be met by reductions in the electricity sector alone.\u201d\nEmma Herd, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said Australia \u201cremains off track to achieve our currently inadequate 2030 target and, critically, achieving net zero emissions by 2050\u201d.\nShe said the longer the country delayed taking credible action, the harder the economic adjustment would be and Australia risked losing the benefits of investment in clean energy and other low carbon opportunities.\nHerd said the suggestion in the report Australia might try to use carryover was concerning and \u201cundermines the investment needed to transform the economy to net zero emissions\u201d.\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s targets should be strengthened, not weakened, by 2020,\u201d she said. \u201cTo secure the long-term prosperity of Australia, targets need to be in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement \u2013 limiting warming to 1.5C and well below 2C.\u201d\nThe Greens\u2019 climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, said the government was resorting to \u201caccounting tricks\u201d to try to meet its Paris target.\n\u201cSo far the government\u2019s only plan to meet Paris appears to be using dodgy accounting to cook the books and count dodgy \u2018carryover\u2019 credits from Kyoto towards Paris,\u201d he said. \u201cOther major countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany voluntarily cancelled their Kyoto carryover credits.\u201d\nMorrison disputed in a statement issued on Friday that the government was not on track to beat the 2030 target.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition",

Dive into the emerald water. It\u2019s 13 minutes and 70 metres down to lunch. Are you dead yet? Not if you are one of the Bajau \u201csea nomads\u201d of south-east Asia, who have been free-diving like this for more than 1,000 years, relying on their remarkable physiology, and, as we learned in April, their genes. Humans left Africa 50 millennia ago, encountering new environments that required adaptation to survive. Adaptation is mostly cultural \u2013 building shelters, using fire, deciding what to eat, and transmitting instructions from generation to generation. But alongside this are advantageous genetic mutations grasped by natural selection.\nFinding genetic changes that drive adaptations has become much easier now genomes can be sequenced cheaply, and a study this year of the Bajau people provided a beautiful example. Ultrasound scans revealed enlarged spleens \u2013 reflex contraction of this neglected organ helps during diving by pumping oxygenated red blood cells into the circulation. Sequencing Bajau genomes and comparing them with those of their non-diving neighbours revealed genes showing signatures of natural selection, one of which is specifically associated with spleen size. Understanding the dive response could have medical applications in acute hypoxia, a common killer in A&amp;E.Mark Jobling, professor of genetics, University of Leicester\nAmong the tsunami of bad news about plastic waste this year, there was a small piece of good news. This was an agreement in April by those responsible for more than 80% of the plastic packaging in the UK to make all plastic packing 100% recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025. This pledge, called the UK Plastics Pact, is significant because it has emerged not from government but from a consortium of companies and organisations including supermarkets, coffee chains, brands, manufacturers, waste disposal companies and local authorities. Thee organisationsy have clubbed together to solve this problem largely because they are under massive public pressure. They propose to create a circular economy of plastics, a seismic shift in the way companies engineer and use them. It is a big win for the environment of the UK, but it will also have a global impact, because many of the companies involved \u2013 such as Coca-Cola, Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble \u2013 are multinational corporations that sell products all over the world. Once the UK creates a non-polluting circular economy of plastic packaging, the likelihood of it being rolled out by these companies in the rest of the world is high. There is an enormous amount of work to do, but I hope when our children look back at the environmental catastrophe of the 20th century, they will see 2018 as the year plastic pollution started its decline.Mark Miodownik, professor of materials and society at University College London\nMost people don\u2019t think much about the high seas. Far beyond the horizon, they begin where national control ends, 200 nautical miles from the coast, and cover 61% of the ocean and 43% of the Earth\u2019s surface. Few laws restrain fishing here; countries can opt out of those that exist, and much activity is in any case hidden by remoteness. But 2018 may signal the beginning of the end of freedom to plunder fish and slaughter wildlife caught alongside them. This year Global Fishing Watch lifted the veil on the high seas, exposing fishing vessels and companies to scrutiny for the first time. Their tool tracks ship movements based on satellite transmissions from vessels, and uses machine learning to determine what a vessel is doing from its behaviour. We learned this year that high seas fishing contributes only 4.2% of wild fish catches, that 64% of the spoils go to just five rich countries, and that much of this fishing would not be profitable without public subsidies. In September, the UN began negotiations for a new treaty to protect high seas wildlife, paving the way for marine protected areas that Global Fishing Watch can help to police.Callum Roberts, professor of marine conservation at the University of York\nWhile it is always nice to round off the year with good-news science stories, I feel that the publication of the new UN IPCC (the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report in October was so important and with such huge ramifications that all else pales into insignificance.\nThe report shook the world when it was published on 8 October, suggesting that the time for talking was over and that the window available for us to really act against the worst effects of climate change was closing fast. It stated that \u201climiting global warming to 1.5C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\u201d.\nWritten by 91 scientists and review editors from 40 countries, with over 6,000 scientific references and contributions from thousands of experts worldwide, it explained that we are already seeing the consequences of 1C of global warming: more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice. It also highlighted how much worse things could get if we do not act immediately.\nThe report examined what it would take to avert disaster and what the consequences could be. But the omens are not good. Global CO2 emissions are on the rise again, as is the popularity of climate change-denying, populist world leaders, which makes everything more difficult. Jim Al-Khalili, professor of theoretical physics at the University of Surrey\nEurope\u2019s hegemony on humankind\u2019s story loosened when the record for the oldest known figurative cave art by Homo sapiens shifted from Germany to south-east Asia. The painting of a local wild cow, a banteng, in a remote cave in Borneo was dated in November as being a minimum of 40,000 years old, just nudging ahead of the Lion Man carving of Hohlenstein Stadel in Germany. In September, a flake of stone with hashed patterns made with an ochre crayon from the Blombos Cave in South Africa was dated at 73,000 years old, though these markings fall short of being identifiable as art. All these artefacts show the emergence of minds like our own, so-called behavioural modernity, all around the world. But it wasn\u2019t limited to Homo sapiens. An abstract image of parts of a cow and some other mysterious figures adorns a cave wall on the Spanish Cantabrian coast, and in February was found to be a whopping 65,000 years old, though this date has been contested. The only people in northern Spain at that time were Homo neanderthalensis, and the continued rehabilitation of our cousins continues: Neanderthals were simply people too.Dr Adam Rutherford, presenter of Inside Science, Radio 4\nWhen my son was younger, he had a duvet cover with animals from around the world. He slept wrapped in colourful images of tigers, elephants, and kangaroos. However, if this duvet represented mammals in terms of their weight, all the world\u2019s wild mammals would cover only a corner of the pillowcase. This shocking fact was the main message I took from a detailed analysis of the biomass of life on Earth published earlier this year. People and our livestock (mostly cattle and pigs) now make up 96% of mammalian biomass on the planet. Similarly, the weight of domestic poultry (mostly chickens) is three times higher than all species of wild birds combined.\nThese stark statistics help us understand the extent to which we humans now dominate ecosystems. While wildlife documentaries still wow us with images of wonderful wildlife in wild places, these places are shrinking. Almost everywhere, the large mammal you are most likely to encounter is a human or a cow. I hope that being reminded of this will help society take actions to ensure that my son\u2019s children don\u2019t live in a world where wild species are only known from images on soft furnishings.Julia Jones, professor of conservation science, Bangor University\nGene-editing is a breakthrough in biotechnology, not least in crop improvement. Scientists\u2019 favourite method, Crispr/Cas9, makes precise changes to individual genes, even changing a single \u201cletter\u201d of the genetic code. It\u2019s quick, easy and amazingly versatile. A headline story in 2018 was the European court of justice\u2019s ruling that gene-edited crops must be subject to the same cumbersome regulation as older methods of genetic engineering, even though Crispr mutations are no different to those found throughout the natural world. Plant breeders are pressing for this decision to be overturned so farmers and consumers can benefit from improvements in fruit, vegetables and field crops.\nMeanwhile, they are seizing the opportunities offered by Crispr to transform food production. In 2018, teams of scientists in India and Australia announced that they had successfully edited the genome of bananas. This could rescue the world\u2019s most popular fruit from the threat of disease. Banana improvement faces two great challenges. One is monoculture: the Cavendish is the supermarkets\u2019 favourite banana, but plantations worldwide are susceptible to the destructive tropical race 4 strain of the Fusarium fungus. In other crops, cross-breeding could produce disease-resistant varieties, but the second challenge is that banana flowers are sterile. Gene-editing offers the exciting prospect that scientists will at last be able to make a disease-resistant banana.James Brown, head of crop genetics at the John Innes Centre, Norwich\nAny woman who has suffered a miscarriage is likely to worry about what she has done \u201cwrong\u201d; a woman at the end of her pregnancy who is afflicted with the serious condition pre-eclampsia will wonder why it afflicted her in particular. Both situations, common as they are and with all their accompanying distress, are likely to arise from problems with the placenta. But it is difficult to determine this, since the human placenta is hardly available off the shelf for easy study.\nA team of scientists at the University of Cambridge have made a breakthrough permitting them to create a 3D (that\u2019s important in order to simulate reality) \u201corganoid\u201d, clusters of cells derived from the placentas of aborted foetuses. These have been shown to grow and produce proteins, sufficiently mimicking the real thing that a pregnancy test gives a positive result. This mini-placenta, only a millimetre or less across, offers the promise that the origin of the developmental abnormalities that lead to the embryo not correctly implanting in the womb can finally be understood. For many women, this insight could prove transformative. Clearly, there is a long way to go from creating the first mini-placentas to answering the fundamental questions, but this study appears to provide a critical step forward.Athene Donald, professor of experimental physics at the University of Cambridge\nAs much as I love seeing otherworldly pictures beamed back from the surface of Mars, it was a different sort of space landing that grabbed my attention this year. In June, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency\u2019s (Jaxa) Hayabusa2 probe rendezvoused with a near-Earth asteroid called Ryugu, some 280m km away. The first pictures beamed back revealed a strange and beautiful diamond-shaped rock ploughing its way through space. Fascinating in and of itself, but the real treat would come in September, when the probe landed two rovers on Ryugu\u2019s surface. The picture above is one of the first ever transmitted from the surface of an asteroid, and I could stare at it for hours. It\u2019s a reminder that while there\u2019s still so much to learn about the universe, the baby steps we\u2019re already taking reveal an awe-inspiring beauty in the most unexpected of places. Hayabusa2 will also be collecting rock samples that might shed light on the potential origins of water and organic compounds (and maybe even life) on Earth, but the journey will be a long and risky one \u2013 it\u2019s not scheduled back until December 2020.Dr Pete Etchells, reader in psychology and science communication at Bath Spa University\nThis year has seen some sobering science stories, not least the increase in cases, sometimes fatal, of preventable diseases such as measles due to vaccine hesitancy and the growing politicisation of the anti-vaccine agenda. My older brother suffered with measles as child and was dangerously ill. He used to describe his fever dreams as the most terrifying experiences of his life. As late as the 1960s, many people still witnessed the potentially catastrophic effects of measles, rubella and whooping cough and there was a huge demand for the development of vaccines to prevent them. The introduction of vaccines dramatically reduced the incidence of infections and fewer people experienced the impact of disease. Now we are seeing a resurgence in preventable diseases such as measles due to vaccine hesitancy. Although there is not one clearly defined anti-vaccine group, six themes emerge:\n1. Control: the idea that we can take back control of our own bodies through alternative means.\n2. Parenting style: philosophies that shun mainstream medicine, opting for \u201cnatural\u201d remedies.\n3. The past: previous bad healthcare experiences or a bad experience around vaccination shapes perceptions.\n4. Risk: misunderstandings about the risks of vaccination versus the risks of disease.\n5. Fear of chemicals: the fear that the vaccine will introduce toxic chemicals.\n6. Distrust of government agencies and corporations.\nBy listening to people, it is possible to start to understand what may lie behind their hesitancy. The re-emergence of preventable diseases is a stark reminder of how mistrust, confusion and bad information can spread, and emphasises the importance of experts in the field talking with and listening to the public to enable meaningful dialogue, help reduce propaganda and effect change. Sheena Cruickshank, professor in biomedical sciences and public engagement, University of Manchester\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has continued to make great strides in 2018. Although the AI of Blade Runner and Ex Machina remains as distant as ever, the power of so-called \u201cdeep neural networks\u201d and \u201creinforcement learning\u201d to solve complex problems has developed rapidly. Two milestones stand out this year: AlphaZero and AlphaFold, both from the London-based AI firm DeepMind. AlphaZero is the latest iteration of AlphaGo, which catapulted DeepMind to public prominence in 2016 when it beat Go champion Lee Sedol in a series of high-profile matches.\nAlphaGo worked by training a deep neural network to predict the value of board positions, using millions of past games as training data. This was later improved upon by AlphaGo Zero, which learned purely by playing itself, and now AlphaZero takes things further by training a single network, again entirely through self-play and without any game-specific knowledge, to deliver world-beating performances in three different games: Go, chess, and the Japanese game shogi.\nThis remarkable achievement has also provided glimpses into new \u201cmachine-like\u201d ways of thinking: as grandmaster Matthew Sadler put it, \u201cit\u2019s like discovering the secret notebooks of a great player from the past\u201d. AlphaFold takes the same approach beyond the rarefied regime of board games to address a practical problem of real importance: predicting the 3D structure of proteins solely from genetic sequences. Here, the DeepMind software has again achieved world-leading results, bringing important implications for biology and medicine, and showcasing how AI can be used for scientific discovery itself.Anil Seth, professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience, University of Sussex\nAtoms emit and absorb light when electrons inside them jump around. This light comes at frequencies characteristic of the type of atom \u2013 sort of a unique barcode. Reading these barcodes tells us what elements are present in the stars, galaxies and the sparse gas between them.\nOne thing we don\u2019t know though is why there is not more antimatter around. Antimatter is created in radioactive decays and particle collisions; it is routinely used in medical diagnosis. But equal amounts of antimatter and matter are always created or destroyed together. So if the matter around us was created in the Big Bang, there should presumably be an equal amount of antimatter. So where is it?\nThe ALPHA experiment at CERN this year collected and controlled anti-electrons and anti-protons to make and store enough anti-hydrogen to could start reading its barcode. They read one of the key identifiers used to track intergalactic hydrogen for the first time \u2013 the so-called \u201cLyman alpha\u201d line. The line is in the same place as that for hydrogen, as predicted. This sets our knowledge of the universe on a slightly firmer footing, and, as the programme progresses, they will be on the look out for any subtle differences between matter and antimatter that may help explain where all the antimatter has gone.\nJonathan Butterworth, professor of physics, University College London ", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/science/genetics", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/biology", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/space", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oceans", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ipcc", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "description": "Our guest scientists pick the breakthroughs and discoveries that defined their year, from insights into human evolution to our first trip aboard an asteroid", "date_published": {"$date": 1545548420000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1545582608000}, "authors": ["Anil Seth", "Mark Miodownik", "Jim Al-Khalili", "Adam Rutherford", "Callum Roberts", "Pete Etchells", "Athene Donald", "Jon Butterworth"], "article_section": "Science", "article_tags": ["Science", "Genetics", "Biology", "Space", "Oceans", "Environment", "Climate change", "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)", "Global climate talks", "DeepMind", "Technology", "Artificial intelligence (AI)", "Computing", "Consciousness", "Vaccines and immunisation", "Plastics", "Medicine", "Pregnancy"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/23/the-science-stories-that-shook-2018-genetics-evolution-climate-change-artificial-intelligence", "og:description": "Our guest scientists pick the breakthroughs and discoveries that defined their year, from insights into human evolution to our first trip aboard an asteroid", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c91118fe1100b6cb836897150b865244cd12c130/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=2dacd53214164f558afb0dbf4053eda3", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "The science stories that shook 2018"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c91118fe1100b6cb836897150b865244cd12c130/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5857a059ed464daca57a8b889bf3e03c", "width": "5616", "height": "3370", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c91118fe1100b6cb836897150b865244cd12c130/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3906beffb839db5b3b0ea9fd786a022a", "description": "A Bajau free diver swimming with jack fish near a reef.\nPhotograph: Timothy Allen/Getty Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23e57f4a8fadb8eb5fc2cd9543eb036c818294ff/0_146_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c2f1e57a4fd4ee38356846b5a6127001", "width": "5472", "height": "3283", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23e57f4a8fadb8eb5fc2cd9543eb036c818294ff/0_146_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4de8a6f9b4d2be1bc02d3a68a678f58a", "description": "A man walks carries a sack of bottles to be sold for recycling after weighing them at the dump in the Dandora slum of Nairobi, Kenya.

My experience has been that most of them would like to do what you and I would consider to be the \u201cright\u201d thing, but they are constrained because their primary objective (the reason they have a job) is to maximise return for shareholders. Yes, shareholders include rich and greedy investors, but also our savings and pension plans, so investors are not the bogey man you seek.\nThe key is the regulatory framework within which companies have to operate. Their job is to maximise long-term profit, so by manipulating regulatory system, you can close off activities which are detrimental and encourage those which benefit society. And it is government which is in the driving seat i.e. politicians. The system is by no means perfect (it is distorted by lobbying and campaign donations by companies (i.e. company directors) seeking to maintain shareholder value in, for instance, coal reserves) but there is at least the possibility of democratic control over the way in which companies behave.\nIt is convenient for politicians to pretend that it is evil companies which do all this damage, but the responsibility lies squarely in their court. That means that, because they are elected, we the people actually hold the power to effect change, if we can be arsed to use it.

Liberty caps, one of the most prevalent species containing the psychoactive ingredient psilocybin, produce their mushrooms at below 15C in the day and 10C at night \u2013 often next to manure \u2013 with the first freezing temperatures heralding the end of the season.\nMagic mushroom use was popularised during the 70s when it emerged as a legal alternative to LSD, but they were banned in 2005. However, more than 200,000 people in the UK used them in 2017-18, an increase of a third on the previous year. According to the 2017 Global Drug Survey, they are the safest \u201crecreational\u201d drug.\nRecent studies have suggested magic mushrooms have therapeutic benefits and can help treat depression. Despite this, it is a class A drug and picking psychedelic mushrooms is an offence punishable with up to seven years\u2019 imprisonment.

Her decades of experience in this fight, both in Florida and in the Congress, will be vital,\u201d Pelosi said.\nCastor said in a statement that she was honored to lead the panel and pledged to \u201cact with urgency to reduce carbon pollution\u201d and \u201cunleash\u201d American ingenuity to create clean-energy jobs.\n\u201cThe costs of the changing climate and extreme weather events pose greater risks every day to American families, businesses and our way of life,\u201d Castor said. She added that the new panel \u201cwill tackle the crisis head on. Failure is not an option.\u201d\nThe membership and exact scope of the panel remain to be determined, but Pelosi said it would play a key role in shaping how Congress responds to the threat of global warming while creating good-paying, \u201cgreen\u201d jobs.\nThe Maryland representative Steny Hoyer, the incoming House majority leader, said last week the climate committee would probably not have legal authority to demand documents under subpoena. But he added that he did not think the panel would need subpoena authority, since experts will be \u201cdying to come before them\u201d.\nClimate scientists and other experts \u201care going to want to testify\u201d, Hoyer said. \u201cI think they\u2019ll want to give the best information as it relates to the crisis.\u201d\nThe Democratic representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and other progressives, have pushed for a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d that includes thousands of jobs in renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

They say the National Climate Assessment (NCA) \u2013 an expansive federal government report on the dangers of climate change in the US \u2013 considers only the highest possible levels of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\u201cIf you take the extreme case, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s dire,\u201d Trump\u2019s interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, said on Fox News. \u201cIf you take the best case, it\u2019s not much.\u201d\nZinke, who has encouraged fossil fuel production on public lands, compared climate risks to the chance of nuclear war.\n\u201cIf you look at nuclear war, today we\u2019re going to go home to a bunker and wear a hazardous suit,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case.\u201d\nActing Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator Andrew Wheeler used some of the same phrasing, saying he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised if the Obama administration told the report\u2019s authors to take a look at the worst-case scenario for this report\u201d. The Trump administration, he said, would need to \u201ctake a look at the modeling\u201d for the next assessment, which is required by law.\nTrump said he did not believe climate change would have economic consequences for the US.\nOf Zinke\u2019s comments, Pennsylvania University climate scientist Michael Mann said \u201cthere is no truth to [them] whatsoever\u201d. He added: \u201cThe report looked at an extremely wide range of scenarios.\n\u201cAt nearly every juncture, we have actually underestimated the impacts that climate change is having. Sea levels are rising faster, ice is disappearing sooner and the incidence of extreme weather events is increasing faster than our projections from just a few years ago suggested.\u201d\nKatharine Hayhoe, a Texas Tech University climate scientist and lead author of the scenarios chapter of an earlier part of the assessment, said the authors considered the range of possibilities outlined by United Nations experts, \u201cfrom one where carbon emissions continue to grow through the end of the century to one where emissions are already declining and fall below zero before the end of the century.\u201d\nRutgers University climate scientist Robert Kopp, also a lead author on an earlier volume of the report, called the administration\u2019s framing \u201cmisguided\u201d.\n\u201cIn good risk assessment, you want to consider a range of scenarios from the high to the low,\u201d Kopp said.\nAwaiting Senate confirmation, Trump nominees have largely acknowledged that climate change is happening but downplayed its impacts, suggesting it is not possible to say how much of it is because of human activities like burning coal and driving cars.\nIn office, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt considered a military-style \u201cred team, blue team\u201d debate, questioning climate science. An EPA official speaking to conservative state lawmakers in Washington on Friday said those plans were no longer on the table.\nMandy Gunasekara, a high-ranking official in the EPA air office, said the agency\u2019s \u201cunderstanding of CO2 and greenhouse gases continues to evolve\u201d. After the meeting she said the EPA was still having a \u201cpreliminary interim discussion\u201d about climate change science policies.\nThe NCA, which the administration quietly published the day after the Thanksgiving holiday, looks at how the extent of heat waves, extreme weather and swelling seas will depend on how much greenhouse gas pollution continues to rise.\nEven if greenhouse gases stopped rising now, the world would heat up by another 1.1F (0.6C), according to the earlier portion of the report authored by Hayhoe and others. Over the next two decades, temperatures could increase between 0.5F and 1.3F (0.3C and 0.7C).\nGlobal atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations appear to be the highest they have been in 3m years, and continued carbon growth is likely lead to carbon levels not seen in tens of millions of years.\nIf humans greatly reduce the greenhouse gases spewing into the atmosphere, continuing warming will still pose wide-ranging dangers.\nThe Trump cabinet has however sought to advance oil and gas operations, subsidize coal plants and rescind climate protections drafted by Barack Obama\u2019s agencies. Trump also plans to exit the international Paris agreement that aims to cut greenhouse gases.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Officials minimize warnings and say government report considers only the highest possible levels of greenhouse gas emissions", "date_published": {"$date": 1543644013000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1543865050000}, "authors": ["Emily Holden"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "Climate change", "Science", "Trump administration", "US news", "US politics"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/01/trump-officials-argue-climate-change-warnings-based-on-worst-case-scenario", "og:description": "Officials minimize warnings and say government report considers only the highest possible levels of greenhouse gas emissions", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60f29e78dc76834981c19cf1c76db2380aafa2fd/290_0_4056_2435/master/4056.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=c72803ce61e348a2ceb7a0c6e9240f03", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Trump officials argue climate change warnings based on \u2018worst-case scenario'"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60f29e78dc76834981c19cf1c76db2380aafa2fd/290_0_4056_2435/master/4056.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d0ed4a3921a158905fcdda264b25f359", "width": "4056", "height": "2435", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60f29e78dc76834981c19cf1c76db2380aafa2fd/290_0_4056_2435/master/4056.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c3a10c185da65ed8d827650fc874befd", "description": "Floodwaters brought on by tropical storm Harvey in Houston on 28 August 2017.

The Liberal party won\u2019t reform, so it is time to stop fighting, split and take the opportunity to compete for the support of the public. The Liberal party is now broken, brand-damaged and unable to attract new members that would enable it to represent a \u201cbroad church\u201d.\nThe failure of the existing Liberal party to address climate change or to support an integrity commission is unacceptable.\nNowhere is this failure more obvious than in its continued support for the Adani coalmine and new coal-fired power stations.\nI expected more from Scott Morrison after the Victorian walloping. Instead we get the very same. Slippery answers to everything. Coal, coal, coal and soaring greenhouse gas emissions.\nRefusing to reduce emissions as cheaply as possible is irrational, immoral and economically reckless. Achieving emission reductions of just 2% a year as proposed by the Labor party in the electricity sector costs very little and won\u2019t risk system stability or security.\nWe should be aiming for a 2% reduction in emissions every year to ensure Australia does its fair share to tackle climate change. Instead, emissions are increasing and are at a seven year high.\nSomething must lie behind the failure of the Liberal party to accept policies that are economically rational and environmentally sound, so some sunlight from an integrity commission should be welcomed by all Australians.Wherever you look, something is wrong.\nWe desperately need an integrity commission to investigate potential conflicts of interest\nThe pursuit by ministers of baseload coal power when we need dispatchable renewable energy and storage.\nClaims by ministers that we need more fossil fuels and that they are cheaper than renewables or that clean coal is the answer.\nClaims by ministers that as Australia only emits 1.3% of global pollution we have no role to play, ignoring the fact that we are only 0.3% of the population and that we will be heavily damaged by the impacts of climate change.\nAnd the final insult \u2013 allowing the Adani coalmine to proceed when it lacks a social licence, is completely inconsistent with the need to tackle climate change and frankly smells with donations, overseas trips and wedding parties.\nWe desperately need an integrity commission to investigate potential conflicts of interest that see a revolving door between the coal industry and minister\u2019s offices. It is hard to believe donors don\u2019t have influence on the selection of ministers to some degree.\nMembers of parliament that are selected to be ministers stand to receive additional pay of more than $150,000, boosting their remuneration towards $500,000. It seems obvious that such ministers would be more likely to promote the views of the large donors that influenced their appointment in the first place.\nWe need a parliament that accepts science.\nWe need a parliament that respects our geography and rationally accepts that our neighbours and their views have special relevance and their concerns deserve special attention, just as my neighbours on my street deserve my special consideration.\nWe need a root and branch review of the political remuneration system that ensures that it provides the right incentives for all politicians to work for the benefit of our country rather than fight against each other to secure the \u201cspoils of government\u201d.\nAs a Liberal, I have had enough and, as evidenced by the swing in safe Liberal seats in Victoria, I am not alone.\nWe must provide alternatives for Liberals to vote for at the next federal election, and I hope to see independent Liberals provide electors in safe Liberal seats with that choice. We need to return to the day where politicians know that their job is not to retain their job but rather to represent their electorate, who, if they are lucky, reward them with their job.\nThe Liberal party brand has been so damaged and trust so completely destroyed that no amount of \u201cshuffling the deck chairs\u201d will change the outcome of the next federal election.\nIt is simply impossible for many Liberal voters to vote for a party that:\nworks to prevent any action on climate change\nhas the potential to be controlled by the mining industry or whichever new industry is willing to pay for favours (clubs, internet gambling, pokies, firearms and many more)\nrejects the establishment of an integrity commission\nrejects donation reform and transparency and promotes members for their fundraising skills rather than policy and communication skills\nbacks the Adani coalmine, which has no social licence and is inconsistent with our need to tackle climate change; and\nregardless of the election result seems to be heading towards installing Tony Abbott or Peter Dutton as the next party leader\nLiberal voters will align with independent Liberals who have real world experience, who will put the interests of their electorates first and who support: \ntight fiscal responsibility so the country operates within its means\nstrong border controls, backed by a compassionate approach to the treatment of refugees\nfree enterprise and small business, balanced with appropriate regulation to ensure competition is fair\ntransparency, integrity and trust; and\nreal action on climate change that is consistent with what the science is demanding\nWhile I am sure many \u201cshock jocks\u201d who are doing daily damage to the Liberal party will yet again venture to their usual corner of scare tactics about the arrival of independent Liberals, there is no justification for that.\nIndependent Liberals will move with transparency and integrity, and will clearly state their principals and beliefs so electors know what they are voting for. Just imagine how refreshing that would be in the current world of dark party politics where trading principles for position and power is considered a positive skill.\nOnce the Liberal party reforms and rebalances, Liberal independents might elect to join again.\n\u2022 Oliver Yates is a member of the Liberal party and former chief executive of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-political-donations", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/mining", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Trust in the Liberals has been destroyed, and no amount of \u2018shuffling the deck chairs\u2019 will change the outcome of the next federal election", "date_published": {"$date": 1543799445000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1543815241000}, "authors": ["Oliver Yates"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Liberal party", "Australian politics", "Australia news", "Australian political donations", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Coal", "Mining", "Fossil fuels", "Energy", "Coalition", "Scott Morrison", "Adani Group", "Carmichael coalmine"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/03/coal-coal-coal-and-soaring-emissions-as-a-liberal-i-have-had-enough", "og:description": "Trust in the Liberals has been destroyed, and no amount of \u2018shuffling the deck chairs\u2019 will change the outcome of the next federal election", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9d89b146091c63fdc18e6f886f3ed1841f3a6b3/0_24_3786_2272/master/3786.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=e64943befb047988d927ef159076f2df", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Coal, coal, coal and soaring emissions - as a Liberal, I have had enough | Oliver Yates"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a28d0e702b58bc1ce92d796d05d17895cc447c70/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8eeba957e270a1fed7ba93896471c7aa", "width": "5568", "height": "3341", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a28d0e702b58bc1ce92d796d05d17895cc447c70/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7532c03c29f38e83b8975c9aaaf801ff", "description": "\u2018I expected more from Scott Morrison after the Victorian walloping.

Surrounded by a hellish inferno of burning trees and cars, McLarty reasoned the flames would engulf her long before the smoke could choke her to death.\nTrapped in nearby vehicles, some of McLarty\u2019s colleagues made similarly macabre calculations. Two nurses, stuck in the back of a stalled police car, contemplated shooting each other. Another nurse rolled down her window and gulped in the smoke. McLarty edged her car away from a burning wreckage, fired off some final messages to her sister and called her daughter, who said she could hear the roar of the blaze over the phone.\n\u201cOnce you feel heat, you know that your car can\u2019t last very long,\u201d said McLarty, a slight, deliberate woman who, little over an hour previously, was in a hospital conducting a gallbladder operation when she was told to evacuate.\n\u201cYou can hear other people\u2019s cars blow up. I grew up thinking that when people died in fires, they died from the smoke and so they didn\u2019t really suffer. But I\u2019m thinking \u2018this is coming fast enough \u2026 I don\u2019t think that I\u2019m gonna die from smoke.\u2019\u201d\nAs McLarty arrived at this grim conclusion, a bulldozer emerged from the sun-blotting pall of smoke and shoved an abandoned car off the road, opening an escape path for McLarty and a few others to dart to safety in a nearby field. \u201cThis poor man. I mean, he\u2019s just driving to his death, and they cleared a path,\u201d McLarty said. \u201cIt was apocalyptic.\u201d\nThe bulldozer driver, she later found out, survived, as did others given just minutes to flee the incinerated town of Paradise, California, on 8 November. Heather Roebuck delivered her daughter by cesarian section at McLarty\u2019s hospital and had to be dragged on a stretcher through thick smoke to safety. Brad Weldon somehow stopped flames devouring his home, aided by buckets, a hose and his blind and immobile 90-year-old mother. More than a dozen terrified people waded into a frigid reservoir, nearly succumbing to the cold while their neighbours were perishing in the heat.\nStill, the Camp fire is comfortably the deadliest in California history, with 85 confirmed deaths and a few dozen people unaccounted for. More than 50,000 others were scattered into refugee tent encampments, hotels, relatives\u2019 couches. \u201cWe are a town in exile,\u201d said Michael Orr, a Paradise resident now living on an air mattress at his in-laws\u2019 house in Chico.\nOf the 10 most destructive fires in California\u2019s history, five have occurred since October last year\nNine in 10 homes in Paradise have been reduced to clumps of ash, mixed with twisted metal, as if the settlement has been carpet-bombed by a brutal invader. Chimneys, like tombstones for a lost town, are the only things left standing. The birds fled along with the humans leaving Paradise an eerily quiet place with a lingering smell of charcoal.\nThe visceral trauma of having a town wiped off the map is the nadir in an astonishing burst of recent wildfires \u2013 of the 10 most destructive fires in California\u2019s recorded history, five have occurred since October last year.\n\u201cThe landscape is changing into the appropriate climate zone that we are moving towards,\u201d said LeRoy Westerling, a climate change and fire expert at the University of California, Merced, who attempts to work out how wildfires will spread as temperatures continue to rise. \u201cThe fires seem to be outpacing our predictions. The Camp fire shocked me by how fast it was.\u201d\nCalifornia is in the grip of what its governor, Jerry Brown, calls the \u201cnew abnormal\u201d. The past five years have been the hottest on record in the state, which is in stuttering recovery from its worst drought in a millennium. The state has received just a fifth of its normal rainfall so far in 2018, with a record 1.6m acres of grassland, forest and urban area, an area larger than Delaware, burning this year.\nOf the multifarious consequences of climate change, scientists consider increasingly ferocious wildfires to be one of the most starkly apparent. Rising atmospheric heat \u2013 average minimum temperatures in California are 2.3F warmer than a century ago \u2013 is drying out trees and shrubs, drawing moisture away from the soil and shrinking the snowpack. Dampening rains are becoming erratic, or, like this year, not materializing at all.\nThis creates a tinderbox for wildfires, which can ignite from actions as simple as sparks flying from a trailer dragging on the road or a faulty power line. There\u2019s also evidence that climate change will help southern California\u2019s autumn winds, known as Santa Anas or Diablos, fan wildfires. A 2016 study found climate change has doubled the total area burned in the western US since the 1980s.\nSomething on the scale of the Camp fire, where a funnel of flame seared through a town in a few hours, could\u2019ve conceivably occurred 50 years ago but it would\u2019ve involved a \u201cvery unlikely sequence of climate events you wouldn\u2019t see again\u201d, Westerling said.\n\u201cNow we are seeing it happen again and again, year after year,\u201d he added. \u201cThe climate will continue to warm and will continue to surprise us. No one alive today will ever see a stable climate system again. This is going to be changing for the rest of our lives.\u201d\nFirefighters now face a grueling workload that lasts all year, rather than tapering off in time for Thanksgiving. Last October, the Tubbs fire razed chunks of Santa Rosa, causing 22 deaths. It was swiftly followed by the Thomas fire, which burned a vast swath of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties and primed the landscape for mudslides that killed more than 20 people.\nThen, during the Carr fire in July, the public was introduced to the terrifying concept of a fire tornado, or firenado, when a monstrous seven-mile high flaming column killed a firefighter, Jeremy Stoke, who was attempting to evacuate people on the edge of Redding.\n\u201cA whole bunch of fires have piled on to the top of each other and haven\u2019t stopped,\u201d said Scott McLean, deputy chief of Cal Fire, who oversaw crews working 24-hour shifts during the fight to save Paradise. \u201cI grew up in this state and you\u2019d never really get fires like this in November or December. We\u2019re now fighting fire all year round. There\u2019s no fire season any more. People are tired. It\u2019s a constant battle.\u201d\nI grew up in this state and you\u2019d never really get fires like this in November or December\nThe situation is set to become worse. An exhaustive climate change assessment by the US government predicts the area of the western US consumed by wildfire annually is set to double, or even increase sixfold, within 30 years as the planet continues to warm.\nConfronted by the findings of his government\u2019s scientists, Donald Trump bluntly stated, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d The president has, instead, blamed the \u201cgross mismanagement of forests\u201d in California, a state where the majority of woodland is overseen by the federal government. To add to the confusion, Trump, whose recent ecological pronouncements include \u201coceans are very small\u201d, suggested \u201ccleaning and raking\u201d forests to prevent future conflagrations.\nOthers in the administration argued the issue more conventionally. Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary and former Navy Seal, recently visited Paradise and likened it to Falluja, the Iraqi city flattened during the second Gulf war. Zinke has blamed \u201cradical environmentalists\u201d for preventing proper management of the forests and has vowed to loosen rules to allow more intervention.\nDecades of fire suppression by firefighters has interrupted the natural cycle of forest regeneration, allowing fuel to build up and ignite in huge blazes. During the Ronald Reagan administration, the government spent a few hundred thousand dollars on firefighting \u2013 this year it could top $4bn.\nThe idea of \u201cthinning\u201d the forest to reduce this fuel, however, is viewed suspiciously by many ecologists who see it as a euphemism for logging that can make wildfires more rampant. \u201cIt may make donors some money but it won\u2019t do anything to help communities facing the dangers of wildfires,\u201d said Westerling.\nThere\u2019s agreement, at least, that rustic settlements need to adapt \u2013 better building materials to resist flying embers, moats of cleared vegetation around houses, widened roads to act as firebreaks. One in three Americans now live among forested areas, with many of them drawn to scenes similar to Paradise \u2013 an affordable enclave nestled in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, a bucolic patchwork of almond farms and vineyards.\nThe more complicated question is what to do when things start to go awry, when fires and floods spurred by climate change force growing numbers of Americans to flee their homes. Rebuilding is under way in Santa Rosa following the fires last year, but \u201cfor every building going up you see about 10 lots empty and another 10 for sale,\u201d admitted Shirlee Zane, supervisor of Sonoma county. \u201cClimate change is here and affecting us in catastrophic ways.\u201d\nJody Jones, Paradise\u2019s mayor, has vowed the town will \u201crise from the ashes\u201d, but when you stand in the muddy surrounds of Walmart in Chico, where 75 bedraggled tents full of Paradise evacuees continue to stand, it\u2019s clear that the phenomenon of climate refugees won\u2019t be restricted to places such as Bangladesh and far-flung Pacific islands.\n\u201cA lot of people are desperate,\u201d said Naomi Larae, who had nowhere else to turn to other than the encampment, known in a sardonic nod to Hollywood as \u201cWallywood\u201d, and has suffered the indignity of having her tent stolen.\nBack in Paradise, the town twice mistakenly called \u201cPleasure\u201d by Trump, Ruth McLarty sifted through the remnants of her home. Her daughter rescued her laptop, as well as the dog and parakeet, but the clarinet and piano are just cinders now, the sofa merely springs. McLarty picked up one of the few surviving items, a mug with \u201cHawaii\u201d emblazoned on it, only for the handle to split off in her hand.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just surreal, you don\u2019t really know what to think, how to process it,\u201d she said, plucking a blackened bowl from the ashy detritus that was once her kitchen.\n\u201cDo I even bother to try to stay? So much is lost and it will take so long to repopulate. I really don\u2019t know. I just can\u2019t see the future right now.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/natural-disasters", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Of the traumatic consequences of climate change, scientists consider increasingly ferocious wildfires to be one of the most starkly apparent", "date_published": {"$date": 1544432440000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544433841000}, "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "article_section": "World news", "article_tags": ["Wildfires", "California", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Environment", "US news", "Climate change"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/10/the-new-abnormal-why-fires-like-paradise-will-happen-again-and-again", "og:description": "Of the traumatic consequences of climate change, scientists consider increasingly ferocious wildfires to be one of the most starkly apparent", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be1835d04bd43a26608ee4122776a1ccdbc0ce9b/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=b57f5bd64c47d27a21b6b34cfdc10975", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "The new abnormal: why fires like Paradise will happen again and again"}, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be1835d04bd43a26608ee4122776a1ccdbc0ce9b/244_361_3056_1882/master/3056.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=627d6a653dbe2fe31f9ebaf795729eb4", "width": "3056", "height": "1882", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be1835d04bd43a26608ee4122776a1ccdbc0ce9b/244_361_3056_1882/master/3056.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=102cc0071bc2ccd315c906104bbff36c", "description": "Ruth McLarty sifts through the remains of her destroyed home in Paradise, California.\nPhotograph: Talia Herman for the Guardian"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2cd730ae9b5da27e50eb3dc46a9d8d40f72f74b/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7e23d016a841cf553b72c140647f49bc", "width": "3500", "height": "2100", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2cd730ae9b5da27e50eb3dc46a9d8d40f72f74b/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b97c7b16602359f023c82e133381a9a5", "description": "Ruth McLarty, a surgeon, was in the middle of doing an operation at the Feather River hospital in Paradise when she was told to evacuate because of the wildfire.

Tropical cyclone Owen will bring some relief from the stinking heat; lower temperatures and rainfall that should help firefighters control the most threatening fires by midweek.\nQueensland\u2019s exhausted emergency services will not welcome Owen\u2019s track towards the shore with any sense of respite; to them the blended ends of disaster seasons represent a horror scenario, but one many have seen coming.\nPaul Gray, a representative of the Queensland Firefighters\u2019 Union, says the nature of bushfires has noticeably changed in recent years. The fires, he says, have become more intense and longer-lasting. Last week conditions in parts of Queensland were classified \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the first time. The rating has only existed since 2009, but no bushfire in the state since 1966, when warnings were first introduced, would have been considered so dangerous.\n\u201cThey\u2019re always intense, but now you\u2019re getting punished for days and days. Instead of a heatwave lasting one day, heatwaves are lasting four days or longer,\u201d Gray says.\n\u201cIt makes it more difficult for fire crews to stand down, we lose the ability to rotate. Firefighters are working longer hours on protracted incidents for days at a time. There is an increasing need for out-of-state and overseas assistance, because it\u2019s getting harder to relieve our own crews.\u201d\nAustralia, literally on fire. Via the @BOM_au satellite viewer: https://t.co/RO9nl9Y8U4 pic.twitter.com/ndpbJLQmth\nAustralia\u2019s devastating bushfires typically occur far to the south of the tropical Queensland rainforest.\nBut Gray says the fire season in the north now lasts longer. That means a diminishing timeframe to allow emergency services to change tack from firefighting to battling cyclones and floodwaters, which historically have caused many more deaths and wider destruction in Queensland.\n\u201cWe have to turn around very quickly and go from a fire mindset to a floodwater mindset. We have to repurpose vehicles for a different kind of response. It used to be that you could predict when your storm or flood season would be, you\u2019d predict when your fire season would be.\n\u201cClimate change is having an impact on firefighting. There\u2019s scientific data to back it up, but I like to think that because we are on the coal face that people are a little bit more aware of just how things have actually changed.\u201d\n\u201cClimate change is about unprecedented conditions becoming more probable,\u201d says the climate scientist Lesley Hughes. \u201cWhat was normal on average 20 years ago is not normal or average now. If you\u2019re getting unprecedented conditions, that\u2019s what climate scientists have been warning about.\u201d\nThe word unprecedented has been used repeatedly to describe Queensland\u2019s weather this past week. Centuries-old heat records were broken in north Queensland, most remarkably in Cairns, where the hottest November temperature had been a 37.2C day in 1900. On Monday last week, Cairns was recorded at 42.6C. The following four days were all hotter than the previous record.\n\u201cThe strongest relationship between climate change and bushfires is the weather on the day,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cAs climate change continues on, we continue to get increased average temperatures, that\u2019s increasing the probability that we will get dangerous fire weather on any particular day.\u201d\nIn 2014 the Climate Council made six key findings about Australia\u2019s fire season. That risk had increased; the fire season was becoming longer; fires were being fuelled by record conditions; the number of high-risk days would increase; communities should prepare for increasingly severe fires and \u201cthis is the critical decade\u201d.\n\u201cThis is the new reality that people have to live and plan for,\u201d Hughes says.\nLonger bushfire seasons in Australia and the US have already threatened to disrupt longstanding cooperation between the two countries, including sharing personnel, equipment and expertise. Changes to fire seasons have this week created a conflict between the lingering bushfire emergency in Queensland and the forecast of extreme conditions in Victoria. Crews from Victoria were sent north to assist, but the last will return south so their home state can be properly prepared.\n\u201cWhere once we might have shared personnel during bushfire periods ... that\u2019s becoming less and less feasible because countries and states are needing those things at the same time,\u201d Hughes says.\n\u201cThis does point to the need for more resources, as well as increasingly looking at planning regulations, looking at what people can build, having roads to get people out. It\u2019s an example of how the change in risk due to climate change is affecting everything about our daily lives.\u201d\nThere is a kind of bushfire no one can survive; the sort we could barely conceive until a decade ago.\nBefore the catastrophic Black Saturday fires in Victoria, which killed 173 people in February 2009, residents were advised they could choose to remain in their homes and defend their property. The mantra was leave early, or stay, in part to avoid the dangers of having people panic and flee with a fire front approaching.\nIn Queensland last week, emergency services used modelling developed in Victoria after Black Saturday to launch several widespread evacuations. The largest was in the town of Gracemere, near Rockhampton, where about 8,000 people were told to go.\nBeau Dabron, the administration manager at the Gracemere Hotel, stayed in town. He and others watched traffic bank up in town and remain stationary for more than an hour, as people piled into cars and attempted the short drive to Rockhampton.\n\u201cOnce night time fell we had a good view from the pub towards Kabra ... there\u2019s none of that glow, there was no flame. In our minds we felt we were fine. We slept with one eye open just to be safe,\u201d he says.\nWas he worried that this fire could be different?\n\u201cMost people have been through them before, so generally speaking people have something to expect. The fear set in when people said, \u2018the whole town is going\u2019.\u201d\nThe Tropic of Capricorn runs through Gracemere. Conditions turned when the tropical humidity suddenly dropped \u2013 combined with record high temperatures and fierce winds, the ingredients to fuel the most dangerous fires.\nRachel Nolan, a fire ecologist from the University of Western Sydney, says climate change means conditions are drier, as well as warmer.\n\u201cThe two things are really tied together,\u201d Nolan says. \u201cWhen it\u2019s warmer, that means the fuels are going to be drier.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a couple of things that contribute to the risk of fire \u2013 the fuel load, the amount of material that can burn, and how dry that fuel is.\u201d\nRichard Thornton, the chief executive of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards cooperative research centre, says there has been a \u201clong-term moisture deficit\u201d on the Australian east coast that adds to the fire risk.\n\u201cThe whole of the east coast ... is pretty dry at the moment. The underlying condition is dry. What that means is that if you get a day that\u2019s hot, that\u2019s windy. ... it will burn with a ferocity.\u201d\nThornton says the Queensland fires are \u201canother example of some of the extremes that are possible\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly unusual, if not unknown, for these sorts of temperatures in this location. It\u2019s pretty clear that something is changing in terms of fire season.\n\u201cI think that what we\u2019re seeing in Queensland is tragic for those who are there. For the rest of the country, who are coming into the beginning of summer, this is a real wake-up call saying, \u2018Now is the time to prepare\u2019.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/wildfires", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/natural-disasters", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "With cyclone season under way, exhausted emergency services are more aware than most that climate change is beginning to pose impossible challenges", "date_published": {"$date": 1543874414000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1543887257000}, "authors": ["Ben Smee"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Bushfires", "Wildfires", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Australia news", "Climate change", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/04/bushfires-tropics-queensland-terrifying-new-reality-cyclones-flooding", "og:description": "With cyclone season under way, exhausted emergency services are more aware than most that climate change is beginning to pose impossible challenges", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb99b808b3509f65dd716c86e249642c5e09c945/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=68123d57cdca9a5bfaa3275a50f53d20", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Bushfires in the tropics: Queensland faces terrifying new reality"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb99b808b3509f65dd716c86e249642c5e09c945/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=47006c6bf91bb8cf5b17a33db52290b7", "width": "3000", "height": "1800", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb99b808b3509f65dd716c86e249642c5e09c945/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d5d658d680ee892157afaa895fe29da8", "description": "Queensland firefighters say blazes have become more intense and longer-lasting in recent years.\nPhotograph: Rob Griffith/AFP/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc0790aa2c3613145ed8c66"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/04/alec-taskforce-vote-approve-anti-environment-measures", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Inside a little-known bulwark of conservative state policy, in a hotel conference room in Washington DC, state lawmakers and corporate lobbyists last week voted for a slate of anti-environment measures.\nThey approved resolutions supporting stripping tax benefits from electric vehicles and endorsing Donald Trump\u2019s pro-fossil fuel energy agenda. And they voted down a proposal to limit monopoly control of the power industry, which backers said would give consumers more choice and help grow renewable electricity faster and more cheaply.\nThe group, a taskforce of the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), did so behind closed doors. They barred press from the rooms where they called roll. When voice votes were close and a tally was required, the business representatives weighing in on what kinds of policies state legislatures should pursue voted in secret. They cast ballots on paper, in a change that four sources said organizers announced was meant to keep the process confidential from reporters.\nAn Alec spokeswoman, Anna Tarnawski, said taskforce meetings and votes are closed to the press because \u201clegislators are testing ideas and debating, and often are taking contrary positions for the purpose of debate and informing the conversation. They don\u2019t want to be held to a policy declaration in the meeting because it might not necessarily be what they believe or where they\u2019re going.\u201d\nThe deliberations of a private group such as Alec, where elected officials meet out of public view with big business, highlight the divides the Republican party is struggling with as it courts both rightwing social conservatives and free-market Republicans.\nAlec has lost prominent members, including ExxonMobil and Verizon. Advocates who deny the science behind manmade climate change are regular attendees. Verizon ended its support after an anti-Muslim activist spoke at an annual Alec meeting.\nBut corporate influence over statehouses is strong and was on display in the lobbying fight over the future of the power industry. A trade group for investor-owned power companies opposed the idea of subjecting them to more competition.\nRepresentatives of the group, the Edison Electric Institute, refused to answer questions from the Guardian following the Friday meeting. Kristine Telford and Jennifer Jura, both in external affairs, had a conference organizer escort them out of a back exit and wouldn\u2019t acknowledge reporters when addressed by name.\nCompetition supporters said the fight shows how much power utilities have over state governments and the people who are forced to buy their product.\nMichigan state representative Gary Glenn, the Alec resolution sponsor and head of the house energy committee who lost a primary race for the Michigan senate, said lawmakers are controlled by power companies \u201cin fear of political retaliation\u201d.\nGlenn claimed the industry donated $1m against him in his primary election.\n\u201cI think it is because of the political power of the companies. It was the case in Lansing before this year\u2019s election that a lot of legislators walked around afraid of their own shadows when it came to energy,\u201d Glenn said.\nA spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, the utility trade group, declined to comment on why representatives ignored reporters but argued the competition proposal wouldn\u2019t help consumers.\nBut competition supporters say it is obvious that competition drives down costs and offered Texas, which has competition over power generation, as an example. Texas has low power costs and more wind energy than any other state.\n\u201cCompetition leads to better-quality service, better-quality product at a lower price. Those simple free market principles apply to the provision of electricity just as they do every other commodity in service,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cThis is one of those issues where inevitably 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, we are going to look at this as a quaint and amusing debate because technology means competition is eventually going to win out.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans", "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/lobbying", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "In Washington last week, Alec, a group that links lobbyists with state lawmakers, approved measures to boost Donald Trump\u2019s pro-fossil fuel agenda", "date_published": {"$date": 1543954879000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1543954879000}, "authors": ["Emily Holden"], "article_section": "US news", "article_tags": ["US politics", "Climate change", "Republicans", "Lobbying", "Environment", "US news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/04/alec-taskforce-vote-approve-anti-environment-measures", "og:description": "In Washington last week, Alec, a group that links lobbyists with state lawmakers, approved measures to boost Donald Trump\u2019s pro-fossil fuel agenda", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9149b5b10613a66e2e1a809044bafa8cfa4d40e/0_357_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=19ff08656b699b2919497b79cd2e7968", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Rightwing taskforce secretly approves anti-environment resolutions"}, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9149b5b10613a66e2e1a809044bafa8cfa4d40e/0_357_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eb58e82a0d47247c2fb90dfe6e938758", "width": "3000", "height": "1800", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9149b5b10613a66e2e1a809044bafa8cfa4d40e/0_357_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f1710d98b77c7732ff80b10a1a4bd99a", "description": "An Alec spokeswoman said taskforce meetings and votes are closed to the press because \u2018legislators are testing ideas and debating\u2019.\nPhotograph: Mark Wilson/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07915a2c3613145ed8c6b"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/05/trumps-disbelief-wont-stop-dangerous-climate-change", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Donald Trump when asked about the fourth national climate assessment, authored by 13 government agencies and hundreds of the US\u2019s top climate scientists. His administration had tried to hide the report, publishing it on Black Friday when many Americans were either recovering from a Thanksgiving food coma or stampeding department store sales.\nThe administration\u2019s plan backfired badly \u2013 the latest alarming climate science report became front-page news. Numerous Republican politicians were asked about it on TV news and politics shows, and their answers demonstrated that Trump\u2019s climate science denial continues to pervade the GOP.\nRepublican party leaders\u2019 answers ranged from platitudes \u2013 such as \u201cour climate always changes\u201d and \u201cinnovation\u201d is all that is needed to solve the problem \u2013 to accusations that \u201ca lot of these scientists are driven by the money\u201d.\nAddressing the latter point,one of the report\u2019s lead authors, Prof Katharine Hayhoe, noted that many of its contributors were \u201cpaid zero dollars\u201d and estimated that in the time she devoted to the assessment, she could have written eight of her own papers. Conversely, GOP politicians and operatives are paid millions of dollars annually by the fossil fuel industry. Some people are clearly driven by the money, and it\u2019s not climate scientists.\nTrump\u2019s comments did not stop at disbelief \u2013 he also appeared to shift blame to other countries and tout the US\u2019s clean air and water.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to have China, and Japan, and all of Asia, and all of these other countries \u2013 you know, [the report] addresses our country. Right now, we\u2019re at the cleanest we\u2019ve ever been, and that\u2019s very important to me. But if we\u2019re clean but every other place on Earth is dirty, that\u2019s not so good. So, I want clean air, I want clean water \u2013 very important,\u201d the president said.\nBREAKING: \"I don't believe it.\"President Trump passively rejects the findings of the major new US government multi-agency report that says climate change will wallop the US economy in years to come. https://t.co/ImcZSeAowf pic.twitter.com/hcUnY8Jdui\nThese comments confuse climate change with air pollution, but the two are connected. The national climate assessment report pointed out that climate change was exacerbating wildfires, which in turn create air pollution. The Camp fire in November produced so much smoke that California had the worst air quality in the world at the time.\nA key figure showed that climate change had approximately doubled the area burned by wildfires in the western US, and the report noted that \u2013 contrary to the administration\u2019s frequent claims \u2013 this increase was \u201cmore closely related to climate factors than to fire suppression, local fire management, or other non-climate factors\u201d.\nTrump\u2019s claim that US air is \u201cthe cleanest it\u2019s ever been\u201d is also not strictly true. Despite a long-term downward trend, owing in large part to the replacement of coal power plants that the Trump administration is desperately trying to save, particulate matter levels were up slightly from 2016 to 2017.\nThe administration\u2019s efforts to weaken and repeal every possible environmental regulation certainly do not merit credit for the long-term improvement in air and water quality in the US.\nTrump\u2019s efforts to shift blame to other countries is also at odds with the fact that every other nation in the world has signed up to the Paris climate accords and only one government has announced its intent to withdraw from them.\nThe Republican party has become Trump\u2019s as well. The few party leaders who were willing to acknowledge the threats detailed in the report claimed that all the climate policies proposed thus far would be harmful to the economy, and that we should instead focus on innovation.\nWhile individual climate policies may or may not slow the economy, the scientific research is clear that climate change will curb economic growth \u2013 particularly in the US. The assessment report makes clear that if we\u2019re worried about the economy, we must slow global warming. And while research into potential carbon-cutting technology innovations is needed, hoping that somebody will invent a way out of this mess is too big a risk. It is accepted that solving global warming won\u2019t be cheap or easy but failing to do so will come at a much higher cost and not just in terms of money.\nThose were the least irrational of the Republican party\u2019s reactions to the report, as most of the five stages of climate denial were on display. One conservative panelist went as far as to claim: \u201cWe had two of the coldest years, biggest drop in global temperatures that we have had since the 1980s, the biggest in the last 100 years.\u201d\nIn reality, at the end of this year, 2014\u20132018 will be the five hottest years ever recorded. And virtually everything Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said about the report was wrong, including that it was \u201cnot based on facts \u2026 not data-driven\u201d.\nAs the US astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has said: \u201cThe good thing about science is that it\u2019s true whether or not you believe in it.\u201d\n.\nAmericans elected many climate-realist Democrats to the House of Representative and state governorships in the midterms. If the Trump administration and the GOP continue to a platform of disbelief on climate change, he and Senate Republicans may also face being voted out in 2020.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/analysis"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Republican platform is not only at odds with science but potentially US voters in 2020", "date_published": {"$date": 1543989616000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544007130000}, "authors": ["Dana Nuccitelli"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "Climate change", "Donald Trump", "Trump administration", "Science", "US politics", "US news", "Republicans", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/05/trumps-disbelief-wont-stop-dangerous-climate-change", "og:description": "Republican platform is not only at odds with science but potentially US voters in 2020", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47a7bf4e6758e5f3b4690df1a01cbf291b0392cb/0_125_5104_3064/master/5104.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=9e6085dfbaaaa2ca4981c077c5c1186e", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Trump's disbelief won't stop dangerous climate change"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47a7bf4e6758e5f3b4690df1a01cbf291b0392cb/0_125_5104_3064/master/5104.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bf3846956a74b75251c61cf068becf89", "width": "5104", "height": "3064", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47a7bf4e6758e5f3b4690df1a01cbf291b0392cb/0_125_5104_3064/master/5104.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d9e6265bcc537cf372f5200dfaebc7c7", "description": "Flames from the Camp fire burn near Big Bend, California.\nPhotograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34c7d02da91dafe03846cae22d3fc49840041c1a/0_0_642_345/master/642.png?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=690028b206d5c6a00c765fed027dca24", "width": "642", "height": "345", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34c7d02da91dafe03846cae22d3fc49840041c1a/0_0_642_345/master/642.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4e8ee60f58c0ca5635dcf11dca0b3e7c", "description": "The cumulative forest area burned by wildfires in the western US between 1984 and 2015.

It means emissions are heading in the opposite direction to the deep cuts urgently needed, say scientists, to fight climate change.\nThe rise is due to the growing number of cars on the roads and a renaissance of coal use and means the world remains on the track to catastrophic global warming. However, the report\u2019s authors said the emissions trend can still be turned around by 2020, if cuts are made in transport, industry and farming emissions.\nThe research by the Global Carbon Project was launched at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, where almost 200 nations are working to turn the vision of tackling climate change agreed in Paris in 2015 into action. The report estimates CO2 emissions will rise by 2.7% in 2018, sharply up on the plateau from 2014-16 and 1.6% rise in 2017.\nAlmost all countries are contributing to the rise, with emissions in China up 4.7%, in the US by 2.5% and in India by 6.3% in 2018. The EU\u2019s emissions are near flat, but this follows a decade of strong falls.\n\u201cThe global rise in carbon emissions is worrying, because to deal with climate change they have to turn around and go to zero eventually,\u201d said Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, at the University of East Anglia,who led the research published in the journal Nature. \u201cWe are not seeing action in the way we really need to. This needs to change quickly.\u201d\nThe current Paris agreement pledges from nations will only limit global warming to 3C, while even a rise of 1.5C will be disastrous for many people, according to the world\u2019s scientists. \nLe Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 said: \u201cI hope that by 2020, when [governments] have to come back with stronger commitments, we will then see a turning point.\u201d\nThe International Energy Agency\u2019s data also shows rising emissions in 2018. Its executive director, Fatih Birol, said: \u201cThis turnaround should be another warning to governments as they meet in Katowice this week.\u201d\n\u201cEvery year of rising emissions puts economies and the homes, lives and livelihoods of billions of people at risk,\u201d said Christiana Figueres, at the Mission 2020 campaign, who was the UN climate diplomat overseeing the Paris agreement. \u201cWe are in the age of exponentials,\u201d she said, with renewable energy and electric cars expanding rapidly, but with the extreme weather impacts of climate change doing the same. \u201cWe have to ensure it is the solutions exponential curve that is going to win the race.\u201d\nProf David Reay, at the University of Edinburgh, UK, said: \u201cThis annual balance sheet for global carbon is comprehensive and scientifically robust. Its message is more brutal than ever: we are deep in the red and heading still deeper. For all our sakes, world leaders must now do what is required.\u201d\nHarjeet Singh, at ActionAid International, said news of the emissions\u2019 rise should galvanise those at the climate summit: \u201cThere\u2019s way too much complacency in the air at these talks.\u201d\nThe \u201cdark news\u201d of rising emissions is merging with two other alarming trends, according to Prof David Victor, at the University of California, San Diego, in an article with colleagues also published in Nature on Wednesday.\nFalling air pollution is enabling more of the sun\u2019s warmth to reach the Earth\u2019s surface, as aerosol pollutants reflect sunlight, while a long-term natural climate cycle in the Pacific is entering a warm phase. Victor said: \u201cGlobal warming is accelerating. [These] three trends will combine over the next 20 years to make climate change faster and more furious than anticipated.\u201d\nThe Global Carbon Budget, produced by 76 scientists from 57 research institutions in 15 countries, found the major drivers of the 2018 increase were more coal-burning in China and India as their economies grew, and more oil used in more transport. Industry also used more gas. Renewable energy grew rapidly, but not enough to offset the increased use of fossil fuel.\n\u201cThere was hope China was rapidly moving away from coal power, but the last two years have shown it will not be so easy to say farewell quickly,\u201d said Jan Ivar Korsbakken, at the Centre for International Climate Research in Norway.\nIn the three years since the Paris agreement was signed, financial institutions have invested more than $478bn in the world\u2019s top 120 coal plant developers, according to a report by the NGOs Urgewald, BankTrack and partners. Chinese banks led the underwriting of coal investments, while Japanese banks led the loans, the NGOs found.\nIn the US, emissions rose as an unusually cold winter and hot summer boosted demand for both heating and cooling in homes. But it is expected that emissions will start to decline again in 2019, as cheap gas, wind and solar continue to displace coal \u2013 coal use has dropped 40% since 2005 and it is now at its lowest level since 1979.\nThe global rise in emissions, even in rich, developed nations, is very concerning, said Antonio Marcondes, Brazil\u2019s chief negotiator at the UN summit: \u201cEmission reductions are like credit-card debt: the longer they are put off, the more expensive and painful they become.\u201d\nBrazil reached its 2020 emissions targets early, but fears of a rise in deforestation under the new president, Jair Bolsonaro, could reverse this. But Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 is optimistic that the rapid global rises seen in recent decades will not return: \u201cThis is very unlikely.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Rapid cuts needed to protect billions of people from rising emissions due to increase in use of cars and coal", "date_published": {"$date": 1544032809000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544037002000}, "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Coal", "Fossil fuels", "Environment", "Energy", "UK news", "European Union", "Europe", "World news", "Paris climate agreement"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/05/brutal-news-global-carbon-emissions-jump-to-all-time-high-in-2018", "og:description": "Rapid cuts needed to protect billions of people from rising emissions due to increase in use of cars and coal", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/430dc1e239fcaa8b70078f18ae6df43347b701dd/0_325_4800_2881/master/4800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=281f736bad22e62a837fbd6df593c833", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "'Brutal news': global carbon emissions jump to all-time high in 2018"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "0", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/430dc1e239fcaa8b70078f18ae6df43347b701dd/0_325_4800_2881/master/4800.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d98a8d1d2871428fc02e6e813744aee5", "width": "4800", "height": "2881", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/430dc1e239fcaa8b70078f18ae6df43347b701dd/0_325_4800_2881/master/4800.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=961b4f446474779604643eba437bc13f", "description": "Almost all countries are contributing to the rise in emissions, with China up 4.7%, the US by 2.5% and India by 6.3% in 2018.\nPhotograph: Michel Euler/AP"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b5fe2c29373b2bf5a807a13d23c66bf0b25c89d/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=01784ad1d0ac1a00548194f94369664e", "width": "3500", "height": "2333", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b5fe2c29373b2bf5a807a13d23c66bf0b25c89d/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42969346e1f06645dc899cb3b72012a1", "description": "The last two years have shown it won\u2019t be easy for China to say farewell to coal use quickly, according to Norway\u2019s Centre for International Climate Research.

Nitrogen is 78\ufb01 of air and if we distill it out as we could by way of a small domestic fractional distillation unit powered by PV on the roof ( a 4 kW array gives about 3250 Kwh pa in the NW of the Country) we ger a cold liquid we use in cryogenics and as gas at atmospheric pressure but we could use it - if we had the means in its supercritical phase wich is what it will reach if the cold liquid was in a strong tank and allowed to warm up to ordinary - say 20\u00b0C temperature. At that po te pressure inside the tank would be about 44,000 psi. Each Ignition of fuel in your delivers a 'punch' of about 700 psi to each piston so we can convert your car to run on nitrogen completely cleanly.

It is needed not just to replace oil, coal and gas but EV and Turbines, Centralised power generation and ever growing grid systems all of which have direct and indirect carbon footprints that must go - they are as inimical to man as any other carbon emission which not only has to be replaced but we also need to reduce the carbon level in the atmosphere back from where it will go - so worse is to come before it can get better - back to below 300 ppm.

With respect the evidence is otherwise. The Met Office putting 5.4\u00b0C at 2070 is the global anomaly bt it will be much higher by then for the HNA. It might help to look at 'wet bulb' (Wikipedia) above a wet bulb temperature of 35\u00b0C our cooling system fails and we die. So first it was 2\u00b0C anomaly that was 'dangerous' now lowered to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial. The GA for July 2016 was 2.24\u00b0C and in 2017 2.23\u00b0C (Note NASA Gistemp MERAA2). What faces us is exponential mortality should we fail to reverse the trend. \nYou talk of a well mixed GHG. In fact (not the excellent NASA global graphics on 1880 - 2017 change) the accretion of carbon in the Northern hemisphere. As a matter of Occam's Razor - given that the anomaly accelerated as we levelled our emissions (2012 - 2017) - that something other than our emissions is now the main driver. CH4 is 84 times the GHG on emission than CO2 (and breaks down in the troposphere to CO2 and H20 - both long term GHGs). It os now ear 200 ppb as against highest peaks over the previous 800,000 years of 780ppb. We have, I fear, let the gene out f the bottle in the Arctic. \nBut you miss point. You are right on storage which is why, as Google concluded, the only hope we have is in new disruptive tech. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9URyJBuNM . What you can see here is a 2013 video showing a single moving part management and metered flow device enabling us to use undreamt of pressures. \nIt is a device (<pat2pdf > US8556133 is a copy of one of its global patents) which in replacing the spring used in current flow valves by balancing pressures enables us to use nitrogen not as cold cryogenic fluid but warm as a supercritical fluid in which highly energetic state a contained amount will be at some 44,000 psi. That can be flowed in a controlled in a precisely metered way by the PVM (piston valve-manifold) to run your car (on conversion) and your home, train, hospital and air conditioning dehumidifiers et al - clean. And off grid - live on a mountain top or in a desert. \nIt is storage of sunlight in nitrogen both ubiquitous and 'free' - using almost entirely old well tried and tested technology given a new future by a bit of kit as simple as a hairpin. jmcbruce@btinternet.com", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "123467019", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "123475305", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1544276579000}, "author": "JulesBywaterLees", "author_id": "4738374", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Tested areas of climate science- measuring temperature, done in the field [showing warming]measuring ice.measuring the energy balance- i.e. using satellites the incoming short wave light is measured against long wave IR emitted to space- this shows the greenhouse effect in operation.\nI look forward to your response.", "recommendation_count": "3", "in_reply_to": "123474761", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "123475131", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1544275810000}, "author": "GoldenAppleCorps", "author_id": "17327071", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "You\u2019re a scientist who doesn\u2019t know the difference between storage and extraction.

So whilst I could wax lyrical about breakthroughs in thermo-electic generators that can operate in the \"sweet spot\" temperature range of an ICE exhaust and up the total engine power output by as much as 10%, it will not make a damn bit of difference if the car is an incremental one.The Gates Foundation (among others) are researching synthetic hydrocarbons (using CO2 \"recycled\" from either the atmosphere or seawater) and Nobel Laureate George Olah proposed a Methanol Economy as an energy carrier from either nuclear or renewable energy. Unfortunately it is almost impossible to even imagine the scale these options would have to operate at.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol_economyAll in all it is not looking too good!", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "123461861", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "123467393", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1544226861000}, "author": "RobLeighton", "author_id": "100731794", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Agree that R&D is most important.

The present 1 degree warming is the result of a small proportion of nations doing development on the back of fossils. It is tiny tiny tiny. If 6 or 10 billion people do the same 2 century journey this planet is utterly fucked. \nThus everyone agrees that it is only fair that we in the west throw our resources into R&D (and China and India certainly does the same). People will not repeat our history (first car owned by grand grand father - grand father - father - son who finally get an EV). The first car of a huge proportion of families will be zero-emission in the near future. \nSimilar with phones. They do not bother to repeat our history of a century of land-lines before rejoicing in a decade of phone modems, VGA screens and faxes like we did. They go straight to smartphone with 4G internet. \nFact is that we humans have absolutely zero problem with making energy. We know how to make energy out of pretty much everything - including the lunar orbit (tidal). \nThe one thing we humans are terrible at is to store energy efficiently. The best we do is hydro-dams storing kinetic energy. A bit of flywheels (century old tech). And batteries that still are less than stellar in terms of bulk and weight. \nSo what should be the strategy of the upcoming COP is to throw all our R&D into energy storage. We already know how to get energy out of wind (solar energy), hydro (solar energy), waves (solar energy), shortwave radiation (solar energy), fossil fuels (solar energy stored). We know how to get energy out of atoms (nuclear). We know how to use latent energy (heat pumps). And we effing know how to tap into the Earth core energy as well (look at Iceland). And yes, we know how to extract energy from the lunar orbit. \nPoint is that we do not need to invent more ways to make energy. \nWhat we must learn to do asap is to store energy cheap and at scale. Because that is the thing that will fix it. \nFossil fuels has one thing going for it - it is solar energy stored at pretty good energy density. The problem with fossil fuels is that in terms of storing it is really slow. It takes hundreds of thousands of years for the planet to make the fossil fuel we need in a year. This is why the carbon we dig and pump up is typically hundreds of million years old. So it is not exactly sustainable as a resource. And climate change is happening because we so radically intervean with rapid extraction of carbon from a several hundred million year carbon cycle. \nWhat we need to do is to store energy (what fossils learnt). Hydrogen is a good energy carrier - the problem with it is that it takes a lot of energy to get to it - because it tie so well with Oxygen (water is a really strong bond - easily surviving the high energy bombing of solar and cosmic radiation as they float around in space). \nSecondly I hope that they do agree to intensify research on CCS. Not to clean coal plants (that is just silly) - but there are CO2 emissions from making steal and stuff. To capture the byproduct on source is important. \nThirdly I hope they agree to put more money into biochemistry. It is demonstrated that the animals we have tamed over the last 10,000 years can burp much less methane with dietary means. \nWhich leads to the final problem - how to deal with the soils on our planet. We are effing with a lot of sub-fossil molecules. \nBut most of all I hope that by now, politicians realize that their 1.5 degree wishful ambition is just that - a wish. And that the true challenge is to keep the forcing below 3 and 4 and 5 degrees if chance plays along. \nHumans can not do anything about climate sensitivity and feedbacks. We can only do something about our waste-gasses. After 4 decades of being in doubt about how well science has nailed natural sensitivity and uncertainty of ever-increasing feedback-loops - maybe sometimes soon we can hope that elected leaders are able to ponder the millennial scale effects of current 4 year election-cycle policies. \nWe can do nothing about physics.

Broecker, still in his chair at Columbia University told us in 2017 'No amount of emission reduction alone can avoid disaster\" .\nWe don't hear because we delude ourselves that we have yet to run out of road. \nWe base policy on the global anomaly - an irrelevance since he Southern and Northern Hemispheres temperature divergence. Where 90% of us live in the latitude band 44-64\u00b0N, the anomaly is above 1.8\u00b0C. \nWe are not threatened by extinction - we are going extinct. \nBut we delude ourselves by ignoring the data applying to where we live. The data is available at <NASAGistemp> dTs, meteorological ground station tables. \nWe also fudge the benchmarks. We aim to stay below '1.5\u00b0C above the pre-industrial temperature'. But to facilitate 'business as usual' we have replaced that with a GA based on the 1951-1980 mean. Correct the figure and the anomaly is c1.8\u00b0C - above the real pre-industrial 'normal earth figure.' \nI raised these thought with the Met Office who recently issued a press release warning that we would be at 5.4\u00b0C by 2070. We will all be dead long before that.\nWe are not warming at the Paris 2015 predicate of 0.01\u00b0C pa or its 6th October 2018 revision to 0.02\u00b0C but by at least 0.08\u00b0C pa.\n 2018 has been cooler than 2017 because La Nina has been in effect following the strong El Nino, but with the November NHA at 1.38\u00b0C that is only 0.01\u00b0C below the 2016 figure indicating a return to trend. So we may expect 2019 to be hotter etc. \nThe dire Met Office prediction is, I fear, optimistic. The system has been in (trend) acceleration since 2013 since the advent of Arctic methane.\n Poland is, as are all COPs, a political exercise. So there is an imperative not to frighten the women and horses. To which end it is an exercise based on delusion and patently and badly flawed models on which it uses out of date or inapposite data. Hence such errors as the Paris predicate and the recent revision which is no less flawed. . \nThe reality is simply this. However much Sir David Attenborough may plead for our lives there remains such scepticism on global warming - by those whose business it doesn't help , and that includes all governments and most big business - that only lip service is being paid to doing anything that would actually reverse global warming. \n\"What would it really take to reverse Climate Change?\" was published in IEEE Spectrum. It is the considered conclusion by Google of its $850,000,000 'save the planet', RE>C project (find renewable energy cheaper than coal) which it began in 2007, and abandoned in 2011 as 'unachievable'. \nIts conclusion was stark. The only hope of avoiding our extinction lay in the invention of a new 'disruptive technology'.\nSince then such a technology has been invented. I know this since I am its unfortunate inventor.\nUnfortunate - because turkeys don't kill themselves for Xmas. Which means that my \"sunlight stored in SCF nitrogen 'battery'\" to give clean, free (after amortisation of installation cost), energy, at point of use, sits on the shelf and will stay there until someone realises that if not deployed to wage global war on global warming then, in absence of other better technology, they and their family will be part of the price we will be paying as we go extinction - people are already dying. Extinction is the price to be paid for 'business as usual'. . We are happy for others to die so we must await for more than just the odd tennis player being overcome at the US Open in our civilised world. Then we might wake up - but maybe too late. \nWhat we now urgently need to engage in is to replace not just oil, coal and gas but all the post Kyoto incremental alternatives whose lifetime direct and indirect carbon footprints have to go or we do. We need to replace power stations and the grids. \nAnd we need to recover carbon from the atmosphere wWhich this technology will do on a commercial and domestic scale. - to be 'put out' each week. \nFractional distillation can be powered by PV to give nitrogen at -196\u00b0C, as a liquid, to be . 'tanked' under the management and control of the new device, the PVM (piston valve-manifold). Left to warm to ambient temperature, the nitrogen passes through its phase states into being a supercritical fluid at about 44,000 psi, enough to replace the normal car engine power, at full throttle, of c700 psi per ignition. \n If the state doesn't fund 100% such technology it doesn't happen.

Then one must gather the team after the review. And not only rewrite the paper (one never does) but one may have to rerun some test-statistics and do read some new papers that was published between submission and review. \nIn short - science is never able to time a publication date. Maybe Nature and Science have a catalogue big enough to say they can hold a paper for a month for an op-ed on the study and general interest of the subject. But for scientists - publication is around the clock. \nWhat you see is that maybe that general media do highlight science a bit - because all eyes are now on COP24. \nBut if you follow \"Geophysical Research Letters\" and \"Science\" and \"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Sosciety, London\" etc - stuff \"peak\" all the time.

And film makers do make films outside of the Oscar week. \nThere is not a flurry of studies and reports being made by science this week - as little as there are a flurry of movies being filmed during the Oscar week. \nThe \"flurry\" is just pop-culture that media represent. And all the data you see now from science reports are minimum 2 years old. Because first you must submit it. Then you must ponder the review. Then you must wait for it to be published. Then you must wait for science to ponder it before thinking about adding it to the report. Then the report goes on review.

To have no mention anywhere of the 12 years we (at best) have to make any difference is a shocking omission. Climate change is the greatest issue the world is facing and readers can\u2019t have the message highlighted enough.\nCan I also ask that you don\u2019t print any letters suggesting that all we need to do is turn our thermostat down and consume more responsibly? As Naomi Klein illustrates in This Changes Everything, the idea that climate change can be solved by personal responsibility alone is a fallacy (and one of the reasons why we are in this mess).\nThis issue requires policymakers everywhere to act now but they won\u2019t do it if they don\u2019t think people care, which is why it is the responsibility of the press to report the danger we are in.Rebecca FrickerLoughton, Essex\n\u2022 The collapse of civilisation is on the horizon, David Attenborough told the UN\u2019s annual climate conference in Poland. We are privileged that the first people\u2019s seat at the conference was filled by one of our greatest national treasures. A few words from him in Blue Planet 2 led to the start of a transformation of our relationship with plastic.\nBut, this is the thin end of the wedge compared with the changes required to enable our children to live out their lives peacefully. We need to radically change our relationship with what we eat, how we heat our houses, where our power comes from and how we transport ourselves. Four years ago the economist Lord Stern said we need an effort that surpasses the combined efforts of the first and second world wars to tackle the approaching existential threat.\nTo meet the changes we need strong political leadership, nationally and locally to steer through this unprecedented time. I look around the local political landscape and see very few people from any party willing to meet the challenge.\nSince this year\u2019s IPCC report, both Bristol and Manchester have voted unanimously to declare a climate emergency. Our national government is focusing on Brexit, which is merely a distraction in the face of what is the greatest threat our species has ever faced.\nWe need a new generation of political leaders to emerge and put our collapsing climate at the heart of all their policies.Caspar HughesExeter, Devon\n\u2022 Your editorial\u2019s revelation (6 December) that the 2014-16 carbon reductions were the result of an economic slowdown that helped fuel the rise of populism appears daunting for future climate-change initiatives. However, rising carbon emissions and extreme rightwing electoral advances can be reversed. This will require a massive increase in economic activity arising from environmental policies that are clearly seen to improve prospects for the majority through an emphasis on green jobs in every community.\nThe obvious starting point is to make every home, commercial and industrial building energy efficient worldwide. In the US this is one of the central demands of the youngest of the new members of Congress, Alexandria Ocasio\u2013Cortez, with her call for a select committee for a green new deal, an initiative supported by Bernie Sanders and other elected progressives. Also key will be the rapid transition to renewables and low-carbon local transport systems.\nTo reduce political opposition to such a shift will require cash to help communities initially threatened by such measures, from scrappage schemes for polluting cars, subsidies for a rapid growth in electric public and private transport, through to job conversion schemes for Polish coal miners threatened by the latest climate talks.\nThe massive amount of money required should come from higher but fairer taxes, while hammering tax dodgers, with increased public expenditure and incentives for affluent savers to invest in such schemes. If this proves inadequate then green quantitative easing should also be introduced. The world really has no other choice.Colin HinesEast Twickenham, Middlesex\n\u2022 We are hurtling towards a climate apocalypse (no hyperbole), and yet the one thing everyone can do is given surprisingly little publicity: change your energy supplier to one which only uses renewable energy.\nWe recently changed our supplier to one of several companies offering 100% renewable energy. The change-over was easy, and we now keep our house snuggly warm, comfortable in the knowledge that we are helping to save the planet. Please, everyone, change to a green supplier. Together we can save the world.Daniel Emlyn-JonesOxford\n\u2022 Before claiming that the wheel, agriculture and gene-edited girls are \u201cMonolith moments\u201d (Letters, 5 December), remember that the monoliths in 2001: A Space Odyssey were of alien origin. While the monolith in the Dawn of Man sequence may or may not have triggered the use of weapons, the discovery of the second monolith, buried on the moon, served only to send a signal, possibly a warning, to the alien intelligence of mankind\u2019s first steps into space. This led to the encounter with a monolith in Jupiter space, the star gate and astronaut Bowman\u2019s journey \u201cbeyond the infinite\u201d and his return to Earth as the star child. Alas, there is no sign today of any alien coming to help us avoid the collapse of civilisation predicted by David Attenborough at the UN climate change summit. We have to do that by ourselves.Graeme CottamPetersfield, Hampshire\n\u2022 Rather than being \u201cmost worrying\u201d, the UN report suggesting \u201cthat the relatively good performance of the years 2014-16 in reducing carbon emissions was the result of the economic slowdown\u201d (Editorial, 6 December) indicates that we urgently need more economic slowdowns.David MurrayWallington, Surrey\n\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

This, surely, is just the kind of radical action the world needs if we are ever to escape the tyranny of the motor vehicle and make our cities green, pleasant and quieter.\nJust imagine being able to hop on and off buses, trams or trains at will, without scrabbling around for coins or tickets. Picture the reduction of traffic that would surely result from shifting the incentives so dramatically: the buses whizzing down uncongested streets, the less stinky air and less stress-inducing crossings, without the queues of cars pressing to squeeze through before the light turns red, their impatient drivers huffing and honking and swearing.\nThe proposal from the tiny (600,000 people) European country\u2019s newly elected government, a coalition including Greens and led by the Democratic party\u2019s Xavier Bettel, is not so much the habit-altering \u201cnudge\u201d popularised by behavioural economics as a giant shove. Stop driving!\nAnd in Luxembourg this makes sense. Its capital suffers some of the worst traffic congestion in the world. People under 20 already travel for nothing. Of course, the city\u2019s buses and trains will still cost money to run (salaries of drivers and managers; fuel; vehicle purchase and maintenance). But rather than people paying for this with tickets, the system will be funded via some form of taxation. Tallinn in Estonia already operates a similar scheme.\nAside from the health and local environmental benefits of such a policy, which could include an economic dividend if Luxembourg becomes a more desirable place to live and work, policies that discourage driving also reduce carbon emissions. With around a quarter of European emissions due to transport, 70% of which are from road traffic, it is tempting to jump up down and demand that Europe\u2019s bigger capital cities should follow suit.\nIf there is a catch \u2013 and I think there is \u2013 it concerns walking and cycling. Pedestrians sit atop any road user hierarchy that is focused around sustainability and safety (such as that employed by the London Plan, until former mayor Boris Johnson changed it). This is because walking is the greenest form of transport there is, and pedestrians are vulnerable travellers. Cycling comes next, followed by public transport. It follows that a green transport policy must encourage walking and cycling, by altering road layouts, signposting routes and providing cycle storage facilities, as well as discouraging unnecessary car journeys and terrifyingly vast heavy goods vehicles. The risk with offering free public transport to a population already overly habituated to sitting down is that, rather than stroll, people take the bus.\nStill, it\u2019s great to see Luxembourg adopting what, in a small and trafficky country (2,500 square km, around the same size as Dorset), sounds like a rational scheme. Transport planning may sound dry, technical, dull. In a more sensible, evidence-driven world perhaps it would be. But the reality is that it is a ferociously contested area, with the different constituencies (principally motorists and cyclists) pitted against each other in a national conversation that has turned transport into a branch of identity politics.\nCarbon emissions and more localised forms of air pollution aren\u2019t the only reasons for this. Nor are road crash statistics that show outcomes for drivers improving while other groups lag behind. The awkward fact, for those of us who would like to see their use drastically curtailed, is that cars and motorcycles are experienced by many people as uniquely useful and liberating. Cotten Seiler, in his book Republic of Drivers, shows how they are hardwired into 20th-century capitalist, liberal individualism. Affordable fuel is widely seen as a right and a necessity. The gilets jaunes protests in France are a striking example. Champions of affordable public transport, by contrast, are often on the left \u2013 though rarely are their demands as rousing as in Brazil, where fare rises have sparked mass demonstrations.\nEarlier this week my daughter was excited to see the green Lamborghini that has taken up residence in our unassuming neighbourhood backing into its regular space. We agreed to sidle past and attempt to meet the driver, both hoping (we admitted later) to be offered a ride. The ploy failed as he didn\u2019t get out.\nI mention it by way of an illustration that there is something about cars that people find attractive \u2013 especially, if you are nine, brightly coloured luxury ones. Good luck to the Luxembourgers trying to persuade people to take the bus or tram instead.\n\u2022 Susanna Rustin is a leader writer for the Guardian", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/transport", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "description": "Luxembourg\u2019s plan isn\u2019t catch-free and is only a start, but it\u2019s just the sort of radical action that climate change demands, says Guardian leader writer Susanna Rustin", "date_published": {"$date": 1544184166000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544184979000}, "authors": ["Susanna Rustin"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Luxembourg", "Environment", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Transport policy", "Green politics", "Climate change", "Transport", "Politics"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/07/free-buses-greener-luxembourg-radical-climate-change", "og:description": "Luxembourg\u2019s plan isn\u2019t catch-free and is only a start, but it\u2019s just the sort of radical action that climate change demands, says Guardian leader writer Susanna Rustin", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a7f2bf3423ec463fe255fd966c4ebdd1064c7ee/0_140_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=dd4e8882b6ab7fcd7a7336d5b9bce138", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Hooray for free buses \u2013 this is how we create a greener, cleaner world | Susanna Rustin"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a7f2bf3423ec463fe255fd966c4ebdd1064c7ee/0_140_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1bfd79c580653115bf6fb11bd0381583", "width": "3024", "height": "1814", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a7f2bf3423ec463fe255fd966c4ebdd1064c7ee/0_140_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=270405a70af54cf176199779f7a0c434", "description": "\u2018There could also be an economic dividend if Luxembourg becomes a more desirable place to live and work.\u2019\nPhotograph: Ryhor Bruyeu/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Stock Photo"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556125023815}, "comments": [{"id": "123523469", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1544435410000}, "author": "towel", "author_id": "1160979", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Closing minor road to through traffic does not cause delays on main roads.

The use of public transport for trips directly to downtown, in most places, is dictated for most workers by the cost of parking, more than the cost of public transport. And for people who don't work directly downtown, it is usually dictated by excessively time-consuming journey times on indirect routes.\nThere might be a small number of people, who do have a viable choice in terms of time and money, who might be persuaded to change to public transport because of advertising that the trains are cleaner, or more secure, or better air-conditioned than they thought. Whether that would be worth the advertising budget, is doubtful.\nAdvertising works mainly to persuade people to buy something they don't really need. Most people really need to travel to work. It's not a discretionary choice, for most people. The other reason for advertising, is to convince people to buy brand X instead of brand Y.

The spectacle of these poor people thus mulcted of so large a proportion of their earnings offended the public con-science, and agitation was set on foot, municipal authorities were roused, and at the cost of the taxpayers, the bridge was freed and the toll removed. All those people who used the bridge were saved sixpence a week, but within a very short time rents on the south side of the river were found to have risen about sixpence a week, or the amount of the toll which had been remitted!\nAnd a friend of mine was telling me the other day that, in the parish of Southwark, about 350 pounds a year was given away in doles of bread by charitable people in connection with one of the churches. As a consequence of this charity, the competition for small houses and single-room tenements is so great that rents are considerably higher in the parish!\"\nThe full text of this once-famous speech is given here.http://www.landvaluetax.org/current-affairs-comment/winston-churchill-said-it-all-better-then-we-can.html\nSo, completely orthodox.

It\u2019s part of a troubling trend: over the last two decades monarch numbers in the West have declined by roughly 97%.\n\u201cIt is a sad reality of climate change,\u201d said Anthony Gutierrez, a volunteer guide at the park and biology student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, as he takes a break from guiding school children through a tour. \u201cFor every little thing that changes there\u2019s not just one consequence \u2013 it\u2019s a whole chain reaction.\u201d\nAccording to the Xerces Society, a conservation organization, in the 1980s between 10 million and 4.5 million monarchs spent the winter in California. The last count, conducted annually by volunteers each November, showed that in 2018 there may be as few as 30,000 across the state \u2013 a number that\u2019s 87% lower than just the year before.\n\u201cWe had a lot of reason to suspect that it was going to be a bad year, but we were shocked at just how bad,\u201d said Xerces Society Conservation biologist Emma Pelton. She said that year-to-year fluctuations can be expected, but this kind of continuous drop-off is cause for concern. \u201cIt is in the context that the population has already declined 97%. So, it\u2019s OK if you have millions of butterflies and they drop down a little bit \u2013 that\u2019s not a huge deal. But if you have 200,000 butterflies to begin with and you have a bad year? Now we only have 30,000 left.\u201d\nWhile researchers can\u2019t pinpoint the direct cause for each annual decline, there are several factors cited for the overall loss in numbers. For years, western monarchs have faced habitat loss in both the places they breed and where they spend their winters and increased use of pesticides has also taken a toll. Climate change, of course, has also played a role. Both drought and severe weather are deadly stressors for the butterflies, that are already under siege.\nMonarchs aren\u2019t alone. As the New York Times noted in a recent article on the \u201cinsect apocalypse,\u201d researchers in Germany found flying insect populations there had decreased by up to 82% over the last three decades. A collection of separate studies showed that the populations of most of the insect species included, had been nearly cut in half. The indirect effects of this massive disappearance \u2013 considered as part of the sixth extinction \u2013 are still unknown, as is the scale of just how massive this die-off might be. Most insect populations aren\u2019t closely watched.\n\u201cThat is a disturbing thing,\u201d biologist Emma Pelton said.\nShe added: \u201cThey are definitely not the ones people are even the most worried about, which says something\u201d\nAnurag Agrawal, an ecology and evolutionary biology professor at Cornell University, suggests that the butterflies are like the canary in the coal mine. In a blog about his work, he said that because they travel across North America every year, monarch migration can be helpful in determining the \u201chealth of our entire continent\u201d. But saving them could require big changes. \u201cWe have to take a step back and ask ourselves the harder questions that none of us want to deal with.\u201dHe said monarchs are \u201care exhibiting multi-decadal declines that point to very big systemic problems. We shouldn\u2019t fool ourselves\u201d.\nSamantha Marcum, a Coastal Program Regional coordinator for the US Fish and Wildlife Service agrees. \u201cMonarch declines give us a clue to the health of ecosystems across North America and declines are being detected across many other pollinator species as well,\u201d she said. But, she added, her agency has been teaming up with researchers and organizations to find solutions and strengthen protections.\nAlong with restoration of monarch habitat \u2013 which she said also provides benefits to threatened bumblebees, honeybees, and grassland birds \u2013 the department has implemented management plans to plant trees that protect the delicate invertebrates from harsh weather. It has also planted native nectar plants, and has worked with the agricultural industry and communities to eliminate or reduce the use of pesticides.\n\u201cEveryone can help to reverse the decline of monarch butterflies,\u201d she said. \u201cThe public can participate in citizen science projects to monitor breeding monarchs or to estimate overwintering monarch numbers in the western US. People can plant native nectar plants and milkweed, where appropriate, that are not treated with pesticides.\u201d\nFor now, researchers will be looking to next year\u2019s numbers to see if the efforts can help turn the decline around. It is still possible for the butterflies to bounce back.\nGlen Cornett, a retired math teacher who now volunteers at the Natural Bridges grove, said he\u2019s hopeful, as he guides children to a scope pointed at a cluster of monarchs.\n\u201c[Volunteering] is a chance to \u2026 raise awareness about what it\u2019s going to take to bring the migration and the monarch population back up again.\u201d\n\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t a volunteer I would like to be paid by each \u2018wow!\u2019 from the kids.\u201d Before packing up his scope he looks up at the butterflies fluttering through the speckled afternoon sunlight. \u201cIt\u2019s just perfection.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/butterflies", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "In the 1980s, roughly 4.5 million monarchs wintered in California, but at last count, there may be as few as 30,000", "date_published": {"$date": 1544248838000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544889854000}, "authors": ["Gabrielle Canon"], "article_section": "US news", "article_tags": ["California", "Climate change", "Environment", "US news", "Butterflies"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/07/its-a-sad-reality-a-troubling-trend-sees-a-97-decline-in-monarch-butterflies", "og:description": "In the 1980s, roughly 4.5 million monarchs wintered in California, but at last count, there may be as few as 30,000", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27501be16c267f55745a503819b81ab23482db96/0_17_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=eafe91b7d103c24d63954c4e5dd63e9b", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "'It's a sad reality': a troubling trend sees a 97% decline in monarch butterflies"}, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27501be16c267f55745a503819b81ab23482db96/0_17_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cafec70d4816ef86ef26abada656de73", "width": "2500", "height": "1499", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27501be16c267f55745a503819b81ab23482db96/0_17_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=16cebb3c086824db662378710e7f41d6", "description": "A monarch butterfly clings to a plant.

TUI Fly, the company\u2019s German counterpart, came in fourth.\nAtmosfair also found that only one in 10 airlines worldwide were succeeding in keeping their greenhouse gas emissions constant while achieving economic growth. Among these were Thai Airways, Finnair, American Airlines and All Nippon Airlines.\nDietrich Brockhagen, executive director of Atmosfair, said: \u201cOur results show that the efficiency improvements of the vast majority of airlines worldwide is not sufficient [to keep within the] 2C or 1.5C target [of the Paris agreement]. We need new, synthetic and CO2-neutral fuels and other more radical measures to curb CO2 emissions in the sector.\u201d\nBritish Airways was placed at 74th, with an efficiency rating of D, behind companies such as Aeroflot and Aeromexico. It fell behind many of Europe\u2019s other flag carriers, including Alitalia, Lufthansa, Air France, KLM and Iberia.\nBritish Airways said: \u201cWe are committed to reducing our carbon emissions and have improved efficiency by more than 10% since 2008. We are well on course to deliver a 25% improvement in carbon emissions reduction by 2025. British Airways is the first airline in Europe to invest in building a plant to generate renewable jet fuel from household waste, and last week we kicked off a research project with some of the UK\u2019s leading universities to find a way to power a long-haul aircraft with 300 customers on board with zero emissions.\u201d\nThe company also pointed to a commitment by its parent group IAG to invest $400m (\u00a3313.6m) on alternative sustainable fuel development over the next 20 years.\nVirgin Atlantic Airways ranks 83rd in the world, behind many airlines from developing countries such as Indonesia\u2019s Garuda, Royal Air Maroc, Air India, and Taiwan\u2019s Eva Air. This showing comes despite the much-publicised activities of Sir Richard Branson, Virgin\u2019s chairman, in highlighting the risks of climate change.\nBranson co-founded the Carbon War Room, which since 2009 has operated as a non-profit organisation aimed at speeding up the adoption of cleaner, low-emissions technology by businesses.\nVirgin took issue with the report methodology, saying it misrepresented the airline. A spokeswoman added: \u201cWe have undertaken a massive renewal programme to replace our entire fleet over a 10 year period, switching from four-engine aircraft to much more efficient two-engine aircraft. As a result we have reduced our aircraft carbon emissions by 23.7% since 2007. Our carbon emissions will continue to reduce as we take delivery of more new aircraft over the next three years.\u201d\nCarbon emissions from airlines grew by about 5% last year, while the number of kilometres flown increased by 6%, according to Atmosfair, showing that much more needs to be done to ensure aviation does not take up an unsustainable amount of the world\u2019s remaining \u201ccarbon budget\u201d. Biofuels are being given trials as an alternative to fossil fuels for aviation, but these carry their own difficulties, not least the threat of deforestation. Virgin recently used recycled waste to fuel a flight, a potentially more environmentally sound alternative.\n\u201cYou cannot beat physics, therefore long-haul flights will not be feasible with heavy batteries and electric engines,\u201d said Brockhagen. \u201cBut you can produce carbon neutral kerosene synthetically, using carbon extracted from the air, water and green electricity. This is ready technologically, but 10 times more expensive per gallon than fossil kerosene. Who will invest the billions to scale this technology up? If airlines grouped together they could do it, but this would require an international spirit of cooperation over competition, so far rarely seen in the industry.\u201d\nThere are also ways for airlines to reduce their emissions without resorting to new fuels and planes, through adjusting their pilots\u2019 flying practices and small tweaks to planes. Some airlines look to offset their emissions through carbon reductions elsewhere.\nA spokesman for Airlines UK, which represents the industry, said: \u201cUK airlines are making enormous efforts to reduce their carbon emissions, and are committed to a global target to cut CO2 emissions from all flights by 50% of their 2005 levels by 2050, through technology, operational efficiency improvements and the use of sustainable biofuels. On top of this, in 2016 the International Civil Aviation Organization adopted the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation to address CO2 emissions from international aviation \u2013 a global first for any sector.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/business/theairlineindustry", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/virginatlantic", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "TUI Airways comes top of 2018 Atmosfair Airline Index while Virgin Atlantic ranks 83rd", "date_published": {"$date": 1544266844000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544297132000}, "authors": ["Fiona Harvey"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "Airline industry", "Virgin Atlantic", "Climate change"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/08/airlines-ignoring-efficient-planes-carbon-targets-tui-airways-atmosfair-index-virgin-atlantic", "og:description": "TUI Airways comes top of 2018 Atmosfair Airline Index while Virgin Atlantic ranks 83rd", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21961e4e48a09ad4ba6845b32be0fbb974d389d3/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=b3775e21678052f4772dfa3659a97202", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Airlines ignoring efficient planes in blow to carbon targets \u2013 study"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21961e4e48a09ad4ba6845b32be0fbb974d389d3/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f4ef4e260bc87aebefe3713234c3367d", "width": "5000", "height": "3000", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21961e4e48a09ad4ba6845b32be0fbb974d389d3/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d3bbb4b28c36dec38b962dadf876bd06", "description": "More efficient aircraft such as the A320neo (pictured) can achieve substantial carbon savings over older models.\nPhotograph: Guillaume Horcajuelo/EPA"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8ad63a15fdb95a7a2e979e48058d7fd72630e06/0_71_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ec245d51b9aa9a70c87bda11c9de5a2a", "width": "3500", "height": "2099", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8ad63a15fdb95a7a2e979e48058d7fd72630e06/0_71_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2f89195b9f0a3484bf409560e028e91f", "description": "Virgin Atlantic chairman Sir Richard Branson co-founded the\nCarbon War Room, which since 2009 has operated as a non-profit organisation aimed at speeding up the adoption of cleaner, low-emissions technology by businesses.

Congressional committees vested with the authority to hold hearings, conduct investigations and serve subpoenas are likely to look into Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns, the bungled hurricane response in Puerto Rico, the firing of former FBI director James Comey and resignation of attorney general Jeff Sessions, and much more.\n\u201cWe are coming to do something that is very important for our country: a more open Congress with accountability to the public,\u201d California representative Nancy Pelosi, the once and probably future speaker of the House, said on Face the Nation. \u201cWe are not doing any investigation for a political purpose, but to seek the truth.\u201d\nIf Pelosi and House Democrats are sincere about restoring integrity to Congress, uncovering threats to democracy and seeking the truth, they should also investigate a corporation that has done long-term and probably irrevocable damage to our politics and planet: ExxonMobil.\nOur era is defined by interlocking crises of truth, democracy and ecology. ExxonMobil is a major actor at that intersection.\nInternal and external documents compiled by InsideClimate News, the Los Angeles Times and researchers at Harvard University reveal that ExxonMobil, the world\u2019s largest fossil fuel corporation, knew as early as 1977 \u2013 and potentially as early as the 1950s \u2013 that its business activities could wreak havoc on the climate.\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the company outfitted the largest supertanker in its fleet with instruments to monitor the oceanic absorption of carbon dioxide and hired scientists and mathematicians to study global warming. They developed in-house climate change models and published their findings in peer-reviewed journals.\nIn a 1978 memo, one Exxon Research manager wrote: \u201cThis may be the kind of opportunity that we are looking for to have Exxon technology, management and leadership resources put into the context of a project aimed at benefiting mankind.\u201d\nBut by the late 1980s, the oil giant had changed its stance. In 1988, an Exxon public affairs manager wrote that the company should \u201cemphasize the uncertainty\u201d of climate science. This became the \u201cExxon position\u201d \u2013 and so began one of the greatest conspiracies of our time.\nBorrowing from big tobacco\u2019s playbook, Exxon and other oil corporations launched public relations campaigns to sow doubt about the science behind climate change. Exxon took out full-page ads in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post, among others. One ad described climate change as \u201cunsettled science\u201d. Another, titled Reset the Alarm, made a claim the company knew to be false: \u201cWe still don\u2019t know what role man-made greenhouse gases might play in warming the planet.\u201d\nExxonMobil and other fossil fuel corporations have spewed emissions into the atmosphere while bearing little or no cost for the damage\nA peer-reviewed study of the corporation\u2019s public and private communications by Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes of Harvard University demonstrates that ExxonMobil actively misled the public about climate science and its implications. Exxon also hid the implications of climate science and policy from its shareholders, inflating the value of the fossil fuel assets that it would have had to abandon  to meet international climate targets.\nBut Exxon\u2019s deceits run even deeper. Over the years, the company channeled about $30m to researchers and activist groups promoting disinformation about global warming. Documents from the Bush administration reveal the company played a key role in dissuading the former president from signing the Kyoto protocol. In league with other fossil fuel corporations \u2013 most notably Koch Industries and the American Petroleum Institute \u2013 Exxon transformed the Republican party into the enemy of scientific fact. \nAll the while, ExxonMobil and other fossil fuel corporations have spewed emissions into the atmosphere while bearing little or no cost for the damage \u2013 and driving us headlong into a climate crisis. The latest report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, informed by thousands of leading studies, makes it plain: to avoid catastrophic warming of more than 1.5C (, humanity must transition from dirty to clean energy by 2030.\nLast month, New York state sued ExxonMobil for conducting a \u201clongstanding fraudulent scheme\u201d to deceive investors, analysts and insurers \u201cconcerning the company\u2019s management of the risks posed to its business by climate change regulation\u201d. Dozens of jurisdictions and entities across the country, including the state of Rhode Island, Boulder county in Colorado, and multiple municipalities across California have filed suits against Exxon and other oil companies. Last week, crab fishermen in California sued 30 fossil fuel corporations for damaging their fisheries. \nExxonMobil and the other fossil fuel corporations most responsible for climate change should pay their fair share to address this crisis. But if their continuing lobbying efforts are any indication, they will not. Oil and gas interests spent over $100m to stop climate action at the ballot box in the midterm elections \u2013 doling out over $41m in Colorado and $31m in Washington to defeat state-level ballot initiatives that would have restricted fracking operations to a safe distance from homes and schools and made carbon polluters pay for their waste.\nRecently, Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined youth climate activists in a sit-in at the Capitol Hill office of Pelosi, demanding House Democrats pursue a Green New Deal. In response, Pelosi has reaffirmed that she will revive the select committee on climate change disbanded by Republicans. For the sake of all of us, House Democrats have a duty to use the authority of that and other committees to investigate Exxon.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/oil", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/oilandgascompanies", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/commodities", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/energy-industry", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Our era is defined by interlocking crises of truth, democracy and ecology \u2013 and ExxonMobil is a major actor at that intersection.", "date_published": {"$date": 1544374329000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544418274000}, "authors": ["Julian Brave NoiseCat"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["ExxonMobil", "House of Representatives", "Democrats", "Oil", "Oil and gas companies", "Commodities", "Energy industry", "Business", "US politics", "Climate change", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/09/exxonmobil-house-democrats-must-investigate", "og:description": "Our era is defined by interlocking crises of truth, democracy and ecology \u2013 and ExxonMobil is a major actor at that intersection.", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88285453ef932f9d397624f873572a7cef95d019/0_0_2464_1479/master/2464.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=311396d0627205189999a9db8708cade", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "If Democrats want seek truth they must investigate ExxonMobil | Julian Brave NoiseCat"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88285453ef932f9d397624f873572a7cef95d019/0_0_2464_1479/master/2464.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c4808bb5598a14e0f79a7e58651ba92c", "width": "2464", "height": "1479", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88285453ef932f9d397624f873572a7cef95d019/0_0_2464_1479/master/2464.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a818903bd4654e7de906fc4d1a26e303", "description": "\u2018Over the years, the company channeled about $30m to researchers and activist groups promoting disinformation about global warming.\u2019\nPhotograph: Matt Brown/AP"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556125065018}, "comments": [{"id": "123517871", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1544418800000}, "author": "seppowatcher", "author_id": "10592748", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Oh the irony of protesting an oil company wearing a yellow plastic vest..........", "recommendation_count": "2", "in_reply_to": "123511112", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "123517848", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1544418555000}, "author": "seppowatcher", "author_id": "10592748", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "This comment was removed by a moderator because it didn't abide by our\ncommunity standards.\nReplies may also be deleted.

Without these, the world faces a financial crash several times worse than the 2008 crisis, they said.\nThe investors include some of the world\u2019s biggest pension funds, insurers and asset managers and marks the largest such intervention to date. They say fossil fuel subsidies must end and substantial taxes on carbon be introduced.\nMinisters arrive at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, on Monday for its crucial second week, when the negotiations on turning the vision of the Paris agreement into reality reach a critical point, with finance for fighting global warming a key area of dispute.\n\u201cThe long-term nature of the challenge has, in our view, met a zombie-like response by many,\u201d said Chris Newton, of IFM Investors which manages $80bn and is one of the 415 groups that has signed the Global Investor Statement. \u201cThis is a recipe for disaster as the impacts of climate change can be sudden, severe and catastrophic.\u201d\nInvestment firm Schroders said there could be $23tn of global economic losses a year in the long term without rapid action. This permanent economic damage would be almost four times the scale of the impact of the 2008 global financial crisis. Standard and Poor\u2019s rating agency also warned leaders: \u201cClimate change has already started to alter the functioning of our world.\u201d\nThomas DiNapoli, of the $207bn New York State Common Retirement Fund, another signatory, said taking action on global warming not only avoided damage but could boost jobs and growth. \u201cThe low-carbon economy presents numerous opportunities and investors who ignore the changing world do so at their own peril.\u201d\nLord Nicholas Stern, of the London School of Economics said: \u201cThe low-carbon economy is the growth story of the 21st century and it is inclusive growth. Without that story, we would not have got the 2015 Paris agreement, but the story has grown stronger and stronger and is really compelling now.\u201d\nThe US Trump administration will hold its only event at the UN summit on Monday and is expected to promote \u201cclean coal\u201d. But Stern said Trump\u2019s suggestion that action on climate change was a jobs killer was \u201cdead wrong\u201d. Stern said: \u201cYou don\u2019t create jobs for the 21st century by trying to whistle up jobs from the 19th century.\u201d\nA key demand of the Global Investor Statement is to phase out coal-fired power stations across the world. Peter Damgaard Jensen, the CEO of Danish pension fund PKA, said: \u201cInvestors, including PKA, are moving out of coal in their droves given its devastating effects on the climate and public health, compounded by its poor financial performance.\u201d\nDozens of nations will affirm their commitment to end their coal burning on Thursday. However, the UN summit has seen US, Chinese and Japanese financial institutions cited as leaders in providing nearly $500bn in backing for new coal plants since the Paris agreement was signed.\nAnother investor demand on governments is to introduce \u201ceconomically meaningful\u201d taxes on carbon. Most are below $10 per tonne, but needed to rise to up to $100 in the next decade or two, the investors said. The French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s botched attempt to increase fuel taxes and the gilets jaunes protests that followed were a model of how not to do it, said observers in Poland.\n\u201cIt failed to take people along with them, accompanying the policy with social measures to allow citizens to embrace the opportunities of the transition and ride out the challenges,\u201d said Camilla Born, of advisers E3G. The host government of the climate summit, Poland, is heavily reliant on coal and is stressing the need for a \u201cjust transition\u201d for workers in the fossil fuel industry.\nThe investors include some of the globe\u2019s largest pension funds, such as Calsters and ABP, and insurers, including Aviva, AXA and Zurich. They also want an end to subsidies for coal, oil and gas, which the IMF rates at $5tn a year and which the G20 has been promising to tackle for a decade. This measure alone could cut global CO2 emissions by 10% by 2030, according a UN report released in time for the Poland summit.\nThe investors said current national pledges to cut carbon would lead to a catastrophic 3C of global warming and that plans must be dramatically increased by 2020. For developing countries, \u201dfinance is the critical enabler of increasing ambition,\u201d said Niranjali Amerasinghe, of the World Resources Institute.\nUN climate summits are frequently dogged by disputes over the $100bn a year that rich nations have promised to poorer ones by 2020 to tackle climate change. Direct government funding and private company finance were needed, Amerasinghe said: \u201cIt is really great when private sector is out there saying we are going to invest in climate-friendly activities.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "UN summit urged to end all coal burning and introduce substantial taxes on emissions", "date_published": {"$date": 1544400088000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544403302000}, "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "United Nations", "World news", "Business"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/10/tackle-climate-or-face-financial-crash-say-worlds-biggest-investors", "og:description": "UN summit urged to end all coal burning and introduce substantial taxes on emissions", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f64839af77d526ce4d3fcad20d25899cb420748/394_779_4139_2483/master/4139.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=94391e4bcf2336b5d63bd5885e43a534", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Tackle climate or face financial crash, say world's biggest investors"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f64839af77d526ce4d3fcad20d25899cb420748/394_779_4139_2483/master/4139.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=037301b37024c51b23957731aecba67d", "width": "4139", "height": "2483", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f64839af77d526ce4d3fcad20d25899cb420748/394_779_4139_2483/master/4139.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e8d1adc04c9e5980c92ef19cf225239c", "description": "Global investors managing $32tn are urging governments to phase out all coal burning.\nPhotograph: Alexander Koerner/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc0795ba2c3613145ed8c8c"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/11/the-window-is-narrowing-scientists-urge-action-at-un-climate-talks", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Scientists have laid down the gauntlet for political leaders as the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, wrestles with the challenge of cutting emissions without sparking social tensions like those seen recently in France.\nThe UN climate talks \u2013 known as COP24 and the most important since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015 \u2013 aim to set a new rulebook for governments to reduce greenhouse gases and to raise ambitions, after warnings of dire consequences if global warming rises more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\nThe climate crisis is already here and the risks are growing, said Hoesung Lee, chair of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, who led a study by thousands of scientists on ways to avoid 1.5C of warming via accelerated transition from fossil fuels.\n\u201cThe IPCC made a tremendous collective effort to bring you the best scientific knowledge on the subject. We tell you limiting warming to 1.5C is possible but the window is narrowing,\u201d Lee told a plenary on Tuesday. \u201cThe scientific community has delivered, now it is up to governments to take action.\u201d\nThere has been fierce debate about what to do with the study. All but four of the world\u2019s governments want to formally welcome the 1.5C report to spur a more ambitious shift towards renewable energy. However, four oil producing nations \u2013 the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait \u2013 said the study should merely be \u201cnoted\u201d.\nThis issue has overshadowed the past few days of the talks in Poland. Saudi Arabia has claimed there are \u201cgaps and uncertainties\u201d in the study. The US held a long-planned event promoting coal, gas, oil and nuclear power.\nIn a thinly veiled criticism of such tactics, Laurent Fabius, a former prime minister of France and president of the 2015 Paris climate talks, told the plenary that political leaders would play a negative role if they were \u201cnot only somnambulists but spoilers\u201d.\nHe noted that global emissions rose by 2% this year, when they need to decline if warming is to be kept to a less dangerous level.\n\u201cLet us be clear, the real world is not on track. We need to do more and to do it faster,\u201d Fabius said. \u201cThe IPCC 1.5C report shows the tremendous importance of every half degree and the disastrous consequences of missing that boundary.\u201d\nBut many delegates said more attention should be focused on the social challenges of rapid change, as workers in old industries, such as coal, lose their jobs and the price of fossil fuels is pushed higher to stimulate the transition to alternative energies.\nWithout greater consideration of how the costs and benefits could be equally shared there could be a violent backlash, as France has experienced with the gilets jaunes protests that were initially about a planned rise in an eco-tax on petrol.\nJonathan Pershing, a former US climate envoy, said technology and the markets would drive change, and it was already cheaper to build a new renewable power plant than a new coal or gas plant.\n\u201cBut you have to think about how to manage it. What happens to people who no longer have jobs from the old economy in the new economy? How do you think about new opportunities and the training you give young people? If you close down old facilities, how do you do it in a manner that keeps the communities alive and helps maintain the traditions and cultural structures?\u201d Pershing said. \u201cWe don\u2019t do it very often so we don\u2019t have much experience. No report tells us how to manage the political difficulties. We need to manage the transitions. They\u2019re hard.\u201d\nThis was echoed by Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, who said it was important for governments to separate raising tax revenue from addressing climate change.\n\u201cThe yellow vest implications are huge and show the danger if we take wrong moves,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t paid enough attention on the short-term impacts [of putting a price on carbon].

His warning came as Pacific and Indian ocean states warned they faced annihilation if a global climate \u201crule book\u201d could not brokered.\nIn a bruising speech before ministers and heads of state, Vanuatu\u2019s foreign minister, Ralph Regenvanu, singled out the US as he excoriated major CO2-emitting developed countries for deliberately hindering negotiations.\n\u201cIt pains me deeply to have watched the people of the United States and other developed countries across the globe suffering the devastating impacts of climate-induced tragedies, while their professional negotiators are here at COP24 putting red lines through any mention of loss and damage in the Paris guidelines and square brackets around any possibility for truthfully and accurately reporting progress against humanity\u2019s most existential threat,\u201d he said.\nRegenvanu said the countries most responsible for climate change were now frustrating efforts to counter it.\nThe UN\u2019s climate change talks in Poland have been distracted by a semantic debate over whether the conference should \u201cwelcome\u201d or \u201cnote\u201d the IPCC\u2019s special report warning of dire consequences if global warming rises more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, with a bloc of four oil-producing countries \u2013 the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Kuwait \u2013 insisting the report be only \u201cnoted\u201d.\nDocuments from the conference presidency, seen by the Guardian, indicate the issue of how to acknowledge the report will be returned to later in the week and is likely to further slow progress on negotiating a final outcome. Negotiators said they are growing increasingly pessimistic that talks can be concluded by their deadline on Friday.\n\u201cWhether you welcome, or note, or shamefully ignore the science altogether,\u201d Regenvanu said, \u201cthe fact remains that this is catastrophic for humanity, and party negotiators blocking meaningful progress should have much on their conscience.\u201d\nHe said climate change represented an existential threat to humanity, but \u201cwe have overcome greater human-induced wrongs before like colonialism, like slavery\u201d.\nAs 193 countries at the climate talks seek to establish a \u201crule book\u201d on how to implement the commitments made in the Paris agreement three years ago, Regenvanu condemned a two-tier system that exempted high-emissions countries from reductions obligations, saying the world needed \u201cone common rule book, in which rules apply to all\u201d.\nThe US state department declined to comment on his remarks.\nRegenvanu was part of a cohort of small island states in the Pacific and Indian oceans that urged greater global action on limiting global warming to 1.5C; leaders from Kiribati, Samoa, Tuvalu, the Cook Islands and the Maldives argued their countries faced an impending existential threat from climate change.\nSpeaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island Developing States, the Maldives\u2019 environment minister, Hussain Rasheed Hassan, said the world needed to question \u201cwhy we are continuing failing?\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cAfter a quarter of a century of UNFCCC negotiations and three years since the historic Paris agreement, we are further from approaching our goal of stabilising emissions than ever, and \u2026 rapidly approaching the point of no return.\nThe prime minister of Kiribati, Taneti Maamau, said the countries that had contributed least to climate change were feeling its impacts first \u2013 and most acutely: \u201cTruly, but sadly, the prosperity enjoyed by a few developed countries, has become the tragedy and misery of the mess of developing countries and particularly those most vulnerable to climate change.\u201d\nHenry Puna, the prime minister of the Cook Islands, said while the Paris agreement represented a moment of global solidarity, inaction and infighting since then had paralysed efforts to reduce emissions. \u201cI am scared for my children\u2019s future, and for the future of generations to come,\u201d he said. \u201cParties have called for action, but it is evident our current efforts are not enough.\u201d\nHe said climate change denialism jeopardised the future of Pacific countries: \u201cSome are not willing to accept the stark realities.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/poland", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/americas", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Vanuatu\u2019s foreign minister says worst offenders on global warming are blocking progress", "date_published": {"$date": 1544561527000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1546433475892}, "authors": ["Ben Doherty"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Poland", "World news", "United Nations", "Americas", "Europe", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/11/us-accused-of-obstructing-talks-at-un-climate-change-summit", "og:description": "Vanuatu\u2019s foreign minister says worst offenders on global warming are blocking progress", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad32dd00ebea577b6221b8c2aaea26ae138eb77/73_0_4620_2772/master/4620.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=98809ef96737c61be41d82d8e480ff3a", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "US accused of obstructing talks at UN climate change summit"}, "headline": "N", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad32dd00ebea577b6221b8c2aaea26ae138eb77/73_0_4620_2772/master/4620.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4fa57f30157d88dffd1f78a9b849057e", "width": "4620", "height": "2772", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad32dd00ebea577b6221b8c2aaea26ae138eb77/73_0_4620_2772/master/4620.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7c38251405b947613f77ea7722e9476", "description": "The climate change summit, known as COP24, began on Tuesday in Katowice, Poland.\nPhotograph: \u0141ukasz Kalinowski/Rex/Shutterstock"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07962a2c3613145ed8c90"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/12/australia-likely-to-use-controversial-kyoto-loophole-to-meet-paris-agreement", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Australia appears likely be allowed to exploit a controversial climate loophole, using carryover carbon credits from the Kyoto protocol to meet its Paris agreement targets.\nNew Zealand has already ruled out using the carryover credits, saying it would discourage other countries from the practice.\nAustralia\u2019s environment minister, Melissa Price, said Australia would meet its Paris commitment of a 26% to 28% carbon emissions reduction \u2013 \u201cequivalent to a halving of emissions per person\u201d \u2013 but would not comment on whether the government would use carryover credits from Kyoto to reach that target.\nNew Zealand\u2019s climate change minister, James Shaw, said this week the practice of claiming credits was not in the spirit of the Paris agreement, and \u201cwe would discourage any country from using [it]\u201d. He has previously described the practice as \u201cdodgy accounting\u201d and like \u201ctrying to have two meals for the price of one\u201d.\nThe use of carryover credits is one of dozens of technical elements being negotiated at the UN climate talks in Katowice, Poland where 193 countries have gathered to negotiate the \u201crulebook\u201d for each meeting the emissions reductions targets made three years ago in Paris.\nThe practice of carryover credits allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030.\nAustralia\u2019s environment department projects its surplus at 294m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, but independent climate analysts suggest that figure could be as high as 333m tonnes, or up to 400m tonnes if tree-planting and other land use changes are counted in Australia\u2019s favour.\nMost of these additional carbon credits have been won through Australia\u2019s unique deal under Kyoto to count land-clearing changes towards emissions reductions.\nHaving those credits already \u201cbanked\u201d against Australia\u2019s emissions reduction target would make meeting its 2030 Paris goal of a 26% to 28% emissions reduction significantly easier: closer to 15% in actual reductions, Climate Analytics has said.\nGovernment figures show the Australia\u2019s carbon emissions continue to rise. Emissions from fossil fuels and industry have been increasing by about 2% a year since 2014.\nAt the UN climate change talks in Poland this week, the Marshall Islands has raised objections to the use of carryover credits in informal negotiations, but with little support.\nPreliminary documentation from inside the talks, seen by Guardian Australia, suggest that using carryover credits is not going to be prohibited under the \u201crulebook\u201d for the Paris agreement, meaning countries will be able \u2013 and some likely \u2013 to do it.\nThe chief executive of Climate Analytics and a lead author on former IPCC assessment reports Bill Hare said it appeared almost inevitable Australia would be allowed to \u2013 and would \u2013 use carryover credits. A change of government would not change the policy, he said.\n\u201cEvery indication is that both the government, and the Labor party, have every intention of trying to carry over surplus credits from the Kyoto protocol into Paris.\n\u201cThe [Australian government] delegation has made statements at negotiations over a period of time that are consistent with that.\u201d\nHare said Australia, based on its current climate policies, could not meet its Paris agreement target without using surplus credits. He described the use of carryover credits as \u201cfake climate action\u201d.\n\u201cAbout half of the cumulative abatement task from 2021 to 2030 could be met by the projected Kyoto second commitment period surplus \u2026 in other words, the overall mitigation effort to reach the already inadequate target would be halved.\u201d\nAlong with New Zealand refusing to use its credits, other countries have previously declined to use theirs. In 2015, Denmark, Germany, the UK, Sweden, and the Netherlands cancelled 635m tonnes of carbon credits.\nIn Katowice, Price told Guardian Australia that the government was committed to the Paris Agreement and its targets.\n\u201cOur priority at COP 24 is to secure agreement on a comprehensive rulebook to guide the implementation of the agreement.\n\u201cOur 2030 target is to reduce emissions by 26 to 28% below 2005 levels, which is equivalent to a halving of emissions per person. The government is confident of meeting this target, based on our track record of meeting and beating our first and second Kyoto protocol targets.\u201d\nAustralia, however, has consistently won specific exemptions to the calculation of its carbon reductions targets over decades of climate negotiations.\nDuring negotiations over the Kyoto protocol, the Howard government negotiated a special deal, allowing it to actually increase emissions by 8% between 2008 and 2012.\nAn additional article negotiated in the dying hours of the conference \u2013 known as the \u201cAustralia clause\u201d and condemned at the time by a European environment spokesman as \u201cwrong and immoral... a disgrace\u201d \u2013 allowed Australia to include land use changes in its emissions calculations which meant the target could be reached with only minor changes to land-clearing laws.\nWhen Australia met \u2013 and exceeded \u2013 its first Kyoto target, it was able to bank those extra carbon credits, carrying them over to meet its second target for 2020. That excess appears now likely to be calculated in assessing its Paris commitment.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/kyoto-protocol", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "New Zealand urges others not to meet emissions pledge with \u2018dodgy accounting\u2019, but UN rules unlikely to prohibit using carryover credits", "date_published": {"$date": 1544587839000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544587965000}, "authors": ["Ben Doherty"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Global climate talks", "Paris climate agreement", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Environment", "Kyoto protocol", "Australia news", "Australian politics"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/12/australia-likely-to-use-controversial-kyoto-loophole-to-meet-paris-agreement", "og:description": "New Zealand urges others not to meet emissions pledge with \u2018dodgy accounting\u2019, but UN rules unlikely to prohibit using carryover credits", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2664a7dc31037c014c0696d369b6b4b019d6604f/0_129_4796_2879/master/4796.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=b7ec27c00f57c4e9cdfaeb5d262b6a0e", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Australia likely to use controversial Kyoto loophole to meet Paris agreement"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2664a7dc31037c014c0696d369b6b4b019d6604f/0_129_4796_2879/master/4796.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ac76e03ddfc0cadfc118f6c5c425b744", "width": "4796", "height": "2879", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2664a7dc31037c014c0696d369b6b4b019d6604f/0_129_4796_2879/master/4796.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bfc56c93490b07972bc658ac430ff314", "description": "The COP24 climate change summit in Katowice, Poland, where countries are aiming to set the rules for meeting Paris agreement emission cuts.\nPhotograph: \u0141ukasz Kalinowski/REX/Shutterstock"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc0796ca2c3613145ed8c94"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/12/we-need-a-non-proliferation-treaty-for-fossil-fuels", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "In the face of the emerging climate emergency (Letters, 10 December) and projected unconstrained growth in global fossil fuel use, this is a plea for people with relevant expertise and influence to take forward the idea for a \u201cnon-proliferation treaty\u201d (NPT) for fossil fuels, floated by Andrew Simms and Peter Newell (theguardian.com, 23 October) and supported by Bill McKibben, Naomi Klein and others (Letters, 30 October).\nThe analogy between fossil fuels and fissile nuclear materials is imperfect, but it should not be overlooked that the nuclear NPT promotes cooperation in and equal access to \u201cpeaceful use\u201d of nuclear technology. \u201cPeaceful use\u201d of fossil fuels could mean their continued but decreasing extraction, within enforceable limits constrained by the Paris agreement goals, and an offsetting role for carbon capture and geo-sequestration (funded by fossil fuel producers).

"Australia\u2019s carbon emissions are again the highest on record, according to new data from the emissions-tracking organisation Ndevr Environmental.\nNdevr replicates the federal government\u2019s national greenhouse gas inventory (NGGI) quarterly reports but releases them months ahead of the official data.\nData it has produced for the year up to September 2018 shows Australia is still on track to miss its Paris target of a 26%-28% cut to emissions on 2005 levels by 2030.\nMatt Drum, the managing director of Ndevr, said if emissions continued at their current rate, Australia would miss the target by a cumulative 1.1bn tonnes.\nWhen excluding unreliable land use data, Australia\u2019s emissions for the year to September reached 558.3m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, an all-time high. \nLand use data refers to emissions from activities such as land clearing and forest management, as well as removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through activities such as reforestation.\nNdevr excludes land use data because the methodology the government uses to calculate these figures is opaque and there have been questions about whether the scale of land-clearing in Queensland is being accurately represented.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still no policy in place to ratchet them down which is why they\u2019re increasing,\u201d Drum said.\nElectricity sector emissions were stable, but fugitive emissions, and emissions from stationary energy and transport are all still trending sharply upwards.\nRelease of the report comes as the environment minister, Melissa Price, addressed global COP24 climate change talks in Katowice, Poland.\nBoth the Coalition government and Labor have not ruled out using controversial carryover credits from the Kyoto protocol to help meet Australia\u2019s obligations under the Paris agreement.\nLabor has promised that if it wins the election it will increase Australia\u2019s target to 45% on 2005 levels, in line with recommendations from the independent Climate Change Authority.\nNdevr\u2019s analysis said this would require a reduction of 197.1m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent based on current emissions levels, which would be equal to taking 75m cars off the road for a year.\nIn comparison, the Coalition\u2019s emission reduction target would require an 80.8m tonne reduction.\nBreaking up Labor\u2019s target across sectors, Ndever suggests a range of reductions will be necessary in several industries, including 61.2m tonnes from the electricity sector, 33.4m tonnes from the stationary energy sector, 23.7m tonnes from agriculture and 34.2m tonnes from transport.\n\u201cIf Labor come into government we can\u2019t afford a policy vacuum,\u201d Drum said. \u201cIt\u2019s looking grim. We need policy levers and we need them quickly.\u201d\nDrum said the need for action was so urgent there would be no time for a full redesign of policy if there was a change of government.\nInstead, he said existing policies, such as the safeguard mechanism, should be amended.\n\u201cThey need to utilise existing policy like the safeguard mechanism and tweak it so it achieves what it is intended to achieve, which is reduce emissions,\u201d he said.\nOn Thursday, the Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, said Australia was using \u201ccreative emissions accounting\u201d to try to meet its Paris targets.\n\u201cCounting Kyoto credit towards Paris cheats our environment and the rest of the world,\u201d she said.\n\u201cOur emissions are going up, yet our environment minister is telling the world we are doing our bit to meet our Paris targets.\u201d\n\n", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sarah-hanson-young", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "If emissions continue at current rate, Australia will miss Paris target by 1.1bn tonnes, Ndevr Environmental predicts", "date_published": {"$date": 1544668728000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544671854000}, "authors": ["Lisa Cox"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Energy", "Climate change", "Environment", "Climate change", "Energy", "Australian politics", "Sarah Hanson-Young", "Australia news", "Labor party", "Paris climate agreement", "Coalition", "Liberal party", "Greenhouse gas emissions"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/13/australias-carbon-emissions-highest-on-record-data-shows", "og:description": "If emissions continue at current rate, Australia will miss Paris target by 1.1bn tonnes, Ndevr Environmental predicts", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/217d9580aee48476d30bb42e3b2b1c05488dcebc/4_1118_4373_2626/master/4373.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=498067ef48b10e29cde95818de737546", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Australia\u2019s carbon emissions highest on record, data shows"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/217d9580aee48476d30bb42e3b2b1c05488dcebc/0_364_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a884528c21485b99f06ef61f2843e667", "width": "5616", "height": "3370", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/217d9580aee48476d30bb42e3b2b1c05488dcebc/0_364_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8ba318370acf4e2bd5d31792873093e6", "description": "The Bluescope steel works at Port Kembla, Wollongong.

[We need to] see if developed countries have honoured their commitments. Still some countries have not started their mitigation efforts, or provided financial support [to poor nations]. We strongly urge them to pay up on their debts.\u201d\nBy contrast, he said, developing countries had been \u201cvery flexible and constructive\u201d at the talks. One of the key sticking points at the UN negotiations in Poland is over how countries should account for their greenhouse gas emissions, and how their progress in meeting their commitments on curbing carbon should be measured and verified.\nDeveloped countries prefer strict standards but developing countries have historically been allowed some leeway, in recognition that their governance structures and capabilities may lag behind.\nBut the EU and other developed countries are concerned that large rapidly developing economies such as China are not agreeing to adequate transparency in accounting for their emissions.\nXie said the talks were \u201cdeadlocked\u201d, but maintained that China should continue to be treated as a developing country, and that developing countries should have flexibility over transparency rules.\n\u201cWe need flexibility,\u201d he said. \u201cDeveloping countries have very varied capabilities. If more [financial and technological] support is given to developing countries, they will have more capabilities and stronger actions [on emissions].\u201d\nClaire Perry, the UK\u2019s climate minister, who arrived on Thursday after the Tory party\u2019s dramatic vote of confidence in Theresa May on Wednesday night, said she was making transparency a key focus of her efforts at the talks.\nIf no compromise can be reached, the talks may end this weekend without finalising the rulebook for implementing the Paris agreement, which was the key aim of these two weeks of negotiations.\nDeveloped countries also came under heavy fire in other parts of the conference. A coalition representing scores of the poorest and most vulnerable nations called on them to raise their emissions-cutting targets, and separately the Pacific island states \u2013 acutely vulnerable to climate change \u2013\u00a0called for the world to abandon coal power generation.\n\u201cWe call on all OECD countries to quickly phase out their use of coal by 2030 and for all other countries to phase out their use of coal by 2040,\u201d Fijian prime minister Frank Bainimarama, the president of COP23, said. \u201cThere must be no expansion of existing coal mines or the creation of new mines.\u201d\nPacific Rim powers Australia and the US have both this week said publicly they have no plans to begin phasing out coal-generated power. By contrast, Perry said the UK would have no unabated coal-fired power stations by 2025.\n\u201cThe United States has an abundance of natural resources and is not going to keep them in the ground,\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s international energy and climate adviser, Wells Griffith, told a US government-run panel discussion on fossil fuels.\nAustralia\u2019s ambassador for the environment, Patrick Suckling, added: \u201cFossil fuels are projected to be a major source of energy for a significant time to come.\u201d\nCook Islands prime minister Henry Puna told the Guardian the phase-out of coal was critical to the survival of Pacific island states. \u201cWe have made that call, it is not directed at any one country, but it applies to all. We know that coal power plants are a significant cause of the climate change we see affecting the whole world.\u201d\nThe Pacific island states also called for the establishment of an international protection regime to protect people displaced by climate change.\nMohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives and now leading the country\u2019s negotiating delegation, said \u201cfour countries\u201d \u2013 referring to the US, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia, the bloc resisting welcoming the IPCC\u2019s 1.5C special report \u2013 were deliberately frustrating negotiations.\n\u201cNothing\u2019s happening. Absolutely nothing is happening,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have this whole dictionary of words that has been brought into these climate conferences, then they talk about brackets, and we go round and round and round, and we don\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d\nWhile at the political level, oil-producing and large emitting nations have resisted increasingly strident calls from several country blocs to announce new targets for deeper emissions cuts, inside the negotiating rooms, officials from countries such as the US and Australia are reported to be working constructively to progress discussions on a Paris agreement rulebook.\n\u201cCountries are negotiating in good faith, some in better faith than others, but there is progress,\u201d Costa Rica\u2019s minister for the environment and energy, Carlos Manuel Rodr\u00edguez, said.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/china", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/asia-pacific", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Key sticking point at UN negotiations is how countries should account for their greenhouse gas emissions", "date_published": {"$date": 1544729315000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544729406000}, "authors": ["Fiona Harvey", "Ben Doherty"], "article_section": "Science", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Climate change", "Environment", "Science", "United Nations", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Paris climate agreement", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "COP 21: UN climate change conference | Paris", "Global climate talks"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/13/china-demands-developed-countries-pay-their-debts-on-climate-change", "og:description": "Key sticking point at UN negotiations is how countries should account for their greenhouse gas emissions", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa309bb48095687445744a6dcd528e101ac46adf/69_0_3361_2017/master/3361.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=5dbea5f4113ccf9d104e9992e233a92e", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "China demands developed countries 'pay their debts' on climate change"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa309bb48095687445744a6dcd528e101ac46adf/69_0_3361_2017/master/3361.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=71d38ed3369a46a7bfb0168aa345af6c", "width": "3361", "height": "2017", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa309bb48095687445744a6dcd528e101ac46adf/69_0_3361_2017/master/3361.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=16508acaf0b0062ea9b7ef7f34ad512c", "description": "Some countries are not agreeing to adequate transparency over their emissions.\nPhotograph: Danny Lawson/PA"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07991a2c3613145ed8c9f"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/14/reforesting-world-australian-farmer-240m-trees", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Through the cacophony of the UN\u2019s global climate talks, an Australian farmer is quietly spreading his plan to reforest the world.\nOver more than 30 years in west Africa, Tony Rinaudo has regenerated more than 6m hectares \u2013 an area nearly as large as Tasmania. His farmer-managed natural regeneration technique is responsible for 240m trees regrowing across that parched continent.\nBut it very nearly never happened.\nHaving grown up in Myrtleford, in country Victoria, Rinaudo moved to Niger, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, in 1981, inspired by his Christian faith and a desire \u201csomewhere, somehow to make a difference\u201d. But after two years of intense tree-planting and trying to coax some life from the arid landscape regularly devastated by severe drought, he despaired.\nNature would heal itself, you just needed to stop hammering it\n\u201cI was in charge of a reforestation project that was failing miserably, it wasn\u2019t that I was particularly dumb, it was the same story all over west Africa. And I remember the frustration that just hit me: north, south, east, west, was a barren landscape, and I knew perfectly well that 80 or 90% of the trees I was carrying [in my car] for planting would die.\u201d\nBut this day, crouching in the sand to reduce his tyres\u2019 air pressure, he looked more closely at the few low desert bushes scattered around the landscape, the only thing that would grow there.\nRinaudo knew they were not small bushes, but trees that had been hacked down. Looking more closely, he realised that, if pruned and allowed to grow, they stood a chance of flourishing.\n\u201cIn that moment, everything changed. We didn\u2019t need to plant trees, it wasn\u2019t a question of having a multi-million dollar budget and years to do it, everything you needed was in the ground.\u201d\nThe root system of the chopped down trees remained alive under the ground \u2013 Rinaudo describes it as an \u201cunderground forest\u201d \u2013 it just needed to be pruned and allowed to grow.\n\u201cNature would heal itself, you just needed to stop hammering it.\u201d\nThirty years on, his technique \u2013 he describes it as akin to pruning a grape vine back to just one or two stems each season \u2013 has a name, farmer-managed natural regeneration (FMNR). It is, Rinaudo says, an \u201cembarrassingly simple solution\u201d to what appeared to be an intractable problem. But it involved overturning generations of accepted wisdom, and a resistance to giving some land back to nature.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got people who are on the edge of starvation every year, not just in famine years, you\u2019ve got this perception that you need every square inch of farmland to grow food crops. And here\u2019s this nut telling people they should sacrifice some of their land for trees.\u201d\nRinaudo \u2013 known then as \u201cthe crazy white farmer\u201d \u2013 managed to convince 10 farmers in as many villages to back his plan, to allow trees to regrow across the land they\u2019d been intensively farming for decades. A drought was the catalyst for a work-for-food program, which brought reluctant farmers into the fold, but when the farming yields were, at first, no worse, then better, then dramatically so, the new technique took off.\nThirty years on, 6m hectares of land have been regenerated under FMNR, totalling 240m trees. The reforestation of the landscape can be seen on satellite images from space.\nAt the UN\u2019s global climate talks in Katowice, Poland, this week \u2013 as thousands of delegates from all over the world debated the minutiae of a complex worldwide rulebook for climate change \u2013 Rinaudo quietly took his farming message from meeting room to meeting room, delegation to delegation.\nThe trees, Rinaudo says, improve farming yields, reduce ground temperatures and hold water in the soil. They provide firewood and make farming, in places where the temperature regularly reaches 40C, more comfortable. But the trees also act, Rinaudo says, as a powerful carbon sink, and with the potential to draw in billions more tonnes of carbon.\nFor his work on regeneration, Rinaudo was recognised this year in the Right Livelihood Awards, often described as the alternative Nobel, and focused on fields such as environmental protection, human rights, sustainability and peace.\nWorking with World Vision, Rinaudo has taken his technique across the world, from arid Somaliland to tropical East Timor.\nThere are 2bn hectares of degraded land in the world, he argues, and much of that land can be restored to help pull carbon from the atmosphere. Regeneration is not the silver bullet for climate change \u2013 no such thing exists \u2013 but it could be a powerful tool to assist.\n\u201cWe can do this very cheaply, we can do this very quickly, and we can do this at scale.\u201d\n", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/niger", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/deforestation", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Tony Rinaudo\u2019s regeneration technique, developed in west Africa 30 years ago, has helped bring back forest over 6m hectares", "date_published": {"$date": 1544743064000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544787497000}, "authors": ["Ben Doherty"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Trees and forests", "Climate change", "Australia news", "Africa", "Niger", "Victoria", "Deforestation", "Conservation", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/14/reforesting-world-australian-farmer-240m-trees", "og:description": "Tony Rinaudo\u2019s regeneration technique, developed in west Africa 30 years ago, has helped bring back forest over 6m hectares", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d08d56f6e854545e3e569a5c791ebf41705f60c3/0_167_3008_1805/master/3008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=7af104d4fdd049198c55ed24f2d07066", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Reforesting the world: the Australian farmer with 240m trees to his name"}, "headline": "0", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d08d56f6e854545e3e569a5c791ebf41705f60c3/0_167_3008_1805/master/3008.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b15209b8780b58d38ab19599c4b158ae", "width": "3008", "height": "1805", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d08d56f6e854545e3e569a5c791ebf41705f60c3/0_167_3008_1805/master/3008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=39cf8c98abddbe3552af22a721c96dce", "description": "Australian farmer Tony Rinaudo discovered a solution to restoring trees in Africa\u2019s Sahel region affected by extreme deforestation.\nPhotograph: Silas Koch/World Vision"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57e7e10dfb0d8de60b892e51150f675b30e9fe70/0_0_3500_2331/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b8b7f69301ea1d7022dcec4fd69bec35", "width": "3500", "height": "2331", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57e7e10dfb0d8de60b892e51150f675b30e9fe70/0_0_3500_2331/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=13ff25f3c07b655ea39b16af814a0d7f", "description": "Australian agronomist Tony Rinaudo receives the Right Livelihood Award at a ceremony in the Vasa Museum in Stockholm.

I had traveled 4,000 miles north as a National Geographic explorer to listen and learn how Americans were responding to the dynamic and dangerous shifts along our coastlines as sea levels rise.\nAs we looked out into sea\u2019s wide expanse, Blanche explained that ice, and the protection it brings, had always been a given for Teller.\nTeller sits on the most north-western edge of the North American continent. A remote town of around 230 I\u00f1upiat residents, the community is built on a gravel spit that juts out into the Bering Strait. Sea ice is critical to the survival of the village, which is surrounded on three sides by water.\nIn normal years, ice begins to form around coastlines of the Bering Sea in early fall. It serves as an extension of the shoreline, providing a thick buffer to protect coastal villages like Teller from strong seasonal storms.\nBut climate change has introduced a new, dangerous normal.\nAlaska is warming at twice the rate of the global average. And as air and sea temperatures warm at record-breaking speeds, sea ice forms much more thinly and much later into the year. According to the Arctic Report Card, during the winter of 2017 and 2018 when ice historically accumulates, the Bering Sea lost a section of ice the size of Idaho.\nWith no ice, Teller has no natural defense from increasingly intense storm surges that annually flood the town\u2019s streets and sewage system. The US Army Corps of Engineers has identified Teller as one of the most imminently threatened villages in Alaska from this flooding. It is one of 12 communities currently exploring relocation away from the coastline further inland to higher, drier ground.\nFor Blanche, the loss of sea ice is more than a scientific indicator of persistent Arctic warming. It represents the daily danger of losing the places, histories and traditions that define Teller as a centuries-strong Native community.\nBut while the fate of Teller is intimately connected to the fate of sea ice, it is not the only community facing the consequences of the Arctic\u2019s unprecedented melt. The extent of sea ice in the Arctic affects the safety of Americans in Alabama and Arizona just as much as it does in Alaska.\nSea ice in the polar regions helps to moderate global climate by reflecting solar radiation back into space. But as more ice is lost each season, more heat is absorbed by the ocean, compromising the Arctic\u2019s ability to keep earth cool. And with more global warming, come more extreme storms across our shared world.\nToday, 96% of Americans live in counties that have been hit by major weather disasters in the last five years alone.\nArctic ice loss is changing our shared planet at an extraordinary and life-threatening rate\nNo matter what corner of this country you call home, whether it be the coast, the mountains, the Great Lakes or the Great Plains, climate change is already causing billions of dollars in damages and irreplaceable cultural loss.\nThe severe warming and 95% loss of the Arctic\u2019s oldest ice documented in the Arctic Report Card is not only pushing the region into uncharted territory. It is pushing our entire world into the most \u201cunprecedented transition in human history\u201d. Arctic ice loss is changing our shared planet at an extraordinary and life-threatening rate.\nFor me, the Bering Sea ice loss noted in the Arctic Report Card represents the danger of losing the places, histories and traditions that define communities across America \u2013 not just in Alaska.\nIn October, the world\u2019s leading scientists warned that we have just 12 years to contain a climate change catastrophe in a landmark UN report. We cannot afford to wait to act ambitiously on climate change. The Arctic is already facing a climate change catastrophe in 2018.\nAnd what happens in the Arctic, doesn\u2019t stay in the Arctic.

One is - what is the damage; who will be affected? And the other is - is it possible to do anything; and what cost does this represent if steps are considered necessary.\nThe first part I think can be summed up thus: we will see agriculture start to die off by the end of the century if we do nothing meaningful to slow emissions. Also, sea levels will rise by about 1-2 meters by 2100. This will start to build losses, and the global economy will experience something like 2008-9, but on a semi-permanent basis. Western economies may not cope at all, and we could start seeing much lower standards of living, greater inequality, unchecked crime and the rich retreating to gated communities etc.\nThe second part is: yes it is possible. However, many people are selfish and it will take much greater effort on the part of those who are used to dealing in minutiae, to start considering the broader implications of a steadily heating planet. There will no longer be time to mull over trivia endlessly, and pontificate about the finer points of one or others political leaning; we will need to fully accept what is happening to us all rather than allow the rich to look after themselves before truly catastrophic events start to effect any kind of normalcy continuing.\nAnd this is where with a solid understanding of both the science and the technology required to avert calamity, hope exists.\nThere are people very much involved with implementing the changes necessary. This basically relates to \na) decarbonising electricity via renewables, and not reading idiotic IEA 'Primary Energy' statistics - it will be achieved before 2100.b) decarbonising gas; both via CCS and via power-to-gas; which will become the de facto standard of storing and distributing super-cheap solar, exporting it etc. This will require converting some parts of the gas distribution network to hydrogen - not complicated or expensivec) expediting and enforcing a total ban on fossil fuels in transport. Again; this is already happening in moany countries around the world; although this is obviously a large industry and will take some time to reach critical mass. As an example, California, Japan, Korea, China, Europe and other regions are already firmly committed to this goal with plans and funding in place. Transport will be cheaper, it will be more ad-hoc in terms of renting vs buying with automatic drive, etc.\nSo we should know both what the dangers are and also be aware of the work being done while we speak to convert the systems we use to zero-carbon fuel.\nIt goes without saying that hydrogen represents the only realistic way of doing this at scale; in a homogeneous way that can be transferred to other countries once methodologies worked through. Reducing imports via self-generation and lower transport costs throughout the system should translate as a fairly minimal economic burden, indeed most things will be cheaper.\nBut the other route is not so rosy; there are many who do not wish civilisation to continue; and understanding who these people are and what they wish to achieve is paramount if the good people are going to win.", "recommendation_count": "0", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "123800876", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1544955906000}, "author": "thebowsie", "author_id": "2484923", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nAs a climate scientist I can reassure everyone that the ice has been melting for the last 14-10k years.

Products and uses of energy are at the energy level made equivalent, when equivalent the apparent value of the products is determined by value added principles.\nThe first order effect would to properly set a cost value of energy. A lump of coal and diamond might contain the same energy, but in such an extreme case humans value diamonds for aesthetic reasons while manufacturers value diamonds to cut hard materials.\nNational Geographic not too long ago presented Aluminum as choice element because it can be recycled; the recycling uses less energy; however primary Aluminum refining is the nearly the most intense energy application known. Yet we don\u2019t evaluate Aluminum as if it and its processing used carbon as its energy source because if uses hydro electric as it source in often remote areas of the planet collecting rain (A solar energy user). The amount of energy used to find a gem quality diamond is absurd, industrial diamond feed the monster. \nNuclear fuel pound for pound has ten million times as much energy as coal, however adding in the cost of mining, refining and unnecessary usage make the pound for pound comparison nearly exact. Environmentally such mining next to us furry mammals is a disaster.\nConsider fracking for natural gas. If a single conventional well could drain a reservoir over 40 years, that energy might be used to its most efficient (90+%) effect in home heating. If the same well is fracted the reservoir could be drained in 4 years. The natural gas could then be used as feed stock for plastics, nitrates, and power generation (electric). Yet the electricity produced is about (40-%). It just math but using natural gas to produce electricity wastes 6 times as much as home heating. (Just got the bill, and it sure does not look like that natural gas is priced based on flooding in of fracted resources.) \nThe current industrial culture would rather make money by not assuming risk or making investment.

Sure, if your money is made by high gas and electric rates, where\u2019s the incentive to invest in the many aspects of alternate energy needed to expand the world\u2019s energy use! Extrapolations made from where we are using carbon resources badly would indicate that maximum profit is made at high rates and peak volume and does not consider the future value of natural gas or any of the likely consequences of such vast pollution. \nToday you are king if you own the property, there nothing to think about if someone in later generation own the same property whatever its worth. \nWhen all such evaluations of energy, products and consequences are based on carbon (currency/tax?) It becomes clear that we be as stupid as I think we are in not expanding energy production using that \u201cfree\u201d energy from the Sun, and take advantage of increasing energy use by factors of 2 or 3.\nJust to remind all, the Sun its distance from the tiny Earth produces 2.1 Billion times as much energy as reached the Earth surface.\nIt just so odd that the thinking is so difficult, and the answer so easily seen.", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "123761828", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "it can be recycled", "effect": "national geographic not too long ago presented aluminum as choice element"}]}, {"id": "123764712", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1544853383000}, "author": "Walsunda", "author_id": "12483673", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\"Experts with impressive credentials, spewing an endless stream of technobabble, would present seemingly incontrovertible arguments to prove their theories.\"\nWhat experts with impressive credentials did you read as a kid in the 60s?

While everyone know that the Norwegian model of spending half a million Euro per person to fix one issue of a truly multi-layered global problem is probably not sustainable. \nEven before we bring in the problem of black carbon and local particle polution and what it does to health - we at least can acknowledge that this topic is one that is shared between regions, nations continents and people. \nThe proverbial \"canary\" has long ago moved out the confinement of enclosed \"coal-mines\". \nThe canaries are everywhere. They are in the wild now. The conditions that could kill in small spaces under ground are well emitted into the free atmosphere. A new El Nino is strangely shaping again. Giving another blow to the Great Barrier. Giving new data on what the F is going on in the rain-foreests that show evidence of actually starting to breath out net carbon during observed (not modelled) heat-stress. Or the worrying sign of methane outgassing in the Arctic.\nIt is not nice to read reports of the microbiological processes that help us in our folly are both theoretically and observationally able to become a positive feedback problem. \nSo here humanity sit. Each on our more or less solid ground under local feet that is 30% of the planet. And the problem has one common cause (to be over-arching) - while our individual stories are unique and critical. \nAnd maybe we also see the cause of why solving this is so difficult. Because the problem of AGW requires solidarity. And that topic is not very popular these days as we all run around voting for more nationalism. Pulling out of treaties is way more popular than to sign on to them. \nDistrust is more popular than trust. To the point that I have a feeling that we are now so partisan that if the town-council lay out a perfect plan to end child poverty in the community - half will vote against that plan - because of arguments of identity politics - \"goodness-terrorism\" (an actual word) or \"excuse to privatize\" etc. \nCurrent trends in world politics is moving us further and further away from any kind of solution. To the extent it has become popular to critisize the UN (that does deserve critique always of course). \nBut if we think about the UN with ca 200 individual parties - compared to the British parliament that has 8 Parties represented - and where the governmental party is in full blown civil war against itself and the Brexit it won - it is maybe not so difficult to understand that to make an agreement between a few hundred nations is a bit difficult. \nCanada has now arrested a Chinese family member for USA - just before these three big emitters were to sit down in Poland and agree on energy and emission policies. If Taiwan had arrested some member of the Rockefellers on orders of China a few decades ago - the whole idea of saving a Panda would seem rather trivial. \nWhat I try to write here that we all sit on a bit of land. And that the almost global self-interest of nationalistic trends are the antidote to wrestling our love of emitting under control. \nWhen all nations on the planet play this \"us first\" game - we are deep into game-theory territory. And game theory can not solve climate change at nation first ideology. Because it is based on a zero-sum outcome. \nIn a climate (sic) of distrust and \"nation before bigger picture\" and distrust to others - we are doomed to increase emissions. USA is clearly wanting to increase emissions. Russia and China is probably not saying the truth about emissions - and as the US president is on record saying - climate change is probably a Chinese hoax anyway.", "recommendation_count": "7", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "because climate cause the town to change into snow avalanche heaven", "effect": "in svalbard people are moved out of houses that are torn down every year"}, {"cause": "once you prepared for too much rain one season one get too little rain next season and", "effect": "that are really hard to guard against"}, {"cause": "arguments of identity politics", "effect": "to the point that i have a feeling that we are now so partisan that if the town council lay vote"}]}, {"id": "123760962", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1544826288000}, "author": "john2047", "author_id": "13603405", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Bolsonaro is most dangerous of all.

Part of the success of the Paris talks was based on the idea that countries would have taken further steps on emissions by now.\nFinance for developing countries to help them cut emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change has also been largely overlooked at this year\u2019s conference, though the World Bank pledged $200bn (\u00a3159bn) over five years as its contribution.\nObservers at the two-week summit in Poland were frustrated by the slow progress, which came in sharp contrast to the warnings of scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that even 1.5C (34.7F) of warming would cause devastation, with the die-off of coral reefs and the decline of agriculture over swathes of the planet.\nGareth Redmond-King, the head of climate change at WWF UK, said: \u201cThese talks are critical to ensuring we get to 2020 on track to meet the Paris targets and avoid runaway climate change. The time to step up is now. We need all countries to signal they will increase their climate ambition by 2020.\u201d\nThe US, which is withdrawing from the Paris agreement, led a small group of countries \u2013 Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait \u2013 to oppose a resolution that would have welcomed the IPCC report spelling out the dangers of breaching 1.5C. \nBy the texts still circulating on Friday, they had succeeded in watering down the wording to a mere \u201cnoting\u201d of the report. The difference may seem small, but the stronger wording would have allowed eager countries to force debates and possibly future resolutions on how to incorporate those stark scientific warnings into action.\nThe EU, the UK, New Zealand, Canada and more than 50 developing countries were in opposition, resolving to focus on a 1.5C limit for their own ambitions on cutting emissions.\nBut veterans of the annual conferences, held since 1992 in the hope of formulating a global response to climate change adequate to the challenge it represents, maintained that more could be forthcoming as the meetings stretched beyond their 6pm official closing time and looked likely to overrun into Saturday and perhaps Sunday. \u201cIt all happens at the end,\u201d one national representative said. \u201cWe are not giving up yet.\u201d\nNext year\u2019s meeting will be held in Chile \u2013 it should have been Brazil, but the incoming president, Jair Bolsonaro, who is hostile to the Paris agreement, withdrew the offer. Costa Rica will also play a role, with some of the anticipatory meetings to be held there.\nThe UK and Italy have submitted bids to hold the 2020 conference, which will be the biggest since Paris in 2015, as governments will be facing a crunch deadline over their efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions and their commitments to cut them further by 2030.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/poland", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Slow progress on 2015 Paris agreement comes as scientists warn of need to get on track", "date_published": {"$date": 1544812116000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544852646000}, "authors": ["Fiona Harvey"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Global climate talks", "Environment", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Poland", "Europe", "Science", "Greenhouse gas emissions"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/14/cutting-emissions-proves-a-sticking-point-at-poland-climate-conference", "og:description": "Slow progress on 2015 Paris agreement comes as scientists warn of need to get on track", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6531b31d592b22bb1ac898f52e9eb2fb3fe635c3/0_0_3242_1945/master/3242.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=514e7ed1e75361b3ca5d8b14d0bf930c", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Cutting emissions proves a sticking point at Poland climate talks"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6531b31d592b22bb1ac898f52e9eb2fb3fe635c3/0_0_3242_1945/master/3242.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bc8ba7daa7bbcc17534ab90c6e34d95a", "width": "3242", "height": "1945", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6531b31d592b22bb1ac898f52e9eb2fb3fe635c3/0_0_3242_1945/master/3242.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=da8dfad96ffa4ec00df9bcb9d3f17044", "description": "Environmental campaigners protest outside the final session of the international climate change conference in Katowice, Poland.\nPhotograph: Janek Skar\u017cy\u0144ski/AFP/Getty Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f57d3058bb756177f6f52177d156294ecee801a8/0_68_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=87276f95a7490eed5e83300e807ce088", "width": "3500", "height": "2100", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f57d3058bb756177f6f52177d156294ecee801a8/0_68_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1b1cf7999a1ac9d6e2e10612a9fde6bc", "description": "A researcher surveys corals on Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef.

They thrive between 1,500 and 1,800 metres and depend on their ability to take water and nutrients directly from the swirling mists that should cloak these slopes.\nBut the continued existence of the cloud forest in Monteverde, familiar to the millions of tourists who have visited it, is under threat from global warming.\nOnly occurring in a narrow altitude band whose upper limit is defined by where the mountain tops run out and by the altitude at which the trees can grow, it is being squeezed in a vice from below by warmer and drier weather patterns eradicating the enfolding cloud.\nAmphibians that once lived here have died back, to the point of species extinction in some cases.\nThe breeding patterns of the area\u2019s emblematic resplendent quetzals \u2013 the colourful birds that have long drawn tourists to the area \u2013 are being disrupted. Lowland species of bats and birds, including toucans, have begun moving into the cloud forest.\nOne of the Costa Rica cloud forest\u2019s most persistent and high-profile champions, Nadkarni has become increasingly concerned about the forest\u2019s future.\nA 64-year-old American scientist who has spent almost 40 years climbing ropes to study the forest canopy, she has seen profound changes in the decades she has spent studying the Monteverde forest.\n\u201cThe tropical cloud forest is a very particular type,\u201d Nadkarni says, reflecting on the fact that only about 1% of the planet\u2019s woodlands are cloud forest.\n\u201cIts most important aspect is the fact that it gets a lot of mist and cloud during most of the year. What\u2019s fabulous about it is that it really nurtures this incredibly diverse and abundant group of plants that live in the canopy, which obtain their water and their nutrients from this mist and cloud.\n\u201cWhen I climb into the forest, when I get away from the dark, damp, windless forest floor \u2013 well, you really enter kind of a different world.\u201d\nNadkarni identifies the montane cloud forest as one of the world\u2019s three most sensitive along with the threatened coral reefs and ice caps.\n\u201cIt is one of the canaries in the coal mine, more sensitive to climate change than others. All are indicative of a world that is experiencing climate change and that\u2019s happening now.\u201d\nNadkarni is not wrong. Once inside, the forest is a dark and dripping place at ground level, its perspectives shifting spookily with the passage of the mists across the rise of the continental divide.\nPunctuating the green curtain are flashes of colour.\nSubtle mauve bells of drymonia compete with the spiky balls of yellow justicia and the blades of vibrant red that attract butterflies and other insects.\nThere are sloths and monkeys in the branches, while coatis and agoutis scamper in the undergrowth.\nBut it is the trees that are most striking, not least the towering strangler figs with trunks like church buttresses.\nThe sheer scale of the diversity is explained by another facet of this ecosystem: the compression of multiple \u201clife zones\u201d into the narrow band of the cloud forest supports huge numbers of species, many still to be identified.\nFollowing Nadkarni and her colleague Cameron Williams 30m up a free hanging rope into the branches, it is hard to credit that her passion for the forest tops almost killed her three years ago. Then, climbing in a forest in the American Pacific north-west, a rope severed, precipitating a 15-metre ground fall.\n\u201cYou know I\u2019ve climbed for 39 years and never had a problem. I always felt that if we take care with our equipment \u2013 with our process or protocols \u2013 that trees actually are one of the safest places to be.\n\u201cBut three years ago, in the temperate rainforest of the Olympic Peninsula, my rope failed. My graduate students said that I didn\u2019t utter a scream. I just fell like a silent sack of sand. I was knocked out for 10 minutes and I was on the forest floor for about six hours before the helicopter came.\u201d\nThe injuries would have stopped most people of 61.\nFive thoracic vertebrae were \u201cexploded\u201d. She lost her spleen as well, and her pelvis was broken in three places; she suffered nine broken ribs, lacerated lungs and a broken fibula. \u201cI was in bad shape.\u201d\nAnd Nadkarni sees her accident as a metaphor for the threat to the cloud forest.\n\u201cI think that fall from a tree made me realise how fragile the human body is. By extension it relates to what I\u2019m trying to do in understanding and communicating the importance of forests.\n\u201cYou can walk into a forest that seems so robust and so healthy and so diverse and so connected and so strong and so useful and so beautiful. Just like I was \u2013 I was robust, I was vibrant, I could climb to the top of any tree.\u201d\nBecause one of the paradoxes of the cloud forest, even under threat, is that it still looks vibrant even as new species move in, undermining its uniqueness.\nIn the research centre at the Monteverde cloud forest reserve, Nadkarni\u2019s fellow scientist Alan Pounds, one of the first people to warn of the threat to the cloud forest from the lifting cloud base in the 1990s, explains that it is not simply a question of the cloud rising.\nInstead the weather appears to be in the midst of a complex, wholesale change that has seen dry days in the forest quadruple in the last four decades. That has also been accompanied by more extreme rainfall, including flash-flooding.\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s hard to quantify exactly, judging from some of the shifts in cloud forest organisms, I would say [the cloud has] shifted upward, so maybe a couple hundred metres over these last 40 years or so. What you can see looking over the years is an increasing number of dry days, in fact quadrupled since the 70s. It\u2019s averaged over 100 days [a year] since 2011.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re teasing out in our analysis is the fact that it\u2019s getting wetter and drier at the same time,\u201d he says, explaining how the persistent mist has given way to drier periods, punctuated by heavy episodes of rain.\n\u201cActually it\u2019s becoming more like a rainforest. We just have more contrast between wet and dry periods.\u201d\nAmong species challenged by these changes, Pounds \u2013 like many the Guardian talks to \u2013 mentions the resplendent quetzal which comes to breed in the cloud forest, feeding on a kind of small avocado.\nMale resplendent quetzal, which breeds in the cloud forest\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good example of what we are talking about when we say it is getting squeezed because there\u2019s no place for it to go upslope.\nPounds mentions a nearby area of woods. \u201cI used to hear them singing every day during breeding season and now they\u2019ve moved out of that area and they\u2019ve become more restricted, moving higher up the mountain here.\u201d\nWhat is doubly ironic, given the threat, is that the community in Monteverde has long been ahead of the curve in terms of conservation efforts, in part the result of a historical coincidence.\nOne key element was the arrival in the 1950s of US Quakers \u2013 pacifists \u2013 who emigrated to the area fleeing the draft for the Korean war.\nDaily life in Santa Elena, which borders the Monteverde cloud forest\nWhile these new residents cleared forest for pastures for dairy farming, they protected parts of the forest to conserve the watershed. In the 1970s, as recognition of the uniqueness of the infrastructure grew, Quakers, incoming scientists and local Costa Ricans formed an informal coalition that has continued to this day as ecotourism emerged as an economic mainstay.\nBut if there is a catch, it is that on an isthmus bounded by warming oceans on two sides \u2013 the Atlantic on the Caribbean side and the Pacific on the other \u2013 it has been impossible to insulate the cloud forest from what is a worldwide phenomenon.\nAnd the impact of global warming has been noticed not only in the forest but in the coffee plantations at its edges.\nOn his plantation, Guillermo Vargas, who doubles as the head of the local tourism council, has seen the mountains transform in his 58 years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been over the last 30 that we have noticed the change in the precipitation,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIt used to rain \u2013 like drizzle \u2013 for many months. It used to be very cloudy most of the year. It used to be very windy with a lot of drizzle and now \u2013 like today [in November, at the end of the rainy season], it\u2019s almost like the dry season.\n\u201cNow it is raining differently. It rains very hard so it impacts the soil, causing more erosion.\n\u201cAlso, the fact that the wet and dry seasons are now not very well defined means that the coffee blooms in January through June. In the past the bloom was concentrated in a period of maybe four or five weeks in the beginning of May, June.\u201d\nThat, says Vargas, has caused economic issues both for farmers and the pickers, including those who come from Nicaragua, who need to come for longer but with fewer coffee beans per day to pick, as the period of the harvest has become much more spread out.\nAnother issue, he adds, is that pests once just seen in Costa Rica\u2019s lowlands have begun appearing at ever higher elevations.\nIt is not only the impact on coffee he is worried about but ultimately on the ecotourism that sustains many of the jobs in the local community.\n\u201cI know that for more than 40 years we have said we are the most famous cloud forest in the world. That this is unique in Costa Rica.\n\u201cWe have been selling Monteverde as a cloud forest and it won\u2019t be a cloud forest in a few decades. It will be like a rainforest. So what visitors can see here, in 2040 they will be able to see [elsewhere].\u201d\nAll of which means, says Vargas, that the ecotourism industry \u2013 which the community has built from a base of 15,000 visitors a year to almost 200,000 \u2013 will also have to adapt to climate change.\n\u201cThe fact that the cloud forest is changing means we have to adapt in terms of the story we tell, to be able to understand the process, and then explain to visitors about the process and still be able to demonstrate that Monteverde is a unique destination not just because of the cloud forest but because of our capacity to teach about climate change.\nDown from the tops of the swaying strangler figs and on solid ground again, Nalini Nadkarni reflects on how the threat of climate change to the place where she has worked for four decades has transformed her in recent years from a scientific researcher into something more activist.\n\u201c[Climate change] is actually happening faster than we thought it was even 10 years ago. And there are certain points that might turn what\u2019s going on in Monteverde right now to change even faster.\n\u201cYou know when I first came here in 1979 as a graduate student and I looked up into the canopy of this Monteverde cloud forest and I saw these plants and animals high above the forest floor, I was just curious about what is going on. I wanted to find out about what\u2019s going on with these canopy plants.\n\u201cBut just 15 years ago I was up in a tree and I heard the sound of a chainsaw just outside the boundary of the Monteverde cloud forest, and I realised in an almost metaphorical way that in fact deforestation, human activities and their negative effects were literally right outside the border of this beautiful little reserve.\u201d\nIt is an issue, she concedes, that has become even more pressing in the Trump era, where climate change denial has been embraced by the White House.\n\u201cAs an American and as a scientist I am horrified. I am ashamed. I actually feel like going into denial about my own country in terms of its response to global climate change.\n\u201cAll of us scientists, not just in America but around the world, know that climate change is being exacerbated. Being caused by human activities, by overconsumption, by use of fossil fuels. And for our leadership to take exactly the wrong turn, to remove ourselves from the Paris treaty, to encourage coal mining \u2026\n\u201cWhat I feel I need to do is to bring my science, bring my understanding of what\u2019s going on in the tropical cloud forest and other ecosystems to the people, to policymakers.\n\u201cI think that scientists are becoming more political. We have become less afraid to speak out against the political regimes that are making these wrong decisions. In the past, even ten years ago, my fellow scientists would not be making these statements.\u201d\nNadkarni reflects on the change. \u201cYou know each species that moves or disappears has repercussions in terms of the ecosystem as a whole. Now the plants are a little bit harder to see. But I know when I climb in the forest, that compared with when I started here 39 years ago, the canopy dwelling plants \u2013 the mosses, the filmy ferns \u2013 they were much more abundant, much more plush, much more \u2026 just wet, than they are now.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/costa-rica", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/americas", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "For 40 years, Nalini Nadkarni has studied cloud forest in the Costa Rican town of Monteverde.

"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "The world has been put on notice that its best efforts so far will fail to halt the devastation of climate change, as countries came to a partial agreement at UN talks that failed to match up to the challenges faced.\nLeading figures in climate science and economics said much more must be done, and quickly, to stave off the prospect of dangerous levels of global warming.\nNicholas Stern, the former World Bank chief economist and author of a seminal review of the economics of climate change, said: \u201cIt is clear that the progress we are making is inadequate, given the scale and urgency of the risks we face. The latest figures show carbon dioxide emissions are still rising. A much more attractive, clean and efficient path for economic development and poverty reduction is in our hands.\u201d\nJohan Rockstrom, director designate at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said: \u201cMy biggest concern is that the UN talks failed to align ambitions with science. We continue to follow a path that will take us to a very dangerous 3-4C warmer world within this century. Extreme weather events hit people across the planet already, at only 1C of warming.\u201d\nThe two-week-long UN talks in Poland ended with clarity over the \u201crulebook\u201d that will govern how the Paris agreement of 2015 is put into action, but the crucial question of how to lift governments\u2019 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was left unanswered.\nCountries will meet again next year. The annual climate talks have been going on since 1992 when the UN framework convention on climate change was signed, binding governments to avoid dangerous levels of climate change. That agreement followed years of scientific predictions on global warming, culminating in a landmark report in 1988 that warned of the dangers.\nSince then, the warnings have grown clearer and scientists have eliminated the possibility that the global warming observed in recent decades has been due to natural forces. It is a manmade problem arising from the use of fossil fuels, which has poured the heat-trapping gas carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\nOn current national emissions-cutting targets, the world would reach more than 3C of warming, scientists say. Two months ago the world\u2019s leading body of climate scientists, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, found that even 1.5C of warming would cause sea level rises, coral reef die-off, extinction of species and droughts, floods, storms and heatwaves that would threaten the world\u2019s stability.\nLevels of warming greater than that would devastate parts of the globe, wiping out agricultural productivity, melting the Arctic ice cap and rendering many areas uninhabitable.\nSome businesses called on governments to act. Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, which represents investors with more than $21tn (\u00a316.7tn) in funds, said: \u201cIt is vital that the world\u2019s governments recognise the serious challenge posed by climate change and urgently scale up their efforts, both at a national level and globally. It is only through signals such as these that investors will have the confidence necessary to allocate the required capital to the low-carbon and climate-resilient transition.\u201d\nNext year\u2019s negotiations, in Chile, are likely to focus on narrow technical issues. But the 2020 conference, which may be held in the UK or Italy, will be the biggest since the landmark Paris agreement of 2015. There, countries will have to come up with plans for cutting emissions drastically in order to avert a climate crisis that scientists say will cause greater economic, social and natural disruption than anything in humanity\u2019s history.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Agreement will fail to halt devastating rise in global temperature, say scientists", "date_published": {"$date": 1544973940000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544996902000}, "authors": ["Fiona Harvey"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Global climate talks", "Climate change", "United Nations", "Environment", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/16/un-climate-accord-inadequate-and-lacks-urgency-experts-warn", "og:description": "Agreement will fail to halt devastating rise in global temperature, say scientists", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a27854cf22cb5e6b2208cfc2b1b67e5869f90663/0_199_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=366ad46a6ef3a286c430313019a36f38", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "UN climate accord 'inadequate' and lacks urgency, experts warn"}, "headline": "N", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a27854cf22cb5e6b2208cfc2b1b67e5869f90663/0_199_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1c5874775a20f88d965a211c53a4694d", "width": "3264", "height": "1958", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a27854cf22cb5e6b2208cfc2b1b67e5869f90663/0_199_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bba30163974c132d33e845bfac8ddb31", "description": "The two-week-long conference left questions about reducing greenhouse gas emissions unanswered.\nPhotograph: Ryan Tong/EPA"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc079b3a2c3613145ed8cae"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/16/bbc-has-a-key-role-in-tackling-the-climate-emergency", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "This Friday, Extinction Rebellion will hold a peaceful demonstration to call upon the BBC to convey the severity of the climate and ecological emergency we are experiencing, and the urgent action needed to address this.

The world remains on track for 3C of warming, which scientists says will bring catastrophic extreme weather.\nMany NGOs said national leaders at the summit had failed to address the urgency of climate change, which is already making heatwaves and storms more frequent and intense, harming millions of people.\nMay Boeve, the executive director of the 350.org climate change campaign group, said: \u201cHope now rests on the shoulders of the many people who are rising to take action: the inspiring children who started an unprecedented wave of strikes in schools to support a fossil-free future; the 1,000-plus institutions that committed to pull their money out of coal, oil, and gas, and the many communities worldwide who keep resisting fossil fuel development.\u201d\nThe school strikes began in August as a solo protest by 15-year-old Greta Thunberg in Sweden. Addressing the summit in Poland, she said: \u201cIf children can get headlines all over the world just by not going to school, then imagine what we could all do together if we really wanted to.\n\u201cYou say you love your children above all else, and yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes. We have run out of excuses and we are running out of time. We have come here to let you know that change is coming, whether you like it or not. The real power belongs to the people.\u201d\nMembers of the Extinction Rebellion (XR) movement said there was a rising tide of protest. \u201cWe pay tribute to activists, students, civil society and the leaders of vulnerable countries who are rising up all over the world demanding more,\u201d said Farhana Yamin, from XR UK. \u201cWe need now to work together to build an emergency coalition focused squarely on tackling climate devastation.\u201d\nXR branches have been set up in 35 countries, organisers said. US protesters aim to organise a day of action on 26 January 2019, and international activists are planning a global week of action from 15 April 2019. XR protests took place in more than a dozen towns across the UK over the weekend, from chalk-spraying a government building in Bristol to holding a \u201cdie-in\u201d demonstration in Cambridge and handing out trees in Glasgow.\nPatti Lynn, the executive director of the Corporate Accountability campaign group, said: \u201cWe will continue to build our movements at home and we will escalate global campaigns to hold big polluters accountable for their role in the climate crisis. The movement to demand climate justice has never been more united, organised or determined. Our day is coming and we will win.\u201d\nJennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International, said: \u201cPeople are fed up, outraged and are taking action to defend their homes and children and pushing their leaders to act These people are the hope of our generation and governments must finally stand with them and give us all reasons for hope.\u201d\nIn the US, Michael Brune, the head of the Sierra Club environmental campaign group, said: \u201cThe American people are joined by the rest of the world in signalling that they will not tolerate any more of Trump\u2019s shameful blustering and inaction, and they have taken up the mantle of climate action while Trump abdicates any semblance of global leadership.\u201d He said more than 100 US cities had committed to 100% clean energy, covering 15% of the US population.\nStephan Singer, a chief adviser at Climate Action Network, an umbrella group for 1,300 NGOs in more than 120 countries, pointed to the wide range of people taking action and demanding more, including youth and faith groups, indigenous peoples, health authorities, farmers, trade unions, city authorities and some financial institutions. \u201cAll these actions and many more have to magnify and multiply in the next years,\u201d he said.\n", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/activism", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/protest", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greenpeace", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Campaigners say they will force governments to act after lack of progress at UN summit", "date_published": {"$date": 1545057038000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1545093900000}, "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Environmental activism", "Environment", "Protest", "Conservation", "United Nations", "Greenpeace", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/17/climate-change-activists-vow-step-up-protests-around-world", "og:description": "Campaigners say they will force governments to act after lack of progress at UN summit", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4dbe971668c1de293735aa37ede44e7c2b85e36/274_191_5146_3088/master/5146.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=958a649c3a4c4496c015373aceaa7ab9", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Climate change activists vow to step up protests around world"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4dbe971668c1de293735aa37ede44e7c2b85e36/274_191_5146_3088/master/5146.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6d2dd2aa733938212ac16fc738d68b56", "width": "5146", "height": "3088", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4dbe971668c1de293735aa37ede44e7c2b85e36/274_191_5146_3088/master/5146.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7b0cd5f728c7318a8d6dbab9a3a5dd6b", "description": "Thousands of climate protesters marching in Brussels, Belgium, earlier this month.\nPhotograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPA"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc079c3a2c3613145ed8cb7"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/18/carmakers-criticise-unrealistic-eu-plan-slash-vehicle-emissions", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "An EU agreement to cut emissions from cars by over a third by 2030 has faced opposition from Europe\u2019s car industry for being \u201cunrealistic\u201d, as well as criticism from environmental groups for being insufficient to achieve climate change targets.\nEU countries will aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from new cars by 37.5% by 2030 compared with 2021, while emissions from new vans will have to be 31% lower. There was also an interim target of a 15% cut for cars and vans by 2025.\nEurope\u2019s car industry reacted with fury, saying the commitment was driven purely by political motives and \u201ctotally unrealistic\u201d.\nErik Jonnaert, the secretary general of the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA), which represents companies such as Renault and BMW, said the targets \u201cwill be extremely demanding on Europe\u2019s auto industry\u201d, with a \u201cseismic impact\u201d on jobs.\nThe agreement on Monday night, which aims to spur the move towards electric vehicles and other alternatives to diesel and petrol, was described by European policymakers as a compromise between environmental concerns and representatives of countries with large car industries that had pushed for a much smaller cut, including Germany.\nMaro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, the European commission\u2019s vice-president for energy union, described the move as \u201canother credible step in the implementation of the Paris agreement but also another decisive step in support of the long-term competitiveness of European industry\u201d.\nEurope is aiming for the transport industry to be climate neutral in the second half of the century, while countries including France and the UK have announced plans to ban sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2040. Carbon emissions from the EU\u2019s transport sector increased by 28.3% between 1990 and 2016, according to the European Environment Agency.\nHowever, the take-up of electric vehicles in Europe has been relatively slow, with political pressure to keep the cost of motoring low spilling into widespread protests in France. Electrically chargeable vehicles made up 1.5% of all cars sold in the EU last year, according to ACEA.\nTransport and Environment, a Brussels-based thinktank, said the reduction in emissions would not be enough to limit climate change. Under the Paris agreement countries including the EU member states have committed to limit global warming to well below 2C (35.6F) and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C.\nGreg Archer, T&amp;E\u2019s clean vehicles director, said: \u201cEurope is shifting up a gear in the race to produce zero-emission cars.

The issue was deferred at the energy council meeting in Adelaide after intervention by the federal energy minister, Angus Taylor.\nOn Thursday Willox said that \u201cadding emissions reductions to the objectives of reliability and affordability, as the Neg proposed, was a way to facilitate investment in generation by giving investors greater certainty\u201d.\n\u201cWe would support minister Harwin\u2019s call for an end to the \u2018climate wars\u2019 and a resumption of an approach to energy that reinserts the objective of emissions reduction,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also agree that a national approach would be vastly superior to having a myriad of state and territory approaches.\u201d\nNSW plans to ask the ESB for options to achieve zero net emissions in the electricity sector by 2050, the state government\u2019s preferred target.\nWillox said that approach \u201cwouldn\u2019t hurt but we need to bear in mind that the energy sector accounts for about 40% of Australia\u2019s emissions\u201d.\n\u201cIn any national target we need to have contributions from other sectors and we need clarity about the policies that will govern how we meet those targets,\u201d he said. \u201cEnergy is a big part of the equation but far from the only one.\u201d\nOn Thursday Harwin told Radio National the Neg \u201chas wide support among the stakeholders and was the right policy in terms of securing Australia\u2019s energy supply into the future with new investment\u201d.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got one half of [the Neg], the reliability obligation \u2026 my point yesterday is we need the other half of it as well,\u201d he said.\nThe South Australian energy minister, Dan van Holst Pellekaan, told Guardian Australia it had also reiterated its \u201congoing support for the emissions reduction obligation\u201d in the Neg but the \u201cearliest opportunity\u201d to consider it is an out of session meeting in February.\nHarwin denied that the Berejiklian government was spooked into action by the impending March state election, arguing it had \u201cbeen advocating for a policy for a lower emissions future for some time\u201d.\nHe said it had \u201cconsistently supported\u201d the work of the former federal energy minister Josh Frydenberg and the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull to achieve the Neg.\nEchoing a favoured dictum of Turnbull, Harwin said he supported emissions reduction targets \u201cbacked by economics and engineering\u201d, agreeing with Taylor that \u201cLabor\u2019s target is too much too fast and would cause substantial upward pressure on prices and cause a reliability problem\u201d.\nFederal Labor\u2019s shadow cabinet and national conference have endorsed a target of 45% reduction in the electricity sector by 2030.\nHarwin said Labor\u2019s targets were \u201cas much of a risk as the fact we don\u2019t have a Neg at all\u201d.\nSince the emissions reduction obligation was ditched in August, the Morrison government has failed to release new climate policy to drive emissions in the electricity or other sectors.\nOn Thursday Taylor defended the government\u2019s claim Australia will meet its Paris target to reduce emissions by 26% by 2030, telling Radio National that \u201cdepartmental numbers\u201d show in the electricity sector a 28% reduction will be achieved by 2023.\nTaylor conceded the figure applied only to the energy sector and dismissed the latest data showing Australia\u2019s emissions are climbing by claiming \u201cfrom year to year you see ups and downs\u201d.\nBy 2020 Australia will beat its Kyoto target by 300 million tonnes and the Coalition is \u201cvery confident\u201d it will then meet the 2030 Paris target, Taylor said, against the advice of climate scientists and economists.\nAt the latest round of UN climate talks Australia lobbied to exploit a controversial climate loophole, using carryover carbon credits from the Kyoto protocol to meet its Paris targets.\nThe Climate Council\u2019s acting chief executive, Martin Rice, accused Taylor of \u201cmisleading the public\u201d by citing electricity sector figures when Australia\u2019s commitment is for economy-wide reductions.\n\u201cHis government\u2019s own published data clearly indicates Australia is not on track to meet its Paris commitments,\u201d he said. \u201cThe energy minister is using very slippery language.

If a scientist or activist talks on air about the human causes of climate change then someone else, often from one of the denial groups funded by the fossil fuel lobby, is usually invited to provide a \u201ccounterargument\u201d (for example, that recent warming is caused by \u201cnatural\u201d factors). This leaves many viewers with the erroneous impression that a genuine scientific is debate taking place and weakens social support for strong measures to address climate change, which is precisely what the organised denial lobby wants.\nIt is time for the BBC to abandon this illusion of impartiality. Global warming demands a new ethos of public service broadcasting. Scientific evidence has made it unambiguously clear that contemporary climate change is caused by human greenhouse gas emissions. There is no scientific equivalence, and certainly no moral equivalence, between what climate scientists have concluded and what the deniers assert. The only scientific debate left is on the scale and pace of change. How bad will it be; and how soon?

And as winters warm up, more frequent outdoor activity by humans is adding to the litter rats thrive upon.\nRat-related complaints have been on the rise over the past four years, with 19,152 calls made to the city last year, an increase of about 10% on 2016. There are no reliable figures on the number of rats in New York \u2013 estimates range from 250,000 to tens of millions \u2013 but the surge in rat activity has been replicated in other cities. Houston, Washington, Boston and Philadelphia have experienced large increases in calls to pest control.\nVeteran anti-rat strategists have, in part, blamed climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex issue but we are seeing rat population increases around the world now,\u201d said Bobby Corrigan, a sought-after rat-catching consultant who once spent a week living in a rat-infested barn in Indiana as part of his PhD research.\n\u201cRequests for my services are through the roof, I can\u2019t keep up with them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou speak to any health commissioner from Boston to DC and the trend is upwards.\n\u201cIn winter rats slow down their reproduction because it\u2019s so cold, but they are probably having one more litter a year now because it\u2019s getting warmer. A litter is around 10 babies and that\u2019s making a difference.\u201d\nMike Deutsch, a veteran rat-catcher at the New York-based Arrow Exterminating Company, said warming temperatures are having a \u201cnatural consequence. As the earth warms you\u2019ll have more activity, more rats about. They won\u2019t be able to keep growing if there\u2019s not enough food or shelter for them but you\u2019ll see populations rise.\u201d\nDeutsch \u2013 whose recent research found that, contrary to popular belief, cats aren\u2019t very good at catching rats \u2013 also pointed to other factors such as urban construction that has disturbed rat families, making them more visible.\nThe increase in rat sightings has spawned viral videos of rats eating pizza and navigating escalators \u2013 but has also raised health concerns. \nA death was recorded in the Bronx last year due to leptospirosis, a rare disease transmitted via rat urine. New York rats trapped and tested by Columbia University researchers were found to be reservoirs of E coli and salmonella, with some even carrying Seoul hantavirus, which can cause kidney failure.\nThe city\u2019s response has been muscular. Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled a $32m plan last year to launch a mass slaughter of rats in infested areas such as Chinatown and the East Village. New York City makes about 100,000 inspections for rat activity each year, and exterminators gas rats to death in their burrows rather than poison them, because of fears over the impact on other wildlife.\nDe Blasio noted darkly that he\u2019s seen \u201cmany a rat\u201d in the city. \u201cI see them in the parks, and in the subway. We\u2019re kind to rats. We just want them to go away.\u201d\nHowever, New York is likely to remain a haven for rats because of its large human population, sprawl of hole-ridden buildings and its copious waste. A warming climate will only exacerbate these rat-friendly conditions.\nThere is mountains of garbage in the city and the rats are saying, \u2018Thanks, we'll bite through that and eat at will'\n\u201cWe are at war but we don\u2019t have weapons to fight the war,\u201d Corrigan said. \u201cWe could get the rat numbers down to tolerable levels but we need to rethink our whole system of doing things.\n\u201cThere are litter baskets all over New York City and every night you see rats in there gorging themselves because it\u2019s easy. There are mountains of bags of garbage in the city and the rats are saying, \u2018Thanks, we will bite through that and eat at will.\u2019 The rats are taking advantage of our weaknesses.\u201d\nRats have become so ingrained in the fabric of New York life that researchers have discovered genetically distinct \u201cuptown\u201d and \u201cdowntown\u201d rats.\nEven those tasked with killing rats recognize they will never be eliminated from the New York experience. An anonymous advertising copywriter, who calls herself the \u201cElena Ferrante of rats\u201d, offers an unusual online gifting service where she will exterminate rats for a fee, providing a certificate to mark the kill.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have it out for rats. I think they\u2019re pretty impressive,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cThere\u2019s just too many of them.\u201d\nDeutsch, who has caught rats in places as diverse as Arizona and on cruise ships meandering around Europe, said he has developed \u201ca relationship with rats.\u201d\n\u201cThey are an incredible animal, I admire their ability to adapt to different situations,\u201d he said. \u201cI look at them as a tremendous success.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Rat-related callouts rise as experts say warming temperatures are helping New York\u2019s rats feed and mate longer into the year", "date_published": {"$date": 1545372023000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1545403313000}, "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "article_section": "US news", "article_tags": ["New York", "Climate change", "US news", "World news", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/21/new-york-rat-crisis-climate-change", "og:description": "Rat-related callouts rise as experts say warming temperatures are helping New York\u2019s rats feed and mate longer into the year", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e1d940cf65538db503a74a57a8c1fe49c078943/218_111_1566_940/master/1566.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=8379da5c54aa64b217ce34a1d587b2a5", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "'We are at war': New York's rat crisis made worse by climate change"}, "headline": "N", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e1d940cf65538db503a74a57a8c1fe49c078943/0_68_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8f8bf538c354b43e391f1ec57bfa765a", "width": "2048", "height": "1229", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e1d940cf65538db503a74a57a8c1fe49c078943/0_68_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d5c40b428087f369f2069ee038be3ab0", "description": "There are no reliable figures on the number of rats in New York \u2013 estimates range from 250,000 to tens of millions.

I felt we were up against it and it was becoming real. Seeing British lawns the colour of dry hay for weeks, getting a heatstroke when vising Kew Gardens, and lastly the extent and ferocity of the wildfires in California truly scared me. I\u2019ve joined Greenpeace. Catherine Laz, 56, London\nThe moment that did it for me was reading the IPCC report that said we have 12 years to reduce carbon emissions to keep global warming to a limit of 1.5 degrees, and that 2 degrees is the tipping point. Knowing that we are warming at an average of 0.2 degrees per decade is scary, and the projections of reaching 4 degrees by 2050 if business as usual is continued shocked me. I\u2019ve been reading more about climate change and the hot summer of 2018 has definitely been an eye opener in demonstrating its huge impact. We have been fed the lies by governments and businesses that we can significantly reduce climate change by taking personal responsibility \u2013 such as recycling more and turning off lights \u2013 when really we need to be demanding government to tax carbon, divest from fossil fuel and invest in renewables. Amina Jahan Ali, 26, London\nI\u2019ve always thought I was reasonably aware of climate change so this summer I had a fairly uneasy feeling about the heatwave we were experiencing. In August I read the hot house earth article in the Guardian and had what can only be described as a mental breakdown. I had a week where I barely ate, drank or slept. It was like I was suddenly thrust into a different world. The thought of having brought children into a dying world was hugely distressing. I hid from the news for a week or two but then decided that this was making things worse so plunged into articles on the true state of the planet, and am doing what I can including going vegan and becoming a member of the Extinction Rebellion. Jennie Gibson, 34, Manchester\nWhat really made me take notice was the UN report this year and an article in the New York magazine, which said we basically now have the permission to freak out. I don\u2019t think people realize how climate change is going to affect us \u2013 we\u2019ve seen it in 2018 with extreme heatwaves in countries such as India. It makes me so mad to know that the really rich people in the world will probably escape death from this and the ordinary people are the ones who will suffer. It\u2019s very frightening and unjust. I heard children in Australia were striking in schools for more action to be taken and hope this tactic is adopted by more people to demand appropriate action if it\u2019s not being done. Margaret Lynch, 31, Ireland\nClimate change has made me fearful before, but in 2018 I am thinking about it every day, and I am terrified that the lives my children might be living in a few years will be ones of desolation and suffering.\nIt was really brought home by the launch of Extinction Rebellion, which I discovered via George Monbiot. I still feel unsure about what I can actually do, beyond the micro-scale \u2013 avoiding plastic, driving and flying as little as possible, etc. In this country I\u2019m not prepared to get myself arrested \u2013 but what, other than civil disobedience, will change the minds of the policymakers? Shari Daya, 40, Cape Town\nFires in Northern California, where I live, were one of the main factors for me. Two years in a row, in addition to many lives lost and homes destroyed, we have had several days of choking, toxic smoke affecting millions and millions of people, including me and my loved ones. Last year the smoke lasted about 5 days; this year it was 12. Next year, will the smoke last for 20 days? A month? How much clean air will we have in Northern CA as the years go on? When my daughter becomes an adult, will she say \u201cwell, in my day at least we still did outside sports.\u201d\nOf course I had heard about climate change before, but I think I really thought it was mostly about sea-level rise, and I thought, \u201cwell, as long as I live more than a few feet above sea level, I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d But in this piece, a professor says \u201cthe odds of human civilization reaching the 22nd century are often estimated at no better than 50/50.\u201d This statistic walloped me, shocked me, and in fact frightened me beyond belief. Among other things I have joined 350.org and attended the Climate March in San Francisco in 2018. Isobel White, 50, San Francisco Bay\nHaving endured ex Hurricane Ophelia last year and the Beast from the East this year, the message did become more relevant than ever. My concern is that some remedies put forward raise legitimate concerns too. For example, the French riots show us that there is little democratic appetite in developed countries to implement the IPCC\u2019s solution, which is to rapidly decarbonise our economies using carbon taxes as tools to ration fossil fuel consumption, while the coverage of the activities of Extinction Rebellion in the UK towards the end of the year shows that extreme measures are currently only being undertaken by relatively few. David, 50, Ireland\nI think I\u2019d recognised it before and seen the effects, but this year it really seemed to hit home in the developed countries. People, the media and politics are starting to take notice \u2013 now we need to act. Aid agencies have been complicit in past downplaying of the threat \u2013 choosing not to emphasise climate as a clear diver and direct cause of emergencies for fear of alienating donors and supporters. This must change: we have to galvanise all elements of society and international politics and ensure we act. Much of the work I do as an aid worker is in response to climate change or the effects of climate change on politics and people \u2013 this isn\u2019t just serious, it\u2019s an existential threat that drives crises across the globe. People in the worst affected regions won\u2019t stay where they are and we are woefully underprepared to deal with the consequences. David Wightwick\nI have been concerned about climate change for some time, but was prompted to be more actively involved this year due to the changing political landscape. No longer can we count on our governments alone to address the threat in a meaningful and comprehensive way. Democracy and societal good needs loud citizen voices now. Aside from supporting political parties that have policies to address climate change I have joined a local group working for a more locally sustainable society.

And Elliott is right to say that the official declaration that came out of Katowice was not nearly enough.\nBut that wasn\u2019t the only thing that came from the climate talks. There was a newly prominent place for civil society, from teenager Greta Thunberg to nonagenarian David Attenborough, and some companies, and many state and city governments, stepping up to the plate.\nWe\u2019ve been trashing the planet over recent decades while creating a miserable, insecure society.\nThe 12 years that the IPCC gave us is an agonisingly short period to transform the world economy. But both Facebook and Twitter were infants 12 years ago; rapid change is a normal part of the human condition.\nHistory is not pre-written, or destined to repeat itself. Offering the hope that with political, economic, social, educational and environmental transformation we can build a society that works for the common good, within the physical limits of this one fragile planet, is politically essential. The politics of the far right is built on fear and we must not feed that.\nBusiness as usual isn\u2019t an option. But then that is one thing that certainly is not going to happen.

In late 2017, White House officials urged him to abandon the idea.\nYet according to emails obtained by the Guardian through a Freedom of Information Act request, as recently as mid-May 2018 aides were considering an alternative: the agency could ask for public comments on a 2009 legal finding that requires the US government to regulate greenhouse gases.\nIf by that process the EPA could successfully rescind the conclusion that greenhouse gases endanger public health, the federal government would no longer have to regulate major sources of carbon pollution, including power plants.\nAccording to a former senior administration official speaking on the condition of anonymity, the plan to ask for comments rather than hold a public debate was a compromise struck between the White House and the EPA. In July, however, Pruitt resigned, following dozens of stories about his ethical troubles.\nThe emails obtained by the Guardian offer a glimpse of how the Trump administration has struggled to settle on a position on climate change.\nTrump himself has repeatedly doubted overwhelming research that shows humans burning fossil fuels are emitting greenhouse gases that raise global temperatures and cause catastrophic environmental changes. A number of top officials have expressed similar feelings or questioned how bad climate change will be, and federal agencies are reversing climate change mitigation efforts for power plants and cars.\nHowever, many Republicans and large energy companies urging Trump to rescind regulations do not want the EPA to debate the 2009 climate change finding, fearing a losing battle.\nThe Midwest power provider American Electric Power, for example, opposes reconsidering the finding. It has long relied on coal but is shifting its electricity mix.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the business community wants this at all,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, who was a climate change adviser to Bill Clinton. \u201cThey all came out against leaving [the Paris climate agreement]. They all have statements on their websites that they believe in climate science. The last thing they want is to get thrust into the middle of this.\u201d\nPruitt\u2019s most conservative supporters pushed him to re-examine the finding anyway, a move which would require a full scientific review and prompt massive legal battles.\nIt is not clear how serious the EPA considerations were or whether Pruitt\u2019s staff intended to eventually propose a rollback. Attachments shared in emails between senior staff members included an \u201cEndangerment ANPRM draft\u201d, referring to an \u201cadvance notice of proposed rulemaking\u201d, an early step in the regulatory process. Another email contained a version of talking points for a \u201cNotice of Opportunity to Comment\u201d.\nConservative groups, including the Competitive Enterprise Institute, had petitioned the EPA to re-evaluate the endangerment finding. The EPA could have posted those petitions and asked for public comments. Or it could have solicited input as part of another climate-related rollback.\nThe documents referred to in the emails were not released, because the Freedom of Information Act does not require the government to release records that were part of ongoing deliberations. One subject line referenced an afternoon meeting.\nThe staffers exchanging the drafts, air official Mandy Gunasekara and the policy chief, Brittany Bolen, stayed at the EPA when Pruitt left. In a brief interview this month, Gunasekara said the agency\u2019s \u201cunderstanding of CO2 and greenhouse gases continues to evolve\u201d. She declined to comment on the released emails. Spokespeople for the EPA and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.\nEmails released to the Guardian also showed the EPA air chief, Bill Wehrum, planning in December to make an announcement about the \u201cRTBT\u201d, the notional \u201cred team, blue team\u201d debate.\nThis month, in a draft rule to ease standards for new coal plants, the EPA said it would accept comments on whether the agency had correctly interpreted the endangerment finding.\nClimate advocates say the EPA should be transparent about its plans now.\n\u201cAmericans deserve to know whether acting EPA head, Andrew Wheeler, nominated to be EPA administrator, disputes that carbon pollution endangers human health and the environment,\u201d said John Walke, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.\nAccording to a peer-reviewed paper published last week in the journal Science, scientific evidence showing that greenhouse gases are dangerous to public health is even stronger than it was when the endangerment finding was established in 2009.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Emails released to Guardian show staff considered questioning 2009 greenhouse gases finding after White House denied administrator\u2019s \u2018red team, blue team\u2019 idea", "date_published": {"$date": 1545462021000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1545462021000}, "authors": ["Emily Holden"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["US Environmental Protection Agency", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Environment", "Science", "US politics", "Trump administration", "Republicans", "US news", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/21/scott-pruitt-epa-climate-change-science-red-team-blue-team-debate", "og:description": "Emails released to Guardian show staff considered questioning 2009 greenhouse gases finding after White House denied administrator\u2019s \u2018red team, blue team\u2019 idea", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db2085e672418f1cb86eb92cc7b568e9a50d337c/0_0_2029_1217/master/2029.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=f2c58560dece59f6f8e07e1d429ee7cc", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Scott Pruitt never gave up EPA plans to debate climate science, records show"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db2085e672418f1cb86eb92cc7b568e9a50d337c/0_0_2029_1217/master/2029.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1aceb1d79f62702ec73061c8657b4078", "width": "2029", "height": "1217", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db2085e672418f1cb86eb92cc7b568e9a50d337c/0_0_2029_1217/master/2029.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5f01a3342819ee84bf2be1502be51094", "description": "Scott Pruitt on Capitol Hill in May.\nPhotograph: Al Drago/Reuters"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc079eea2c3613145ed8cca"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/22/frankie-boyle-review-2018-forget-brexit", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Consider the plight of the satirist. I know you\u2019ve got your own plight, and there are only so many plights that you can consider at any one time, and that the plight of the satirist might even seem to you to be one of the easier plights. A satirist, you imagine, is having a pretty heavy week if they do more than pop up on The News Quiz to say that every MP in the DUP looks like a committee member of a bowling club who\u2019s just seen a visitor enter the bar wearing jeans. And now that you put it like that, yes, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not much of a plight at all, really.\nThe plight of the satirist, such as it is, is a compulsion to look at the grimmest, most important thing they can think of, and then for reasons that probably wouldn\u2019t survive a really good therapist, try to make it funny. To try to address the iniquities of their society, the satirist must manufacture some hope that what they\u2019re doing might make a difference, then type it all up and send it off somewhere before they remember that it never does. Looking back over the events of this year is a bit like holding a doll for a therapist and pointing to where the bad man hurt you. Among the lowlights were:\n1 Theresa May dancing on stage at the Conservative Party conference (choreographer Ray Harryhausen), looking like an uncloaked Dementor on a hen weekend.\n2 A group of deranged kippers burning a cardboard effigy of Grenfell tower. They were later quizzed by police, and Kensington and Chelsea council, who asked them to quote for some public housing projects. \n3 A senate grilling of Mark Zuckerberg, who gave the general impression of a Batman villain whose backstory is being given puberty-delaying drugs by a paedophile, and who seemed visibly relieved to be questioned on privacy concerns rather than Facebook\u2019s monopoly power.\n4 The continuing media fascination with Jacob Rees-Mogg, a man who has all the authenticity of a character at a murder-mystery weekend.\n5 Philip Hammond delivering a budget speech so dry it was sponsored by Vagisil, making watching for 75 minutes feel like a gateway drug for necrophilia.\n6 The hilarious emergence of the phrase \u201crules-based international order\u201d, which I like to imagine pronounced with the jaded, lisping irony of Gore Vidal, drunk on his deathbed.\n7 The Palestinian right-of-return marches that demonstrated the old Israeli proverb, you can\u2019t make an omelette without shooting protesters. Trump said the US was \u201cfully committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement\u201d. The lasting peace that will come about once Israel has shot all the Palestinians.\nBeyond that, the year broke down into four seemingly unending and increasingly apocalyptic chapters.\nThe Brexit endgame\nDomestically, the year was dominated by the Conservative party successfully externalising its bitter divisions on trade. They have never, in their whole history, not been fighting about trade: trade laws are to the Tory party what ownership of the Queen Vic is to EastEnders.\nTheresa May was always only a placeholder prime minister, something that would appear to make about as much sense as using a slice of Victoria sponge as a bookmark. At the time of going to press, she had survived a vote of no confidence from Tory MPs, and there was the general impression that European leaders had agreed to end freedom of movement just to stop her from visiting them. Throughout the year, Boris Johnson has maintained that dishevelled, confused look of the people at the end of a disaster movie being ferried to the ambulances. He resigned as foreign secretary in July, barking \u201cChequers is dead\u201d as if he were in an Agatha Christie novel and had just discovered the body of the butler at the bottom of the stairs. Johnson has promised a bonfire of EU regulations, a teetering one, without fencing and namby-pamby safety glasses, so that we can wipe the drifting cinders from our newly liberated eyes screaming, \u201cFuck you, Brussels! Maybe I want to be blind!\u201d I look forward to a UK without EU red tape, and vegans weeping in supermarkets that resemble a cross between a botanical freak show and a fruit-and-veg hospice.\nI say, let\u2019s forget the worries of Brexit for a week or two, and just enjoy our last Christmas with running water. Brexit has many downsides, but I think it will be nice for the Irish to watch a British famine. Personally I look forward to a new age where the London Christmas lights won\u2019t be turned on by vacuous celebrities, but by someone found guilty of \u201ctalking foreign\u201d and sentenced to complete the circuit. A time where we no longer guess the fluctuations of the market, but our high priests stare into polished heads, newly bald from radiation sickness, and interpret the patterns cast by the light of flickering sewer-fat candles.\nParadoxically, I think Brexit will actually lead to less nationalism: economic collapse meaning that borders lose all their current toxicity, as they\u2019re constantly redrawn in a never-ending struggle between regional warlords, antibiotic-resistant microbes and organ-harvesting cyborgs. Our children will have less inclination to dwell on skin colour as they\u2019ll be preoccupied with appeasing the whims of some pitiless, scab-encrusted Cyclops waving a horse\u2019s hoof nailed to a broomstick, roaring for fresh meat as he plays his three-note national anthem on a ribcage xylophone.\nIt is at times like those that we will remember the work of Dominic Raab, who resigned in November, having decided that he could not endorse a deal that he himself had negotiated. Raab didn\u2019t want to be Brexit secretary, but he didn\u2019t have the negotiating skills to decline the job. When Raab took over, I was heartened by the thought that negotiations were being handled by someone with the air of an embattled leisure centre manager, who could be outmanoeuvred by a statue of Stephen Hawking. Surely better withdrawal terms have been negotiated during prison sex. Much of the Brexit discourse has revolved around people who seem inbred telling us that diversity is bad, but there don\u2019t seem to be any easy solutions. In a way, I envy the touching optimism of people who feel that another referendum might clear up all this bad feeling once and for all.\nThe Labour party somehow managed to achieve a Brexit position more incoherent than a government of opportunists at war with itself. There is definitely something odd about Labour supporting free movement for goods and not, well, labour. Meanwhile, May tried to attack Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s handling of antisemitism while in the middle of the Windrush scandal, which was like Pol Pot complaining about gender balance in the films of Martin Scorsese. Corbyn has mastered a lot of things, but strangely not saying shit just to get elected. Mate, say some shit just to get elected: it\u2019s really your only job right now. This needs to go to the top of your to-do list, not somewhere down below \u201cfix the spare room door\u201d.\nAnd yet, he has undoubtedly been travestied by a press who must somehow contrive to terrify Middle England with a man who looks as if he celebrates New Year\u2019s Eve by edging the lawn. Corbyn was attacked in August after the Daily Mail printed pictures of him laying a wreath for some Palestinian martyrs. Corbyn argued that, just because he was near the graves of terrorists, didn\u2019t mean he was honouring terrorists. Personally, I\u2019m surprised our politicians find the time to lay so many wreaths when not one of them has poured liquor on the ground for Tupac.\nPerhaps some idea of how Britain intends to deal with the post-Brexit world is encapsulated in the Dickensian figure of the secretary of state for international trade, Dr Liam Fox, a man for whom Another Day, Another Dollar means the proposed minimum wage in our trade agreement with the US. You might wonder how a former doctor can cheerfully promote arms sales. Luckily, Liam\u2019s brain has plenty of experience hosting seemingly irreconcilable contradictions: such as believing we should all stand on our own two feet, while claiming expenses of three pence for a 100-metre car journey in 2012. Liam Fox manages to be a grotesque moral nihilist and yet, somehow, not even the worst Dr Fox. Like me, he was raised on an Irish Catholic council estate in Scotland. It\u2019s these sliding-doors moments where I have to thank alcoholism for denying me the focus to become a genocidal sociopath.\nYet perhaps the clearest signpost to post-Brexit Britain this year lay in Boris Johnson, and later Prince Andrew, advocating the procurement of a new Royal Yacht. Andrew said that, for British exports, it would be a tool in the bag \u2013 despite having never used a tool, or carried a bag. There is no doubt that having Prince Andrew on such a boat could boost Britain\u2019s reputation, provided it never docks.\nOf course it\u2019s hardly the first ship the royals have had: that burned up entering the atmosphere after their journey here from their home planet, Azeroth 9. But how do you respond to the monarchy asking for a \u00a3100m boat? The history of European royalty suggests they\u2019re going to be well ahead of any suggestion to \u201cgo fuck themselves\u201d. On balance, I say stick with the royal train: we can always add an international dimension just by extending the tracks into the sea.\nA Saudi Arabian horror show\nThe murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi Arabia is another very difficult subject to find the lighter side of, unless someone in the Ecuadorean embassy has clipped the story out and stuck it to the fridge. The 15 Saudi suspects have been banned from entering the UK, which is a shame as the people this hurts the most are the box office staff at Salisbury Cathedral. Turkey wants the murderers tried there, possibly because sticking journalist killers into a Turkish jail will really tidy up the lifers\u2019 wing.\nYou can imagine that this is all quite surreal for the Saudis; they behead people in public, and starve the children of Yemen. The idea that they would be lambasted for killing a fully grown man in private with no witnesses must seem ridiculous; it would be as if I had got into trouble for saying someone looked like a spoon.\nThe murder was such a calamitous fuck-up from start to finish, I like to think that it\u2019s got David Davis\u2019s fingerprints all over it. Considering the version of events that the Saudis were willing to push, I\u2019d love to see the ones they rejected. \u201cWe regret to inform you that Mr Khashoggi perished while attempting to rape an outboard motor.\u201d They killed Khashoggi with a bone saw. No wonder they need to buy arms: their own weaponry seems to be sourced from the Whoops! shelf at Homebase.\nWe apparently \u201cshare values\u201d with the Saudis. After they behead someone (48 in the first four months of the year), they sometimes crucify the body in the public square for three days. Watching a horror movie in Saudi Arabia must have all the adrenaline buzz of a local council meeting. I\u2019m guessing the most horrifying film you could screen there would be a remake of The Dukes of Hazzard where Daisy Duke drives her own car.\nOur government was angry about Khashoggi and sent the Saudis a strongly worded arms invoice. Perhaps it\u2019s unfair to expect Britain to criticise the Saudis. Can we be expected to take the moral high ground when it comes to royal families sanctioning murder? Sadly, the only long-term consequences of Khashoggi being killed will be that, in future, when a Saudi diplomat orders a pizza, the Deliveroo rider will kick it the last few feet to the front door. Despite the long-running, disgraceful and illegal war in Yemen, there is no sign from Britain of a moratorium on weapons sales. So Britain, an international arms dealer, censuring someone for using its products would be as hypocritical as that bit when Willy Wonka rolls his eyes at Augustus Gloop.\nSaudi\u2019s war in Yemen struggles to get much coverage here, despite the significant role Britain plays; sometimes it seems that only journalists getting killed will engage the British press. In the US, the worst person you can kill would be a cop; in China, a government official; and in the UK, woe betide you if you touch anyone who\u2019s mastered Pitman shorthand.\nPerhaps the saddest part of this whole business is knowing that there are so few British journalists committed enough to get murdered: you could silence most just by breaking the fingers they use to do select all, copy, paste. Nobody\u2019s going to flay you to death just for barking offers of money through the letterboxes of recently bereaved parents, or trawling for offensive tweets with your free hand. Of course, there are a lot of good journalists. Perhaps journalist is now just too broad a term, in much the way the word actor encompasses everyone from Meryl Streep to Sooty.\nThere\u2019s no point asking how UK arms dealers sleep at night after watching footage from Yemen, as they\u2019ll reply, \u201cVery well: in fact my erection even stops me rolling out of bed.\u201d Yet shouldn\u2019t we, as a society, demand better? If we can set aside the moral element here (and I don\u2019t know that we can, but just as an exercise in trying to recognise the sheer breadth of our current futility, it might prove useful), Britain sees its interests as almost synonymous with an industry that isn\u2019t labour intensive, or environmentally sustainable, and that seems to be riddled with corruption, because it reminds us of what it was like to be powerful.\nTrump trumps himself\nOf course Donald Trump trundled out in front of the cameras like a corpse on a Segway and announced: \u201cWe are with Saudi Arabia, we are staying with Saudi Arabia.\u201d I honestly think that the Republican establishment is just coming to terms with how useful Trump is \u2013 realising that this troll-doll King Lear, who looks like something you\u2019d pick off a baking tray after cooking pizza above it, can say the things that they themselves would like, or find useful to say, but can\u2019t because of some vestigial attachment to decency. The Republicans\u2019 current attitude to Trump is of turning a blind eye to your racist builder because you just need to get the conservatory finished.\nTrump has not refashioned the GOP in his own image. He has achieved something more significant: he has managed to maintain a semantic distance from the Republican party despite cheerfully delivering its agenda. Meanwhile, the Democratic establishment has chosen to mirror his attachment to nepotism, entitlement and conspiracy theory \u2013 not that the conspiracy theory is necessarily invalid. Trump might, I suppose, be a Russian spy: it would certainly explain why he can\u2019t speak English. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s normalising his own behaviour; it\u2019s that, by comparison, he\u2019s normalising that of dreadful people everywhere. Jared Kushner, a bloodless, lipless demon, a dependent clause of the Anti-Life Equation who could be thrown into any Edgar Allan Poe adaptation and trusted to improvise, looks merely emo in comparison.\nThe racial animus that Trump has cynically aggravated saw his supporters protesting Nike\u2019s Colin Kaepernick advert in September. The Nike swoosh is now the sound their products make when they go on fire. One patriot filmed himself destroying his Nike clothing by cutting off the top couple of inches from his socks. Instead of destroying the clothing, he\u2019s created an additional, free set of Nike sweatbands.\nWhat does it say about our times that we\u2019re expected to look for moral guidance to corporations like Nike, whose brand message of \u201cJust do it\u201d started out as a looped PA announcement in their Vietnamese trainer factory. I\u2019ve always been wary of Nike \u2013 I think because their single tick logo is so reminiscent of the one used in my youth for Bob a Job: just a glimpse of a trainer and I\u2019m back in short trousers, fibre-glassing that pensioner\u2019s loft for a shiny 50 pence piece. (If you\u2019re interested it was 10p for the insulating, 40p for wearing the shorts.)\nDespite Trump\u2019s rage, the taking-a-knee protests have continued. It\u2019s odd, in most cultures going down on a knee is considered respectful: personally, I expect either a proposal or a medley of hits from Oklahoma. You have to hand it to the president; it shows a certain ambition to try to undermine the idea of protest in a country that was founded by, well, Protestants. Trump has tried to make this about respect for a flag I very much doubt he could draw from memory, and for military service that he studiously avoided.\nOf course the NFL players are not actually protesting the flag. That would be as pointless as arguing with a sock, screaming at a table cloth, or a whole bunch of other stuff Trump probably does on a daily basis. The protest was originally about racial justice, and black people being shot dead by the police. You have to ask yourself how abusive a relationship has to be if even kneeling in silence is too provocative, how you are valued in a country where even the statement that your life matters ignites furious dissent.\nThere is an obvious misogyny to the Trump administration, and the president no doubt has many supporters whose idea of foreplay consists of dropping a rope ladder down a well. This was highlighted by the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court, despite a confirmation hearing where he unspooled like a Columbo villain, bellowing endlessly about his love of beer. Trump ordered an FBI probe during the hearing, an investigation that was concluded with the speed of an airplane edit of CSI Miami. An investigation that ranged from the FBI agent looking at himself in the mirror and noting that Judge Kavanaugh wasn\u2019t at that moment raping him, all the way through to noting that he hadn\u2019t raped anyone during his time on television being questioned by senators.\nWith Kavanaugh now on the bench, the irony for American women is that huge amounts of beer will soon become their only means of abortion. Should he be any kind of judge? There\u2019s an argument that the very last thing you want to hand to any man accused of sex crimes is a hammer, but then again maybe we need his hands where we can see them. Still, it certainly is a very scary time for young men in America. Especially the ones aged 10 that Trump has put in cages.\nA climate of fear\nAt least Trump, looking like a cross between Dr Frankenstein\u2019s first attempt and a tiebreak dinner for the contestants on I\u2019m A Celebrity, came up with the solution to politicians only ever making short-term policies: he made sure there will only be a short term. This year he appointed a former energy lobbyist as head of the environmental protection agency, and announced his intention to change regulations that prohibited new coal burning plants. My guess is that the only concession Republicans plan to make to global warming will be to change the lyrics of America The Beautiful to \u201c\u2026from sea to boiling sea\u201d.\nClimate catastrophe is imminent. Climate change could decimate pollinating species, leading to a world starved of fruit and vegetables. The best way to alert the world to that danger is to hold the next climate conference in Coatbridge, a town so short of fibre many residents can only shit successfully with the aid of a corkscrew. Perhaps we should try to look on the bright side. The colossal internet servers that provide the architecture for the modern world\u2019s de-socialisation are based above the Arctic Circle. Should they burn out through lack of natural cooling, maybe people will look up from their phones and withered genitalia to once more make eye contact.\nThe death of the planet seems almost too big to take in, doesn\u2019t it? The real tragedy is not that we can\u2019t prevent it. The real tragedy, I think, lies in the fact that we can. There are a lot of things we can change through political action, some small, some large, that would add up to saving the Earth.\nConsider again the plight of the children starving in Yemen. It\u2019s a hard thing to consider. It\u2019s OK to admit that, I think \u2013 that it\u2019s hard to empathise: you don\u2019t know much about it, you have your own plight, and it\u2019s a difficult thing to think about. To consider that, in a world that has pub lunches, wristwatches, golden retrievers, the novels of Donna Tartt, the music of Kendrick Lamar, flumes and The Amazing Spider-Man, there is still a plight where you starve to death, as a child, for no reason.\nI mean, there is a reason, that I suppose has somehow made itself too obvious to mention. The reason is that some people are addicted to money and power, many of them pathologically so, and we let them do what they like. In our name, and with our taxes, we let them kill who they like in the service of their bored, baroque perversity, because we don\u2019t care enough to stop them. We cannot seem to rouse ourselves, even as they move to turn the world into a consuming flame. We are running out of time to save the children of Yemen, and ourselves \u2013 and yet we could still, in theory, be redeemed. Consider the plight of the satirist.\n\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "It\u2019s been tough to find much to laugh about this year.

That average went up through the 1990s and 2000s, but over the past decade it has risen dramatically: 2014 saw more than 1,200 turtles make landfall. This year, more than 790 sea turtles have washed up on Cape Cod so far. Some 720 of those are Kemp\u2019s ridley sea turtles, a critically endangered species that nests on the shores of the much warmer Gulf of Mexico.\nIt is an event unmatched in magnitude anywhere else in the world.\nThose who study sea turtles say part of the reason that annual strandings are up in Massachusetts is that efforts to conserve and boost Kemp\u2019s ridley populations have been successful. But the other part is that the Gulf of Maine is rapidly warming in the face of climate change and proving to be a more hospitable environment for turtles than it used to be, drawing them in larger numbers and resulting in them staying longer into the year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s warm water now,\u201d said Bob Prescott, the director of the Massachusetts Audubon Society\u2019s Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary on Cape Cod.\nThe Mass Audubon tracks turtle strandings and is on the frontline of turtle rescue. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t think they understand is the change in the seasons. These are tropical and sub-tropical turtles and I don\u2019t think they understand the change in season, cold fronts and the water getting colder and colder,\u201d Prescott said.\nThe Gulf of Maine, which the Cape Cod peninsula juts into like a flexing arm, is warming faster than 99% of the world\u2019s waters. This year marked the gulf\u2019s third-warmest year on record. The warming is responsible for a boom in the lobster industry in Maine and has invited new fish species, such as the black sea bass, to the area. But for turtles, it has proved dangerous.\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually a good foraging habitat for them, really,\u201d said Kate Sampson, the sea turtle stranding and disentanglement coordinator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office in Gloucester, Massachusetts. \u201cIt\u2019s just unfortunate that it brings them right into this area that has a trap.\u201d\nThat trap is Cape Cod, which many sea turtles counterintuitively have to swim north and then east to get around in order to flee to warmer waters when winter approaches.\n\u201cCape Cod Bay we often call a deadly bucket,\u201d said Tony LaCasse, the New England Aquarium\u2019s spokesperson. As turtles swim north, they run into colder water \u201cand their instinct tells them something is wrong \u2026 their instinct tells them to retreat back into the shallow warmer water of the bay and wait it out. But the problem is it\u2019s the end of the season and there\u2019s no way to get out\u201d.\nKemp\u2019s ridley turtles begin their lives on beaches on the Gulf of Mexico. The few that survive the mad dash from their eggs to the water and the predators of the shallows settle down for the first few years of their lives in sargassum, floating forests of seaweed that offer safety to the tiny adolescent turtles. The Gulf Stream carries sargassum north and it is believed that the turtles washing up on Massachusetts\u2019 coast \u2013 which are largely between two and four years old according to Sampson \u2013 are exploring a coastal habitat for the first time.\nKara Dodge, a research scientist who focuses on sea turtles at Boston\u2019s New England Aquarium, said beyond the Gulf of Maine\u2019s warming, changes to ocean circulation patterns due to climate change could also affect the magnitude of stranding events by bringing more young sea turtles up from the Gulf of Mexico into the western Atlantic.\nIf climate change continues as expected, she said, \u201cthe prediction is that we will continue to see these high-stranding events, hundreds of animals, for the foreseeable future\u201d.\nCold-stunning events sometimes affect sea turtles elsewhere, such as along the Gulf coast off Florida and Texas, but they are generally short-lived, the result of a sudden cold snap. The challenge in Massachusetts, researchers say, is that turtles washing up on shore have largely been exposed to long-term hypothermia.\nThe large-scale turtle stranding events that Massachusetts has seen in recent years have resulted in the rise of a large, complex network of rescuers working to save as many turtles as possible.\nEmployees of the Massachusetts Audubon Society and an army of volunteers patrol Cape Cod\u2019s northern beaches in November and December looking for stranded turtles. Cold-stunned turtles recovered on Cape Cod are then driven to the New England Aquarium\u2019s sea turtle hospital in Quincy, near Boston, where hypothermic, emaciated and often sick turtles are rewarmed, treated and rehabilitated. The process usually takes months.\nThe sea turtle hospital in Quincy has treated more than 400 turtles so far this year. However, it has struggled to keep up with the sharp rise in strandings and moves stabilised turtles to treatment facilities elsewhere in the country when it reaches capacity.\nEdward Filangeri is a volunteer pilot who helps the organisation Turtles Fly Too to move turtles from Massachusetts to other facilities. Every year since 2014, Filangeri has flown his single-engine aircraft up from New York\u2019s Long Island, where he lives, to Massachusetts to pick up turtles packed in banana boxes and ferry them south. By flying during November and December he has to contend with winter weather while also working to keep the temperature in his small aircraft turtle-friendly.\n\u201cWhen we get the temperature just right they want to start swimming and I know we\u2019re doing a good job when I hear a lot of cardboard rubbing in the back of the plane,\u201d he said. \nThose working to save the turtles say every bit of help they can give is worth it.\n\u201cPersonally I spend a lot of my time doing this and the network spends a lot of their time doing this because we all believe that this does make a difference,\u201d said Sampson, the Noaa turtle stranding and disentanglement coordinator. \u201cThese are an endangered species, we have to do all we can to help recover their population.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/massachusetts", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/animals", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The Gulf of Maine\u2019s rapidly warming waters draws in larger numbers of Kemp\u2019s ridley turtles, enticing them to stay longer", "date_published": {"$date": 1545804018000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1545804161000}, "authors": ["Josh Wood"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Wildlife", "Climate change", "Massachusetts", "Environment", "US news", "Animals"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/26/climate-change-sea-turtles-massachusetts", "og:description": "The Gulf of Maine\u2019s rapidly warming waters draws in larger numbers of Kemp\u2019s ridley turtles, enticing them to stay longer", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f260e5163404d5b5272c75eafffc172ee840872/0_399_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=c677f1179abfd7fa514b40ffd6eb47b4", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "'It's warm water now': climate change strands sea turtles on Cape Cod shores"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f260e5163404d5b5272c75eafffc172ee840872/0_399_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b6c0355b66350de61c90dc294d3286bb", "width": "3500", "height": "2099", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f260e5163404d5b5272c75eafffc172ee840872/0_399_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d67d089ce3315858bce04c915b478c74", "description": "Staff at the Turtle hospital in the Florida Keys work to intubate a cold-stunned Kemp\u2019s ridley turtle flown in from Cape Cod, Massachusetts.\nPhotograph: Handout/Reuters"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/556ba95cffb8b3ec3736dbce634742ce77378d94/0_43_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e58c4b66bb73da75ab95909642fbeb4c", "width": "3500", "height": "2100", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/556ba95cffb8b3ec3736dbce634742ce77378d94/0_43_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1940031bb1599dfebaa77371675d1ea9", "description": "Staff members at the Turtle hospital in the Florida Keys tend to some of a group of 32 cold-stunned Kemp\u2019s ridley sea turtles rescued off Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

In Britain it\u2019s the Brexit quagmire and rolling political crises, and in Australia it\u2019s the palpable disgust at the political class as they roll prime ministers, lock children up in brutal offshore detention camps, impregnate staffers, and treat their female colleagues with disdain. \nEven if on a personal level things are going well, it is now pretty much accepted that we live in the worst of times.\nIf 2017 was about fear (this Trump guy, what could he do?), 2018 was about learning to live in that fear. The edges of 2017\u2019s anxiety were blunted. We were no longer surprised at the increasingly bizarre and dangerous tone of global politics. Instead, anxiety gave way to jadedness, with a side of depression. The year had vibes of a bad hangover.\nIf we were unsure about it at the start of the decade, we knew it now: the planet is on fire and there are no adults in the room who want to put it out. Even the drugs of this era \u2013 benzos and opiates \u2013 speak of futility and surrender. In 2018 it seems easier to see the darkness than the light.\nBut there was light. Good things happened in this year. And maybe part of the resistance, part of the thing that could rouse us from this jadedness, is naming and celebrating those good things.\nThe two areas where a sense of futility had crept in \u2013 gun control in the US, and the climate debate \u2013 where suddenly given a new jolt of life by teenagers.\nThe kids of Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school who survived a gun massacre at their school in February, reignited the gun control debate with a sense of urgency and anger that had been missing.\nThese kids are 100% gutsy. In the midst of their own personal trauma, they demanded a national rethink to America\u2019s gun addiction knowing that they would be labelled crisis actors, have to come up against the powerful National Rifle Association and have their own personal safety imperilled by conspiracy theorists and gun nuts.\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas high school student Emma Gonz\u00e1lez gave the best political speech of the year \u2013 calling BS on previous limp efforts to pass gun control legislation.\nIn 2018 if the penny hadn\u2019t dropped already, then it was obvious to young people everywhere that older generations had failed them royally on so many fronts. Instead of apathy, the kids got angry and organised.\nIn Australia in November, there was a massive school walkout over climate change inaction, in a protest organised and lead by teenagers. And young people in Britain are demanding a second referendum over a Brexit vote that will limit their future opportunities.\nThe revelations published in the Observer about data breaches at Facebook on an industrial scale (the profiles of more than 50 million individuals were harvested) led millions of users \u2013 particularly in Europe \u2013 to delete their profiles. \n2018 was Facebook\u2019s annus horribilis. After appearing at a congressional hearing in Washington to answer questions about Russian meddling in US elections, Facebook\u2019s chief, Mark Zuckerberg, admitted: \u201cOne of my greatest regrets in running the company is that we were slow in identifying the Russian information operations in 2016. We have kicked off an investigation \u2026 I imagine we\u2019ll find some things.\u201d \nBut the reputational damage and erosion of public trust in Facebook may never be healed.\nHow is that good news? With more (non-fake news) information about what goes on at Facebook and how our personal information is used, we\u2019re more empowered to make a decision about whether or not to ditch the site.\nPrince Harry\u2019s story could have been a tragic one: bereft by the early loss of his mother, the lost years of drinking, partying in Vegas and dressing up as a Nazi \u2026 But somehow things righted themselves. After a military career Prince Harry set up the Invictus Games for members of the armed forces with injury and illness, started speaking openly about mental health issues, and fell in love with a black American divorcee, a couple of years older than him.\nIt was a lovely wedding, and a sign that although the monarchy is built on tradition, it is more open to change than we once thought.\nThis was a well thought-out, well planned and clearly worded referendum that resulted in an overwhelming majority in Ireland deciding to overturn one of the most restrictive reproductive laws in the western world.\nThere was a large voter turnout, with only one county (Donegal) voting no to change.\nIreland\u2019s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said after the vote: \u201cToday is a historic day for Ireland. A quiet revolution has taken place, and today is a great act of democracy.\n\u201cA hundred years since women gained the right to vote, today we as a people have spoken. \n\u201cAnd we say that we trust women and respect women to make their own decisions and their own choices.\u201d \nThis, of course, is not good news for everyone \u2013 particularly investors. But for the increasing number of young Australians locked out of the housing market because of insane price rises, a drop in prices in the capitals of Melbourne and Sydney was welcome news.\nSupermarkets across Australia banned single use plastic bags, while parts of the US, Taiwan, Canada, Scotland and Britain banned single use plastic straws.\nSome of this is led by government, but mostly the initiative is through private companies responding to cues from consumers.\nDue to popular shows such as David Attenborough\u2019s Blue Planet we can no longer close our eyes and pretend that plastic just vaporises after we use it. It clogs our oceans and kills marine life.\nWhile parts of the planet, such as California, which was devastated by wildfires, have had their hottest summer on record, the move against single-use plastic may seem like trying to stop a tsunami with a surfboard. But the change in collective consciousness is heartening. \nThe feel-good story of the year united all if us in hope, then joy at the rescue of 12 young soccer players and their coach.\nIt also came at a time of unrelenting bleakness in the news cycle. Seeing global efforts to rescue the boys made me think \u201cmaybe we\u2019re not totally doomed as a species\u201d.\nA few honourable mentions for game-changers in pop culture are:\nThe most successful comedian of 2018 inspired thousands of think pieces and global acclaim after her show Nanette was screened on Netflix.\nIn an era where misogyny is rising to the surface like scum forming on boiled milk, we needed Gadsby \u2013 someone smart, funny and deadly serious \u2013 to explain the structural problems in art and life that lead to the #MeToo movement. Watching her in full flight felt bracing and absolutely necessary.\nThe clip for This is America with its guns and casual violence (a gospel choir gunned down mid song) was, like Nanette, the shock we needed to properly see where we are right now. The place ain\u2019t pretty, even if the music is good. \nThere is a pretty binary narrative to break-up songs: you\u2019re either saying sorry or \u201cfuck you\u201d to an ex.\nAriana instead this year said thank you to her exes and paid tribute to what they taught her. \nMore of this please in 2019.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook", "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/royal-wedding", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/housing", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/plastic", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The kids revolted, Facebook was humbled, house prices fell, a football team was rescued from a cave and ...

The billionaire former New York mayor said: \u201cIt would be a lot more helpful if we had a climate champion rather than a climate denier in the White House.\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve always thought Trump has a right to his opinions. But he doesn\u2019t have a right to his own facts.\u201d\nA vocal critic of the coal industry, Bloomberg, whose fortune is estimated at $40bn and who spent $100m on his last mayoral race, has said he plans to make climate change a leading issue in the 2020 race, whether or not he runs.\n\u201cAny candidate for federal office better darn well have a plan to deal with the problem that the Trump science advisers say could, basically, end this world,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you one thing, I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m going to run or not, but I will be out there demanding that anybody that\u2019s running has a plan.\u201d\nBloomberg paid his latest visit to Iowa, site of the first voting in the presidential election cycle, earlier this month. Joining him in a call on Sunday to make climate change a national priority was Brown, a presidential hopeful in the past now standing down after 16 years at the head of the Golden state. He said wildfires in California should serve as a wake-up call.\n\u201cWe see it in the fear in people\u2019s eyes, as they fled, many elderly who died,\u201d Brown told NBC. \u201cThis is real, it\u2019s dangerous. And we\u2019ve got to wake up the country, wake up the world.\u201d\nBrown, one of the few governors to have implemented climate policy, compared the challenge of galvanizing public opinion to that faced by Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1941.\n\u201cIt took Roosevelt many, many years to get America willing to go into world war two and fight the Nazis,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, we have an enemy, though different, but perhaps very much devastating in a similar way.\u201d\nBrown echoed Bloomberg\u2019s criticism of the president.\n\u201cHe is very convinced of his position,\u201d Brown said of Trump. \u201cAnd his position is that there\u2019s nothing abnormal about the fires in California or the rising sea level or all the other incidents of climate change.\u201d\nBrown contended that US economic wellbeing, conventionally trumpeted by the Trump administration, was the key issue on which Americans should vote.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get off this idea, \u2018It\u2019s the economy, stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, it\u2019s the environment.\u201d\nSeventy per cent of Americans believe \u201cglobal warming\u201d is happening, according to polling cited by NBC, but only 57% believe climate change is caused by humans.\nA rejection of the human role in climate change is a central plank for political leaders who refuse to back environmental regulations and other policies to confront the problem.\n\u201cThe world is getting hotter,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cThere are bigger storms than ever before; there are droughts where we used to have floods and vice-versa; our water is getting less; and we\u2019ve got to do something about it.\n\u201cThe challenge is what we do about it.

Yes, there\u2019s row after row of the little packets of greenish stuff you\u2019d expect, with enticing names such as \u201cPink Lemonade\u201d and \u201cChocolope\u201d. But lots of other cannabis-infused goodies too: vape pens, pre-rolled joints and \u201cedibles\u201d, from brownies to jelly sweets to drinks.\nBudtenders are on hand to \u201ctalk flower\u201d with discerning pot veterans, and chat with canna-curious tourists about the basics, such as the difference between the psychoactive THC, which produces a \u201cmind high\u201d, and the non-psychoactive CBD, which results in a healing \u201cbody high\u201d. (Me: \u201cBut what\u2019s the difference between a mind and a body high?\u201d Patient budtender: \u201cOne makes your mind feel high, the other your body.\u201d)\nIf the goal of cannabis prohibition was to reduce social harm, it\u2019s been an unalloyed failure\nIt was fascinating talking to Washingtonians about what they\u2019ve got right and wrong in regulating an industry from scratch. And as I tucked into my first vegan mockburger on the plane home \u2013 nicely pink inside, my tastebuds honestly couldn\u2019t distinguish it from the real thing \u2013 it left me thinking, why are we so willing to wield the nanny state when it comes to cannabis but not something like meat, which does real social harm?\nIf the goal of cannabis prohibition was to reduce social harm, it\u2019s been an unalloyed failure. As even President Obama admitted, it\u2019s safer than alcohol: it\u2019s much less addictive than smoking or drinking. And while overdosing can be a deeply unpleasant, frightening experience, as the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd found when she consumed a whole chocolate bar that would have been better cut into 16, a fatal overdose is impossible. (There has been a handful of cases in the US where people have attributed extreme violence to ingesting cannabis, but the link between cannabis-induced psychosis and violence remains unproved \u2013 and, unlike alcohol, studies suggest smoking cannabis may be associated with lower levels of domestic violence).\nWhere there are established risks \u2013 heavy cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of psychotic disorders \u2013 they should be set out so that, as with alcohol, people can make their own decision about whether they\u2019re worth taking.\nBanning cannabis doesn\u2019t stop people using \u2013 the industry in the US is thought to be worth $40bn a year, much of it black market, and in the UK, 2.2 million people are estimated to have taken cannabis. But a failure to legalise and regulate it makes it less safe than it need be \u2013 users have no idea of the psychoactive strength of what they\u2019re buying on the black market, in stark contrast to the Seattle shops, which list the THC levels of every product. Prohibition also results in millions in lost tax revenue: California, the largest state to legalise recreational cannabis, collected more than $60m in cannabis taxes in the first quarter of 2018.\nProhibition has had hugely unjust consequences. It disproportionately snares people of colour into the criminal justice system: in the UK, black people are around half as likely to report using drugs last year, but nine times more likely to be stopped and searched for drug possession and almost 12 times more likely to be convicted for cannabis possession.\nThe reason we have prohibition is nothing to do with preventing social harm\nThis should inform the way cannabis is legalised. In some places in the US, legalisation has been accompanied by expunging of historic marijuana misdemeanours, which can make it difficult to get a job or housing, from criminal records. Oakland in California has even reserved a proportion of its cannabis permits for those with a cannabis conviction in an attempt to combat the capture of the burgeoning weed industry by white, cash-rich businessmen. (Because cannabis remains federally illegal, it\u2019s almost impossible for cannabis producers to secure bank loans.)\nBut the reason we have prohibition is nothing to do with preventing social harm. It\u2019s about the queasiness politicians feel about legalising something that they perceive still has a huge social stigma attached, even though the public is now firmly in favour of legalisation.\nWhich brings me to the vegan burger. Take a step back and it seems bonkers that our political leaders hold firm on outlawing weed but seem loth to invoke the nanny state where it\u2019s most needed: in avoiding catastrophic climate change. We won\u2019t succeed in this unless we persuade people to fly less and eat less meat and dairy.\nThat\u2019s a gargantuan task, made harder by the demotivating knowledge that your own efforts are only likely to matter if others match them. Yet the most politicians do is half-heartedly conjure up a few green taxes in the hope they\u2019ll nudge people in the sort of right direction. But they\u2019re not effective enough, and also hit the poorest most.\nTime for the nanny state to get more radical. We should start by banning altogether things that have literally no function, such as bottled water in a country where it\u2019s actually safer to drink tap water. And take a leaf out of wartime Britain \u2013 climate change is no less existential a threat \u2013 and ration activities such as flying and eating meat. If you\u2019re not that bothered about a rare steak, you can sell your coupons to someone who can\u2019t live without a good ribeye and feel smug as you tuck into your environmentally friendly, fake-meat alternatives.\nIt\u2019s perhaps not surprising that prohibition is based on social prissiness rather than rationality. But, my goodness, we\u2019re missing a trick. We should follow Canada, which just became the second country to legalise recreational cannabis. And go after \u2013 if not banning, then rationing \u2013 the stuff that does society real, undeniable harm.\n\u2022 Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/society/drugs", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/drugs-trade", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/americas", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/seattle", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "If our goal is to limit social harm, we should reassess what we allow and what we ration", "date_published": {"$date": 1543685410000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1543842285000}, "authors": ["Sonia Sodha"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Cannabis", "Law", "Society", "Climate change", "Drugs", "Environment", "UK news", "Drugs trade", "Canada", "Americas", "World news", "Seattle", "US news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/01/we-ban-cannabis-but-let-people-eat-as-much-meat-as-they-want-does-that-make-sense", "og:description": "If our goal is to limit social harm, we should reassess what we allow and what we ration", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d29de50d13386f569211d6c313dfc5a9e229dc0/0_506_4277_2567/master/4277.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=d58da75adb481ec9e6e2694bc3211db3", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "We ban cannabis but let people eat as much meat as they want.

Moves to rapidly ramp up action would be another key goal, with current pledges leaving the world on track for a disastrous 3C of warming.\nThe negotiations will take place against a background of ominous news: the past four years have been the hottest on record and global emissions were rising again, when they need to fall by half by 2030. Climate action must be increased fivefold to limit warming to the 1.5C scientists advise, according to the UN.\nThe political backdrop contains challenges as well, with climate change denial from the US president, Donald Trump, and attacks on the UN process from Brazil\u2019s incoming Bolsonaro administration. The hosting of the summit by a coal-friendly Polish government further worries some observers. But the EU\u2019s new intention to become climate neutral and the plummeting cost of renewable energy have been positives, while a year of extreme weather was anticipated to focus minds.\n\u201cWe are clearly the last generation that can change the course of climate change, but we are also the first generation with its consequences,\u201d said Kristalina Georgieva, the CEO of the World Bank. The bank announced on Monday that its record $100bn (\u00a378bn) of climate funding from 2021-2025 would for the first time be split equally between projects to cut emissions and those protecting people from the floods, storms and droughts that global warming is making worse.\nIn recent years, just 5% of global funding has gone on protection, but 2018 has seen climate impacts hit hard, with heatwaves and wildfires in Europe and California and huge floods in India, Japan and east Africa. \u201cWe are already seeing the devastating impact of climate change,\u201d Georgieva told the Guardian. \u201cWe strongly believe that action ought to go both on mitigation and on adaptation.\u201d\n\u201cClimate extremes are the new normal,\u201d said Prof Patrick Verkooijen, the CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, in the Netherlands. \u201cThe climate debate can no longer only be about the causes \u2013 it also needs to focus on how billions of people at risk can rapidly adapt.\nRich nations have promised $100bn a year by 2020 to help poorer countries adapt to climate change and develop clean energy. Negotiators in Poland would have to bring the two blocs together with firm agreement on how the promise would be fulfilled.\nGebru Jember Endalew, the chair of the 47-strong Least Developed Countries Group, said: \u201cWe represent almost one billion people, the people who are least responsible for climate change but among those most vulnerable to its effects. The longer poor countries have to wait [for funding], the larger the cost will become.\u201d\nThe negotiators in Poland must also produce a rulebook governing how action pledged under the Paris agreement was tracked and reported to ensure all nations play their part.\n\u201cFair and effective rules for accounting must be established, with special responsibilities for the big emitters such as the US and Europe but also China and India,\u201d said Prof Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. \u201cWhile defining a rulebook sounds boring, it is in fact essential.\u201d\nThe role of the Polish hosts will be crucial and the deputy energy minister Micha\u0142 Kurtyka has said it would focus on using forests to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, electric vehicles and ensuring workers in fossil fuel industries were helped into new jobs.\nPoland generates 80% of its electricity from coal and the UN summit will take place in a coal mining town, Katowice. The Polish government has also allowed two coal companies to sponsor the summit.\n\u201cHaving major coal companies as climate summit sponsors sends the worst possible signal at the worst possible time,\u201d said Robert Cyglicki, Greenpeace\u2019s director in Central and Eastern Europe. \u201cIt would be like Philip Morris sponsoring a health summit where a cigarette ban is supposed to be agreed. We will know this was a successful summit if coal companies regret sponsoring it.\u201d\nMany nations remain firmly committed to climate action, particularly France and China. But the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, warned last week that the rise of populism was undermining the political will of some countries to work with others. \u201cWe have more and more nationalist approaches being popular and winning elections,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has led in my opinion to a lack of political will.\u201d\n\u201cEvery day, we witness the effects of the changing climate on poor and vulnerable people around the world,\u201d said Adriana Opromolla, at NGO Caritas Internationalis. \u201cTransformation is possible, but political will is needed to make it happen.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Big cuts in carbon emissions and a

and ExxonMobil face a shareholder challenge to set carbon targets in line with the Paris climate agreement, as a green group seeks to repeat its success in pressuring Shell to set environmental benchmarks.\nWhen Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, laid out an ambitious long-term carbon target last year, he acknowledged the role played by a resolution on carbon targets submitted by Dutch activist shareholders Follow This.\nFollow This is hoping to use investor power to push other major oil and gas firms into setting similar goals. \nThe organisation has bought shares in several major fossil fuel groups and has submitted two resolutions to the European firms BP and Shell. It will file identical resolutions with the US companies Chevron and ExxonMobil later this week if other parties do not submit a similar demand.\nInvestors at the firms\u2019 annual general meetings next year will be asked to vote in favour of them publishing climate change targets in alignment with the international goal of keeping the rise in global temperatures well below 2C.\nMark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, said: \u201cTargets should be on the agenda of every oil company, given that the oil industry can make or break the Paris climate agreement.\u201d\nThe group has little chance of winning by persuading a majority of the four companies\u2019 shareholders to back the resolution but it believes the tactic can put public and investor pressure on firms.\nAlthough backed by the Church of England and major pension funds, the resolution filed for Shell\u2019s AGM on carbon targets failed in 2017, with 94% of shareholders voting against and 5% abstaining.\nWhen Van Beurden set the firm\u2019s carbon goals last year, however, he said the firm had seen a kernel of truth in the proposal.\nVan Baal said: \u201cWe expect that the investors who supported the Shell resolution will also support the resolution with the other companies and that more investors will start to participate.\u201d\nThe resolutions will ask firms to set goals that account for their biggest contribution to global warming \u2013 the emissions produced when consumers burn the oil, which are known as scope 3 emissions. That is considered an important step beyond oil companies just cutting emissions from their own operations.\nFor BP that would mark a significant step up from the carbon curbs its chief executive, Bob Dudley, announced earlier this year, which explicitly ruled out counting emissions from the burning of its products.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/business/oil", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/oilandgascompanies", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/energy-industry", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/exxonmobil", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Company is among energy firms being urged to set goals in line with Paris agreement", "date_published": {"$date": 1544400088000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544431893000}, "authors": ["Adam Vaughan"], "article_section": "Business", "article_tags": ["BP", "Oil", "Oil and gas companies", "Energy industry", "Business", "Climate change", "Paris climate agreement", "US news", "ExxonMobil", "Chevron", "UK news", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/10/bp-faces-shareholder-challenge-over-carbon-targets", "og:description": "Company is among energy firms being urged to set goals in line with Paris agreement", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2975015020188ced14660f838f5a22b77264d2e0/0_54_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=f314ee69625a2f59bad5123b9060f2aa", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "BP faces shareholder challenge over carbon targets"}, "headline": "r", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2975015020188ced14660f838f5a22b77264d2e0/0_54_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fa1a698d2cf013496ead4dc17e28b149", "width": "4256", "height": "2554", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2975015020188ced14660f838f5a22b77264d2e0/0_54_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3cf586d3b16266b8fdedf57caf83b294", "description": "Activists have demanded that BP, along with Chevron and ExxonMobil, set similar targets to Shell.\nPhotograph: Nick Ansell/PA"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc078eea2c3613145ed8c5b"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/10/global-commitment-to-climate-change-dies-on-the-floor-of-a-committee-and-australia-is-silent", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/oil", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Brenda the Civil Disobedience Penguin goes to COP24", "date_published": {"$date": 1544423993000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544479146000}, "authors": ["First Dog on the Moon"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Global climate talks", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Oil", "Fossil fuels"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/10/global-commitment-to-climate-change-dies-on-the-floor-of-a-committee-and-australia-is-silent", "og:description": "Brenda the Civil Disobedience Penguin goes to COP24", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bffc99b00da9edbe25d31fb132939ed728887ad/0_0_1688_1013/master/1688.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=ab2c54b3c6854c51645b78165cb2c94f", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Global commitment to climate change dies on the floor of a committee and Australia is silent | First Dog on the Moon"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556124964801}, "comments": [{"id": "123677752", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1544662809000}, "author": "PDGFD1", "author_id": "13011646", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "This comment was removed by a moderator because it didn't abide by our\ncommunity standards.\nReplies may also be deleted.

With a 50% reduction in our CO2 emissions we will not be energy poor.\n40% of net global CO2 emissions come from countries like Australia which who contribute less than 4% of total emissions. As such small and medium sized countries such as us make a significant contribution to the CO2 emissions which are causing global warming. While the planet as a lump of rock will survive the effects of global warming, many Australian farms will be saved if in the long run we can stall, stop and eventually reverse global greenhouse warming caused by our combustion of fossil fuels.\n\"And how much is it costing the poor taxpayers to reduce the Planet's temperature by virtually 0?\"\nAs the increase in the planet's temperature is being caused by net CO2 emissions reducing these emissions will reduce the planet's temperature to a level below what it would have been.\nElectricity from new coal fired power stations costs $119 per MWhr to produce. That from large scale photovoltaic arrays $105, from flexible gas turbines $92 and from windfarms $74.

The study of sediments and fossilized creatures show the event was the single greatest calamity ever to befall life on Earth, eclipsing even the extinction of the dinosaurs 65m years ago.\nUp to 96% of all marine species perished while more than two-thirds of terrestrial species disappeared. The cataclysm was so severe it wiped out most of the planet\u2019s trees, insects, plants, lizards and even microbes.\nScientists have theorized causes for the extinction, such as a giant asteroid impact. But US researchers now say they have pinpointed the demise of marine life to a spike in Earth\u2019s temperatures, warning that present-day global warming will also have severe ramifications for life on the planet.\n\u201cIt was a huge event. In the last half a billion years of life on the planet, it was the worst extinction,\u201d said Curtis Deutsch, an oceanography expert who co-authored the research, published on Thursday, with his University of Washington colleague Justin Penn along with Stanford University scientists Jonathan Payne and Erik Sperling.\nThe researchers used paleoceanographic records and built a model to analyse changes in animal metabolism, ocean and climate conditions. When they used the model to mimic conditions at the end of the Permian period, they found it matched the extinction records.\nAccording to the study, this suggests that marine animals essentially suffocated as warming waters lacked the oxygen required for survival. \u201cFor the first time, we\u2019ve got a whole lot of confidence that this is what happened,\u201d said Deutsch. \u201cIt\u2019s a very strong argument that rising temperatures and oxygen depletion were to blame.\u201d\nThe great dying event, which occurred over an uncertain timeframe of possibly hundreds of years, saw Earth\u2019s temperatures increase by around 10C (18F). Oceans lost around 80% of their oxygen, with parts of the seafloor becoming completely oxygen-free. Scientists believe this warming was caused by a huge spike in greenhouse gas emissions, potentially caused by volcanic activity.\nThe new research, published in Science, found that the drop in oxygen levels was particularly deadly for marine animals living closer to the poles. Experiments that varied oxygen and temperature levels for modern marine species, including shellfish, corals and sharks, helped \u201cbridge the gap\u201d to what the model found, Payne said.\n\u201cThis really would be a terrible, terrible time to be around on the planet,\u201d he added. \u201cIt shows us that when the climate and ocean chemistry changes quickly, you can reach a point where species don\u2019t survive. It took millions of years to recover from the Permian event, which is essentially permanent from the perspective of human timescales.\u201d\nOver the past century, the modern world has warmed by around 1C due to the release of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, rather than from volcanic eruptions.\nThis warming is already causing punishing heatwaves, flooding and wildfires around the world, with scientists warning that the temperature rise could reach 3C or more by the end of the century unless there are immediate, radical reductions in emissions.\nAt the same time, Earth\u2019s species are undergoing what some experts have termed the \u201csixth great extinction\u201d due to habitat loss, poaching, pollution and climate change.\n\u201cIt does terrify me to think we are on a trajectory similar to the Permian because we really don\u2019t want to be on that trajectory,\u201d Payne said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like we will warm by around 10C and we haven\u2019t lost that amount of biodiversity yet. But even getting halfway there would be something to be very concerned about. The magnitude of change we are currently experiencing is fairly large.\u201d\nDeutsch said: \u201cWe are about a 10th of the way to the Permian. Once you get to 3-4C of warming, that\u2019s a significant fraction and life in the ocean is in big trouble, to put it bluntly. There are big implications for humans\u2019 domination of the Earth and its ecosystems.\u201d\nDeutsch added that the only way to avoid a mass aquatic die-off in the oceans was to reduce carbon emissions, given there is no viable way to ameliorate the impact of climate change in the oceans using other measures.\nThe research group \u201cprovide convincing evidence that warmer temperatures and associated lower oxygen levels in the ocean are sufficient to explain the observed extinctions we see in the fossil record\u201d, said Pamela Grothe, a paleoclimate scientist at the University of Mary Washington.\n\u201cThe past holds the key to the future,\u201d she added. \u201cOur current rates of carbon dioxide emissions is instantaneous geologically speaking and we are already seeing warming ocean temperatures and lower oxygen in many regions, currently affecting marine ecosystems.\n\u201cIf we continue in the trajectory we are on with current emission rates, this study highlights the potential that we may see similar rates of extinction in marine species as in the end of the Permian.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/science/extinct-wildlife", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/animals", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Up to 96% of all marine species and more than two-thirds of terrestrial species perished 252m years ago", "date_published": {"$date": 1544122803000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544176177000}, "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Extinct wildlife", "Wildlife", "Environment", "US news", "Animals", "Science", "Climate change"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/06/global-warming-extinction-report-the-great-dying", "og:description": "Up to 96% of all marine species and more than two-thirds of terrestrial species perished 252m years ago", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1492fa740fcda3086387b1f771530a1c95f87eee/0_41_1152_691/master/1152.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=14e5f4e0e1981a14783e7b6b16b07a95", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "The 'great dying': rapid warming caused largest extinction event ever, report says"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1492fa740fcda3086387b1f771530a1c95f87eee/0_41_1152_691/master/1152.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3d2748fe28fbb3cba3e7a2424dac9c4d", "width": "1152", "height": "691", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1492fa740fcda3086387b1f771530a1c95f87eee/0_41_1152_691/master/1152.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0abfa5ab357b08e505f43203e0c68433", "description": "A model in the study mimicking conditions in the Permian period suggests marine animals essentially suffocated in the warming waters.\nPhotograph: AP"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07909a2c3613145ed8c65"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/macron-u-turn-on-eco-tax-rise-gives-green-lobby-fuel-for-thought", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Emmanuel Macron\u2019s defeat by the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement over a proposed eco-tax rise is likely to come as a painful lesson for environmental policymakers at this week\u2019s UN climate talks in Katowice.\nAfter the most violent protests in Paris for half a century, the French president has been forced to postpone a planned eco-tax rise on fuel, showing how ecological measures can have explosive consequences if there is any suggestion they are being used to \u201cgreenwash\u201d austerity.\nOther leaders will need better timing and a far defter political touch before they introduce similar measures to reduce carbon emissions.\nDozens of countries and cities have introduced or drawn up plans for carbon taxes to speed the transition from fossil fuels that are warming the planet to increasingly dangerous levels. They are rarely easy to implement. There have also been protests and political backwards steps in Belgium, Tunisia, Algeria and Canada.\nMacron has positioned himself as one of the pioneers. He has championed the Paris climate agreement and promised to make France an example of how economies can grow as they cut carbon emissions. In contrast to the me-first-ism of Donald Trump, the French leader\u2019s slogan has been \u201cMake our planet great again\u201d.\nAccording to government officials, this goal was behind the plan to increase petrol prices by four euro cents a litre from January. This, they said, was one of several steps towards France\u2019s commitment to cut carbon emissions by 40% by 2030 and to ban sales of petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040.\nThe economic and environmental logic is sound. Raising the price of carbon is an essential tool if global warming is to be kept below the dangerous level of 1.5C, according to the recent report by the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change. This year\u2019s Nobel laureate for economics, William Nordhaus, was one of the first advocates of a global carbon tax as the best way to put a true cost on the use of coal, oil and gas. \nIt is a matter of justice. Without a carbon tax, the health and pollution costs of cars and trucks are unfairly passed on to society in the form of respiratory problems, congested, dirty streets and an increasingly unstable climate. Fuel taxes are also an incentive for change. As the former Nasa scientist James Hansen has noted: \u201cAs long as fossil fuels seem the cheapest energy to the public, they\u2019ll keep using them.\u201d\nBut while policy wonks across the world agree on the principle of \u201cpolluter pays\u201d, Macron has clearly found it hard to convince the French public on two key questions: what they are supposed to be paying for and whether the burden is being fairly shared.\nThe majority of the hundreds of thousands of gilets jaunes protesters are from low- or middle-income families who are hardest hit by the fuel price rises because they spend a disproportionate share of their incomes on fuel and transport.\nThey may have found the eco-tax rise easier to stomach if the revenues were then redistributed among the public, a model already used in British Colombia that Justin Trudeau plans to expand throughout Canada.\nThere would also be less hostility if the revenues were ringfenced for renewable energy, environmental homes or a better healthcare system to deal with the costs of air pollution and rising temperatures. Instead, protesters have been able to argue the tax will be used mainly to cut France\u2019s budget deficit by paying off wealthy creditors, in effect worsening inequality.\nMacron has also demonstrated poor timing by announcing a rise in diesel and petrol taxes after a year in which oil prices rose by 23% largely because of Opec limits on production.\n\u201cMaybe he should have taken that into account and waited until the price goes down. Or perhaps he should have returned some revenue,\u201d said Bob Ward of the Grantham Institute. Instead of a tax, he said governments could also consider alternatives such as raising standards on vehicles, which has been the approach taken by California. \u201cYou have to find the right mechanism.\u201d\nIt also helps to secure public approval. The city of Boulder in Colorado introduced a carbon tax after a majority of voters cast ballots in favour of the move. Seven US states are also considering similar steps following midterm elections in which many Democrats campaigned on promises of climate action.\nIn the UK, a carbon tax in the power sector has helped to phase out coal, but the prime minister, Theresa May, appears too politically weak to consider action on fuel. In the most recent budget, the chancellor once again left fuel taxes unchanged, where they have remained since 1999. Earlier governments promised \u201can escalator\u201d of steadily rising duties to tackle environmental concerns about road traffic. But this commitment has not been met since massive fuel protests in 2000.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/emmanuel-macron", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/france", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/protest", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/analysis"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Defeat by gilets jaunes will make others think twice before taking similar steps to cut emissions", "date_published": {"$date": 1543943413000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1543963409000}, "authors": ["Jonathan Watts"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Emmanuel Macron", "France", "Europe", "World news", "Climate change", "Environment", "Protest"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/macron-u-turn-on-eco-tax-rise-gives-green-lobby-fuel-for-thought", "og:description": "Defeat by gilets jaunes will make others think twice before taking similar steps to cut emissions", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d20656d0b5e114b640b126da9f64970af0770d7/0_58_1735_1041/master/1735.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=6f7cd4b08c531d9fe9e39e451064525d", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "U-turn on eco-tax rise gives President Macron  fuel for thought"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d20656d0b5e114b640b126da9f64970af0770d7/0_58_1735_1041/master/1735.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5ce322424322aa6f46ab4fa396342161", "width": "1735", "height": "1041", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d20656d0b5e114b640b126da9f64970af0770d7/0_58_1735_1041/master/1735.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f18a85648eab5475374132ac65721308", "description": "Emmanuel Macron inspects the damage after violent clashes in Paris last weekend.\nPhotograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc0790da2c3613145ed8c68"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/05/school-students-protest-climate-change-canberra-morrison", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "High school students from across Australia calling for emergency action on climate change have travelled to Canberra to confront the prime minister after he criticised them for skipping school to stage national strikes.\nStudents from Scott Morrison\u2019s southern Sydney electorate of Cook \u2013 as well as Townsville, Melbourne and Brisbane \u2013 arrived at Parliament House on Wednesday morning to meet with him.\nMorrison said he would sit down with the school students.\n\u201cI\u2019m always happy to listen.

That projection makes me very concerned and European nations and UN member states should be thinking about investing in rural transformation.\u201d\nThe former prime minister of Togo added: \u201cFor three years in a row, the state of food security and nutrition report shows that the level of food insecurity and malnutrition has been going up after decades of decreasing.\n\u201cIf those investments are not there at a time when climate change is also a pressure and when the population is growing then it is very clear that parts of the world will be left facing risk of famine.\u201d\nHoungbo \u2013 in the UK to give a keynote speech at Chatham House \u2013 said a holistic approach is vital to prevent Africa\u2019s young people being forced to migrate to urban areas or other countries because they are economically disadvantaged.\n\u201cInvestment in sustainable farming is essential for the livelihoods of those in rural communities and for food security but it is not enough to engage the younger generations,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat is why we need to look at the bigger picture \u2013 the priorities are decent schools, potable water and basic healthcare. I also consider access to WhatsApp to be a basic service. Young people need access to modern technology.\u201d\nHe said developing renewable energy would also be a consideration as some local grids are not up to the job. \u201cIf you cannot charge your cellphone or laptop, it\u2019s difficult to do business.\u201d\nSmallholder farms produce 50% of all food calories on 30% of the world\u2019s agricultural land. In sub-Saharan Africa, 80% of all farms are small-scale. Their productivity varies but they are generally characterised by growing subsistence crops and one or two cash crops on a small plot and relying almost exclusively on family labour, with women playing a vital role.\nWith the right approach, smallholder farms can be turned into profitable businesses that supply local and national markets, generate surpluses and offer communities a pathway out of poverty and hunger, according to Ifad, the UN\u2019s financial institution dedicated to rural areas.\nAction is needed by national governments, the development community and private sector partners to create the right conditions to make this possible, said Houngbo. His organisation is due to announce plans for an investment fund for young people in rural areas, available globally, but targeting young people in Africa.\nHe said the sums would be in the region of $10,000 (\u00a37,835) to $20,000, up to $1m \u2013 greater than the sums offered by microfinance institutions, but amounts that young people would find difficult to borrow from a bank.\nIfad also wants to encourage rural startups and smallholder farms to develop resistance to climate change. The number of hungry people globally has risen for the third year in a row because of climate variability.\nIt is currently field-testing a pilot called Cachet, which operates a hedging mechanism to protects smallholders against price volatility. It is already assisting small-scale producers of cocoa in Nigeria and maize in Senegal and aims to scale up to reach more beneficiaries in low- and middle-income countries.\nThe scheme protects farmers against selling at a loss. Next year it will expand to use finance schemes to transfer climate-related risks.\nInvestment in training and empowering women in rural areas is also vital to the transformation of rural economies. Research has shown that if women were to have the same access to agricultural resources as men, about 150 million fewer people would go hungry.\nHalf of Ifad\u2019s beneficiaries are women who struggle to access finance and land, and face challenges around inheritance and entitlement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about training the women, it\u2019s about their ability to have a voice in rural life \u2026 it is essential they\u2019re part of decision making,\u201d said Houngbo.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about changing policies and family law so women can attain equal rights. Also, it is one thing to change laws but enforcing them in rural areas can be very tricky if society has not bought into it.\u201d\nIrene Nantale, 30, a local entrepreneur from Mashiaga village in Uganda\u2019s eastern Mayuge District, was part of Ifad\u2019s Project for Financial Inclusion in Rural Areas initiative and is testament to what women can achieve with small loans.\nHoungbo said her family had been struggling before she joined a savings and credit cooperative in 2013 and used her first loan to buy 50 chickens and a cow.\nWhen Houngbo visited Nantale in May she had 350 chickens, four cows, 12 goats and two employees on her farm. She had also invested some capital in opening a pharmacy in the village, filling a vital gap in local services. She plans to use her savings to send her three children to university.\n\u201cWe are looking beyond being food secure \u2013 we also want to generate income and profits,\u201d explained Houngbo.\nThe 57-year-old is no stranger to life in a poor farming community. Growing up in rural Togo, he became accustomed to missing meals and combining education with hard labour. Aged 11 he left his village because his father wanted to give him a better education in the capital.\n\u201cI lived 240km away but every weekend and in the holidays I would go back to work on the farm. Vacation to us meant farming, it wasn\u2019t a holiday,\u201d said Houngbo.\n\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to live on one meal a day. But it is shocking to think that 50 years on that still exists in parts of the world. To me that is unacceptable and every day I have to ask myself if I\u2019m doing as much as I can to help avoid that.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/migration", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/farming", "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/environmental-sustainability", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "With continent\u2019s population set to soar, agriculture chief Gilbert Houngbo stresses need to make rural life profitable", "date_published": {"$date": 1543993218000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1543993359000}, "authors": ["Hannah Summers"], "article_section": "Global development", "article_tags": ["Food security", "Migration and development", "Global development", "Farming", "Environmental sustainability", "Environment", "Climate change", "Africa", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/dec/05/invest-africa-youth-now-before-migration-to-europe-doubles-un-gilbert-houngbo", "og:description": "With continent\u2019s population set to soar, agriculture chief Gilbert Houngbo stresses need to make rural life profitable", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b854ad0b18d2e3eea895a407d3984e22f6a0acb/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=ec9f5d8262e88e7eccf8df1bfb686e2a", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Invest in Africa's youth before migration to Europe doubles, says UN official"}, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b854ad0b18d2e3eea895a407d3984e22f6a0acb/0_524_4076_2445/master/4076.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=283589cf6ae749255532e1c007096daf", "width": "4076", "height": "2445", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b854ad0b18d2e3eea895a407d3984e22f6a0acb/0_524_4076_2445/master/4076.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2ec262f1b120d5993ede09e9a20c5922", "description": "Ifad\u2019s president Gilbert Houngbo, second from left, speaks to farmers during a field visit to Mayuge District in eastern Uganda.\nPhotograph: Edward Echwalu/Ifad"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eee2193808b57b93e59e18b33584622c1f6caae8/0_0_4500_3000/master/4500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6a87ed0fcae2de7319a2cad34b48de90", "width": "4500", "height": "3000", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eee2193808b57b93e59e18b33584622c1f6caae8/0_0_4500_3000/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=00864638fbd30e1bee0f58c90db48b6c", "description": "Gilbert Houngbo: \u2018We are looking beyond being food secure.

In a report requested by UN climate summit leaders, the WHO says the economic benefits of improved health are more than double the costs of cutting emissions, and even higher in India and China, which are plagued by toxic air.\n\u201cThe global public health community is getting very impatient,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Neira, WHO director of public and environmental health. \u201cIf you don\u2019t think you need to take action for the sake of climate change, make sure when you think about the planet you incorporate a couple of lungs, a brain and a heart. It is not just about saving the planet in the future, it is about protecting the health of the people right now.\u201d\nThe damage caused by coal, oil and gas pollution is \u201coutrageous\u201d, she said. \u201cThere are words not included in the documents at [the climate summit]: asthma, lung cancer, stroke, heart disease \u2013 they need to be incorporated in all the decision-making processes.\u201d\n\u201cMorally, delaying the [clean energy] transition is being responsible for millions of deaths every year,\u201d Neira said. \u201c[Leaders] need to ask themselves how many deaths are [they] willing to accept. When health is taken into account, climate action is an opportunity, not a cost.\u201d\nAir pollution is the best known impact of fossil fuel use, and climate change damages health through heatwaves, storms, floods and droughts, increased spread of infectious disease and the destruction of health facilities. Global warming is also damaging crops and reducing their nutritional value, with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization now reporting a rise in the number of hungry people going up after decades of decline.\n\u201cWe now have scientific evidence that people are suffering and dying from climate change,\u201d said Prof Kristie Ebi, at the University of Washington and lead author on the recent intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) report, that warned that the global temperature rise must be kept to 1.5C to protect hundreds of millions of people from harm. Another major recent report concluded that climate change is already a health emergency.\nDiarmid Campbell-Lendrum, at the World Health Organization and also an IPCC report author, said doctors needed to press hard for climate action: \u201cThe health profession is the single most trusted profession in the world.\u201d Just 0.5% of multilateral climate finance is currently going to healthcare, he said. Organizations representing more than five million doctors, nurses and public health professionals from 120 countries have issued a call to action to the climate summit in Poland.\n\u201cWe should no longer be talking about the cost of [cutting emissions], we should talk about the benefits to people\u2019s health of investing in what needs to be done,\u201d Campbell-Lendrum said.\n\u201cAt the moment we pretend that polluting [fossil] fuels are cheap fuels, only because we don\u2019t include the cost of them to our health and economy.\u201d The IMF estimates these subsidies to the fossil fuel industry to be $5tn a year, more than all governments currently spend on healthcare.\nAlmost 200 nations are meeting in Katowice, Poland, for two weeks, aiming to turn the carbon-cutting vision set in Paris in 2015 into a reality, as well as increasing the ambition and speed of action and the funding needed.

Its analysis showed the average UK temperature during June, July and August was more than 2C above pre-industrial levels.\nHundreds more early deaths than usual occurred at the height of the heatwave, while farmers struggled for water and hay and thousands of houses suffered subsidence.\nThe research was launched at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, and the Met Office\u2019s Prof Peter Stott, who led the work, said: \u201cWorld leaders should be listening not just to scientists but also to the people who are being affected by extreme weather events right now. They are seeing it with their own eyes and suffering from it. Humanity just won\u2019t be able to cope with the world we are heading for.\u201d\nStott said scientists were making links across the world between extreme weather events and climate change, from heatwaves in Japan to wildfires in California: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing it happen again and again across the world. This whole sequence of events would not have happened without climate change.\u201d\nProf Mark Maslin, at University College London, said: \u201cThe analysis clearly shows climate change has already changed our weather patterns and is having adverse effects on people\u2019s lives. It is beholden on all governments to take heed of these warnings and start cutting carbon emissions as quick as possible.\u201d\nJohn Sauven, an executive director at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cThe link between climate change and extreme weather used to be a fingerprint, it now looks more like a smoking gun. The science is leaving world leaders nowhere to hide. They are the first generation of political leaders with a clear view of the precipice we\u2019re heading towards and may be the last to be able to swerve away from it.\u201d\nThe heatwave showed the vulnerability of farming and food security to global warming, said Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers Union. \u201cOur industry is on the forefront of climate change impacts. The summer heatwave was hugely challenging and should be a wake-up call for us all.\u201d She said long-term drought policies were needed, such as making it easier to get planning permission for new reservoirs.\nThe Met Office analysis used sophisticated computer models to estimate the probability of such a hot summer in the UK in a world with manmade global warming and in a world without it. If humanity\u2019s fossil fuel burning had not more than doubled the CO2 in the atmosphere, there would have been a less than one in 200 chance of the 2018 heat. But in today\u2019s warming world, the probability was one in eight.\nThe 30-fold increased risk surprised Stott: \u201cIt is a large number, but we checked it very carefully.\u201d The methodology used has been peer-reviewed and the new analysis would be, too, but the Met Office said it was important to make the information public as early as possible.\nStott\u2019s team also looked at the Central England temperature record which stretches back to 1659. They found just one summer, 1826, as hot as 2018 in the two centuries up until 1850, when CO2 emissions began to rise fast. In contrast, there have been two other summers just as hot as 2018 in the last two decades, in 2003 and 2006.\nAn earlier analysis of the summer heat in Europe also found that climate change had increased its risk, though it looked at the hottest three-day periods, not the whole season. Scores of extreme weather events around the world, including droughts and severe rainfalls, have been linked to global warming, including the Storm Desmond downpour that caused extensive severe flooding in the UK.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Global warming is harming people\u2019s lives and humanity will not be able to cope, say scientists", "date_published": {"$date": 1544076925000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544083950000}, "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "article_section": "World news", "article_tags": ["Extreme weather", "Climate change", "Environment", "World news", "Science", "UK news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/06/climate-change-made-uk-heatwave-30-times-more-likely-met-office", "og:description": "Global warming is harming people\u2019s lives and humanity will not be able to cope, say scientists", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/693f097fd6b2b861fe0a0912420ae4ab8f822de9/0_180_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=22ac97bc8979f6adca38a703eaa24e5f", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Climate change made UK heatwave 30 times more likely \u2013 Met Office"}, "headline": "O", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/693f097fd6b2b861fe0a0912420ae4ab8f822de9/0_180_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=44e0517d89eab87aed215407705c57f6", "width": "3000", "height": "1800", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/693f097fd6b2b861fe0a0912420ae4ab8f822de9/0_180_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c495126ff089d79974af75e86c3c09e0", "description": "Low water level at Swinsty reservoir near Harrogate, Yorkshire, during the UK\u2019s summer heatwave.\nPhotograph: Andrew Mccaren/LNP/REX/Shutterstock"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc0792da2c3613145ed8c78"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/07/weatherwatch-calmac-western-isles-stormy-future", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Anyone who has been to the islands off Scotland\u2019s west coast will be familiar with Caledonian MacBrayne ferries.

Or rather two problems. The first is a matter of definition: who or what is a human being, entitled to the rights spelled out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights? The second is the old mind-body split: what if these two components have different wills?\nI illustrate by means of the Ohio Republicans, who have recently moved to declare motherhood mandatory, and also to define any fertilised egg \u2013 whether in a woman\u2019s body or in a Petri dish \u2013 a person under the law. Causing a non-living condition in such an entity would be murder, incurring the death penalty. Even if by miscarriage, it could be manslaughter: a woman might spend years in prison for falling off a horse, like Scarlett O\u2019Hara in Gone with the Wind. (These same Republicans have plans to declare an acorn an oak tree: anyone destroying an acorn would incur the full wrath of the environmental tree-protection forces.)\nBut the Libertarians too must be satisfied: the rights of the individual must be respected! This could be solved by reverting to the 19th century and declaring women to be adults in respect to responsibilities, but children in respect to rights. Though that might not wash today, considering all the new rights children have been granted.\nHowever, a more sophisticated plan is being mulled over, helped by another Republican who declared that pregnant women cannot have been raped, since a woman\u2019s body \u201cshut(s) that whole thing down\u201d. According to this theory, the body is a sort of automaton.\nThus one proposal might be to declare women persons from the neck up, but things from the neck down. The things could then be requisitioned by the state, like parcels of land. In fairness, compensation would have to be paid to the head, at full market value. The head would be, legally, a she; the body would be an it.\nThis will annoy some of the female heads, and squawking will ensue; but anti-squawking legislation should take care of that! (Not applicable to chickens.)\nHowever, with advances in transplant surgery a solution satisfactory to all could be legislated: a mandatory Head Exchange! Those heads that don\u2019t want their bodies to have children would be made to switch with those heads who\u2019d like to have children, but whose bodies refuse to comply. Joy all round! (These lawmakers would surely pass a sub-clause changing the words of \u201cI\u2019m So Pretty\u201d, from West Side Story, to \u201cI\u2019m So Itty\u201d. This would reinforce the message to women that their bodies are things, and have no human rights.)\nA Republican declared that pregnant women cannot have been raped, since a woman\u2019s body 'shut(s) that whole thing down'\nPeople, I don\u2019t recommend any of this. It would go pear-shaped very fast (no innuendo intended). Instead of happiness there would be strife. Imagine the arguments that would take place over the allocations of heads and bodies! Bribery and political influence would play their part \u2013 and picture the lawsuits concerning bodies that malfunction. Some heads \u2013 I hesitate to say \u2013 might declare a wish to get pregnant simply in order to obtain a body more to their liking. What uproar!\nTo forestall this sad state of affairs, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should add a clause concerning the Right to Refuse Ittiness. In view of the new findings that the intestinal tract constitutes a second brain, this clause would reject the mind-body split and declare the neck a protected area, much like the Korean demilitarised zone. Problem solved!\nNot that such a clause will do much good in Ohio, where they don\u2019t seem so keen on the universal declaration in any case.\n \nIt makes sense that the original Declaration of Human Rights ignores the Earth \u2013 the Earth was the backdrop to the human story. Against that backdrop, for thousands of years, the great dramas had been carried out: tyrannies risen and fallen, wars won and lost, ordinary people oppressed and rebelling. The idea of the \u201cenvironment\u201d would barely have made sense at the time \u2013 obviously the physical systems of the planet were necessary to grow crops, obviously the Earth\u2019s resources could be hoarded or shared. But it was the scenery, not the play. As we got better at storing food and fighting germs, and as world wars terrified us with their uncontrollable violence, the physical world seemed to be receding ever further. We needed instead to focus on what humans could do to each other, for better and for worse.\nAnd now that has shifted, decisively. Though all the concerns of the universal declaration \u2013 intolerance, poverty, ill health, the lack of education, suffrage, work \u2013 remain as acute as ever, they have been joined by an overriding if often unspoken dread. We have begun (slowly, perhaps too late) to understand what we can do to the Earth, and what in turn that damaged Earth can do to us.\nIt was a recognition that began to dawn in the years just after 1948 \u2013 by the early 1960s Rachel Carson had begun the vital task (in Silent Spring) of knocking the shine off \u201cprogress\u201d. It\u2019s given rise to one of the greatest movements the world has ever seen, this thing awkwardly called \u201cenvironmentalism\u201d that has united people across continents and faiths and races. But it still exerts a tenuous claim on power: no one \u201cdenies\u201d war or hunger or unemployment, but many of the world\u2019s paramount leaders continue to pretend we cannot damage the planet.\nThat pretence, of course, is rooted in the wealth and power of precisely those humans who do the most damage. The oil industry, for instance, long the richest single force on this globe, and one that has spent a generation insisting that climate change isn\u2019t real, even as the Arctic melted and the sea began to rise. Or agribusiness, or the chemical industry, or many others \u2013 all of whom insist that they are merely meeting the human needs enshrined in the declaration, for housing and energy and dinner.\nSecuring the physical Earth is the first order of business now, not an add-on\nAnd so it is necessary to postulate a new right: that humans must be protected against those forces that would damage the Earth\u2019s systems. Indeed, none of the other rights can be guaranteed on an unstable planet: a heating planet endangers everything from food supplies to political freedom. In some sense, securing the physical Earth is the first order of business now, not an add-on.\nBut it is a complicated right, one that comes with a corresponding responsibility not to do that damage ourselves. Or not any more than we absolutely must. And it is complicated further by the fact that we must think not only about the humans of the moment, but the humans of the future as well: the Peloponnesian war is not still claiming human lives because it ended 2,500 years ago, but our current destruction of the climate will be impoverishing people for 10 times that long.\nIt is complicated further still by the fact that it\u2019s not just humans who are laid waste, but the rest of creation. We have apparently wiped out more than 60% of the animals that shared the world with us when the declaration was written \u2013 it is possible that the moment has come to expand our vision of who deserves protection.\nThis \u201cright\u201d is not an aspiration but a requirement. If we mistreat each other for another 70 years that will be hideous, but humans of 2088 will still be able to change. If we mistreat the Earth for another seven decades, implacable physics and chemistry and biology will write the next chapter in our history.\nThe right to live free from blame for the fact that someone or something has made a man feel small or unimportant, for example if they are not King of the Entire World, if they have not won the medal, or made the money, if they have not beaten the opposition in the last 24 hours, even if the opposition is in their own head. The right to live radiantly free of a man\u2019s feelings about all this, even if you are the person who makes their dinner, or the person who does not make their dinner but probably should because they really need something from you, they are feeling so undervalued, and maybe sex will do.\nThe right to freedom from blame if you are a woman who sleeps with a man or does not sleep with a man, who flatters or fails to flatter a man who is feeling the grip of shame or mortality because he is not the poshest, or the strongest, or the most eloquent, or in some way the most important person in the world, or at least in the room.\nThe right not to get hit for all the above.\nThe right not to get raped ditto.\nThe right not to make anyone\u2019s dinner but your own.\nThe right not to be compared with a man\u2019s mother, if she was lovely, or confused with a man\u2019s mother if she was not \u2013 this especially if she made him feel small or unimportant or mortal at the age when every child deserves to feel like the King of the Entire World. We are sorry you missed all this, or that this phase ended abruptly or badly for you, it is not our fault. We were not there. Yes we have breasts and no, despite the fact that these are actual breasts and therefore very confusing for you, we were not there.\nThe right to bodily autonomy, of course.\nThe right to live free from a man\u2019s need to use you as a way to bond with other men, by turning you into an object of shame or derision.\nThe right to call out the difference between wanting and possessing, between liking and taking, looking and touching. The right to your own ideas, even if a man at the meeting likes them and therefore thinks that they are his. The right to your own body, even if a man at a meeting likes it and therefore thinks it is his. The right to both these things even if everyone else at the meeting agrees with him for reasons that are completely hidden from their conscious minds and also inexplicable and strange.\nThe right to call it out when a man takes something and holds you responsible for the theft \u2013 of your work, your talent, your body, your sweetness or sexuality, your good thing. The right to tell this to the world without being accused of masochism or greed or of wearing the wrong underwear, of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, or of wanting a job, of wanting to be hurt, of wanting it, whatever it is, sex, or power, or humiliation, because when a woman wants a little she gets everything and then some. She gets the blame. The right to hand back the blame.\nThe right to love a good man, and to love the goodness in men, when they are authoritative and gentle and know who they are.\nThe right to desire, because your mind is always free.\nWe live in strange times, and we\u2019re actively making them stranger. Volkswagen has been forced to pay out more than \u20ac28bn for designing cars that could cheat emissions tests. Political operatives use the unstated fashion choices of voters to microselect for campaign ads. YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithms are implicated in the radicalisation of flat earthers and ultranationalists. Artificially intelligent machines beat us at games with novel strategies we do not, and cannot, understand. The future is only going to be more confusing. Six years before the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was proclaimed, the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov proposed his famous Three Laws of Robotics: that a robot must not harm or, through inaction, allow harm to come to any human being; that it must obey orders given to it by human beings where they do not contradict the first law; and that it must protect its own existence to the extent that doing so would not conflict with the first two laws. They\u2019re good laws, but the robots that Asimov imagined were discrete beings, aloof and accountable \u2013 and very different from the entangled, ever-present, overwhelmingly sophisticated yet often obscure technologies we actually find ourselves living among today.\nInstead of visibly dangerous robots, we have hidden programs inside car engines that poison the atmosphere, prejudiced automation systems for sentencing and job selection, covert data-gathering regimes that sell us out to corporations and political enemies, and proprietary attention-seeking algorithms which distract our attention, and amplify division and conspiracy. If it were robots that were doing all that, a contemporary update to Asimov\u2019s laws might require them to explain themselves to humans, so that we might not be harmed by the fact that most of the time, we have no idea what they\u2019re doing. But really, the onus is on us, not on them.\nWhat then would this requirement look like if framed as a right? The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was primarily concerned with interpersonal relationships and mutual understanding; it speaks of \u201ca common understanding of these rights and freedoms\u201d as well as the promotion of \u201cunderstanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups\u201d. But when so many of those relationships are mediated by inscrutable technologies, the understanding required is that of systems, not of one another.\nToday we hear a lot about the benefits new technologies such as artificial intelligence and mass automation will bring to our lives, but even those tasked with constructing them have little understanding of the effects they will have on our societies. Lack of understanding \u2013 the feeling of being lost and powerless in the world \u2013 leads to fear, apathy and rage. It\u2019s hardly surprising then that in these times of technological acceleration and complexity, those are the dominant emotions felt across the globe.\nThe right to understand, then, would be a useful addition to what is expected for us today. A demand both for better education \u2013 not just in technology, but in all forms of critical thinking \u2013 allied with the requirement that those deploying complex and life-affecting technologies must consult with those subject to them, engineer them for transparency, and actively work to make them comprehensible and accountable. Only through mass understanding, and thus mass engagement and mass participation, might we hope to get a firmer grip on an increasingly strange and inscrutable world.\nEveryone has the right to fulfil their potential, free from discrimination.\nIt\u2019s time to recognise drastic racial disparities in our institutions for what they are \u2013 a threat to human potential. Discrimination places an insidious stranglehold on what a person can be, and how far they can go. It limits individual lives, marginalises talent, and hinders society.\nNo child should ever have to be warned that in the worlds of school and employment, they\u2019ll have to work twice as hard for half the reward. That this lesson must be instilled in a child of colour before they strike out on their own is an indication that we still live with drastic inequality.\nThat same child should never have to look at leadership and decide that it isn\u2019t for them, because leaders don\u2019t look like them, or come from where they come from.\nNot everyone aspires to achieve great things. Each of our understandings of \u201cgreat\u201d is different. A fair society doesn\u2019t demand that you should be a leader, but it certainly doesn\u2019t try to hold you back if you want to be. It won\u2019t tell you that you\u2019re too poor, or too female, or too black to be where you want to be, or do what you\u2019d like to do.\nOutside of aspiration, every person deserves fair treatment inside each institution that we have to interact with to survive \u2013 employment, education, housing and healthcare. You deserve to live your life without being blown off course by the distraction of racism.\nNo burden should be placed on the shoulders of marginalised people to live a double consciousness, in which we know the reality of discrimination, but never speak of it in order to keep the peace. Your safety and stability should never be reliant on an expectation that you\u2019ll be silent about subtle injustice.\nYou should never have to make the case to be seen as a full human being. Immigrants and refugees should have the freedom to live a banal and mediocre life in their country of asylum without the threat of being sent back to danger. You shouldn\u2019t have to climb up the side of a building and rescue a toddler to be granted citizenship, because being exceptional is not a passport to being an agreeable refugee.\nIf you\u2019re a British citizen who is not white, your \u201cnot whiteness\u201d should never be provided as an explanation as to why you did a bad thing. The fact that you are not white does not indicate a tendency to doing bad things. Black is not shorthand for bad.\nYou deserve to live in a society where the life-limiting aspects of discrimination are eliminated. Where your race, gender or class has a nominal effect on your life\u2019s trajectory. Where no one is held back by structural bias.\nThanks to article 23 of the declaration, we can all claim the right to work. Article 23 also gives us the right to do the work we choose under decent conditions, protected from all the adverse consequences of losing both wages and a sense of human purpose. Oh, and a just living wage, social insurance and the individual and collective safeguarding of workers\u2019 interests.\nThese precious provisions around the right to work are followed immediately by a recognition of the right to limits on work, or in the words of article 24, \u201cthe right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay\u201d.\nThe adjacency of the articles implies their inextricability; the right to work is meaningless in the absence of a right to a life beyond work. Yet survey the landscape of work today, and we find the latter everywhere under assault. For the sweatshop workers of China and Bangladesh, the precarious workforce of our expanding gig economy, even for the chronically enervated workaholic bankers and lawyers of Wall Street and the City, the right to a non-working life has been annulled by the sovereignty of work.\nHow have we allowed the right to non-work to be so thoroughly undermined? The first point to make is that this is as a predicament of psychology and culture as much as politics and economics. It is rooted in a deeply entrenched conception of the human being as a creature whose substance and meaning lie in work above all. The declaration, in defining the right to non-work in terms of \u201crest and leisure\u201d, implies that its purpose is to serve the imperatives of work; we rest in order to restore ourselves for work; leisure is the term used for play outside working hours.\nWhile the declaration, in other words, clearly recognises the essential place of work in human self-definition, it recognises non-work only in the negative \u2013 as an interval in or limit on the state of work. What if non-work could gain a new, positive and substantive place in the declaration? If we human beings could be established by it as creatures who paint, sing, speculate idly or stare out of the window not because it restores our working batteries, but because the state of idleness is its own value?\nThe British psychoanalyst DW Winnicott saw us as composed of two fundamental elements: \u201cdoing\u201d and \u201cbeing\u201d. His point was that as we grow more distant from the daily reveries of infancy and childhood, we define ourselves increasingly in terms of doing at the expense of being. But neglecting the dimension of being, he argued, can make us psychically and physically ill. \u201cAfter being,\u201d he writes in a typically terse formulation, \u201cdoing \u2026 but first, being.\u201d\nCould the declaration find a place among the fundamental human rights for the right to be? This is to be distinguished from the right to life, which secures the bare fact of existence. The right to be is the right to a space freed from the imperative of doing, from aim, purpose, productivity. It is at least as essential as action to what the declaration calls \u201cthe free development of personality\u201d.\nThe right to be has as much bearing on political and economic justice as it does on human health and inner security. If non-productive, aimless time and space is protected as a basic human right, it becomes that bit more difficult for, say, Chinese corporate masters to insist that two five-minute toilet breaks in a 16-hour shift constitute a sufficiently \u201creasonable\u201d limit on working hours.\n\u201cThere is nothing,\u201d wrote the great American writer Henry David Thoreau, \u201cnot even crime, more opposed to poetry, to philosophy, ay to life itself, than this incessant business.\u201d Let us declare freedom from this incessant business; call it a right to non-work, a right to be, a right to poetry and philosophy; or indeed, a right to life itself.\nIn 1910, the German doctor and sexual reformer Magnus Hirschfeld calculated that there were 43m possible combinations of gender and sexuality. His thinking came out of extensive clinical experience. Over the years he had interviewed thousands of people, whose diversity of genitalia, physical appearance and sexual desires astounded him. \u201cThe number of actual and imaginable sexual varieties is almost unending,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn each person there is a different mixture of manly and womanly substances, and as we cannot find two leaves alike on a tree, then it is highly unlikely that we will find two humans whose manly and womanly characteristics exactly match in kind and number.\u201d\nHirschfeld\u2019s words are radical even now, though versions of them were repeated right through the 20th century. You can, for example, find very similar statements in Virginia Woolf, who thought of herself as not quite one thing or another, who loved both men and women and who was perennially at sea between the fixed poles of gender. Excited by a newspaper story about a pretty young woman who became a man, in 1928 she channelled her feelings into Orlando, her ebullient masterpiece, a novel bent on unsettling binary notions of gender and identity. \u201cDifferent though the sexes are, they intermix,\u201d it reports. \u201cIn every human being a vacillation from one sex to the other takes place, and often it is only the clothes that keep the male or female likeness, while underneath the sex is the very opposite of what it is above.\u201d\nSexual desire and gender identity are the base notes of bodily experience and yet the wish to organise them into categories of right and wrong, permissible and illicit remains overwhelming. The 1948 Declaration of Human Rights safeguards the right to a nation and the right to be safe from imprisonment, but not the right to express one\u2019s own personal experience of gender; nor to choose, within the absolute limits of consent, with whom and how one wishes to conduct a sexual life. A body can be a prison too. You can exile or incarcerate someone simply by defining them against their own living sense of who they are, by forbidding them love or erotic range. And then, of course, you can make their life a misery, regulate their clothes, their use of lavatories and changing rooms, stop them being able to work or marry.\nAnyone who\u2019s read the annual Transgender Day of Remembrance list of deaths will know the stakes are high. In August 2013, to take a single story, Islan Nettles, a 21-year-old transgender woman, was beaten to death in Harlem. Her assailant was a young man who had been flirting with her when his friends told him Islan had been born a boy. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to be fooled,\u201d he told the police.\n'In every human being a vacillation from one sex to the other takes place'\nWhat rights would have helped Islan? Not so much a right to self-define, which can be made to sound arbitrary and whimsical, as a right not to be forcibly defined by the state, to have a gender identity imposed from outside, to be told that what you aren\u2019t is natural, and what you are is deviant, wrong, illicit, fake. The right to have the stays of gender unloosed, the right to breathe. The right to transition, to shift, to exceed or refuse the expectations and constraints that have attached to the categories of man and woman. The right to dress in whatever clothes one chooses. The right to love whoever one chooses. The right to be different. The right to be neither. The right to be both.\nThe framers of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights couldn\u2019t foresee that in the 21st century, we would need two sets of rights \u2013 one for our lives in the physical world, and one for our lives online. But the beautiful thing is that we don\u2019t, actually, need to rewrite the UDHR for the digital world. We might need an amendment or two, but to begin with, we only need to recognise that the same rights we expect in the physical world should be afforded in the online world, too.\nArticle 12 of the declaration states: \u201cNo one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, no attacks upon his honour or reputation.\u201d Online, countless social media platforms, websites and apps may violate users\u2019 privacy, tracking our movements online, studying and manipulating our digital behaviour, and intercepting and monetising our correspondence. \nArticle 26 of the declaration states that \u201cEveryone has a right to education\u201d and that \u201cEducation shall be free\u201d. Increasingly in elementary and secondary schools, students are required to access, complete and submit their homework using digital tools. Given a laptop can cost at least $1,000, and having wifi at home requires monthly payments to private providers, education in such a situation is no longer free.\nLater in article 26, the UDHR asserts that \u201cParents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.\u201d Given the vast wealth of research that proves that increased screen time for children and teenagers leads to higher rates of depression and even suicide, schools that push their pupils into more screen usage are doing three counterproductive things simultaneously: they\u2019re forcing young people on to the screens that have been proved unequivocally to be addictive and harmful; they\u2019re making learning more difficult; and they\u2019re creating a two-tiered system, whereby those wealthy enough for computers and phones and wifi at home have an easier time accessing their education, while lower income students are left to scramble and to feel inferior.\nArticle 27 asserts that \u201cEveryone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.\u201d The original sin of the digital world was the well-intentioned belief that everything online needed to be free. This led to the hollowing out of the creative middle class, as musicians, journalists, photographers and countless other creators no longer controlled their work, and consumers no longer expected to pay for it. Thus we have now had two generations that can\u2019t conceive of the notion of paying .99 cents to own a song. Because their music is given away for free \u2014 or next to free \u2014 online, musicians have to tour incessantly to make a living, or else be forced to sell their work for use in car commercials.\nArticles 28 and 29 are probably the most poignant here. They state that \u201cEveryone is entitled to a social and international order\u201d and that \u201cEveryone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society.\u201d Currently the digital world does a poor job in achieving any of these objectives. Whereas laws of civility govern the physical world and lawmakers and law-enforcers endeavour to keep us safe from harassment and threats, few such protections are afforded online. The digital world is anarchic, and largely without recognition of rights, public order or general welfare. It\u2019s every person for him or herself. That is in opposition to the soul of the UDHR, which envisions a latticework of rights and responsibilities of all humans \u2013 one that might keep us responsible to each other and invested in our mutual wellbeing.\nThis is not the feeling we get while online. So the digital world has some work to do. If we add to the UDHR a handful of amendments necessary and specific to the digital world, we just might create a framework within which all but the most outlaw tech entities might operate. Here are two amendments: we need to clarify that all surveillance is inherently abhorrent and should be undertaken only in the interest of law enforcement, and even then, only after an independent judiciary signs off on that surveillance. All other dossier-creation is inherently immoral and stands in clear violation of everything that the UDHR states and implies. If we eliminate all tracking from the web \u2013 and all tracking is surveillance, after all \u2013 we\u2019d be well on our way to a digital world that actually conformed to the spirit of the UDHR.\nMost important of all, though, is that we need to ensure that humans in the 21st century will be allowed to enjoy analogue lives. When a student needs a $1,000 device to do her homework, her fundamental rights are being violated. When any government service requires the ownership of a smartphone to gain access to basic services, then their rights are being compromised. Scientific studies have proved that every additional hour we spend in front of screens makes us less happy and less healthy. So we must put the brakes on moving every last element of our lives into the digital realm.

Instead, they said it should merely be \u201cnoted\u201d, which would make it much easier for governments to ignore. The motion has not yet been able to pass as a result of the lack of consensus.\nIt opened up a rift at the talks that will be hard to close in the coming five days. During the plenary, the EU, a bloc of the 47 least developed countries, as well as African and Latin and South American nations, all spoke in favour of the report. Several denounced the four countries trying to dilute its importance.\nRueanna Haynes, a delegate for St Kitts and Nevis, told the plenary it was \u201cludicrous\u201d not to welcome a report that UN member nations had commissioned two years earlier and to hold up crucial talks over two words.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating that we are not able to take into account the report\u2019s findings: we are talking about the future of the world \u2013 it sounds like hyperbole when I say it, but that\u2019s how serious it is,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cI would say that this issue has to be resolved. This is going to drag out and the success of the COP is going to hang on this as well as other issues.\u201d\nScientists were also outraged. \u201cIt is troubling. Saudi Arabia has always had bad behaviour in climate talks, but it could be overruled when it was alone or just with Kuwait. That it has now been joined by the US and Russia is much more dangerous,\u201d said Alden Meyer, the director of strategy and policy in the Union of Concerned Scientists.\nHe said the shift in the US position would be embarrassing for the country if it persisted. \u201cDonald Trump is the denier-in-chief. He takes a personal interest in dissing scientists,\u201d said Meyer. \u201cBut the science won\u2019t go away. The law of thermodynamics can\u2019t be ignored.\u201d\nClimate campaigners said the four blocking governments had been overrun by fossil-fuel interests and were trying to sideline the study.\nMay Boeve, the executive director of the activist group 350.org, said: \u201cDeliberately ignoring the IPCC report would be wholly irresponsible and 350.org stands with the rest of world in condemning these climate deniers \u2026 and the vested fossil fuel interests behind them.\u201d \nMinisters have only five days to establish a rulebook for the Paris agreement. A wild card is the role of the host nation, Poland \u2013 the most coal-dependant nation in Europe \u2013 which will chair the final week of the meeting.\n\u201cThe big challenge now is for the Polish presidency to set aside its obsession with coal, get out of the way and allow full acknowledgement of the IPCC 1.5C report, and its implications for increasing the ambition of all countries, in the conclusion of COP24 later this week,\u201d said Bill Hare, the managing director of Climate Analytics.\n As well as acceptance of the report, there are several other potential fights brewing regarding transparency rules for reporting emissions and proposals for wealthy high emitters to provide financial support to poorer nations struggling to adapt.", "keyword_urls":

"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "As four of the world\u2019s largest oil and gas producers blocked UN climate talks from \u201cwelcoming\u201d a key scientific report on global warming, Australia\u2019s silence during a key debate is being viewed as tacit support for the four oil allies: the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait.\nThe end of the first week of the UN climate talks \u2013 known as COP24 \u2013 in Katowice, Poland, has been mired by protracted debate over whether the conference should \u201cwelcome\u201d or \u201cnote\u201d a key report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nThe IPCC\u2019s 1.5 degrees report, released in October, warned the world would have to cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 45% by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5C and potentially avoid some of the worst effects of climate change, including a dramatically increased risk of drought, flood, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people.\nThe UN climate conference commissioned the IPCC report, but when that body went to \u201cwelcome\u201d the report\u2019s findings and commit to continuing its work, four nations \u2013 the US, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia, all major oil and gas producers \u2013 refused to accept the wording, insisting instead that the convention simply \u201cnote\u201d the findings.\nNegotiators spent two and a half hours trying to hammer out a compromise without success.\nThe apparently minor semantic debate has significant consequences, and the deadlock ensures the debate will spill into the second critical week of negotiations, with key government ministers set to arrive in Katowice.\nMost of the world\u2019s countries spoke out in fierce opposition to the oil allies\u2019 position.\nThe push to adopt the wording \u201cwelcome\u201d was led by the Maldives, leader of the alliance of small island states, of which Australia\u2019s Pacific island neighbours are members.\nThey were backed by a broad swathe of support, including from the EU, the bloc of 47 least developed countries, the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean, African, American and European nations, and Pacific countries such as the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu.\nAustralia did not speak during the at-times heated debate, a silence noted by many countries on the floor of the conference, Dr Bill Hare, the managing director of Climate Analytics and a lead author on previous IPCC reports, told Guardian Australia.\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s silence in the face of this attack yesterday shocked many countries and is widely seen as de facto support for the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait\u2019s refusal to welcome the IPCC report,\u201d Hare said.\nRichie Merzian, climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute, said widespread goodwill across the Katowice talks was being undermined by \u201ca handful of countries\u201d trying to disconnect the science and urgency from the implementation of the Paris agreement.\n\u201cIt is disappointing but not surprising that Australia kept its head down during the debate \u2026 by remaining silent and not putting a position forward, Australia has tacitly supported the US, Russia and Saudi Arabia\u2019s rejection of the latest science on climate change.\u201d\nMerzian said Australia\u2019s regional neighbours, including New Zealand and Pacific islands, had voiced strong support for the IPCC\u2019s report, which was a key outcome of the Paris agreement.\n\u201cA number of delegates privately shared their frustration that countries like Australia stood on the sidelines while Trump\u2019s, Putin\u2019s and King Salman\u2019s representatives laid waste to the fundamental climate science.\u201d\nHare said the interests of the fossil fuel industry were seeking to thwart the conference\u2019s drive towards larger emissions cuts.\n\u201cThe fossil fuel interest \u2013 coal, oil and gas \u2013 campaign against the IPCC 1.5 report and science continues to play out in the climate talks, but even those countries [opposing welcoming the report] are being hit by the impacts of only one degree of warming.\n\u201cThe big challenge now is for the Polish presidency to set aside its obsession with coal, get out of the way and allow full acknowledgement of the IPCC 1.5C report, and its implications for increasing the ambition of all countries, in the conclusion of COP24 later this week.\u201d\nAustralia\u2019s environment minister, Melissa Price, arrived in Katowice on Sunday, with negotiations set to resume Monday morning.\n\u201cThe government is committed to the Paris agreement and our emissions reduction targets,\u201d she said before leaving Australia. \u201cAustralia\u2019s participation in the Paris agreement and in COP24 is in our national interest, in the interests of the Indo-Pacific region, and the international community as a whole.\u201d\nPrice said a priority for Australia at COP24 was to ensure a robust framework of rules to govern the reporting of Paris agreement targets. \u201cAustralia\u2019s emissions reporting is of an exceptionally high standard and we are advocating for rules that bring other countries up to the standard to which we adhere.\u201d\nThe latest Australian government figures, released last month, show the country\u2019s carbon emissions continue to rise, at a rate significantly higher than recent years.\nAustralia\u2019s emissions, seasonally adjusted, increased 1.3% over the past quarter. Excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (for which the calculations are controversial), they are at a record high.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/poland", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oil", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Country accused of tacitly supporting oil allies\u2019 rejection of the latest science", "date_published": {"$date": 1544390251000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544392974000}, "authors": ["Ben Doherty"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Global climate talks", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Australia news", "Climate change", "Environment", "Poland", "Oil", "Fossil fuels", "Energy", "Europe", "United Nations", "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)", "US news", "Saudi Arabia", "Kuwait", "Russia", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/10/australias-silence-during-climate-change-debate-shocks-cop24-delegates", "og:description": "Country accused of tacitly supporting oil allies\u2019 rejection of the latest science", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f49167a235a8a97f6f556addc4ebb3149de910c7/257_549_2981_1789/master/2981.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=116224a7de8d8f62644683b2c273fff6", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Australia's silence during climate change debate shocks COP24 delegates"}, "headline": "O", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f49167a235a8a97f6f556addc4ebb3149de910c7/257_549_2981_1789/master/2981.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c2b9862298d6d05d3f373e2bfdead4b7", "width": "2981", "height": "1789", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f49167a235a8a97f6f556addc4ebb3149de910c7/257_549_2981_1789/master/2981.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=07610133bf90e6b676aa9e6507866607", "description": "Greenpeace activists project words \u201cNo hope without climate action\u201d on the roof of the venue of the COP24 conference in Katowice, Poland.

The revered Scandinavian artist has placed 24 large blocks of centuries-old ice, harvested from the Nuup Kangerlua fjord in Greenland, in a circle outside the Tate Modern in London, with another six on display in the City.\nThe purpose of Ice Watch London, a collaboration with award-winning Greenlandic geologist Minik Rosing, is to bring the effects of climate change closer to home, putting people in direct contact with its effects so that they can feel \u2013 and even sniff and lick \u2013 the ice as it slowly melts away.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been studying behavioural psychology, and looking into the consequences of experience,\u201d says the Icelandic-Danish artist. \u201cWhat does it mean to experience something? Does it change you or not change you? It turns out that data alone only promotes a small degree of change. So in order to create the massive behavioural change needed [to tackle climate change] we have to emotionalise that data, make it physically tangible.\u201d\nEach ice block was fished out of the sea after it had broken away from the Greenland ice sheet \u2013 then transported in fridge containers to the UK (\u201cJust like the ones that take your frozen prawns to Selfridges,\u201d grins Rosing). The blocks, which weigh between 1.5 and 6 tonnes each, all have to be of a shape that is unlikely to break \u2013 when Ice Watch was on display in Copenhagen and Paris, the public were fond of scrambling up and sliding down the blocks.\nOf course, such interaction is the point of the project. As Eliasson puts it: \u201cRoll around on it, climb on it, listen to it!\u201d\nThe icebergs are made up of compressed snow rather than frozen water, meaning that each block contains tiny little bubbles of air. Put your ear up against them and you will hear a magical popping and fizzing sound.\n\u201cIt sounds so beautiful,\u201d says Rosing. \u201cThat is air that was trapped before we started polluting the atmosphere. Those bubbles have almost half the CO2 content as the air outside the iceberg. It was trapped maybe 10,000 years ago, maybe 100,000, so you can smell what air used to smell like before we polluted it. And you can take a drink of it, beautiful, natural water.\u201d\nThe artwork arrives here to coincide with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s latest stark warning that we have only 12 years to limit the worst effects of climate change. Eliasson and Rosing both point out the rather chilling statistic that 10,000 blocks of ice such as the ones on display in London are falling from the ice sheet every single second. However, they both passionately believe that focusing on scare stories is the wrong way to tackle climate change. \u201cInstead of fear-based narratives, you need a positive narrative to make people change their behaviour,\u201d says Eliasson, \u201cand that\u2019s why I think the culture sector has a strong mandate to take on some leadership here.\u201d\n\u201cWe have to provide a glimpse of hope,\u201d adds Rosing. \u201cPeople think the scientists come with the bad news about climate change but actually we come with the good news. We understand what\u2019s happening, we know exactly what needs to be done and we actually have the means to fix it. The only reason we\u2019ve been able to upset the global environment system is because we have enormous power. If we direct that same enormous power to improving the system, we can get it back on track.\u201d\nEliasson\u2019s is perhaps best known here for his 2003 Tate Modern installation The Weather Project, which hung a gigantic sun in the gallery\u2019s turbine hall and attracted over two million visitors. His work has often focused on environmental themes: Green River used uranine, a non-toxic dye, to turn rivers in Stockholm, Tokyo and LA a dazzling bright green, while his Little Sun project provided small, solar-powered lamps to local entrepreneurs in communities where electricity was scarce. Even during the installation of this latest work, which started on Monday, Eliasson says his ice blocks have had an unusual effect on people: \u201cThe crane guy outside who was lifting and putting them down said \u2018You know what? These are actually really heavy!\u2019 Another woman touched it and said \u2018wow, it\u2019s really cold!\u2019 Of course she knew this but the knowledge of her hand is so different to the knowledge in our heads.\u201d\nIce Watch is set to run until 21 December, providing the weather doesn\u2019t melt them away before. After that date, any ice left unmelted will be taken to local community and cultural institutions as part of an extended educational programme.\nThe exhibition comes before a major retrospective of Eliasson\u2019s work at the Tate Modern that starts on 11 July 2019. That, too, will have a climate focus, perhaps inevitably so given Eliasson\u2019s longstanding interest in environmental matters. For the catalogue, he has interviewed Elke Weber, the psychologist whose research into human behaviour has shaped his recent thinking about how to change people\u2019s actions through art. The show will also contain a work from 20 years ago, in which Eliasson flew over Iceland documenting glaciers from above with a camera.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of my oldest works, but also one of the first where I was focusing on the question of climate and glaciers,\u201d he says.\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d adds Rosing, striking a rare forlorn note, \u201cthose glaciers will probably be gone.\u201d\n\u2022 Ice Watch London continues until the ice melts, details here", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/olafur-eliasson", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The Scandinavian artist is tackling climate change by transporting centuries-old Greenland icebergs to the banks of the Thames \u2013 allowing people to smell and taste the earth\u2019s air before it was polluted", "date_published": {"$date": 1544533965000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544556585000}, "authors": ["Tim Jonze"], "article_section": "Art and design", "article_tags": ["Art and design", "Olafur Eliasson", "Climate change", "Culture", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/dec/11/icebergs-ahead-olafur-eliasson-brings-the-frozen-fjord-to-britain-ice-watch-london-climate-change", "og:description": "The Scandinavian artist is tackling climate change by transporting centuries-old Greenland icebergs to the banks of the Thames \u2013 allowing people to smell and taste the earth\u2019s air before it was polluted", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66544c1ac2bcab0c43e23bb3c2018ab4d8bb97bc/0_14_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=db431a29f8d2e30538469a5d843ced93", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Icebergs ahead!

And why they these days are increasingly shaped in cold-rooms - because working for weeks outside with them is risky also in the traditionally cold Nordic nations. \nArt can make us reflect upon such things. \nThough I get it is more fun to ponder if the Avengers will use time-travel in the spring to fix things - than to ponder how to slow down our own Ragnarok - an artificial introduction of carbon dioxide molecules within 200 years that is now on the verge of reversing 50 million years of natural processes\nhttps://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/12/05/1809600115", "recommendation_count": "3", "in_reply_to": "123622659", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "working for weeks outside with them is risky also in the traditionally cold nordic nations", "effect": "and why they these days are increasingly shaped in cold rooms"}]}, {"id": "123622659", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1544580206000}, "author": "glacier", "author_id": "4706143", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "As scientist I find this both beautiful and touching. \nTo point out that this use CO2 and thus is ironic, means that Attenborough TV shows are bad for the planet - is that correct? \nArt was always about taking somewhere and place it in a context. Duchamp made a fountain. We see the amazing images of Salgado and Adams. Both extreme abstractions and landscape photos take both time and the z-dimension out of the art. Still we watch it. Still it is touching. \nArt is also activist (look at Salgado again). \nThere is more to this world than strict documentation and cost-benefit analysis. There is art. There is room for reflection. And I urge people who can to watch it. There is something special about hearing the sound of glacial ice melting. And if one pay attention - one will see that the visual characteristics of glacial ice is different from the one we made by freezing water in the fridge. \nI find it interesting that so many find this provoking. In itself that makes a trained scientist like myself think that there is something deeper than an artist just present some chunks of ice. \nBecause it does make us think about consumer society. That a product of a few cars worth in mass does come with transportation. That ice sure does melt slow even in areas where ice at the moment could not survive. Even if these - 50(?) tons look large. While Greenland - where ice are conditioned to exist shed close to 300 million tons net - every year. These things. \nI do not think this art is trying to teach us about the physics of glacier ice. Or AGW. And one does not need to like this art to understand AGW - as little as one need to be a star in solving differential equations to understand the concept of AGW. \nBut it can make someone experience something. Reflect upon something. \nI have taken scientists with half a life worth of studying glacial ice up to actual glaciers. Scientists who has never actually seen a glacier in real life after a decade or more of doing their core scientific work. A lot of glaciologists are not field scientists. \nI have seen tears. Experienced scientists sitting down - in a moment of quiet. Touching them. Hugging them (really - flat down with arms stretched out as if trying to embrace the whole entity). I have done the same thing in reverse - hugging a section of the first ice-core spanning 400,000 years (the \"Vostok\") still being preserved in laboratories. \nFor science Vostok was and is special - because it took science from 1970 to 1997 to get these 400,000+ years worth of data. Two generations of science. Since it is expanded to 800,000 years of data. \nI do not think non-scientists will be this emotional about ice either - just as with art. \nBut it does allow for reflection. Even political reflections. Because there are nations on this planet now that cut their funding for climate science. Because they do not like the answers these lumps of ice (for example) gives. It is so much convenient to say one does not believe - right? \nFrom a scientific point of view - to study frozen water is a really difficult science. Because water is a very strange substance. There are volumes of science on how and where conditions makes ice start to deform (flow). How ice does (or not) slide over the ground. How diffusion works. \nBut as Prof. Richard Alley succinctly pointed out in a lecture some 30 years ago - best rule of thumb is that heat melts ice. It is a bit more complex than that - but it is one good rule of thumb - based on some pretty good science. \nI completely get that people do not like art. That is fine. But like science itself - one can not falsify much stuff with linear regression. And there are things on this planet that has value outside of the austerity bible of cost-benefit zero-sum calculations. \nThe great thing about art is that it does not force itself upon us. We are free to dislike it. But thermodynamics is not so kind. \nI find that the artistic side of our evolution - allowing us to make it - and find everything from pure joy to reflection to sadness to dislike when exposed to it as one our more redeeming qualities. It is not like we really need the artform of music, is it? Or is it? Nor do we need the artform of film - most people do not watch films much even though people gasp collectively when a CGI guy with a gauntlet snapped his finger and made fictional figures evaporate (or whatever). I did gasp. But I completely see how silly it is when one think about the CO2 cost of such a silly story earning billions is. Flying some person around the world just because he plays Norse god even more fictionus than the religious character it was based on. Is it really more silly to let melting ice melt in a city than what the billion dollar industry of a movie does? In between the same guys making a silly film about a fictional \"Ragnarok\" based on a less silly religious belief system? Really?

It seems like climate change and global warming is a conversation that\u2019s going to be hard to avoid this Christmas.\nBut some ways of talking are better than others. To help you prepare for difficult conversations here are five different ways you can try to talk about climate change, or anything else difficult and controversial, this holidays.\nThis is not a winning strategy in itself. The facts have been around for more than 50 years but the debate has taken a course that has at times ignored science.\nSure, you can throw intellectual spaghetti at the wall and see if it sticks. But there are better options.\nIn a recent interview, professor of linguistics and cognitive science George Lakoff railed against \u201cenlightenment reasoning\u201d, which is the belief that \u201cif you just tell people the facts, they\u2019ll reach the right conclusion\u201d\n\u201cThat just isn\u2019t true,\u201d Lakoff says. \u201cPeople think in terms of conceptual structures called frames and metaphors. It\u2019s not just the facts.\u201d\nCompelling stories steeped in emotion and backed with facts \u2013 that\u2019s the way to talk about global warming.\nEarlier this year the UN released a handbook for talking about climate change which recommends \u201ctelling a human story, talking about the real world, knowing what matters to the audience, and employing visual aids\u201d.\nThis advice takes advantage of processes that are literally hardwired in our brains and have assisted with our survival. Or, as moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt said, the \u201chuman mind is a story processor, not a logic processor\u201d.\nYou don\u2019t have to look far to find these stories.\nTell your family about the joint US and Australian firefighting efforts that have been running for 20 years but may be stopped because we are moving towards a \u201cyear round\u201d fire season and will be too busy battling blazes at home to help anyone else.\nThe process of simply hearing what the person says is enough to defuse the emotional charge\nTell them about the bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, which could hit again next year with heat waves breaking records that have stood for 118 years by more than 5C.\nTell them about the low-lying island nations like Kiribati, which are being threatened by storm surges and rising sea levels, and then show them this picture.\nIf you need something festive perhaps mention that summer heat waves have destroyed one third of the Christmas tree crops in the UK, something already well known in Australia.\nIf you do have to quote facts and figures, use graphs to bring them to life. These animated charts of global temperature over time are compelling and this collection of 10 graphs is a little dated but still worth bookmarking.\nChances are you\u2019re not going to meet outright deniers this Christmas. The overwhelming majority of people believe in global warming \u2013 73% of the Australian public at last count.\nThe problem is urgency. So make your conversations about the tangible present with solutions. This might mean talking about smaller things first so it doesn\u2019t sound so big and difficult to deal with that it is overwhelming.\nTalk about the droughts across Australia. The fires in Queensland and California. The increased severity of storms and hurricanes such as those that hit Florida and Houston or the single cyclone that wiped out more than 60% of Vanuatu\u2019s economy.\nKeep things real, immediate, and tangible.\nIn the case that you do run into deniers, or denialist rhetoric, it\u2019s important to resist the urge to repeat false claims while attempting to refute them.\nI\u2019ve written before about the downsides of acting as a publicist for views you disagree with. In short, it\u2019s counterproductive and usually ends up strengthening the other side\u2019s arguments. You want to avoid repeating claims \u2013 but by all means refute them forcefully. \nAn example of this would be if someone raises scientific consensus. You say \u201cmore scientists agree on global warming than on plate tectonics\u201d but don\u2019t repeat whatever claim has prompted this.\nThen there is framing. A frame is a theory that suggests that how something is presented to an audience can influence how people process that information.\nThink about the \u201ccarbon tax\u201d. This was either a failure or triumph of framing depending on how you look at it. The ETS was actually not a tax, in fact, as this article  explains, it\u2019s kind of the opposite.\nBut still, it was framed as a tax. People don\u2019t like taxes. Opposition built. Election were lost. The tax that was not a tax was scrapped.\nWe can learn from this.\nIn 2003 Republican consultant Frank Luntz laid out the climate strategy used by conservatives for the last 15 years. This was leaked in a memo and included advice such as using the term \u201cclimate change\u201d instead of \u201cglobal warming\u201d because it sounded more natural and less alarming. This has led to the often repeated \u201cclimate is always changing\u201d argument.\nTo counter this framing you have to not engage with it but to push a different, more compelling, frame \u2013 Lakoff suggests \u201cclimate crisis\u201d but global warming also works.\nThis is about all of our futures \u2013 our lives, our quality of life, and that of our children. Keep it in that frame and you\u2019re a lot closer to changing minds.\nNon-violent communication (NVC) is a methodology created by psychologist Marshall Rosenberg as a way to bridge communication divides by focusing on universal human needs.\nWhile it sounds quite touchy-feely, it is used by everyone from companies to personal therapists, and even hostage negotiators. NVC is all about listening, repeating, asking questions, and thinking about what needs are being expressed.\nYou begin with neutral observation and repetition. These conversations can degenerate to yelling matches without people even realising what the other is trying to say.\nIf someone tells you \u201cclimate change is natural\u201d and that they\u2019re sick of alarmists, NVC advises repeating back \u201cI\u2019m hearing you say that what\u2019s happening is normal and people are exaggerating the dangers, is that right\u201d.\nIn conversations that can quickly devolve into sloganistic shouting the process of simply hearing what the person says is enough to defuse the emotional charge.\nThe second step is to talk about emotions rather than policy positions or facts, which should sound familiar by now.\nIf someone tells you they are sick of the \u201cclimate change cult\u201d and \u201clying scientists\u201d, ask them what they are feeling rather than arguing about something they are already upset about.\nDo they feel confused, angry, overwhelmed, incredulous? Talking about the feeling behind the statement and your own feelings can help you start to see things from each others perspective, as long as you are doing it respectfully.\nThat\u2019s a lot of talking about feelings but I assure you, this is effective \u2013 you can probably see now why I brought up hostage negotiations at the start.\nStep three is to identify what need is being expressed \u2013 you can find a list here. I\u2019ve written before about the empowering belief of climate denialism \u2013 and what a relief it would be if it were true.\nThe truth is that people don\u2019t simply believe things. They hold beliefs because they empower them or give them utility. Try to understand what that utility or empowerment is.\nThe final step is a request. Ask the person if they would be willing to look at one of the graphs above, or read a first person piece from a firefighter, a farmer, or a soldier.\nThe main thing is to keep trying.\nStress the urgency, try to understand where people come from, have the conversations. This affects us all.\n\u2022 Simon Black is senior media campaigner for Greenpeace Australia", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/family", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Compelling stories steeped in emotion and backed with facts \u2013 that\u2019s the way to talk about global warming", "date_published": {"$date": 1544588892000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544623724000}, "authors": ["Simon Black"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Climate change", "Family"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/12/five-ways-to-talk-to-your-family-and-friends-about-the-climate-crisis-this-christmas", "og:description": "Compelling stories steeped in emotion and backed with facts \u2013 that\u2019s the way to talk about global warming", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b8ab1fc2c22cab593a983f6fc280bc51e8cca0d/637_669_3107_1864/master/3107.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=8afd64ee5e298a3311286a19399ae06e", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Five ways to talk to your family and friends about the climate crisis this Christmas | Simon Black"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b8ab1fc2c22cab593a983f6fc280bc51e8cca0d/637_669_3107_1864/master/3107.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=770f27b2ffc9e35b70046ad00ba4f1de", "width": "3107", "height": "1864", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b8ab1fc2c22cab593a983f6fc280bc51e8cca0d/637_669_3107_1864/master/3107.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7676250a9c01b67532ea20cd1ee4d445", "description": "\u2018This is about all of our futures \u2013 our lives, our quality of life, and that of our children.

Is it real? Yes. It's been clear from research in the late 1990s that global climate had decoupled from solar activity and correlated instead with industrial CO2 production.2. Is it going to affect us? Oh yes. Some of the ways will be good, some will be neutral, but because we have adapted our societies to conditions the way they are now most affects will be bad.3. Is it going to affect poor countries more? Oh boy yes. Some small Pacific island nations will cease to exist, but of the big boys Bangladesh (huge numbers of people in low lying coastal areas) and most of Africa (already hot, population set to double in the next few decades, weak economy and lack of decent governance to do much about it) are going to be absolutely hammered.4. Is there anything we can do about it? No, not really.5. Oh come on, there must be something? Well, OK. Don't use a car, don't fly, go vegetarian will all significantly lower your personal CO2 footprint. Installing a heat pump for heating would help a bit more. Just don't expect any of it to make much difference.6. Why not? Only a small (tiny) percentage of the global population looks like taking this advice. The rest might make small changes at the edges, but not the major lifestyle changes that would actually have an impact. It would need concerted government action from the big economies to make a difference.7 So will they? Not a hope. Russia and India are not really interested, China is building new coal fired power stations. And the USA currently seems keen on actively worsening climate change. So, err, no. 8 Is there any hope? Unless human nature suddenly changes, or world harmony and concerted action suddenly breaks out between all major nations, our best hope is technological - improved batteries, solar and wind power, and so on.

Human-caused climate change was behind 15 deadly weather disasters in 2017, including droughts, floods and heatwaves. The world\u2019s leading climate scientists, in a special report for the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), have warned that there is only a dozen years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C. To meet that target, global carbon emissions need to drop by 45% by 2030. Instead they are going up. We need radical, urgent change. So it is appalling that negotiators in Poland at the 24th Conference of the Parties, or COP24, are finding it so hard to push ahead with implementing the climate deal signed three years ago in Paris.\nThis is largely because rising rightwing nationalism has vitiated the global solidarity needed to avoid a catastrophe. Under the Paris agreement, effective action to tackle climate change requires global cooperation on three fronts: first, nations set demanding carbon-reduction targets for their own societies; second, countries are held accountable for meeting these targets through surveillance mechanisms; and third, rich states provide cash for poorer ones to transition to a carbon-free future. Yet none of this is possible when the most important actors on the world stage think that the chief business of the nation state lies at home. The biggest problem is the US president, Donald Trump \u2013 a longtime climate-change denier. While negotiators were discussing how to lower carbon emissions, Mr Trump\u2019s officials unveiled two schemes promoting fossil fuels. The US\u2019s rogue behaviour has encouraged others to behave badly: notably Saudi Arabia, which played a key role in attempts to wreck the summit\u2019s \u201cwelcoming\u201d of the IPCC report. Last month, Brazil\u2019s president-elect, Jair Bolsonaro, chose as his foreign minister a climate-change denier, and the nation has pulled out of hosting COP25. The top European leaders \u2013 Emmanuel Macron, Theresa May and Angela Merkel \u2013 are inwardly focused, leaving Poland, the current talks\u2019 host, to sing the virtues of its large coal stocks. The other big players are India and China: the latter has the global heft but is not internationally deft; for the former, the opposite is true.\nPublic opinion is way ahead of national politics. In the US there has been a definite shift in beliefs: more than 80% of Americans, including most Republicans, believe climate change is happening. Tens of thousands of people in Brussels marched ahead of the summit in Poland. The collapse of the planet\u2019s biosphere has permeated the public consciousness. This means that there are breakthroughs: Poland relented to create a group that will make sure the summit\u2019s goals will be ambitious. Germany has stumped up extra cash to ensure funding pledges are met. Even the US has been allowed to play a constructive role in creating rules by which nations agree to abide by in meeting climate targets \u2013 because everyone has an interest in creating a backdoor for Washington to re-enter the agreement. About 80% of all energy traded is oil, coal or gas. The world\u2019s economy runs on fossil fuel, which is destroying our planet.

It isn\u2019t the first and it won\u2019t be the last. Occupy, the Arab spring and #MeToo are other recent examples of this new politics. Some of it is good. Some of it is not: a leaderless movement, self-organised on Reddit, helped elect Donald Trump. But leaderless movements are spreading, and we need to understand where they come from, what is legitimate action and, if you want to start one, what works and what doesn\u2019t.\nLeaderless movements spring from frustration with conventional top-down politics, a frustration shared by many\nThe Arab spring began with the self-immolation of one despairing young man in Tunisia; the revolt rapidly spread across the region, just as protests have proliferated in France. In highly connected complex systems, such as the world today, the action of a single agent can suddenly trigger what complexity theorists call a \u201cphase shift\u201d across the entire system.\nWe cannot predict which agent or what event might be that trigger. But we already know that the multiplying connections of our worldoffer an unprecedented opportunity for the rise and spread of leaderless movements.\nLeaderless movements spring from frustration with conventional top-down politics, a frustration shared by many, not only those on the streets. Polls suggest the gilets jaunes are supported by a large majority of the French public. Who believes that writing to your MP, or signing a petition to No 10 makes any difference to problems such as inequality, the chronic housing shortage or the emerging climate disaster? Even voting feels like a feeble response to these deep-seated problems that are functions not only of government policies but more of the economic system itself.\nWhat such movements oppose is usually clear, but what they propose is inevitably less so: that is their nature. The serial popular uprisings of the Arab spring all rejected authoritarian rule, whether in Tunisia, Egypt or Syria. But in most places there was no agreement about what kind of government should replace the dictators. In Eygpt, the Tahrir Square protests failed to create an organised democratic political party that could win an election. Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood, long highly organised and thus prepared for such a moment, stepped into the political vacuum. In turn, this provoked further mass protest, which eventually brought to power another dictatorship as repressive as Hosni Mubarak\u2019s.\nWhen the demand is for change in social relations\u2013 norms more than laws \u2013 such as the end of sexual harassment, the results can be as rapid but also more enduring and positive. The #MeToo movement has provoked questioning of gender relations across the world. The British deputy prime minister, Damian Green, was forced to resign; in India, a cabinet minister. The effects are uneven, and far from universal, but sexual harassers have been outed and ousted from positions of power in the media, NGOs and governments.\nSome mass action has required leadership. The race discrimination that confronted the US civil rights movement was deeply entrenched in both American society and its laws. Martin Luther King and other leaders paid exquisite attention to strategy, switching tactics according to what worked and what didn\u2019t. King correctly judged, however, that real and lasting equality required the reform of capitalism \u2013 a change in the system itself. In a sense, his objective went from the singular to the plural. And that is where his campaign hit the rocks. Momentum dissipated when King started to talk about economic equality: there was no agreement on the diagnosis, or the solution.\nThe Occupy movement faced a similar problem. It succeeded in inserting inequality and economic injustice into the mainstream political conversation \u2013 politicians had avoided the topic before. But Occupy couldn\u2019t articulate a specific political programme to reform the system. I was in Zuccotti Park in New York City, where the protest movement began, when the \u201cgeneral assembly\u201d invited the participants to pin notes listing their demands on to trees. Ideas were soon plastered up, from petitioning Washington DC to replacing the dollar \u2013 many of which, of course, were irreconcilable with each other.\nThis is why a leaderless response to the climate change disaster is tricky. It\u2019s striking that in Emmanuel Macron\u2019s fuel tax rises the gilets jaunes opposed the very thing demanded by Extinction Rebellion, Britain\u2019s newly minted leaderless movement: aggressive policies to reduce carbon emissions to net zero. Macron\u2019s proposals would have hit the poorest hardest, illustrating that resolving the crises of the environment and inequality requires a more comprehensive, carefully wrought solution to both. But leaderless movements have largely proved incapable of such complicated decision-making, as anyone at Zuccotti Park will attest.\nConventional party politicians, reasserting their own claim to legitimacy, insist that such problems can only be arbitrated by imposing more top-down policy. But when most feel powerless about the things that matter, this may only provoke further protests.\nUltimately, to address profound systemic challenges, we shall need new participatory and inclusive decision-making structures to negotiate the difficult choices. An example of these forums has emerged in parts of Syria, of all places. Rightly, this is precisely what the Extinction Rebellion is also demanding.\nInevitably, leaderless movements face questions about their legitimacy. One answer lies in their methods. The Macron government has exploited the violence seen in Paris and elsewhere to claim that the gilets jaunes movement is illegitimate and anti-democratic. Mahatma Gandhi, and later King, realised that nonviolent action \u2013 such as the satyagraha salt march or the Montgomery bus boycott \u2013 denies the authorities this line of attack. On the contrary, the violence used by those authorities \u2013 the British colonial government or the police of the southern US states \u2013 against nonviolent protestors helped build their own legitimacy and attracted global attention.\nComplexity science tells us something else important. System-wide shifts happen when the system is primed for change, at so-called criticality. In the Middle East there was almost universal anger at the existing political status quo, so it took only one match to light the fire of revolt. Meeting people in colleges and towns across the UK but also in the US (where I lived until recently) you can hear the mounting frustration with a political and economic system that is totally unresponsive to the needs of the 99%, and offers no credible answer to the climate emergency.\nThere will be more leaderless movements to express this frustration, just as there will be more rightwing demagogues, like Trump or Boris Johnson, who seek to exploit it to their own advantage. For the right ones to prevail, we must insist on nonviolence as well as commitment to dialogue with \u2013 and not denunciation of \u2013 those who disagree. Messily, a new form of politics is upon us, and we must ensure that it peacefully and democratically produces deep systematic reform, not the counter-reaction of the authoritarians.

There are many movements, mostly peaceful, that have influenced changes in our daily lives in terms of awareness that can influence us as consumers to make a choice. Greenpeace, WWF and similar organisations obviously come to mind. However, if one looks at some of the issues that GJ are raising e.g the rich vs poor has now been taken up as a result of the initiatives concerning the Fair Tax Lable, one of the main drivers has been the UK Fair Tax Mark that has been introduced by, among others Coop in the UK and adopted by the European Parliament. \nThe network of European Cooperatives states on their products produced throughout Europe that a broad range of international standards (environment, labour conditions, etc) are adhered to in the production of the food and other goods. The Fair Tax Mark is also under consideration. These are in response to concerns of more aware consumers.\nSimilarly, initiatives such as the Fairwear mark that I have mentioned elsewhere, inform consumers of often high-quality fashion wear, that these are produced under fair working conditions. This situation has come about by lobbying multinationals who can see the medium-long term benefits of informing their customers that they adhere to internationally recognised standards. \nThere is a long list of such initiatives, buying 0Km food etc, non-exploitation of agricultural workers (e.g. in Italy). All of these have come about through peaceful education and awareness initiatives. And, of course, have occurred over a long period and a business case that recognises there are more customers that will consciously make certain purchasing choices.\nPolitical protest becomes more problematic. We cannot compare with the 1960s (Vietnam, Paris etc). There are a stronger biased media machinery and level of conspiracy theory that speeds through the social media and fanatical groups that can hijack a peaceful movement-protest. There are major divisions in frustrations between generations, class and levels of education. The older that hang on to past visions of the role of their country (e.g. Brexit and right-wing/fascist groups in the EU)) and at the same time are witnessing much of the socio-economic fabric that they once enjoyed, evaporating. Most of the young, don't have an inkling of what those benefits were; but as they gradually understand naturally are demanding them or turn on the older generations to accuse. What the older generation (and I count myself) do not fully comprehend is that many young people are much more concerned about global issues (survival of the planet, justice etc) and see us as having created the problem. Simultaneously, many of the youth are awaking to the fact that some of the opportunities that have been created for them are being taken away (e.g. EU in the case of Brexit), moreover, are perceived as being taken away by the older generations. This is also happening in other European countries but rarely mentioned in the press. In the many cases, it is not the majority of the younger generations that are pushing the far-right anti-EU agenda, often it is the far-right older (and include 35+) that have highjacked them to serve their own needs. For example, youth in Milan have been spontaneously arranging an initiative to wave to place the EU flag on balconies as a protest against the current government's hostile attitude towards the EU. At the moment, it is peaceful but it is quite likely that they will be infiltrated by groups to discredit them.\nUnfortunately, we have politicians at national and EU level that ignore these developments; and in many cases use their propaganda machinery to undermine them. Any dreams of turning Brexit around are naive. The country has been dramatically split by misinformation and hate. One peaceful protest march in London will not change the government's decision (similar to the Iraq war as somebody has already mentioned). It will require millions to peacefully walk the streets across the entire country to protest the reasons why they voted, which were not necessarily EU. This is unlikely to happen.

Next year\u2019s host was supposed to be Brazil, but the incoming president, Jair Bolsonaro, is hostile to the Paris agreement and has withdrawn the offer. Chile and Costa Rica are understood to be considering alternative bids.\nSome campaigners at the current climate change talks in Poland, which have stalled over continuing disagreements on how to implement the Paris agreement, praised the UK\u2019s move.\nGareth Redmond-King, the head of climate change at WWF UK, said: \u201cThis is great news and we welcome the bid to host the 2020 [conference]. It\u2019s an opportunity for the UK to lead the way on climate change at a time when the need for action has never been starker.\u201d\nCOP26, as the 2020 conference is known in UN jargon, will also be notable for the role of the US. Under Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, the country has begun the process of withdrawal from the Paris agreement, but that could be halted if he is replaced in the 2020 election.\nBolsonaro has indicated he may take Brazil out of the Paris agreement, and the divisions between developed and developing countries that have characterised the current talks are likely to remain in the intervening years, giving the UK a diplomatic mountain to climb to make a success of the talks if awarded host-country status.

And any plan to make the EU more lovable is surely overdue: the British predicament is a testament to that.\nProspects for enacting the Piketty plan may be slim, given Europe\u2019s perennial difficulty in finding consensus: not even everyone on the left will agree, as Yanis Varoufakis makes clear in this piece about his own plan to revive the EU. \nBut at least it\u2019s a plan.\nElsewhere, one of our abiding themes in 2018 has been homelessness, an issue that always comes to the fore at this time of year.

They will also go some way to encourage the stepping up of each country\u2019s climate change efforts.\nAmong the issues holding up progress is the highly technical question of what should happen to the market for carbon credits, held by some countries in recognition of their emissions-cutting efforts and their carbon sinks, such as forests.\nThese credits count toward countries\u2019 emissions-cutting targets. Brazil introduced wording that would benefit the country for its huge rainforest cover, but critics said contained loopholes that allowed for double counting of carbon credits would severely undermine the integrity of the system.\nThat question is unlikely to be resolved in the time remaining, but gave an indication of Brazil\u2019s likely stance in future talks. Next year\u2019s conference was supposed to be held in Brazil, but will take place in Chile because Brazil\u2019s incoming president, Jair Bolsonaro, withdrew the offer to host.\nBrazil has been a reliable supporter of the annual talks in the past and has worked to broker deals between the developed and developing world. Without that support in future, the talks are only likely to grow more fractious.\nThe US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have also played a disruptive role, watering down a resolution that would have welcomed the recent IPCC report that a temperature rise of 1.5C would have dire consequences.\nThe compromise in the redrafted text would have all countries \u201cwelcome the timely completion\u201d of the IPCC report, but campaigners pointed out that this was weak because it refers merely to the timing of the report rather than its content. The EU, by contrast, and several other developed countries joined with scores of developing nations in announcing they would focus on preventing a 1.5C rise in their carbon-cutting efforts.\nThere were few new offers from the rich world of financing for developing countries to help them cut emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change, another issue that has been pushed to future talks.\nAs the last-minute negotiations wore on, delegates were saddened to hear of the death overnight of the veteran Philippine negotiator, Bernaditas de Castro Muller, who was a notable presence at the talks for nearly three decades.

Resolving these should mean countries can move ahead with meeting their targets.\n\u201cThis is a good agreement,\u201d the European commissioner Miguel Ca\u00f1ete told the Guardian. \u201cWe have more to do but we can move forward now.\u201d\nNicholas Stern, author of the seminal review of the economics of climate change, said: \u201cThis has been another summit of tough negotiations, but it has ultimately succeeded in its crucial primary task of agreeing the so-called rulebook for the Paris agreement.\u201d\nOne important issue that could not be resolved was over carbon markets, and how countries can gain credits for their efforts to cut emissions and their carbon sinks, such as forests, which absorb carbon dioxide. After Brazil, which hopes to benefit from its huge rainforest cover, insisted on wording that critics said would allow for double counting of credits and undermine the integrity of the system, this issue was postponed until next year.\nWhile the conference broadly succeeded within its narrow technical remit, however, key questions on tackling climate change were ignored or put off. Foremost among these is the inadequacy of countries\u2019 current national targets for curbing greenhouse gases. With current targets, the world is likely to face 3C or more of warming, which scientists warn would bring disaster.\nPaul Bledsoe, a former climate adviser to President Bill Clinton, said: \u201cGaining a strong regime of accounting for emissions is an essential step on getting a handle on global emissions, and a major achievement. But the biggest breakthroughs on emissions cuts must be done at the head of state level over the next several years, not in a few days by ministerial negotiators.\u201d\nThe conference also failed to take account of the warnings by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the global body of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists, which only two months ago presented a bleak picture of the damage that would be done if global temperature rises reached or exceeded 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\nThe panel said that the result would be heatwaves, droughts, floods, the die-off of coral reefs, and the decline of agricultural productivity in large swathes of the world. The Paris agreement binds countries to avoid a 2C temperature rise, with an aspiration to limit warming to no more than 1.5C. Time is running out: the IPCC\u2019s findings imply that there is about a decade left to set the world on a new track.\nThis year was the fourth hottest on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization, and extreme weather \u2013 such as the heatwave in the UK, wildfires in Europe and the US, floods in India and storms in south-east Asia \u2013 affected every continent.\nJennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace, said: \u201cA year of climate disasters and a dire warning from the world\u2019s top scientists should have led to so much more. Instead, governments let the people down again as they ignored the science and the plight of the vulnerable. Adopting a set of rules for climate action is not nearly enough; without immediate action, even the strongest rules will not get us anywhere.\u201d\nThe two-week conference, known as COP24, in Poland\u2019s coal-fuelled heartland started with Sir David Attenborough warning of the collapse of civilisation if untrammelled climate change were allowed to take hold. \u201cRight now, we are facing a manmade disaster of global scale, our greatest threat in thousands of years: climate change,\u201d the veteran broadcaster and naturalist told delegates. \u201cIf we don\u2019t take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.\u201d\nThe secretary general of the UN, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, also stepped up his rhetoric, warning it would be \u201cimmoral and suicidal\u201d to fail to take strong action.\nThe 15-year-old Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg, whose strike to raise awareness of the issue drew global attention, was scathing in her speech to the conference: \u201cYou\u2019re not mature enough to tell it like it is. Even that burden you leave to your children.\u201d\nThere were encouraging signs of shifting geopolitics at the talks. China and the EU were able to settle differences on how to account for and verify greenhouse gas emissions, and the EU and a handful of other rich countries joined with scores of developing nations in promising to focus on the 1.5C limit in setting their future emissions-cutting targets.\nBut while the conference ended in a show of unity, with the Polish minister in charge leaping from the podium table into the audience in glee as it finally closed 30 hours after the deadline, the talks also displayed new rift lines.\nBrazil, under its incoming president, Jair Bolsonaro, who is hostile to the Paris agreement and sceptical of climate science, held up agreement for nearly a day by insisting on a change to the rules on carbon credits that critics say would undermine the system. That decision has been put off to next year, but the stance of Brazil under Bolsonaro \u2013 he also withdrew Brazil\u2019s offer to host next year\u2019s conference \u2013 troubles many other countries. Brazil previously acted as a powerbroker between developed and developing nations, and without that role future talks may be more acrimonious.\nThe US also showed how Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is changing its role, when it joined with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to prevent the conference from fully embracing the IPCC\u2019s findings. In previous years, while Saudi Arabia has played an obstructive and delaying role behind closed doors, it has rarely been willing to take a public stance against agreement, and Russia has remained largely quiet since allowing for the adoption of the Kyoto protocol in 2004. Australia, which has played a shifting role in the talks under successive governments, also joined with US supporters in a celebration of coal.\nIt seems that Trump\u2019s hostility to climate science is emboldening other countries to take a more aggressive role in fighting progress.

Ever since President Trump\u2019s announcement in 2017 that the US would withdraw from the Paris agreement, the question has been whether the UN process could continue to work. Much like the communique that came out of the recent G20, the agreement on a set of rules to implement promises made in Paris shows that while multilateralism has been damaged, it is not dead. Flawed and inadequate though it is, the process that has developed since the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed in Rio in 1992 is still the best hope we have of staving off the most terrifying impacts of global warming.\nThe sticking point of carbon credits, with new demands from Brazil regarding the treatment of forests, was pushed back to next year. But the agreement on how governments will measure and report on emissions cuts is important. The dynamic that previously pitted developing against developed countries has significantly shifted.\nMinds will now turn to the next deadline: 2020, when countries must demonstrate that they have met old targets and set new, much tougher ones. This round of talks, which the UK aims to host, is even more crucial following recent warnings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that current goals are nowhere near ambitious enough. While these set the planet on a course towards a 3C rise in temperatures, scientists believe even 1.5C would bring serious consequences. We have around 12 years in which to bring an unstable situation under control.\nDrastic changes to the global economy are the only option, underpinned by a rapid shift to low and zero-carbon energy, along with adaptation and mitigation measures including new mechanisms to manage migration. The US\u2019s refusal, in Poland, to embrace the IPCC\u2019s findings, along with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, was wrong-headed and a hint of troubles ahead. Next year UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres will attempt to break the logjam when he hosts a climate summit with heads of state.\nOnce, the UK claimed a global leadership role on the environment, which was at least partly justified by the 2008 Climate Change Act. Political paralysis connected to Brexit is not the only reason why it now sits on the margins, while increasing cooperation between the EU and China is one of the more hopeful recent signs. The UK\u2019s bid to host the 2020 summit should focus minds, not least on the contradictions of an energy policy that combines phasing out coal with the promotion of fracking. While the UN framework is essential, it cannot do the heavy lifting of cutting emissions, which will be done by nation states or not at all.\nThis month\u2019s pledge by Danish shipping giant Maersk to be carbon neutral by 2050 was important. Businesses too have a responsibility to the societies in which they operate. But governments cannot wait for the private sector, let alone the energy companies on whose riches so much of the global economy rests. They, and the politicians who champion them, are the vested interests against whom the battle for the future must be fought. Some long-term investors are starting to recognise the risks. So are more and more people, as extreme weather linked to warmer temperatures becomes more frequent. Greta Thunberg, the 15-year-old Swedish activist who addressed the UN in Poland, was right to say \u201cthe only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake\u201d.", "keyword_urls":

It's common sense to realise that a warmer climate with the same rainfall can result in more evaporation and lower soil moisture resulting in drought.\nThe increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall events with global warming is well documented and leads to increased flooding. While this may seem to contradict the preceding paragraph, the increase in extreme rainfall events occurs at the expense of moderate rainfall events. This can lead to drought and flood occurring in the same year as we just seen in South Eastern Australia.\nHeatwaves and extremely hot days have increased in both frequency and duration of the former as our climate has warmed. With increased evaporation and reduced soil moisture fire seasons have increased in both length and area affected.\nGlobal warming has decreased the high latitude temperature gradient reducing the energy of the jetstream causing weather patterns to remain in place. This can cause intense cold snaps that last for weeks as I found on my only visit to such latitudes.\nWhat you call the \"Ice age\" is a popular term for the glacial periods, which, interspersed with interglacial periods, have been a characteristic of the last 2.6 million years of this planets history. During glacial periods Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation (NHHLSI) which varies over periods of roughly 100,000 years due to orbital and axial cycles, is low. Atmospheric CO2 drops to 290 to 200 ppm. Glacials are ended by a NHHLSI peak accompanied within 1,000 years by rising CO2 and global greenhouse warming for 10,000 years causing glacial continental ice sheets to retreat as CO2 reaches the interglacial level of around 280 ppm \n The last glacial period ended 9,000 years ago and NHHLSI has continued to decline. The global warming of the last 150 years has been due to an increase in atmospheric CO2 from 280 to more than 400 ppm due to people extracting and burning fossil fuels. \nNHHLSI will continue its decline for another 50,000 years to a level which, if atmospheric CO2 was at the normal interglacial level of 280 ppm, would have seen the beginning of the next glacial period or \"Ice age\" but which will not occur if CO2 is in excess of 350 pp.", "recommendation_count": "4", "in_reply_to": "123820423", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "a warmer climate with the same rainfall", "effect": "more evaporation and lower soil moisture resulting in drought"}, {"cause": null, "effect": "drought"}, {"cause": null, "effect": "increased flooding"}, {"cause": "this", "effect": "drought and flood"}, {"cause": null, "effect": "weather patterns"}, {"cause": "this", "effect": "intense cold snaps that last for weeks as i found on my only visit to such latitudes"}, {"cause": "orbital and axial cycles", "effect": "which varies over periods of roughly 100,000 years"}, {"cause": "an increase in atmospheric co2 from 280 to more than 400 ppm due to people extracting and burning fossil fuels", "effect": "the global warming of the last 150 years has been"}]}, {"id": "123878808", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1545101039000}, "author": "Walsunda", "author_id": "12483673", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "In one post you talk of the need for a country other than your own to reduce it emissions.

This is the large scale system that throws about every natural low pressure system forming in the North Atlantic straight over the UK and makes your winters a long rain season and your summer a gray cold summer. \nYou want to take that blow for the world?\nWell - the same system dries up Mediterrainian nations even more than they do with AGW alone. Do you think they want to solve heat and drought problems with more drought? \nThe Chinese may be a nation that has the most experience with this technology. They did \"cloud bombing\" for a long time (also during their olympics in Beijing). The problem was that they enhanced \"down-stream\" drought problems. \nThe problem with global climate modification is of course that the UK want it modified into being Paradise on own soil. So does France. So does Egypt. So does China. So does Donald Trump. So does Australia. \nSo imagine this fun fact.

Americans poor in some brandy to counteract that. Brazil is throwing in some sugar. Mexicans poor some salt into it to counteract the sugar and the Brandy. India poor in some rice that is fermenting. \nViola - you have a drink that everyone on the planet will hate. And that every nation on the planet will go to war for. \nFrance get it right. What will Italy do as they are fucked by what France does usptream - taking away their precipitation, seasonal and temperature patterns, you think?\nWhen UK diverge heat and precipitation from Northern Europe what must Europeans do? \nTo fiddle with climate is a very scary thing. Just look at the geopolitical strains and numbers of treaties needed in Africa and Middle east when a simple dam is built in a river. \nJust look at the political strains in existence in Spain due to redirection of fresh-water. \nYes - to bomb the well-stirred liquid of the stratosphere is cheap if one measure it by \"mean global temperature effect\". But once you study it as \"global anomaly pattern\" effect - you see war. \nWhen nations start to modulate temperature and rain patterns - other nations will not sue. They will go to war.

The deep ocean is also gaining heat at a smaller rate, and energy is going into the net melting of ice all around the planet. And the land, to depths of tens of meters, is also warming. \n07:09The total energy imbalance now is about six-tenths of a watt per square meter. That may not sound like much, but when added up over the whole world, it's enormous. It's about 20 times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity. It's equivalent to exploding 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year. That's how much extra energy Earth is gaining each day. This imbalance, if we want to stabilize climate, means that we must reduce CO2 from 391 ppm, parts per million, back to 350 ppm. That is the change needed to restore energy balance and prevent further warming.\nBQEND\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/james_hansen_why_i_must_speak_out_about_climate_change/transcript?language=en", "recommendation_count": "10", "in_reply_to": "123872587", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "123873478", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1545084248000}, "author": "Erik Frederiksen", "author_id": "15131989", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Your personal incredulity means nothing in the face of the science.\n1824 Fourier says the surface of the Earth is warmer than it should be, it must be doing something like a greenhouse. \n1859 Tyndall says, hmmm, CO2 is doing it. \n1896 Arrhenius says hey if we burn fossil fuels we're raising CO2, we're going to warm the Earth and this is how much and he was pretty close.\n1940s the modern quantum version with the US Air Force right after WWII.

You answer to that one is an excellent indication of your view on whether the problem with the world is that it already has too many plebs and darkies in it, and it certainly does not need any more. Industrialisation begat trade unions, and we all know what they begat. We do not want that anywhere that it has not already happened. Instead, we need to halt it where it is already happening, and we need to reverse it where it happened long ago. Margaret Thatcher made an excellent start. Now to finish the job. Isn't that right, Guardian? Isn't that right?\nNo, of course not. We urgently need the exploitation of the vast reserves of coal in this country, and not least in this county of Durham. That, and the extension of civil nuclear power, are the means of delivering highly paid, highly skilled, high status, unionised jobs while securing independence from Arab oil, from Russian gas, and from coal that has been mined using child and slave labour. From North Korea, Donald Trump intends his dynasty to supply a dependent world with the coal of the Kim dynasty deep into the twenty-second century. Yet we have our own, right here under our feet. Horror stories about how coal was burned or mined in the Britain of the twentieth century have no relevance to the Britain of the twenty-first. At the same time, we must be totally opposed to the open-casting of the Pont Valley or anywhere else, digging up hardly any coal while employing hardly anyone. On those same grounds, we must also be totally opposed to fracking.\nWe need an approach to climate change which protected and extended secure employment with civilised wages and working conditions, which encouraged economic development around the world, which upheld the right of the working classes and of nonwhite people to have children, which held down and as far as practicable reduced the fuel prices that always hit the poor hardest, and which refused to restrict travel opportunities or a full diet to the rich.\nAnd we must reject out of hand the notion that the problem with the world is that it has people in it. Instead, we must celebrate the full compatibility between the highest view of human demographic, economic, intellectual and cultural expansion and development, and the most active concern for the conservation of the natural world and of the treasures bequeathed by such expansion and development in the past. That expansion and development must now include space exploration, fuelled by, and fuelling, fusion power.\nAnother hung Parliament is coming, and we need our people to hold the balance of power in it.

All that matters for actual global climate change effects are actual global emissions.\nSure, you can argue that a country with twice the per capita emissions of some other country has a greater responsibility to do something about it. I'm fine with that argument, at least as it applies to comparatively wealthy countries (yes, that includes Australia). However, India's and China's emissions massively outweigh anything Australia could possibly do. This is, in fact, frequently used as in this country as an argument for why we shouldn't bother doing anything.

The small legless creature was found in Panama and EnviroBuild\u2019s Aidan Bell said its ability to bury its head in the ground matched Donald Trump\u2019s approach to global warming.\nTrump\u2019s distinctive hair has already led to comparisons to a poisonous furry caterpillar and a golden-plumed pheasant, while a yellow-crowned moth was called Neopalpa donaldtrumpi in 2017.\nClimate change is already harming Americans\u2019 lives, from wildfires to floods, and will get worse, according to a US government report published in November. Trump\u2019s response to the report was: \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\nThe only event his administration put on at the recent UN climate summit in Poland extolled the virtues of fossil fuels, to cries of \u201cshame on you\u201d from protesters.\nThe newly discovered creature is a caecilian and its naming rights were auctioned to raise money for the Rainforest Trust.

I wrestled with my own preconceived notions and past experiences, and was surprised when conversations took inspiring, if not transcendent, turns.\nSecular as I am now, I still think fondly of my childhood minister, Dr Lehman, who loved college basketball and Honda Accords (he drove 13 of them during his lifetime). At the conclusion of each Lakeside Baptist service, he\u2019d call the eastern North Carolina congregation to action.\n\u201cGo forth,\u201d he said as the organ began to play, \u201cand be involved in the world.\u201d\nMy family later moved to Spartanburg, South Carolina, and my high school experience felt ripped from the pages of the Footloose script. Local parents disowned gay sons; classmates openly questioned the science of evolution in biology class; Young Life leaders plastered an Abstinence Pledge on the wall of our public school cafeteria.\nMy frustration from those years has at times stopped me from reaching out to those in the faith-based community, especially regarding political issues like climate change. I\u2019m aware of my own bias, the way it was formed by negative experiences, and how it limits my understanding of believers and their choices. This realization helps me understand why believers might in turn have problems connecting with someone like me.\nBut if we\u2019re going to address climate change in time to prevent catastrophic results, we\u2019re going to do it by taking cooperative action with those with whom we disagree. I find myself wondering if similar discussions are happening in faith-based communities, and why there hasn\u2019t been a more palpable response to climate change among people of faith in the south.\nWhile climate change scenarios have all the hallmarks of biblical narrative \u2013 violent storms, epic floods, plagues, resource scarcity, the displacement of people \u2013 it\u2019s considered liberal political terrain. Scott Coleman, a practicing Baptist and the amiable environmental manager of Little St Simons Island, a mostly undeveloped strip of shoreline off the coast of Georgia, tells me that \u201cenvironmental stewardship is often associated with liberal politics, thus looked upon negatively\u201d.\nThe Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.\nThe political power of the pulpit is undeniable, even in the post-Billy Graham south, where in many states nearly half of all citizens attend church services.\nI can\u2019t help but imagine the sheer impact a faith-based movement could have on expediting climate action. Scott Coleman agrees. \u201cI think that if our faith leaders in the south were more outspoken about the importance of creation care, it would go a long way in helping to depoliticize environmental issues in our region,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if we could depoliticize environmental stewardship in the south, imagine the progress we could make with elevating environmental stewardship in southern culture.\u201d\nI spoke with people of faith in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia, and it became clear that the primary barrier to climate action is the fact that it\u2019s been yoked with the liberal agenda. Climate activist and author Anna Jane Joyner, whose father is the pastor of a megachurch in North Carolina, writes that she grew up lumping \u201cenvironmentalists in with hippies and liberals and all the other people who were probably going to hell\u201d.\nDr Lucas Johnston, a professor of religion and environment at Wake Forest University, explains that \u201cthere is a longstanding antipathy toward environmental sentiments in Christian, and especially evangelical circles, because they have, for centuries, been imagined as pernicious and dangerous, and possibly bordering on paganism.\u201d\nI asked former six-term South Carolina Republican congressman Bob Inglis why discussing climate change is so difficult in the south. A proponent of growing the eco-right and setting the free market upon the challenges of climate change, he called the environmental movement a bird with a left wing so large it can\u2019t fly straight. Climate change is \u201crarely talked about in the language of conservatism\u201d, he explained. \u201cIf you want someone to have a conversion moment, it helps for them to hear it in their own language, from someone they trust.\u201d\nInglis has been trying to start the conversation in conservative southern circles since having his own conversion moment on a trip to Antarctica in 2006. A scientist drilled into the ice, and Inglis saw, firsthand, the Industrial Revolution\u2019s impact on the ice record, which revealed a long period of stability with a sudden uptick in carbon dioxide levels. He accepted then that burning fossil fuels changed the chemistry of the atmosphere. He was later booed at public events for stating his belief in climate change.\nWe reject the notion that God gave us the Earth to do with whatever we please.\nWhile in office, Inglis introduced a Raise Wages, Cut Carbon bill. Though grounded in science and conservative economic principles, his efforts were seen as subversive by Tea Party opponents, who essentially implied his bill would destroy civilization. \u201cI had crossed the line of orthodoxy,\u201d he said.\nThere\u2019s a perceived social and political cost to speaking up about climate issues among people of faith in the south. Roughly half of the southerners I spoke with felt that people in the south avoided talking about climate change altogether because it was awkward and politically divisive. Mary Beene, a pastor in Savannah, notes that \u201cin our congregation, it was a more controversial topic than race or sexuality\u201d. She observed that some women in the south who believed in climate change worried \u201cit simply would not be polite to challenge what the men \u2026 were saying in public.\u201d\nIndeed, white male evangelicals are still dominating the conversation and decision-making power structures.\nWatch, for example, this clip from a 2014 GOP Senate primary debate in North Carolina, where four contenders, including Senator Thom Tillis, deny that manmade activity influences climate change in under one minute. Tillis, whom the Center for Responsive Politics reports as having received over $260,000 from oil, gas and coal interests, won the Senate seat, with 63% of his voters identifying as evangelicals or born-again Christians. Ninety-five percent of them were white.\nAccording to Pew, 77% of Hispanic Catholics are likely to say human activity has contributed to the Earth\u2019s warming. Religiously unaffiliated (64%) and black Protestants (56%) are also likely to tie climate change to human activity. Pew points out that \u201cfewer white mainline Protestants (41%) view climate change as primarily due to human activity \u2026 white evangelical Protestants are least likely to hold this view.\u201d\nWhen Rabbi Rachael Bregman moved to Brunswick, Georgia, she was told: hurricanes don\u2019t happen here. Then she evacuated for both Irma and Matthew. \u201cBoth of the evacuations were on top of the holy days where we say the words of the Unataneh Tokef,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s a prayer which asks, \u2018who by fire, who by water \u2026 who by drowning\u2019 regarding the end of one\u2019s life. Those questions felt very real and not metaphorical.\u201d\nHer synagogue is 12 feet above sea level and a half-mile from the ocean\u2019s edge. During recent hurricanes, they \u201cevacuated our five Torah scrolls, locked the doors and hoped for the best for our 130-year-old building. What has surprised me,\u201d she says, \u201cis how little has changed and how little environmental activism sprang up as a result.\u201d\nBregman, like many I talked to, has witnessed climate change firsthand and is eager to see more responsiveness in the faith-based community. She has made personal changes, like switching to an electric car; greening up at the synagogue; and offering a sermon on climate change.\nTony Lankford, the senior pastor at the First Baptist church in Saint Simons, has also improved the church\u2019s energy and water use, and organized a Coastal Green Team Summit for faith leaders to discuss climate change.\nThere is a lack of emphasis on climate change in the South due to a lack of knowledge. We often experience it but, we don\u2019t know how to articulate what we experience.\nLankford feels that \u201cregardless of political or theological leanings, there is agreement upon the basic tenet that God formed all of this beauty around us, and scripture [Genesis 1-2] gives us a responsibility to be stewards of that creation. For me, thus, mismanagement and abuse of creation is not only immoral or unethical, but is sinful.\u201d\nThe majority of southern believers I spoke to reported never hearing climate change mentioned in a sermon, but, like Lankford, could ground feelings about protecting the Earth in scripture, and felt that there was a strong moral imperative to protect the planet and its inhabitants.\nSeveral mentioned Dr Katharine Wilkinson\u2019s book Between God and Green: How Evangelicals Are Cultivating a Middle Ground on Climate Change as helping them articulate a scriptural basis for taking climate action in the future.\nWhen Bob Inglis \u2013 someone with whom I probably disagree on several core issues \u2013 spoke with reverence about seeing an Australian scientist evangelize about the natural world at the Great Barrier Reef, I could recognize his passion for the natural world as my own. Sometimes, common ground gets lost in semantics.\nInglis gave me the rational and the emotional case for his conversion from skeptic to climate change believer. The emotional case is what has stayed with me most since our talk, and is one I hope other skeptics manage to hear from their children, like Inglis did.\nHis son once told him, lovingly: \u201cBe relevant to my future. Show some courage.\u201d\nA note from the author: I started this column with the intention of joining a conversation I knew was already happening in the south, and your emails helped make that a reality last week.\nI heard from retired marine biologists in Arkansas, philanthropists in Georgia, theologists in Virginia, poets and boat captains in Louisiana, lawyers in Florida, clean air activists in Mississippi. I also heard from climate change deniers, brand marketers, and \u2026 an old boyfriend.\nI want to witness and listen to the south as it really is - not just how I want it to be. I\u2019m doing my best to stay curious and open-minded and look forward to your continued responses. I hit the road in January, with an eye toward Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama.

But coal-dependent Poland secured a loophole allowing countries another year to negotiate new \u201ccapacity mechanisms\u201d that would be exempted from the deadline.\nIt could allow subsidies to keep unprofitable coal plants running until 2035, five years beyond a projected cut-off for meeting the Paris goals.\nBill Hare, the director of the Climate Analytics thinktank and a former Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change lead author, told the Guardian: \u201cContinued support for coal as just agreed by the EU is completely inconsistent with meeting the Paris agreement goals and in particular with limiting warming to 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels].\u201d\n\u201cIt appears to be a de facto rejection of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finding that coal needs to exit the power sector rapidly. In the EU this means by 2030.\u201d\nGreenpeace said the stay of execution for coal subsidies showed many EU governments were still not serious about climate action.\nAfter the deal was signed, the EU\u2019s climate commissioner, Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, tweeted: \u201cA more flexible market will facilitate the integration of more renewables. We also limit capacity mechanisms and #support550 to move #BeyondCoal. #CleanEnergyEU completed.\u201d\nThe European parliament\u2019s chief negotiator in the talks, the MEP Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161, said the deal \u201cwill help the transformation to cleaner electricity production and it will open up more competition in electricity across the EU border \u2013 good for the climate and good for the wallet\u201d.\nEurope is committed to a goal of limiting global warming to \u201cwell below 2C\u201d and has pledged to cut its carbon dioxide emissions by at least 40% by 2030. Last month, Ca\u00f1ete himself launched an EU strategy for achieving \u201cclimate neutrality\u201d by 2050 in order to reach the UN\u2019s 1.5C target.\nFlorent Marcellesi, a Green MEP involved in the talks, said the delayed introduction of the emissions standard was \u201ca free licence to go on polluting despite the impact on climate and public health\u201d. It was also insufficient to meet the EU\u2019s Paris climate goals, he said.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greenpeace", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/activism", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/protest", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Stay of execution for coal subsidies has been heavily criticised by climate analysts", "date_published": {"$date": 1545219375000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1545220633000}, "authors": ["Arthur Neslen"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Coal", "Energy", "European Union", "Greenpeace", "Environment", "Environmental activism", "Protest", "World news", "Europe", "Poland", "Fossil fuels", "Paris climate agreement", "Climate change", "Global climate talks", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/19/eu-coal-subsidy-phase-out-completely-inconsistent-paris-climate-deal", "og:description": "Stay of execution for coal subsidies has been heavily criticised by climate analysts", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50e15e64db06c9d99e47a438c6a35c99989b7284/0_263_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=aedb12683844fdaa96783c94e5be2bda", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "EU coal subsidy phase-out 'completely inconsistent with Paris deal'"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50e15e64db06c9d99e47a438c6a35c99989b7284/0_263_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=58f9f17dc08f8d10872749503f391ce0", "width": "5000", "height": "3000", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50e15e64db06c9d99e47a438c6a35c99989b7284/0_263_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ef8a4145969dc95d1ef636d758c0c3d", "description": "Greenpeace activists block the street leading to the EU council headquarters in Brussels last week.\nPhotograph: Julien Warnand/EPA"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc079d2a2c3613145ed8cbf"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/20/last-day-in-paradise-california-deadliest-fire-untold-story-survivors", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "William Goggia awoke to a poisonous orange atmosphere so thick with smoke he couldn\u2019t see the sun.\nIt was 8am on Thursday 8 November. He heard the piercing metallic clang of propane tanks exploding in the distance. His sister, who lived nearby, called to ask him to help a relative in the area, but Goggia told her that he couldn\u2019t: chunks of burning wood were falling from the sky. \nGoggia inhabited the same stucco, three-bedroom house he grew up in. Now it was time to leave. By 9am he was on the road, accompanied by his tabby cat, Mikey. But the street was so clogged with people trying to escape that Goggia barely moved. The fire was getting closer. The van was going to burn up with him and the cat inside, he thought. So he turned back around against the traffic.\nGoggia didn\u2019t know it yet, but he had been engulfed by the deadliest wildfire in recorded California history. Soon at least 86 people would be dead in a new and ferocious kind of climate change-inflected wildfire. And Paradise would suffer a fate that appears increasingly likely: the total destruction of a modern American city.\nThis is a reconstruction of Paradise\u2019s final hours, based on interviews with more than 50 residents, first responders and wildfire scientists.\n\u201cYou are ascending into Paradise,\u201d read a road sign on the way into town, a charming spot in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains in northern California.\nIn truth, if this was a utopia it was a mellow sort. Dating back to the Gold Rush, Paradise was less a garden of earthly delights than a quiet community of 27,000, with homes and trailer parks hidden amid dense stands of pines and oaks.\nMost here were middle and lower income. The population skewed towards retirees, but residents say there was also a younger influx escaping real estate prices elsewhere in California. When a Starbucks opened several months ago, a local joke went, Paradise had truly arrived.\nBut one menace was constant. Wildfires are a normal part of the forest ecosystem in California, and over the past decade parts of Paradise have been threatened by at least four fires. More than 200 structures were destroyed in 2008.\nRecent conditions have boosted the risks. Years of drought exacerbated by global warming have left its forests achingly dry and littered with dead trees. And because there has been a policy of suppressing wildfires to protect homes and businesses in the state since the early 1900s, the landscape is now unusually dense with shrubs and young trees that would otherwise have been burned off by naturally occurring blazes. Fire experts, who have long spoken out about the danger, don\u2019t see this as vegetation \u2013 they see it as fuel.\nParadise\u2019s geography makes it particularly vulnerable. It sits on a ridge between two canyons that meet like the lines at the top of a triangle, providing magnificent vistas but also impeding escape in the event of a disaster. One main thoroughfare, Skyway, leads out of town and into the valley to the west.\nResidents could opt in to an alert system that would notify them of trouble via telephone, text and email, and Paradise had an emergency plan that split the city into evacuation zones. Evacuations would proceed based on which areas were affected, and during a disaster, cars would be permitted to use both lanes on certain roads to flee.\nBut the plan, officials would later say, had a crucial vulnerability: it did not envision the panicked evacuation of the entire town at once.\nTwo days before the fire, the gas and electric company PG&amp;E, which serves much of northern California, warned roughly 70,000 customers in nine counties, including in Paradise, that it was considering shutting off power because of increased fire risks from high winds and low humidity.\nSparks from PG&amp;E equipment have been blamed for igniting a number of fires, including the Tubbs fire, which killed 22 in wine country in 2017, and 2015\u2019s Butte fire, which killed two and destroyed more than 900 structures after a tree came into contact with a power line.\nThe night before the fire, the utility company said it was continuing to monitor weather conditions, and by 10pm it still hadn\u2019t made a final decision about whether to turn off power.\n3.30am Thursday, Paradise \nOn the day the blaze broke out, Susan Van Horn was having trouble sleeping. Lying in bed in her double-wide mobile home, she noticed the wind: gusts tearing through the oak trees on her half-acre property, falling branches and acorns clattering on to her roof. \u201cI thought, \u2018if we\u2019re going to have a fire, this is it,\u2019\u201d said Van Horn, 66.\nNormally the wind in California blows from west to east \u2013 from the Pacific Ocean inland. But, particularly in the fall, a different pattern emerges: hot northerly air from the Nevada deserts courses over the Sierra Nevada, rushing downslope over towns like Paradise. These are winds that firefighters fear because they disperse wildfire embers like dandelion seeds flung into the breeze. In Paradise that morning, there were northerly gusts of up to 70mph.\nAt 6.15am, PG&amp;E reported a power outage on one of its transmission lines near the community of Pulga, in the hills about 10 miles east of Paradise. By 6.30am, according to the company, an employee observed fire on the same transmission line. It would be christened the Camp fire, after the fire\u2019s location at Camp Creek Road. Cal Fire officials are investigating a second possible ignition point, also at 6.30am and near the same area.\nRob Nichols, 51, an 18-year veteran of the Paradise police, rose at 7am to gusty winds and an unsettling red glow in the sky, visible from the back patio of the home he shared with his wife and young stepchildren. The glow concerned him, and he called a colleague at the station, who told him about the small fire burning near Pulga. Paradise, the colleague said, would probably be OK.\n8am, Paradise police station\nWhen Nichols arrived at work, 911 calls were pouring in, and ash was falling from the sky as if from a volcano. He had a very bad feeling. He called his wife and told her to pack the kids in the car and leave.\nEvacuations were ordered for the tiny communities east of Paradise, but the situation quickly spiraled into something far more terrifying. The flames were being propelled downslope by gales at speeds of 80 football fields a minute. Suddenly they were approaching Paradise itself.\nAt around 8.30am, Nichols got a call to respond to a fire. Strangely, it wasn\u2019t east of Paradise \u2013 it was in the heart of the city.\nNichols and a trainee officer went looking for flames. They drove past the homes of family and friends and arrived at a small gated lot where they found the fire. It seemed to have appeared out of nowhere. They hopped a fence and Nichols turned on a hose, but no water came out. By this time, firefighters were being inundated with calls from all over town and could not respond. The pair were left with no choice but to run from house to house, banging on doors to alert people, some still asleep, that it was time to go.\nNichols recognized what was happening. Extreme winds were lofting embers to areas far to the west of the main body of flames, igniting so-called spot fires.\nThese spot fires destroyed all hope for an orderly evacuation, said Nichols. \u201cWhen you make fire evacuation plans you think in your mind the fire is going to come from the east or the west side.\u201d But this one blew fires all over town. \u201cBefore you knew it, all your evacuation routes are on fire.\u201d\n9am, Paradise elementary school\nSome of those who opted in to the alert system say they received warnings, but others did not, and many locals say they had no official notification at all that they were in the fire\u2019s path. That could be because the fire destroyed cell towers and other communication infrastructure, preventing the alert from reaching some residents.\nEarly on Thursday morning Krystin Harvey, a 44-year-old homemaker, called her daughters\u2019 high school to ask whether classes had been canceled owing to the plume she could see on the eastern horizon.\n\u201cThey said they\u2019re not going to cancel school for smoke,\u201d she explained. After all, fires were a regular part of life in Paradise. So she and Arianne, 17, and Arissa, 16, climbed into her car. On the way they noticed that the pines were coated in ash, as if there had been a blizzard. She dropped them off, but at around 8.20am the school called: it was evacuating, and the girls would have to be collected.\nAt Paradise elementary, a teacher named Lynn Pitman, 54, had also seen the smoke and thought little of it. When it became so stifling that the children were sent in from the playground, she began to worry. Sitting at her desk to call parents, \u201cI was shaking pretty bad.\u201d Once only a few kids were left she gathered with the other teachers and their remaining students in a classroom upstairs.\nOutside it was now growing dark, as if an eerie twilight were falling at 9am. \u201cLooking at the kids\u2019 faces I thought, \u2018I gotta do something with them,\u2019\u201d Pitman said. Forcing cheeriness, she gave them snacks and began playing games, until police came through to check the building and told them to move. Buses were waiting next door, they said.\n\u201cOnce I got outside, the smoke, the darkness \u2013 it looked like midnight,\u201d Pitman said. \u201cThen I got really scared.\u201d\nThe winds were blowing plumes of smoke low over the town, forming a choking, swirling shroud about 1,500 meters deep. A fireman seemed shocked to see Pitman. The buses had already left, he said, and instructed her to find a car. Pitman quickly flagged down a woman named Millie, who she vaguely recognized, and threw herself and three students in the car. But it was no escape.\n10am, Skyway\nAs many of the tens of thousands of inhabitants of Paradise, and of Magalia higher up in the hills, all tried to leave at once, the result was predictable but no less horrific: gridlock. Cars, RVs and trailers inched along as the fire outpaced them and trees and homes on either side of the road went up like torches. Some vehicles ran out of gas or caught fire themselves, blocking the way and making the jam worse. \u201cYou\u2019re fight or flight, you\u2019re trying to get out, to escape, and it\u2019s bumper-to-bumper LA traffic,\u201d said Pitman. \u201cYou can\u2019t move, and flames are all around you.\u201d\nInside their car, the temperature was rising. One of the boys asked if he could pray, and for a while they could all hear his small voice asking Jesus for help. Pitman called her husband to apologize for not leaving sooner. He listened as, in the background, Millie, the driver, pounded the steering wheel and shouted: \u201cGo, go, go, everybody go.\u201d\nBy now, the fire had morphed from a countryside blaze to one that raged its way from building to building. The Safeway, the Skyway Villa RV park, the Gold Nugget local history museum, the Paradise Adventist church, the mayor\u2019s home, the police chief\u2019s home: all went up.\nFires aren\u2019t supposed to act like this any more. In 1906, a fire that broke out in the wake of San Francisco\u2019s great earthquake incinerated the city. But decades of research into fire safety and changes to building codes were meant to have ameliorated large-scale structural conflagrations, said Faith Kearns, a researcher at the University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources. In recent years, though, things have begun to change. In 2017, some 3,000 single-family homes were destroyed in the city of Santa Rosa, and over 1,000 homes burned in summer 2018 in a fire that advanced into the city of Redding, which also saw a bizarre \u201cfire tornado\u201d.\nThe main drivers, Kearns believes, are a more extreme climate and more people living in fire-prone, semi-rural areas. \u201cWe engineered our way out of that kind of fire,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing it come back.\u201d\nBack on the road, Allyn Pierce, the manager of the intensive care unit at Adventist Health Feather River, was on the run with two colleagues. After evacuating 67 patients they had hopped into Pierce\u2019s Toyota truck but were almost immediately waylaid amid exploding gas tanks and burning cars.\nThe air conditioner was running full blast, yet the windows were hot enough to burn skin. Trying to keep the atmosphere light, Pierce put on music. Celine Dion\u2019s song Ashes came on, and he skipped it. Instead they sang along to Peter Gabriel\u2019s In Your Eyes. A Volkswagen Beetle passed Pierce\u2019s truck and caught fire. Its driver jumped out and ran.\nCars, some abandoned, now completely blocked the road, and when a fire truck pulled up next to the Toyota, Pierce\u2019s colleagues sought refuge in the cab. But he stayed: he hoped the road might somehow clear, and he didn\u2019t want to trap anyone else behind him by leaving his own vehicle.\nSoon the firefighters began covering their windows of their truck with heat-reflective blankets \u2013 their last resort when surrounded by fire. Pierce recorded a video for his family and friends, and buried it deep in his center console, hoping that it would survive if he did not. He expected that flames would overtake his truck in minutes. Listening to an acoustic version of A-ha\u2019s Take on Me, he put his hands on the wheel and sang along to the chorus, trying to blot out the whirls of fire outside the window.\nPierce made it. A bulldozer miraculously appeared and began clearing abandoned cars to create a path out. By 10.30am, Pierce was back at the hospital, helping to set up a triage center and treating incoming patients.\nPitman also eventually made it off the ridge with her students \u2013 a journey that was usually 20 minutes took over three hours. On TV, she watched footage of her school burning.\nKen Lowe had never seen a fire so intense. As residents tried to flee, the Cal Fire chief, leading a \u201cstrike team\u201d of five engines with three firefighters each, went the opposite way \u2013 back into town, trawling through the vicious jam.\nNear the Fastrip gas station in the north of town, as vehicles began to catch fire and their occupants fled with nowhere to go, Lowe and his crews did the only thing they could think of to save lives. They shouted for people to run toward the wide intersection.\nThere, Lowe\u2019s five fire trucks formed a physical barrier around 100 or so civilians and their dozens of dogs and cats, protecting them as the flames went past. \u201cIt was panic,\u201d Lowe said: pitch black, trees lighting up like matches all around, power lines arcing, embers skidding through the sky like amber snowflakes.\nAs escape became impossible, firefighters elsewhere also tried to help people shelter in place. One couple, Diana and Helmut Bredow, and their son were corralled with others into an intersection as firefighters aimed water cannons at the encroaching flames, like soldiers defending a position from attack.\nNear the site of the old Optimo bar,crews hatcheted their way inside some empty, newly constructed buildings and hustled anywhere from 100 to 200 people inside with their animals.\nIn the memory of one of the evacuees, everyone, and even the dogs, was composed and self-possessed. By contrast, Erin Roach 58, recalled that \u201cpeople were crying \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t wanna die.\u201dAn amateur artist, Roach had her paints with her, so she did the only thing she could to stay calm: she started painting. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d\nThat morning Roach encountered a police officer who looked particularly stressed, so she put her arms around him.\nIt happened to be Nichols, the policeman who had discovered the spot fire a few hours earlier. \u201cI thought she seemed like she needed a hug,\u201d Nichols said, \u201cand I\u2019m sure she thought I needed one.\u201d\nFor those the firefighters could not reach, survival was a matter of outpacing the flames. After following a light blinking in the darkness, one fire crew found a paraplegic man with scorched feet who had dragged himself 50 yards (45 meters) along a dry creek bed, and out of harm\u2019s way. In the town of Concow, east of Paradise, over a dozen people waded into a reservoir for shelter, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nAfter turning his van around, William Goggia headed toward the home of his neighbors, the Romeros. On a rocky patch they had erected three enormous crucifixes. That was where he decided to leave his van with the cat still inside. He recalled addressing God: \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m gonna leave him in your hands.\u2019\u201d\nIn the suffocating smoke, he went back out and followed the road by foot, hoping it would be easier to make progress. Yet he was not in perfect health. A locksmith for 30 years, Goggia, 56, had a heart attack three months previously and did landscaping work as his health allowed.\nHe hadn\u2019t advanced very far before he was overcome by the choking fumes and collapsed to the ground. Vainly he tried to get up or get the attention of passing vehicles. At some point, his left eye was injured so severely that he was permanently blinded. Lying in a ditch at the side of the road, he thought he was going to die.\nFinally a truck stopped for him. \u201cHell yeah, you can get a ride,\u201d said the two men who crammed him into their truck among their belongings. Instead of aiming for safety, however, they turned towards the flames: one of the men wanted to save his tiny home, a residence the size of a garden shed that could be transported on a trailer.\nGoggia thought the man was out of his mind, and indeed, just as they reached the spot, the tiny home caught fire, and the man retreated.\nIt seemed like a fatal detour. The road out was now blocked by flames, and the driver seemed unsure what to do. His friend pulled him out of the front seat, but the car would not start. Flames coiled and flickered into the cab through the open windows, and the sides of the truck began to melt. The floorboard was so hot that they had to lift their feet. Goggia\u2019s leg nearest the door was severely burned, and he poured a bottle of water over himself to stop himself being cooked. The man in the back was trying to stomp and pat out fires that were igniting in the cab.\nFinally the engine caught. The driver jammed the accelerator, and they blasted through the wall of fire.\nIt took firefighters 17 days to bring the Camp fire under control, by which time it had destroyed 14,000 homes, including almost 90% of those in Paradise, according to city officials. Authorities have spent weeks sifting through the rubble for human remains.\nOf the 86 people who died in the fire, the overwhelming majority were found in Paradise. About 20 were found in the communities of Concow, Magalia and Butte Creek Canyon. Most were inside homes and other structures, and a smaller number were in cars.\nThe fire moved so quickly that it trapped the town\u2019s most vulnerable inhabitants \u2013 its senior citizens. Of the deceased identified so far by authorities, 46 were aged 65 or older.\nParadise resident Chellie Saleen, 56, had risen at 6am, went for a coffee with a friend and observed a pall of smoke. Returning home, she received an alert by phone, and \u201call of a sudden someone was banging on door \u2013 it was my neighbor saying, \u2018we gotta go now.\u2019\u201d She quickly changed out of her nightgown into jeans and a shirt and tried to call her 75-year-old mother, Joanne Caddy, who lived in Magalia, but couldn\u2019t get through.\nHer mother didn\u2019t drive and depended on her for everything from her shopping to her medication. Saleen threw a few things in the car and headed in her mother\u2019s direction through the abysmal traffic, but she was blocked by \u201ca wall of fire\u201d.\n\u201cShe was probably expecting me,\u201d Saleen said. She isn\u2019t sure how her mother, or her mother\u2019s two dogs, died. \u201cI hope she was just sedated and sleeping and didn\u2019t suffer.\u201d\nSaleen\u2019s own home was destroyed. She has no idea where she will go next. \u201cI feel alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI lived alone and took care of her.\u201d\nIn the year before the fire, Beverly Craig Powers, 64, a nurse, had posted on social media of her deep affection for Paradise. She and her partner, Robert Duvall, 76, loved to camp and fish.\nAccording to Kelci Craig, Powers\u2019 niece, Duvall was trying to move his fishing boat to safety when the flames overtook him. Perhaps he, like many residents, assumed that the fire would be like the others that had imperiled Paradise: a threat, but not life-threatening. His remains were found in the car, and remains have also been discovered in the couple\u2019s trailer, which the family assumes are Powers\u2019.\nPowers\u2019 own brother worked for decades as a firefighter with Cal Fire, the state\u2019s fire-protection agency, said Kelci Craig. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes me sick. He spends his whole life fighting fire then loses his sister in one of the deadliest.\u201d\nExperts are urging change in the wake of the fire. Prescribed burns should be implemented more widely to reduce the fuel load, they argue, and the wisdom of siting settlements amid forests and grasslands should be questioned. Yet for those trained to read it, future tragedies are already inscribed on the California landscape.\nEighteen years before she was a fire scientist at the University of Idaho, Crystal Kolden worked as a firefighter based in Placerville, about 85 miles south-east of Paradise.\nLast month, she drove from Idaho to southern California for Thanksgiving. It was like retracing earlier parts of her life, but the memory and the reality were jarringly discordant. Over 100m trees, mostly conifers, are estimated to have died in California in a five-year period of drought in the 2010s, and Kolden was \u201cblown away by how many dead pine trees we saw \u2013 alone, in clusters, all over the place\u201d, she said.\nOf greater concern, she also saw that oaks, a resilient species that dot even the driest hills in California, were suffering. \u201cWhen I fought fire, we didn\u2019t worry much about the oaks,\u201d she said. They are more moist and can slow fire. \u201cNow what I see is a continuous bed of 20 to 40ft-high oak and pine trees that is tinder dry and ready to burn.\u201d\nThe consequences for places like Paradise are clear. \u201cThe vegetation is responding very, very obviously to climate change extremes, and setting the stage for more disasters,\u201d Kolden said. \u201cParadise will not be the last town we lose.\u201d\nCraig Clements, who researches the weather associated with wildfires at San Jos\u00e9 State University, had a blunter assessment. \u201cThis whole place is going to burn down. Paradise is just one example.\u201d\nLittle remains of this understated utopia: the Starbucks; a gourmet pizza place; the occasional house, inexplicably still standing. Some hope the town can stage a comeback. The mayor, Jody Jones, for one, plans to rebuild her own home. But many Paradisians remain rootless: stuck in evacuation centers or scattered elsewhere.\nIn the heat of the moment, there was not always time to grab precious belongings. After waking at 3.30am, Susan Van Horn escaped with her \u201cgo-bag\u201d, some changes of clothing and utility bills. She considers herself lucky. A high-school teacher, Virginia Partain, only had time to pick up her students\u2019 draft college admission essays and a blanket. Retired teacher Suzanne Linebarger left with $30 of scallops she had purchased for dinner, a pair of mismatched shoes, and her swimming fins from a vacation to Mexico. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I grab my grandmother\u2019s mandolin worth hundreds of dollars?\u201d she wondered.\nWilliam Goggia got out with nothing but the clothes he was wearing. The fire left him with searing injuries: burns on his right leg and ear and a ruined eye. Even now, he cannot sleep without dreaming of the flames, and his sister is seeking donations for his care. Something else of his, however, did survive the destruction.\nA day after he escaped, and while the town was still cordoned off by officials, Goggia snuck back in. The extent of his injuries had not yet been recognized \u2013 he was in terrible pain, and would later be admitted to the hospital for almost two weeks. But he was determined. Below the crosses, there was his van, still intact. He opened the door to a miaow.\nPolice body camera footage courtesy of the Butte county sheriff\u2019s office\nEvacuation footage courtesy of Diana and Helmut Bredow", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/natural-disasters", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "A bucolic community was reduced to ash by a new kind of wildfire \u2013 the deadliest in California\u2019s history.

Earlier this year, the head of news, Fran Unsworth, told staff that the corporation had struggled with the topic: \u201cClimate change has been a difficult subject for the BBC, and we get coverage of it wrong too often.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cTo achieve impartiality, you do not need to include outright deniers of climate change in BBC coverage; in the same way you would not have someone denying that Manchester United won 2-0 last Saturday. The referee has spoken.\u201d\nThe BBC acknowledged it had received a letter from a \u201cnewly formed campaign group\u201d but did not comment on the demand for a meeting with the director general.\n\u201cThe BBC has a proud record of leading the way in sustainability in the media industry and we\u2019ve set out further action including cutting energy use further, eradicating single-use plastic and minimising the impact of necessary travel,\u201d said a spokesperson.\n\u201cIn the last charter period, we reduced our carbon footprint by a third.

And almost without exception, these winter wonderlands are hotting up.\nIn Sweden, festive tourists flock to Mora, which boasts a Santa headquarters known as Tomteland that follows local traditions dating back to the Viking era. But the effects of global warming are becoming harder to ignore.\nReindeers are becoming confused by unseasonal temperatures, according to the indigenous Sami. This spring, there were bad floods, and in summer, nearby woodland was destroyed by wildfires that swept through many areas in Sweden.\n\u201cI have consulted Mr Santa \u2013 or \u2018Tomten\u2019 which is his real Swedish name \u2013 and he is very concerned about climate change,\u201d Anders Ros\u00e9n, Mora\u2019s communications manager, told the Guardian. \u201cHe has a very strong message to the decision makers of the world: \u2018Please take climate change seriously and make decisions in order to save the planet.\u2019\u201c\u201d\nA more stable climate would also be better for business. Local ski slopes and cross-country tracks sometimes have to be kept in operation by artificial snow machines. A few years ago, there was no snow on 25 December but the temperature this week is \u201310C and there have been some falls in recent days so hopes are high that this year will deliver a white Christmas. \u201cEven without snow, we are very good at creating the right Christmas atmosphere,\u201d Ros\u00e9n said. \u201cThe tradition of Christmas is very strong in Sweden.\u201d\nThe Finnish city of Rovaniemireceives tens of thousands of letters to Santa from children around the world. Residents of the Lapland capital said the summer was freakishly hot and dry with temperatures above 30C for several weeks in a row. The winter snow arrived so late this year that tourist companies had to improvise with new activities for visitors, including hikes across lakes, where the ice is so crystal clear that fish can be seen near the bottom.\n\u201cThe lakes are normally covered in snow,\u201d said Sanna K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen, the managing director of Visit Rovaniemi. \u201cThe weather has changed for sure in the past three to five years. It used to be more stable but now it goes from long mild periods to sudden extreme cold.\u201d\nIn recent weeks, the weather has returned to something like its normal pattern and the population of the city \u2013 which triples each December with tourists from as far afield as Australia and the US \u2013 is once again living in a white landscape. Even so, the locals are worried. Every year, the character of Joulupukki (Old Man Christmas) delivers a festive message \u2013 and this year\u2019s was a call for action. \u201cOur friend nature has been in trouble for a while now and now we all can give one gift together: we can help nature. I wish you all a merry Christmas,\u201d he told one reporter.\nDr\u00f8bak \u2013 a Norwegian town 25 miles (40km) from Oslo \u2013 is home to another Santa Claus post office, as well as a year-round Christmas house. The local tourist manager claims to be the cousin of Santa Claus, who is said to live in the nearby island of H\u00e5\u00f8ya. Compared with other Christmas grottos, this is in a relatively southern location and so the climate is mild with only a 60%-70% chance of a white Christmas. When the seasonal lights were turned on at the start of Advent it was raining, but the snow has finally come.\nHans Petter Treider, a local author who has written a book about the life and history of Santa Claus, said Dr\u00f8bak was doing its bit to fight climate change with an electric ferry service to Santa\u2019s island and a promise to make the town centre car-free by 2030. \u201cWe have one earth, and we must take care of it,\u201d he said.\nThe Alaskan city of North Pole, which has its own Santa Claus house complete with a 42ft (13-metre) tall statue of the man in red, is in the middle of its second warmest winter on record. It was only last week that it finally registered freezing temperatures, a delay that one resident described as \u201cunheard of\u201d. Snow used to fall in October but, in recent years, people in the small city close to Fairbanks are more likely to see freezing rain. Last month, the US federal climate assessment said Alaska was warming faster than almost anywhere else in the world and that Alaskans would a hefty bill to pay as the population were forced to adapt.\nAlaskan senator Lisa Murkowski, however, is pushing for more oil drilling in the state. The Republican also seems to be looking at the melting Arctic as a business prospect.\n\u201cThere are very real opportunities for commerce in the Arctic region. I think Santa figured out that the shortest way to get around the globe was over the pole. He understood the geostrategic position of the Arctic,\u201d she recently tweeted.\nIn Canada, the government has previously granted Santa Claus citizenship rights and established a postal district H0H 0H0 (Ho Ho Ho!) to cover the territory where the old man dressed in the country\u2019s national colours is said to live. The environment ministry was reluctant to comment on a specific individual, but said the broader trends were apparent. \u201cThe ice-free area in the North Pole is getting larger and the ice that remains tends to be thinner, younger ice,\u201d wrote spokesperson Mark Johnson. \u201cThe Arctic has been warming more than twice as fast as the world as a whole for the past 50 years. The area and duration of snow cover continue to decrease in the Arctic. Over the past 15 years snow has melted from the land surface earlier in the spring (April, May, June) with a shallower snowpack\u201d. Although there has been warm spells over recent years, the weather this winter is expected to be seasonal.\nRepresentatives of several other Christmas themed regions including the towns of Santa Claus, Indiana, in the US, Uummannaq in Greenland, and Veliky Ustyug, the putative home of Russia\u2019s Ded Moroz (Father Frost), did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/sweden", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/finland", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/norway", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alaska", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Many towns claiming to be the birthplace of Santa Claus have seen unseasonal temperatures", "date_published": {"$date": 1545634820000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1545634820000}, "authors": ["Jonathan Watts"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Christmas", "Climate change", "Sweden", "Finland", "Europe", "Norway", "Alaska", "US news", "World news", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/24/father-christmass-winter-wonderland-homes-are-hotting-up", "og:description": "Many towns claiming to be the birthplace of Santa Claus have seen unseasonal temperatures", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2a57d5a5aabc5de56db4b05e9fb558c2f4ba86f/0_223_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=d5e71677967ec47a37108f1c41113b0a", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Father Christmas\u2019s winter wonderland homes are hotting up"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2a57d5a5aabc5de56db4b05e9fb558c2f4ba86f/0_223_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bfbe80bbd8311db0b0eac6512ecddfc0", "width": "4000", "height": "2400", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2a57d5a5aabc5de56db4b05e9fb558c2f4ba86f/0_223_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=37b61e330eaf4af581e7f42933f51bc8", "description": "Santa Claus village in Rovaniemi, Finland.\nPhotograph: Elena Petrova/Alamy"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54a354b3b386a97c010cf87f6f64ede32bfa4ed1/0_170_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ea95fa3e6ec2c0dbf75d5e00ee5267d8", "width": "3500", "height": "2101", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54a354b3b386a97c010cf87f6f64ede32bfa4ed1/0_170_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=17241e261d0e26a29ded91fcc3f73282", "description": "Santa poses for a picture at the Santa Claus Office located on the Arctic Circle near Rovaniemi.

The question of what to do about it, however, has become highly politicised. Scepticism about climate change is typically a conservative position and trust in the conclusions of the scientific community a more progressive one. While this politicisation is perhaps most evident in the United States, it is well known in many other countries.\nBut this wasn\u2019t always the case. Between 1972 and 1995, a US agency named the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) existed to provide the practical means to help overcome such politicisation. During its 23-year existence, the OTA was in a unique position to assist members of Congress in understanding complex issues in science and technology.\nThe OTA was a non-partisan agency governed by a technology assessment board which consisted of of equal numbers of senators and representatives and equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. Its assessments strove for objectivity and comprehensiveness, and were considered state-of-the-art documents by many. The OTA provided Congress, at its request, with the information and options it needed for the issues with which it was grappling, but it was careful never to tell Congress what it should do. The methodology that OTA used was widely admired and imitated in the parliamentary units that many European countries established following OTA\u2019s lead.\nIn the early 1990s there was still Congressional interest in taking action on climate change, which most of the scientific community already understood would become a major problem if not addressed. Thus, in October 1993, the OTA published a two-volume, 700-page report, Preparing for an Uncertain Climate, at the request of three Congressional committees. I was a principal author. The report identified more than 100 options to help coastal areas, water resource systems, agriculture, wetlands, forests, and federally protected natural areas adapt to climate change. Not only that, but the OTA had also proposed \u2013 in its comprehensive 1991 assessment, Changing by Degrees \u2013 steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that would help the US avoid climate change.\nImagine where we would be now if Congress had begun to address climate change at the time of these reports (and the early reports of other organisations, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).\nInstead, the OTA was abolished in 1995, shortly after Republicans retook control of Congress and Newt Gingrich became speaker of the House of Representatives. At the time, the OTA was one of the most respected agencies in Washington.\nMany reasons have been suggested for the move, but it mostly came down to a change in attitude towards the value of science and analysis in Congress. The OTA\u2019s abolition was the proverbial canary in the coalmine with respect to the current anti-science attitude among many conservatives in and out of Congress. Since the 1990s, the pace of technological change has continued to accelerate, but few in Congress have the scientific or technological background to understand the new developments.\nNow more than ever, the US Congress, as well as legislative bodies in other countries, need sources of unbiased and comprehensive information and analysis they can trust. When Democrats retake control of the House in 2019, they will have an opportunity to re-establish the OTA or an agency like it to assist Congress with complex science and technology issues. Ideally, this should be done by Democrats and their Republican colleagues together, so that technology assessment can once again be a bipartisan benefit to Congress.\nCongress has already scheduled two days of hearings in January 2019 to consider how to respond to a changing climate. It would be well served if it could turn to its in-house technology assessment office for advice. Congress might ask a reconstituted OTA, for example, to assess the costs and benefits of implementing the provisions of the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, a bipartisan bill which was recently introduced in both the US House and Senate.\nClimate change aside, the number of science and technology issues that may require legislative action continues to grow. A new OTA could also provide assistance, for example, on such issues as artificial intelligence, gene editing, cybersecurity, self-driving cars, alternative energy technologies, voting technologies, and dozens of other multifaceted issues that have, or should, come before Congress. These issues, of course, are of interest to countries other than the United States. The need for organisations in Europe and elsewhere that can provide impartial, non-partisan advice on the complicated science and technology issues of the day has never been greater.\nWe live in an age that seems at times to dismiss expertise, while the problems that require complex solutions grow ever greater. The OTA was an important source of clarity and understanding until it was abolished. Had we instead retained its valuable services, we could surely have reduced or avoided many of the very serious problems we now face.\nIn 2019, will the world prove able to heed this lesson?\n\u2022 William Westermeyer was a senior policy analyst for the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment from 1982-95 and a principal author of the 1993 report Preparing for an Uncertain Climate\n\n", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The US Office of Technology Assessment should be revived in 2019, says climate consultant William Westermeyer", "date_published": {"$date": 1545910301000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1546944508000}, "authors": ["William Westermeyer"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "US news", "Climate change", "US politics", "World news", "Environment", "Science", "Technology"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/27/1993-agency-climate-change-abolished-office-technology-assessment", "og:description": "The US Office of Technology Assessment should be revived in 2019, says climate consultant William Westermeyer", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e928981e529ec535f2ab0aed2fbd50f6379ad636/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=0c8e52bbd451e6987377de2ea3f28a84", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "In 1993 my agency warned of climate change.

Pessimism fuelled by fears that young people will be the first generation who find themselves worse off than their parents; that gaping regional inequalities are going to widen post-Brexit; that the world will be overtaken by catastrophic climate change; that we are on the brink of an overwhelming instability in the global order not seen since the cold war.\nThere are certainly reasons to be glum going into 2019. There is not only a growing sense that Britain will be at the mercy of powerful global forces it can do little about. Brexit looms on the horizon, a challenge entirely of our own making that threatens to ensure there is next to no political capacity left for anything else.\nBut the fug of pessimism too easily distracts us from the eminently solvable nature of many of the challenges Britain faces. All it would take is political leadership, courage and ambition. Here are five ideas within the grasp of any government determined to make Britain a kinder, greener, more equitable place to live in the 2020s.\nOur stretched lifespans are an incredible marker of human progress; a just cause for celebration. But not only are we living longer, we are living longer with frightening and debilitating conditions such as dementia that erode our mental as well as physical capacities. Yet as a society, we have given barely a thought to how we care for older people towards the end of their lives in a way that supports them to live fulfilling, rich lives rather than manages physical decline.\nThis will require profound shifts in how we think about care. But it should begin with a radical reform of entitlements in older age. It is ludicrous and ageist that someone diagnosed with cancer gets free care, whereas most people diagnosed with dementia have to fund their own care. The government should phase in free personal care, funded through progressive taxation. We must also reimagine caring as a high-skill profession, which should start with the government, the biggest buyer of care services, setting higher pay for carers.\nJust as inventions such as the washing machine have transformed labour markets of the past, so automation and artificial intelligence will continue to transform the labour market of today. We should be wary of dystopian predictions of the end of work; past waves of technological progress have created new jobs to replace the ones displaced. But technology will transform the nature of work, leaving some without the skills they need to adapt, and, left unfettered, will increase inequality.\nThere has been insufficient thinking about how to improve the quality of work today, let alone in the future. We need to prepare by reforming post-18 education funding so that all young people get the sizable state subsidy that those who go to university do, regardless of which route they pick, and by setting up a reskilling fund to offer one-off grants to those who lose their jobs to automation. Unions should be offered new powers contingent on them diversifying their memberships, currently dominated by older, professional, better-paid workers.\nClimate change poses an increasingly existential threat to mankind and the time available to stave off catastrophic levels of warming is running out. The government must do more to advocate for global net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and set out a plan for the UK to produce net-zero carbon emissions before 2050, including bringing forwards the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars to 2030.\nAlways-on technology is changing the way we live our lives, from the way we consume news, interact with friends and buy things. But technology has evolved far faster than government\u2019s willingness to regulate. The government should introduce greater restrictions on the way monolithic tech companies operate. Potential options include establishing a legal \u201cduty of care\u201d towards their users to tackle online abuse, obliging providers to publish the algorithms that determine what people see in their feeds and increasing the digital services tax that will be levied on the UK revenue of large tech companies from 2020.\nOur majoritarian, two-party system is struggling to cope with a freshly multidimensional political spectrum, in which Brexit has riven both main parties. The quality of political debate has degraded as politicians from both the fringe and the mainstream have grasped at the easy appeal of populism: blaming scapegoats and telling people there are no tough trade-offs.\nThere may be little appetite for the type of institutional reform, such as a more proportional voting system, that the Observer has long supported. But we urgently need to update electoral law for the 21st century, for example by bringing social media campaign spending within national caps and exploring ways to encourage consensus-building and informed debate into our politics, for example through the citizens\u2019 assemblies used in the Irish Republic to empower people to deliberate and issue recommendations on key issues such as abortion.\nThe country indeed faces big societal, technological and climate-related challenges going into 2019. But their scale is far from unprecedented. With political leadership and spirit of the sort we saw in the late 1940s, it\u2019s within the grasp of our leaders to ensure Britain can face the future with optimism.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/science/ageing", "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/editorials"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Five ideas within the grasp of any government to make the country a better, fairer place", "date_published": {"$date": 1546149613000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1546179325000}, "authors": ["Observer editorial"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Politics", "UK news", "Ageing", "Brexit", "European Union", "Climate change", "Artificial intelligence (AI)"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/30/observer-blueprint-for-a-better-britain-in-2019", "og:description": "Five ideas within the grasp of any government to make the country a better, fairer place", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c50413b993ec37cc77cda884c36306f7b1582b02/0_34_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=6bf554dda577699b65ca215350ae59d7", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "The Observer\u2019s blueprint for a better Britain in 2019 | Observer editorial"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c50413b993ec37cc77cda884c36306f7b1582b02/0_34_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=29d35187013004a4639881c9b776aae4", "width": "6720", "height": "4032", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c50413b993ec37cc77cda884c36306f7b1582b02/0_34_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=302ba18fcf813e53e5c248ce275e5ed2", "description": "A homeless man begging on Shaftesbury Avenue, London.\nPhotograph: Antonio Olmos for the Observer"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556125246756}, "comments": [{"id": "124216779", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1546378090000}, "author": "TransWorldSocialist", "author_id": "100693009", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\u201cUnions should be offered new powers contingent on them diversifying their memberships, currently dominated by older, professional, better-paid workers.\u201d\nThis will just lead to another blairite thirdway piecemeal of neoliberalism. 40 years of attacks and still the social democrats want to enforce division and thereby destroy Unions.", "recommendation_count": "1", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "this", "effect": "another blairite thirdway piecemeal of neoliberalism"}]}, {"id": "124216759", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1546378027000}, "author": "rikkitavi889", "author_id": "16465677", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "You're right.

It seems we are headed for the hardest of brexit, so no transition period, so the Tories \"emergency\" hard brexit plans come into effect. If they are handled with expertise and panache of the rest of the negotiations, we can expect another virtuoso display of crass bungling. We may be faced with food shortages, medicine shortages, serious difficulties with travel, blocked motorways, and animals having to be slaughtered in overheated lorries on blocked motorways. No doubt the railways will go on strike at the same time. Then there will be problems with the new blue passports. So obvious barriers to trade. However if Parliament endorses May's weakminded proposal, there will be no trade deal with Trump and Britain will have no trading partners for quite a long time. And if Corbyn is in No.10, the whole fucking process of the last two years has to start again, only to reach an equally unsatisfactory state of affairs. There is no way out. Tim Martin wants BoJo as PM. His wish may yet be granted. May said yesterday, she would now fight for remainers!! Once we are out of the EU, there is no point in fighting for remainers. Her cynically hypocritical claim to fight for remainers is merely a ploy to persuade remainer Mps who don't like her \"agreement\" to vote for it. When this whole shameful brexit episode has been finally consigned to history (probably in about fifty years) will it be possible to create political parties clean of brexit filth.

Thanks Labour, the working classes needed you guys like a hole in the head! Were we really held in such contempt?? To me the answer is YES ABSOLUTELY! As stated hundreds of thousands lost their jobs and Labour just stood by and watched. They had been in power for over ten years so they knew the score, its not like they were just finding their feet.

As do some of yours, like the Saxe-Coburgs, the Battenbergs, the Hannoverians (with a proper double -nn-).\nAs to population density: Why do you cram them all into a few conurbations? There are absolutely desolate places in England, Wales, and in Scotland, where you may find yourself lucky to find accommodation within a circumference of ten miles.\nAs to immigration: It is, of course, the inborn right of any freeborn Briton to roam the world and to settle North America, Downunder and New Zealand, South Africa. O send a couple of million where the sun shines in Spain and France. But woe if the chickens come home to roost.\nYour gridlocked roads? Learn building railways. And proper bus and coach systems. Your polluted air? Apply clean air standards to heating and transport. Learn to cycle. I do, and have done for sixty-five years. And NHS creaking a the seams? Under-investment, austerity. Hostile environment for foreign doctors and nursing staff who are leaving in droves. Overcrowded classrooms? Ask teachers why they are leaving the profession.\nYours is the epitome of self-pity and rabid (your term) plaintiveness.

Solidarity\nIt used to mean something good. In solidarity we run to help someone in need. \nThese days, solidarity means something between being brainwashed (as social democracy of Sweden and Norway that must be half communist) and economically stupid, because economical and social theory has still not separated itself from the misunderstanding of the scientific understanding of evolution with \"survival of the fittest\". \nI do see media report \"Circus Trump and Brexit\".

Showing us amazing things in a very well orchestrated fashion. A Circus or Tivoli cost a lot. It was special. Made up by people who had trained all their lives to amaze us. And entertain us. And make us all clap and cheer. \nThe \"circus\" media gives us nonstop without any fee or any of us pay for is amateurs with the legacy to determine our future way more serious than the \"wise woman\" who told me I would have 5 kids as adult back in 1978. That wise woman was fun. \nThe politic \"circus\" at present exists only because media do not dare to write that the political system is failing. \nWe are so off-piste that it is reported that \"good news of 2018\" is that micro-plastics get some attention. This is how crazy it is. While Putin is indicating that the cold war is on again and having a ball proclaiming that UK should leave Europe and clapping his hands while Trump is impromptu doing whatever the leader of the free world is not supposed to do every day. \nThe world needs a reality check. \nAnd every time the world have acted with solidarity is after a world war. We westerners do now show much solidarity to \"regional\" conflicts that we bomb for a decade. \nThe western culture is now in complete \"me first\" mode. \nI miss the circus attitude of the old. Rip people off - but make it worth it. \nPersonally i look forward to see Avengers in 2019.

And to an extent you can understand it \u2013 after all, they did win it. But this week the prime minister adopted a rather more bizarre strategy of trying to win the next election by fighting the 2007 election over again. It is about as likely to result in victory for Scott Morrison as it did the first time round for John Howard.\nIn Monday\u2019s question time, the Morrison was at his shouty worst. Coming off the Victorian state election drubbing, the government MPs were hardly in a jocular mood and yet, oddly, Morrison decided to attack the opposition by invoking one of the more infamous jocular moments in Australian politics.\nAfter railing at the ALP benchers for being \u201cvery cocky\u201d he suggested that there was a warning ahead for voters, and it came in the form of Peter Garrett.\nYes, a man who left parliament five years ago.\nThe prime minister cast his mind back to 2007. The ALP were leading in the polls and Garrett had a conversation with Steve Price in Melbourne airport, in which in response to Price\u2019s suggestion that it was \u201cturning into the \u2018me too\u2019 election campaign\u201d, Garrett replied, \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that. Once we get in we will change all that.\u201d\nGarrett later told the media that he was not serious and that it was just \u201ca casual conversation, jocular in manner.\u201d\nOn Monday Morrison took us back to that time, telling parliament \u201cI\u2019ll never forget what Peter Garrett said back before the 2007 election. We all remember it. While they were all trying to pretend there wouldn\u2019t be anything dramatic, that they would just be John Howard-lite if Kevin Rudd were elected, Peter Garrett let the cat out of the bag when he said, \u2018We\u2019ll change it all.\u2019 That\u2019s what the leader of the opposition\u2019s plan is. That\u2019s what the Labor party\u2019s plan is. They want to change it all\u201d.\nSuch history lessons are always quite fun, if only to recall that \u201cme too\u201d now has a very different meaning from the one ascribed to the Rudd strategy of being Howard-lite.\nYet, ironically, \u201cme too\u201d remains part of this election campaign \u2013 except now in its current meaning. The greater empowerment women feel, and their utter lack of patience with being told by those in power that changes take time, has meant the position of parties on gender issues is now a strong player in how people vote.\nThe worry is that the ALP\u2019s big talk of change will become, once in government, a repetition of the same\nAnd the Liberal party knows it \u2013 Kelly O\u2019Dwyer was reported to have told colleagues this week that voters saw the party as \u201chomophobic, anti-women, climate-change deniers\u201d.\nGee, I wonder why?\nThis week in the Senate, the LNPs Barry O\u2019Sullivan said of Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young that she had \u201ca bit of Nick Xenophon in her\u201d and his fellow senator Ian MacDonald responded to Greens senator Larissa Waters wearing a pair of earrings that said \u201cStop Adani\u201d by asking the Senate if he could wear his \u201ccoal hi-vis jacket\u201d.\nAnd then of course there was the minister for resources, Matthew Canavan, who responded to the news that the Adani coalmine would begin construction (albeit on a much smaller scale than previously proposed) by tweeting reference to the bushfires in central Queensland caused by extreme heat conditions and referring to Adani as a \u201clittle Aussie battler\u201d.\nThe problem with Morrison\u2019s reference to the 2007 campaign is that there are a number of things the same, but also much that is different, and none helps the government.\nBack then the Liberal party sought to engage in fear and also hoped that budget surpluses would be enough to have people overlook other economic concerns such as industrial relations. It didn\u2019t work.\nNow we again see the Liberal party clinging to the budget surplus as the ultimate aim of any government. The prime minister this week announced the date of next year\u2019s budget and that it would be in surplus. He and the party hopes this will be enough to counter any concerns about flat real wages growth over the past four years. Thus far the polls suggest it is not working.\nThe big difference is that in 2007 the presumed fear was that the ALP would get in and change everything; now the real fear is that it won\u2019t.\nMorrison suggesting that if the Labor gets in it\u2019ll change everything is actually a free ad for the ALP. The worry is that Labor\u2019s big talk of change will become, once in government, a repetition of the same.\nFor example, Labor\u2019s energy policy is basically a resurrection of the Liberal party\u2019s national energy guarantee \u2013 albeit with much greater emissions reduction targets. As Katharine Murphy has rightly noted, so damaged has climate change policy become in this country that the reformed Neg is probably a smart ploy. But all the same, it is hardly the bold policy that is needed.\nOn Friday the latest greenhouse gas emissions targets were released. And, once again, total emissions (excluding land use, land use change and forestry) rose, the annual level of greenhouse gas emissions jumping 0.6% - the biggest quarterly jump in over 13 years.\n2007 was also an election that featured climate change \u2013 indeed, it was an issue that severely wounded the government, as under Howard the Liberal party was lost in a haze of denialism and wilfully ignorant intransigence.\nOnce again climate change politics is back in a big way. The extreme temperatures and early start to the bushfire season have placed the LNP\u2019s policy shambles on the issue in the spotlight.\nThe demonstrations by school students this week is the work of a generation holding their elders in rightful contempt. Their voting parents may not have also taken to the streets, but the Victorian election showed they have had enough of the LNP\u2019s inability to even come up with a plausible energy policy that deals with climate change.\nThe 2007 election was one where the economy was growing well and the budget was in surplus, and yet the government was caught out on issues of workplace relations and climate change and was seen to be out of touch with the way the times were headed.\nIt is not an election that members of this government should wish to recall. And if Morrison believes the best tactic is to make people afraid the ALP will change it all once they get in, then he might as well give Bill Shorten the keys to the Lodge right now.\nNot only do voters not want Shorten to be Morrison-lite; the problem for the government is they don\u2019t particularly want Morrison and what his party stands for either.\n\u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/energy-australia", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The PM\u2019s suggestion Labor would change everything is a free ad for the opposition \u2013 because change is what voters want", "date_published": {"$date": 1543698015000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1543715839000}, "authors": ["Greg Jericho"], "article_section": "Business", "article_tags": ["Scott Morrison", "Labor party", "Coalition", "Australia news", "Australian politics", "Climate change", "Energy", "Climate change", "Liberal party", "Bill Shorten", "Australian economy"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/dec/02/scott-morrison-is-fighting-the-2007-election-again-it-can-only-backfire", "og:description": "The PM\u2019s suggestion Labor would change everything is a free ad for the opposition \u2013 because change is what voters want", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b556728ec519c1c31716210f7471ce1ab30f470c/0_0_4565_2740/master/4565.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=f37029e306c844467bc4af4679ecbcba", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Scott Morrison is fighting the 2007 election again.

Take your statement: \"When the GFC hit, mining was one of the first industries to do mass lay offs.\" You are either ignorant of the facts (excusable) or want to believe something that is not true just because it suits your politics (self-deception). I work in the heart of the mining industry and the \"boom\" in new investment continued a good 3.5 to 4 years beyond 2008. That is a demonstrable fact, not an opinion. Mass layoffs, as you call them, did not really happen. Capital projects wound down and all of those boiler makers who had been FIFOing to the Pilbara for $250k a year went back to \"normal\" jobs at normal wages. The only sector where layoffs and closures occurred in any size was was coal, and that is now returning to full strength. The construction phase of the cycle has led to the position we are in now where commodity production is substantially more than a decade ago. And here's another you should think about: \"It was acknowledged across the world that Labor's stimulus was the most effective at countering the GFC.\" . Handing out free money so everyone can either buy a flat screen television (made in China) or pay a bit off their mortgage is hardly an economic strategy. Rudd and Swan took the easy route - guarantee the banks and give the people free money. The real strength was in the debt free structure of Australia's accounts, the nature of Australian mortgages which discourages people \"handing back the keys\", and the fact that the banks were not permitted (at the time) to engage in the complex CDOs and the like which did so much damage in the US.Facts, Grey, do not care about feelings or opinions.", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "123250489", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "just it suits your politics", "effect": "to believe something that is not true"}, {"cause": "the construction phase of the cycle", "effect": "the position we are in now where commodity production is substantially more than a decade ago"}]}, {"id": "123251474", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1543801981000}, "author": "Siameez", "author_id": "15089262", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Adani a \"little Aussie battler\"?

The study rates 24 of the world\u2019s biggest insurers on their efforts to distance themselves from the fossil fuel industry.\nA growing number of insurers are taking action, faced with mounting losses from disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires, whose frequency and severity has increased due to a warming climate. Global losses reached $337bn last year, including insured losses of $144bn.\nThe report found that Europe\u2019s four biggest insurers have restricted insurance for coal. Germany\u2019s Allianz and Italy\u2019s Generali limited underwriting this year, while French firm Axa tightened its policy further.\nA third of the global reinsurance market has also restricted cover for coal, with the reinsurance firms Swiss Re and Munich Re limiting their underwriting this year.\nUK insurers, though, have made less progress than European firms. Lloyd\u2019s of London, the world\u2019s oldest insurance market, has done nothing to encourage its syndicates to stop insuring coal or sell their coal investments, the report said, although it excluded coal from the investment strategy for its own central fund in April.\nLloyd\u2019s said: \u201cThe Lloyd\u2019s market is made up of more than 50 insurance companies that run almost 100 syndicates between them. These insurance companies each have their own investment policies. It is not the corporation\u2019s role to set investment strategy for the market, although we think that by showing leadership in this area, others in the Lloyd\u2019s market and wider insurance sector will be encouraged to follow.\u201d\nAviva and Legal &amp; General are focused on engaging with coal companies to create change, and only sell their coal holdings in exceptional circumstances. Neither provides insurance to coal companies, but Aviva is one of the top investors in the Polish coal industry, whose plans to build more than 7 gigawatts of new coal power are inconsistent with the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change, according to Unfriend Coal.\nUnfriend Coal\u2019s campaign coordinator, Lucie Pinson, said trying to engage with coal companies was \u201ca waste of time\u201d and that cutting financial ties with them was the only way forward.\nAcross the Atlantic, none of the nine leading US insurers have taken any action. In Japan, there are the first signs of change, as three large life insurers \u2013 Nippon Life, Dai-ichi Life and Meiji Yasuda Life \u2013 have announced they will no longer fund new coal projects.\nGlobally, Allianz is the only company that has pledged to cut its financial ties with coal companies completely by 2040, by stopping both underwriting and insuring in coal. \nThe UK insurance broker Willis Towers Watson warned in September that \u201cfinding alternative sources [of coal insurance] is likely to become increasingly challenging \u2013 especially if North American insurers begin to follow the European lead\u201d.\nThe Unfriend Coal report is being presented to insurers at an insurance and climate risk conference in London, and as the UN climate change conference gets under way in Poland on Monday.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/business/insurance", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/energy-industry"], "share_count": "0", "description": "European firms are making faster progress in refusing to insure polluting firms, says campaign group Unfriend Coal", "date_published": {"$date": 1543816814000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1543816814000}, "authors": ["Julia Kollewe"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Fossil fuel divestment", "Insurance industry", "Coal", "Climate change", "Fossil fuels", "Energy", "Environment", "Energy industry", "Business", "Lloyd's", "Aviva", "Axa", "Legal and General"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/03/insurers-in-uk-and-us-lagging-behind-in-divesting-from-coal-report-finds", "og:description": "European firms are making faster progress in refusing to insure polluting firms, says campaign group Unfriend Coal", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a70c9e780a591e810381d85d89b48e63526e8871/0_256_4016_2410/master/4016.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=29cb781711a37c226d5f2ea9baaaedaf", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Insurers in UK and US lagging behind in divesting from coal, report finds"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a70c9e780a591e810381d85d89b48e63526e8871/0_256_4016_2410/master/4016.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ec0f23d3062a92710304b796ee2b168c", "width": "4016", "height": "2410", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a70c9e780a591e810381d85d89b48e63526e8871/0_256_4016_2410/master/4016.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5aa1090f67c62085178a1cd69c3b7593", "description": "Chelyuskintsev mine, Donetsk, Ukraine.

Children frolic in the water. Palm trees sway in the ocean breeze. Chickens run between thatched huts as fishing nets hang by the beach, ready for the next outing. It feels like very little has ever changed here.\nYet this tranquillity belies the enormity of the change ahead. Few countries are more vulnerable to climate change than Madagascar, the location of which \u2013 in the Indian Ocean, off the south-east coast of Africa \u2013 leaves it hugely exposed. The island nation\u2019s pervasive poverty and lack of economic development also severely restrict its capacity to adapt to climatic shifts.\nBroadly speaking, the main changes experienced by Madagascar will be rising temperatures, extended drought periods, as seen in the south, greater variability in rainfall, the intensification of cyclones \u2013 cyclone Enawo, in 2017, was the most destructive in 13 years \u2013 and rising sea levels and sea temperatures.\nIn Kivalo, much of this is already familiar. \u201cThe southern wind used to start in January and last until June or July,\u201d says Bikison Thomas, a local fisherman. \u201cBut it\u2019s still going now [ in November].\u201d\nOn very windy days, fishermen cannot go out to sea. \u201cThere is also more fog, which makes it difficult to leave early in the morning,\u201dsays Thomas.\nOther factors are also contributing to reduced catches, not least overfishing and the loss of mangrove, a crucial habitat for the regeneration of fish stocks.\nFurther down the coast, in the city of Morondava, hotels and restaurants in the seaside neighbourhood of Nosy Kely are grappling with another effect of climate change: sea-level rise. Two years ago, Chayune Badouraly bought a hotel there, the Coco Beach: it had a few bungalows and a lovely beach. Badouraly then built a new building with bedrooms, a reception and a restaurant. But in September, during the powerful equinox tides, the sea destroyed two of his five bungalows. The water level has not returned to its original level since.\n\u201cWe used to have 150m of beach, now it\u2019s minus five,\u201d he says, bitterly. \u201cI knew we had coastal erosion problems, but I didn\u2019t think it would be that bad. I would never have bought.\u201d\nThe government of Madagascar is well aware of the country\u2019s vulnerability. It has ratified the Paris climate agreement and climate change is listed in every major policy document. Budget allocations usually fall short, however, says Jane Razanamiharisoa, director of adaptation at the National Bureau for the Coordination of Climate Change. \u201cAs part of the consultation for the national adaptation plan, we have lobbied about the importance of getting the ministry of planning and budget involved, so that decision-makers can factor climate change in the budget,\u201d says Razanamiharisoa.\nThe government is also piloting adaptation projects in key sectors, but Razanamiharisoa believes that, for Madagascar to boost its resilience, climate change must become embedded in policy \u201cin every sector, and at every level: national, regional and local\u201d.\nAlthough there are plans to build sea defences in Morondava, Badouraly says it could take months, even years for anything to materialise. Since September, the sea now laps right up against the new buildings, so he\u2019s taken the problem into his own hands by building a 60-metre long sea defence wall from stone blocks, steel rods and sand bags. \u201cEverything we earn goes there,\u201d says Reza Vally, Coco Beach\u2019s manager.\nIn Kivalo, WWF is piloting the development of beekeeping and ecotourism. The initiatives offer alternative revenues to fishing and protect the mangrove by making it the cornerstone of the new activities. The organisation estimates that 80% of mangrove destruction in the area is due to human factors, and 20% to climate change; rising sea level and less rainfall means increased salinity levels and more silting in mangrove areas.\n\u201cThere is nothing we can do about [climate change factors], but we can work on the human factors,\u201d says Eli Todimanana, capacity building offer at WWF Madagascar.\nDespite the new activities being far removed from anything they had ever done, the villagers have embraced the opportunity. The village now has 12 hives, kept in a secure enclosure, and they have had two honey harvests over the past year.\nSince different species of mangrove trees flower at different times of the year, Todimanana says they could have up to four harvests a year once they master the art of beekeeping. \u201cCan you imagine? Fishermen converted to beekeepers, that\u2019s quite something,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have tough lives: they leave at 4am to fish, come back by midday; then they must look after their nets. It\u2019s quite hard to fit in other activities.\u201d\nThe village has also started receiving tourists, making the best of its postcard location. There are pirogue tours, crab-fishing excursions in the mangrove and meals cooked by local women. WWF has provided training and technical support throughout.\nJustin Rakotomanahira, a local fisherman and president of Kivalo\u2019s village association, says the new activities have been like a window to the world: \u201cIt\u2019s allowed us to meet new people and learn new skills, which we\u2019ll be able to pass on to our children. Fishing is our life but, given the current pressures, this move [to other activities] is really important.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/madagascar", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "In Kivalo, where cyclones, overfishing and rising seas threaten livelihoods, beekeeping offers an unlikely alternative to fishing", "date_published": {"$date": 1543820416000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1543854477000}, "authors": ["Emilie Filou"], "article_section": "Global development", "article_tags": ["Global development", "Climate change", "Madagascar", "Environment", "World news", "Africa"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/dec/03/climate-adaptation-fishermen-madagascar-beekeeping-kivalo-wwf", "og:description": "In Kivalo, where cyclones, overfishing and rising seas threaten livelihoods, beekeeping offers an unlikely alternative to fishing", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94dce8aa088a543d13678545d34ffb93c5549807/0_120_3602_2161/master/3602.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=2491ae212568fcd34452618247fea123", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Climate adaptation proves the bee's knees for fishermen in Madagascar"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94dce8aa088a543d13678545d34ffb93c5549807/0_120_3602_2161/master/3602.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9fb3c366abb045f4d845d5b0e3ddad8e", "width": "3602", "height": "2161", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94dce8aa088a543d13678545d34ffb93c5549807/0_120_3602_2161/master/3602.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ffe674c733d959540d4b727ae6199729", "description": "Honeybee harvesting pollen.

They want you, the decision-makers, to act now. Leaders of the world, you must lead.

Climate action must be increased fivefold to limit warming to the 1.5C scientists advise, according to the UN.\nThe COP24 summit was also addressed by Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general. \u201cClimate change is running faster than we are and we must catch up sooner rather than later before it is too late,\u201d he said. \u201cFor many, people, regions and even countries this is already a matter of life or death.\u201d\nGuterres said the two-week summit was the most important since Paris and that it must deliver firm funding commitments. \u201cWe have a collective responsibility to invest in averting global climate chaos,\u201d he said.\nHe highlighted the opportunities of the green economy: \u201cClimate action offers a compelling path to transform our world for the better. Governments and investors need to bet on the green economy, not the grey.\u201d\nAndrzej Duda, the president of Poland, spoke at the opening ceremony, saying the use of \u201cefficient\u201d coal technology was not contradictory to taking climate action. Poland generates 80% of its electricity from coal but has cut its carbon emissions by 30% since 1988 through better energy efficiency.\nFriends of the Earth International said the sponsorship of the summit by a Polish coal company \u201craises the middle finger to the climate\u201d.\nA major goal for the Polish government at the summit is to promote a \u201cjust transition\u201d for workers in fossil fuel industries into other jobs. \u201cSafeguarding and creating sustainable employment and decent work are crucial to ensure public support for long-term emission reductions,\u201d says a declaration that may be adopted at the summit and is supported by the EU.\nIn the run-up to the summit, Donald Trump expressed denial about climate change, while there were attacks on the UN process from Brazil\u2019s incoming administration under Jair Bolsonaro.\nRicardo Navarro, of Friends of the Earth in El Salvador, said: \u201cWe must build an alternative future based on a just energy transformation. We face the threat of rightwing populist and climate-denying leaders further undermining climate protection and racing to exploit fossil fuels. We must resist.\u201d\nAnother goal of the summit is for nations to increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions; currently they are on target for a disastrous 3C of warming. The prime minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, who led the 2017 UN climate summit, said his country had raised its ambitions. He told the summit: \u201cIf we can do it, you can do it.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/david-attenborough", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Naturalist tells leaders at UN climate summit that fate of world is in their hands", "date_published": {"$date": 1543840196000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1543869601000}, "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Climate change", "Environment", "David Attenborough", "United Nations", "Science", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/03/david-attenborough-collapse-civilisation-on-horizon-un-climate-summit", "og:description": "Naturalist tells leaders at UN climate summit that fate of world is in their hands", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48c055e8b78852460ac73b8892a83376a6d6901a/2033_1585_1304_782/master/1304.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=e6121352448fee510ad875b091ebe220", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "David Attenborough: collapse of civilisation is on the horizon"}, "headline": "l"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07d5ca2c3613145ed8e15"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/dec/03/a-billion-people-without-electricity-missing-out-on-pledged-funds-un-climate-summit-poland", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "The world\u2019s 1 billion people who live without electricity are not benefiting from climate change money promised by governments to help them develop.\nIn theory, there has never been a better time for developing countries to install renewable energy such as solar or wind to combat climate change. The UN\u2019s Green Climate Fund (GCF), along with the World Bank and regional development banks, have all said they intend to significantly increase their green energy financing, offering developing countries cheap loans and grants. Many donor countries like Britain and Japan have also pledged to help poorer nations switch to clean energy.\nBut as diplomats and organisations from 190 countries will hear this week at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, the reality is that the public money available is not nearly enough to meet their needs. Existing funds will not provide clean electricity for people who live beyond grids.\nThe GCF, set up in 2010 to handle the money countries pledged to help the world adapt to climate change, is the great new hope for developing countries. But it has had a slow and torrid start, with rich countries backsliding on their pledges to fund it and poor countries bitterly complaining that international banks control the funds for their own profit. Last year Donald Trump cancelled $2bn (\u00a31.57bn) of the $3bn promised to the GCF by former president Barack Obama. More recently, Australia has chosen not to contribute.\n\u201cWe now have 93 projects, worth $4.6bn. Thirty-nine projects, worth $1.6bn in GCF resources, are under implementation, and we expect to have disbursed around $483m by the end of the year,\u201d said Simon Wilson, head of communication in the external affairs division of the Korea-based operation.\nWilson says more than 40% of the GCF\u2019s projects are micro- or small-scale investments of under $250,000. \u201cDemand for climate finance already exceeds supply, and disbursement of funds for energy projects is expected to pick up quickly over the next few years,\u201d he said.\nBut Neha Rai, senior researcher at London-based International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), said little international climate money is funding decentralised, or off-grid, energy.\n\u201cOf the $14bn approved so far for climate finance worldwide, about 40%, or $5.6bn, has been marked for energy projects. But only 3% ($475m) has been allocated for decentralised energy. That is the equivalent of just $51m a year,\u201d she says.\nInstead of accessing public funds from governments, developing countries must turn to commercial banks. But these, motivated by profit, are loth to provide money to what they consider risky projects.\n\u201cFor a [clean energy] proposal to be accepted by a bank, it needs hard data and a wealth of detail,\u201d says Nathan Rive, a climate change specialist with the Asian Development Bank. \u201cHowever, in many developing countries data on energy and emissions is sparse, unavailable or unreliable, making detailed project-specific climate assessments difficult.\u201d\nThe resulting bias toward more developed countries is stark. Of the roughly $333bn estimated by financial research group Bloomberg New Energy Finance to have been invested worldwide in renewable energy in 2017, nearly $280bn went to China, the US, Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia.\nA handful of middle-income countries like Mexico and South Korea, India, Brazil and Egypt absorbed a further $28bn. The remaining countries attracted only about $25bn between them, despite having most of the people currently without electricity.\nIronically, climate change may be making it even harder for developing countries to raise money for renewable energy projects. Particularly vulnerable ones, such as Bangladesh and small island states, must pay more to borrow because climate change is regarded by banks as an extra financial risk, according to a new UN Environment Programme\u2013backed study.\nResearchers who examined the financial data of 48 countries, including Bangladesh, Guatemala, Kenya and Vietnam, found that vulnerable countries have had to pay an extra $62bn for capital over the past 10 years.\n\u201cClimate vulnerability has already raised the average cost of borrowing to developing countries through higher interest rates. We expect the additional interest payments attributable to climate vulnerability to increase to between $146bn and $188bn over the next decade,\u201d says Charles Donovan, director of the Centre for Climate Finance at Imperial College Business School.\nConsultants working with ministers and banks to raise clean energy finance say the world\u2019s 47 least developed countries and the 39 small island developing states are barely on the financial map for clean energy.\n\u201cThere are major challenges in reaching least developed countries and small island developing states, due to a lack of sophisticated capital. As a result of this \u2026 renewable energy projects tend to be located in middle-income countries,\u201d said Virginie Fayolle, a senior economist who leads climate finance at Acclimatise, a London-based consultancy which advises developing countries on how to access climate finance.\nDeveloping countries require a higher level of investment in infrastructure, such as small-scale, off-grid and decentralised projects, to reach more remote populations, said Ming Yang, a senior climate change specialist at the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which has provided a significant amount of money for small-scale electrification.\nBetween October 1991 and August 2017, the GEF granted $1.19bn to 254 renewable energy projects. Of these, 43% are micro-grids, mini-grids or decentralised, said Yang.\n\u201cThe problem is not that there is not enough money. It is lack of political will. There is definitely institutional bias against poor countries when it comes to sustainable energy,\u201d said Lidy Nacpil, coordinator of the Asian Peoples\u2019 Movement on Debt and Development.\n\u201cWe see renewable energy as a public good and say that governments and international financial institutions should use public funds to take the lead in developing democratic renewable energy systems,\u201d she said.\nA version of this article was published by Ensia", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/sustainable-development", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "UN climate summit in Poland will hear public money available is not enough to provide clean energy for those living off-grid", "date_published": {"$date": 1543842238000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1543842346000}, "authors": ["John Vidal"], "article_section": "Global development", "article_tags": ["Environmental sustainability", "Global development", "Environment", "Sustainable development", "Climate change", "Renewable energy", "Energy", "United Nations", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/dec/03/a-billion-people-without-electricity-missing-out-on-pledged-funds-un-climate-summit-poland", "og:description": "UN climate summit in Poland will hear public money available is not enough to provide clean energy for those living off-grid", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de1d2391f5fdb791ffb816f9a30581a030e7d7c0/0_0_5088_3053/master/5088.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=c381c673906465ea7260d47fa16f2135", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "A billion people without electricity \u2018missing out on pledged climate funds\u2019"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de1d2391f5fdb791ffb816f9a30581a030e7d7c0/0_0_5088_3053/master/5088.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ff8f26f2c6f3f35d1b7039606004aff5", "width": "5088", "height": "3053", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de1d2391f5fdb791ffb816f9a30581a030e7d7c0/0_0_5088_3053/master/5088.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=853fed3a9db8f77b7e50fc35af4897e7", "description": "Palestinian children do their homework during a power cut in an impoverished part of Gaza City.\nPhotograph: Mahmud Hams/AFP/Getty Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc9ba4522bfd5ee5df85c1fe6c17ecacfff86651/0_0_3500_2352/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fdbff7c3eb2b61319e89658fd9d66639", "width": "3500", "height": "2352", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc9ba4522bfd5ee5df85c1fe6c17ecacfff86651/0_0_3500_2352/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=23aef89c17038c1bca9497d7c6158731", "description": "A Turkana herd boy carries his gun as he follows his goats near the Lake Turkana Wind Power project in Marsabit County, northern Kenya.

An official at the education authority in Cr\u00e9teil said: \u201cPretexts are clearly being used to commit urban violence.\u201d\nAn 80-year-old woman died in Marseille on Monday after she was hit by a police teargas grenade on Saturday. She was inside her apartment and had opened her windows to close her shutters when she was hit by the grenade as police confronted protesters. She died in hospital after surgery.\nMeanwhile, 11 fuel depots across France were shut down after being blockaded by protesters. More than 70 petrol stations had run out of fuel and restrictions were in place in Brittany on how much fuel motorists could purchase.\nAn opinion poll for Harris Interactive taken after Saturday\u2019s violence in Paris found 72% of French people still supported the protest movement that began last month in response to a rise in environmental taxes on fuel and has morphed into opposition to the government of the centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, amid a sense that the tax system is unfair and favours the rich.\nThe prime minister is expected to meet protesters\u2019 representatives on Tuesday, but the grassroots movement, which emerged on social media, has no leadership nor a defined structure. One Paris representative said he had received death threats warning him not to meet the government.\nJacline Mouraud, one of the protest movement\u2019s prime instigators, said scrapping the fuel tax was a \u201cprerequisite for any discussion\u201d with the government.\nMacron\u2019s challenge in calming the widespread anger against the government is complicated by his own desire not to yield to street protests, which repeatedly forced his predecessors into U-turns.\n\u201cThinking that, as we have always done for 30 years, that you make a little symbolic gesture and then we sweep the dust under the carpet, that doesn\u2019t resolve the fundamental, structural problem,\u201d the government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said, implying the government would not make major concessions.\nMost opposition politicians urged the government to abandon a planned tax on fuel that was to begin in January; the only exception was the Green party, which said instead that tax must be fairer.\nLaurent Wauquiez, the hardline leader of the rightwing Les R\u00e9publicains party, said Macron should call a referendum on carbon tax \u201cto let the people\u2019s voice be heard\u201d, but did not specify exactly what form a referendum would take.\nThe economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, said the solution for tackling the low purchasing power of struggling families lay in reducing the tax burden in France, which is among the highest in Europe.\n\u201cWe must speed up the reduction of taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for that we must speed up the decrease in public spending.\u201d\nSaturday\u2019s violence in Paris has alarmed the French business community, which claims it has already lost billions of euros, as representatives met the economy minister.\nHotel unions said bookings were down 15%. Retailers in Paris and other cities in which there were violent protests on Saturday, such as Toulouse, said they had suffered major losses in the crucial run-up to Christmas.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/emmanuel-macron", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "About 100 schools under blockade while prime minister meets opposition leaders", "date_published": {"$date": 1543847040000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544798608000}, "authors": ["Angelique Chrisafis"], "article_section": "World news", "article_tags": ["France", "Emmanuel Macron", "Climate change", "Fossil fuels", "Environment", "Europe", "Energy", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/03/students-blockade-schools-as-french-protests-spread", "og:description": "About 100 schools under blockade while prime minister meets opposition leaders", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3496eb66d51300e07418bc8b2bb7379c78e2cd3f/0_239_5355_3213/master/5355.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=1fe6f847d6c9ff28e29818c4845617d6", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Students blockade schools as French protests spread"}, "headline": "r", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3496eb66d51300e07418bc8b2bb7379c78e2cd3f/0_239_5355_3213/master/5355.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b5eb9093dbf88ca6544d117b30df1bc6", "width": "5355", "height": "3213", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3496eb66d51300e07418bc8b2bb7379c78e2cd3f/0_239_5355_3213/master/5355.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40a10036ec50d89733f23091b13f0569", "description": "High school students block a road during a demonstration against education reforms in Bordeaux.\nPhotograph: Nicolas Tucat/AFP/Getty Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/689cd0122b8bf3d787211a4f13cd2fed5eb2ec6e/0_336_5021_3012/master/5021.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1f386a0da71624e088eff476db4805f6", "width": "5021", "height": "3012", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/689cd0122b8bf3d787211a4f13cd2fed5eb2ec6e/0_336_5021_3012/master/5021.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cb5340da5bf0943bd5d0b0a8b3681721", "description": "A car burns outside the Jean-Pierre Timbaud high school in Aubervilliers.

But as he flew higher, he lost a sense of the public mood and failed to face up early on to a crisis which brought his modern industrial society to a halt. In doing so he revealed an inability to control events or win around public opinion. Then the country was Britain and the young prime minister Tony Blair. Today the nation is France; and the leader is Emmanuel Macron. Then, as now, a series of seemingly leaderless protests saw aggrieved social constituents latch on to a narrowly framed but popular economic grievance: the rising cost of fuel due to green taxes. Mr Blair considered bringing in the army. Mr Macron weighs up whether a state of emergency will restore order.\nIt is tempting think plus \u00e7a change, plus c\u2019est la m\u00eame chose \u2013 but that would ignore the broader picture. President Macron faces a threat far more existential than Mr Blair did. Liberal democracies are being destabilised by the ability of groups to organise and criticise on social media with arguments that previously would have taken longer to enter the political bloodstream. The gilets jaunes (yellow vest) unrest saw 170,000 take to the nation\u2019s streets at the weekend. Rioters torched cars and buildings. Scribbled on the Arc de Triomphe was \u201cMacron resignation\u201d. Mr Macron\u2019s pro-business rhetoric and tin ear for the street have seen him cast as the embodiment of the nation\u2019s elite, disconnected from the country, and willing to favour the rich.\nMr Macron was right to suggest that higher fuel taxes are needed to fight climate change. Promoting green policies is crucial in the week that climate talks begin in Poland. We have just a dozen years to reduce emissions and cap global warming at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Mr Blair ended above-inflation increases of fuel prices. This was a mistake: the long-term survival of this planet rests on politicians making the right call. But while higher taxes can be useful to change people\u2019s behaviours, they are not sufficient when so many people feel they are an extra burden in precarious times. Mr Macron ought to recall the words of Louis XIV\u2019s finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who remarked wisely that \u201cthe art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest possible amount of feathers with the smallest possible amount of hissing\u201d. The sound of gilets jaunes hissing is now ringing in the French president\u2019s ears.\nSeen as aloof and well-off, Mr Macron needs to regain his popular touch. His party, La R\u00e9publique En Marche, will square off against the far-right Rassemblement National (the re-branded National Front) in the European parliament elections next May. Mr Macron staked his future on winning over Germany by delivering pro-market structural reforms in France, which would put an end to EU reprimands over Paris\u2019s budget plans. His bet that tax cuts would be more popular than more spending has not paid off. Whatever their benefits, the only tax cut people remember is the one for the rich. Mr Macron\u2019s big ideas have also been relegated by Berlin in favour of smaller measures. It would be smarter now to steer Europe away from market-heavy policies and put a greater emphasis on growth in France\u2019s stuttering economy. The unemployment rate is still stubbornly close to 10%. Mr Macron is right that the eurozone would operate better with a federal fiscal capacity and a full banking union.

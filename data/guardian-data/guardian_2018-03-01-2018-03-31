Sea ice hit record lows for the time of year, new US weather data revealed on Tuesday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just crazy, crazy stuff,\u201d said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, who has been studying the Arctic since 1982. \u201cThese heat waves \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d\nExperts say what\u2019s happening is unprecedented, part of a global warming-driven cycle that probably played a role in the recent strong, icy storms in Europe and the north-eastern US.\nThe land weather station closest to the North Pole, at the tip of Greenland, spent more than 60 hours above freezing in February. Before this year, scientists had seen the temperature there rise above freezing in February only twice before, and then extremely briefly. Last month\u2019s record-high temperatures have been more like those typical of May, said Ruth Mottram, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute.\nOf nearly three dozen different Arctic weather stations, 15 of them were at least 10F (5.6C) above normal for the winter.\n\u201cThe extended warmth really has staggered all of us,\u201d Mottram said. \nIn February, Arctic sea ice covered 5.4m sq miles, about 62,000 sq miles smaller than last year\u2019s record low, the ice data center reported, and it was 521,000 square miles below the 30-year normal.\nSea ice is frozen ocean water that, in contrast to icebergs and glaciers, forms, grows and melts on the ocean. It is still growing, but \u201cwhatever we grow now is going to be thin stuff\u201d that easily melts in the summer, Serreze said.\nSomething similar has been noted in the Pacific with open water on the normally iced-up Bering Sea, said the data center senior scientist Walt Meier. To be happening on opposite sides of the Arctic at the same time was unusual, he added.\n\u201cClimate change is the overriding thing,\u201d Meier said.

The issue is that sea levels keep rising for several hundred years after we stabilize temperatures, largely due to the continued melting of ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland from the heat already in the climate system.\nThe study considered two scenarios. In the first, human carbon pollution peaks somewhere between 2020 and 2035 and falls quickly thereafter, reaching zero between 2035 and 2055 and staying there. Global temperatures in the first scenario peak at and remain steady below 2\u00b0C. In the second scenario, we capture and sequester carbon to reach net negative emissions (more captured than emitted) between 2040 and 2060, resulting in falling global temperatures in the second half of the century.\nThe authors found that global average sea level will most likely rise by about 1.3 meters by 2300 in the first scenario, and by 1 meter in the second. However, there is large uncertainty due to how little we understand about the stability of the large ice sheets in Greenland and especially Antarctica. At the high end of possible ice sheet loss, we could see as much as 4.5 meters of sea level rise by 2300 in the first scenario, and close to 3 meters in the second scenario.\nThe study also shows that it\u2019s critical that our carbon pollution peaks soon. Each 5-year delay \u2013 a peak in 2025 instead of 2020, for example \u2013 most likely adds 20 cm of sea level rise by 2300, and could potentially add a full meter due to the uncertainty associated with the large ice sheets:\nwe find that a delay of global peak emissions by 5 years in scenarios compatible with the Paris Agreement results in around 20 cm of additional median sea-level rise in 2300 \u2026 we estimate that each 5 years of delay bear the risk of an additional 1 m of sea-level rise by 2300 \u2026 Delayed near-term mitigation action in the next decades will leave a substantial legacy for long-term sea-level rise.\nAnd remember, this is all for scenarios in which we meet the Paris climate targets, which we\u2019re currently not on pace to achieve. If we miss the Paris targets, sea levels will rise higher yet.\nAnother new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that sea level rise has been accelerating. If the rate of acceleration continues \u2013 which the lead author notes is a conservative estimate \u2013 we would see an additional 65 cm (close to a meter above pre-industrial sea level) of sea level rise by 2100.\nYet another new study published in The Cryosphere using satellite data found that while the East Antarctic Ice Sheet has remained stable in recent years, ice loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has accelerated. Antarctica is now discharging 1.93 trillion tons of ice each year, up from about 1.89 trillion tons per year in 2008. When accounting for snow accumulation, the continent is losing about 183 billion tons of ice per year \u2013 enough to raise sea levels by about 3 to 5 millimeters per decade by itself. The melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet is likewise accelerating and is now responsible for about 25% of annual sea level rise (8.5 millimeters per decade).\nMeanwhile, the Arctic has been remarkably warm in February \u2013 as much as 35\u00b0C hotter than average in some areas. In mid-winter, when sea ice should be growing, in the Bering Sea it\u2019s instead shrinking. \nToday's Bering Sea ice extent was lower than any value from Jan 15th to May 2nd during any of the previous 38 years; and the Feb 20th value was only half of the previous lowest Feb 20 value. #akwx @AlaskaWx @ZLabe pic.twitter.com/FPXThXkdUC\nThe hot Arctic is important because the temperature difference between the Arctic and lower latitudes is one of the main forces that keeps the jet stream moving steadily west-to-east. With a hot Arctic, the jet stream is weakened, leading to weird weather in the USA and Europe. As a result, the western states have been experiencing relatively quite cold temperatures, while the US east coast has been unseasonably hot.\nTo sum up, ice sheet melt is accelerating, as in turn is sea level rise. Even if we manage to achieve the Paris target of less than 2\u00b0C global warming above pre-industrial temperatures, we\u2019re likely to eventually see more than a meter of sea level rise, and potentially several meters. The longer we take to reach peak carbon pollution in the coming years, the higher the oceans will rise. Disappearing sea ice in the rapidly-warming Arctic also appears to be causing increasingly weird and extreme weather in places like America and Europe.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/sea-level", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oceans", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/global-climate-talks", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Dana Nuccitelli: A new study finds that waiting 5 extra years to peak carbon pollution will cost 20 cm sea level rise", "date_published": {"$date": 1519902018000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1519919077000}, "authors": ["Dana Nuccitelli"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Sea level", "Environment", "Oceans", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Paris climate agreement", "COP 21: UN climate change conference | Paris", "Global climate talks", "Antarctica"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/01/decisions-today-will-decide-antarctic-ice-sheet-loss-and-sea-level-rise", "og:description": "Dana Nuccitelli: A new study finds that waiting 5 extra years to peak carbon pollution will cost 20 cm sea level rise", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f39828d2a8401e3e4cf7e4b24ccb9a4228cc0480/0_103_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=61a730cb67d5a091f11d3e5baf5a92e7", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Actions today will decide Antarctic ice sheet loss and sea level rise | Dana Nuccitelli"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "i", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f39828d2a8401e3e4cf7e4b24ccb9a4228cc0480/0_103_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c51a8f1400a97d0750aef7fc1a88b9be", "width": "1800", "height": "1080", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f39828d2a8401e3e4cf7e4b24ccb9a4228cc0480/0_103_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=143afb8074ffe32ad74af4ca8a1cd492", "description": "A handout picture released by British Antarctic Survey shows the Larsen C iceberg.\nPhotograph: Ali Rose/AFP/Getty Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/750c49d0e80db684e02806a35ebd6de249a4d03f/0_0_900_1317/master/900.png?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ca2b54207dc6f80aa7dc5f1fd7454d0", "width": "900", "height": "1317", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/750c49d0e80db684e02806a35ebd6de249a4d03f/0_0_900_1317/master/900.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a47df342b2d9b683e3fec63da6257bdc", "description": "Carbon emissions (top frames), global temperatures (middle frames), and sea level rise (left frames) in the study\u2019s two scenarios (left and right frames).

Weather, famously, is one such (which is why exponential increases in the computing power we can put into forecasting weather only result in roughly linear improvements in the time we can forecast it for).\nClimate does not seem to be one of those systems: small changes in forcings tend to result in small changes to the climate. I am not sure if we understand mathematically why that is, or whether there are regions of the phase space of climate where there is SDIC (there almost certainly are: see below). But we have at least two sorts of experimental evidence that the climate is well-behaved in this sense: first of all we have quite good records of the way the climate behaved in the past, in particular during several cycles of glaciations & deglaciations, and it didn't fall off any cliffs, even when the total temperature swings were ~10 degrees. Secondly we can look around us and see life, and life depends on the climate not continually lashing about: trees, for instance, depend on changes being slow because they can't get up and walk to where the climate is more suitable for them, but have to creep around over hundreds or thousands of years by growing child trees in better places. And there are a lot of trees.\nNone of this means that there are not regions in the phase space where the climate does lash around wildly: as I said, almost certainly there are. But there's no real evidence that we're close to such a region. The most worrying thing is that we're pushing change into the system at a rate much faster than it has happened, almost ever (the event that killed the dinosaurs was faster: things like ice-ages were much slower, as was the PETM).\nAnd even assuming the climate does not fall off a cliff in some way, the results of the changes driven by us are still very bad, of course.\nIn response to your comment about the US and food security: yes, obviously the US will not be the first country where a lot of people starve after harvests fail.

Diplomacy and co-operation, obviously, but also international or bilateral mechanisms? Governments need to invest as well as regulate at many levels.

It has never been so warm for so long at this time of year before and it is just possible that the effects will be catastrophic. We are\u00a0talking, of course, about the Arctic, where over vast areas of frozen sea the temperatures are higher than they\u00a0are in Britain today. A blast of winter in Britain and across much of northern Europe is unpleasant but perfectly survivable and affects few people outside the region, but a period of unseasonal warming in the Arctic\u00a0could be the harbinger of something that changes\u00a0the whole world for the worse. Both could be connected so that the cold winds that belong in the Arctic have broken out southwards to chill us while warm winds melt the ice cap. We don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s\u00a0no reason for complacency.\nPrecisely because climate change on the scale now under way is outside all previous experience of which we have records, it\u2019s impossible to know which unprecedented fluctuations are those that mark the transition to a new and more dangerous state. That determination can only be made long afterwards, when it is too late to change anything. It does not mean there is nothing to worry about; only that we can\u2019t be certain what ought to worry us. This one probably should. The\u00a0weather in the Arctic has always shifted dramatically over short periods, but the drama has never been this intense since records began. At one spot in Greenland the\u00a0temperature rose 36C above the annual average, and\u00a0for two days in February the north pole has\u00a0been warmer than Zurich in Switzerland.\nThe system of global climate is extremely complicated and full of feedback loops that are not\u00a0properly understood, but the worry is that the freak warming of the Arctic marks the emergence of a new feedback loop where increasing temperature leads to still more destabilising rises. The polar vortex, a great girdle of winds that keeps the cold air of the Arctic separate from the warmer air of temperate regions, seems to be weakening. Warm\u00a0air goes north; cold air comes south. In the long run, everything grows warmer.\nAt the moment, this seems to be mainly affecting the Arctic sea ice, which is shrinking at an astonishing rate but does not of itself contribute to rising sea levels. The fear must be that the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, which rest on buried land, will melt and drown many of the world\u2019s most populated coastlines. Sea levels will rise for the rest of this century even if the ambitious targets of the Paris accords are met. These commit the world to cutting the net emissions of greenhouse gases to zero by 2050. Even if that happens, the latest research suggests that sea levels will continue to rise for another two centuries, and may do so by a completely catastrophic amount. The change in behaviour must come quickly: every five years\u2019 delay in action may add another 20cm to the projected sea level rise.\nAll these changes may seem small and distant. It\u00a0is human nature to worry more about 2cm of snow falling in our back yard today than all the oceans of the world rising by 10 times as much over the next century. But the one is a parochial inconvenience and the other a global catastrophe. The snow this week may be a warning of something very much more destructive and we should act as if it were, even if we can\u2019t be certain that it is. The consequences of misplaced optimism would be far worse than those of a pessimism that was not borne out by events.

According to NASA, the planet\u2019s average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century and most of this warming has occurred in the past 35 years with 16 of the 17 warmest years on record occurring since 2001. As mentioned in the article, a spot in Greenland rose 36 degrees Celsius above the annual average and there have been similar cases like this all over the world (theguardian.com). There are a number of reasons for these massive increases in temperatures worldwide, but I wanted to focus on population growth. The population growth of the world has been on a constant rise and by 2023 is expected to top 8 billion (newsweek.com). According to biologicaldiversity.org, each child born in the United States adds about 9,441 metric tons of CO2 to the carbon legacy of an average parent. We shouldn\u2019t necessarily limit the amount of children people can have because I think everyone should have a right to having as many children as they want, but something needs to be done. We need to take extreme measures now and be doing everything we can to help reduce climate change and global warming like decrease our consumption patterns and our consumption of animal products as the population continues to increase.

Burning wood is not CO2 free; it releases carbon, stored over the previous decades, in one quick burst. For an equal amount of heat or electricity, it releases more CO2 than burning gas, oil and even coal, so straight away we have more CO2 in the air from burning wood. This should be reabsorbed as trees regrow. For logs from mature Canadian woodland, it could take more than 100 years before the atmospheric CO2 is less than the alternative scenario of burning a fossil fuel and leaving the trees in the forest.\nThis matters to prevent climate tipping points such as an ice-free Arctic or shifting monsoon patterns before the wider decarbonisation can take place following the trajectories of the Paris and Kyoto agreements. Critics of this view say that the trees would never have been left to grow, but would instead have been chopped down for wood or paper.

They have an important part to play. And they do in this country. As does thermal and PV solar.\nBut heat pumps are only one element of the future. They require vast amounts of electricity throughout the winter cycle. Even a minergy standard home, of which there are virtually none in Britain, will require 3000 kWh per heating season. Or 20 kWh per day on an average winter day. Or 30 kWh on a cold day. When the grid is creaking. By comparison our entire domestic electricity consumption per year is 1800 kWh. And many homes here produce more eletricity than they use.\nPresumable, in addition to the mass use of heat pumps, you also want electrical cars. How are you going to cope?\nYour claims on emissions are wrong. For one thing carbon monoxiode is highly toxic, but not a greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide is. It is the result of incomplete combustion. State-of-the-art wood burning does not produce methane. Methane emissions are also the result of incomplete combustion, ie incomplete chemical reduction because of insufficient temperatures and oxygen input. \nYou need to check your chemistry. If you knew German I would refer you to the association of Swiss oven builders and their computer modulations requisite for every single oven installed.\nThe same holds for black carbon. It is fuel emitted unburnt.\nYou refer to 'domestic heaters\u2019. Again you are unaware of the technologies developed in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and elsewhere. We do not use Villagers or Agas.\nThere is no single fix to the energy and climate future. In the building sector heat pumps are one very important element. But they require an awful lot of electrical power, in winter, when it is least available. I have a fairly good grasp on the capacities of the Alpine storage batteries in winter and know their limitations, as well as the limitations of the grid in Continental Europe. In Britain the situation is much worse. Without interconnectors to the Continent, Norway and Ireland, the UK cannot install sufficient heat pump capacity. Particularly as long as it still exports waste to Oslo (of all places) to heat the homes in Norway, in combination with electricity generation and steam for industries. With plenty of oil, gas, and hydro electricity available.\nWe are far ahead of the UK in combined heating systems in cities, from waste burning, sewage treatment plants, geothermal, and waste heat from industries, office servers and cooling systems. And wood there plays a part, as woodchips, pellets, and logs. Whereas Britain still does landfills, with huge amounts of uncaptured methane emissions. They are extremely potent climate agents.\nIn new homes we need no outside heating input at all. Solar with a one hundred cubic metre boiler will do.\nBut the real crunch is the combustion engine, road transport. Urban transit systems, trains, trams, trolleybuses on renewable electricity, cycling, walking, planning reducing commuter distances: that is where the music plays. And air transport. Why airline kerosene is untaxed is difficult to convey.\nTunnel vision will not do. Check your science, check your energy computations, look at the entire picture, and then come back.\nOr build one hundred nuclear power plants in the UK. Within the next five to ten years. Just how?

And scientific analysis. \nIn sustainable forestry, with as much wood growing as is used for heating, the carbon balance over one year is neutral. And incidentally dead wood rotting will release the same amount of carbon as will wood used for heating, unless it is buried and sealed in the ground, turning to peat and eventually coal under water in moors. \nSustainable forestry prevails across the European Alps. In fact more wood grows (and eventually decomposes unless used) than is harvested. Heating with woodchips and pellets therefore makes sense. And so do log fires with state-of-the-art burning facilities ensuring high temperatures and a sufficient oxygen supply to ensure a complete chemical reduction. \nAny burning of coal and oil will release all the carbon extracted from the earth into the atmosphere, and even supposedly environment friendly gas contains considerable amounts of carbon which is released as carbon dioxide upon burning.\nIn sustainable forestry the very same amount of carbon dioxide is released by burning or rotting as is split up into carbon and oxygen and thus turned into wood by photosynthesis in the same annual cycle, reducing the carbon dioxide to carbon and oxygen. It is hence carbon neutral. And has been for millenia. In fact since the last ice age. When forests began to grow.\nSo, given sustainable forestry, with the same amount of wood growing as is used, heating with wood will be carbon neutral. Coal, oil and gas will not.\nOur area has the highest amount of timber per hectare of forest in Europe: 400 cubic metres. It also has a lot of biodiversity, with a mix of many kinds of trees, as well as a mix of old and young trees side by side. The maximum amount of trees foresters are allowed to cut in any area is defined by the height of the trees. With trees measuring a length of 25 m, a circle of at the most 50 m diametres may be cut. But mostly individual trees will be taken out, providing space and light for the others and for saplings to grow naturally. Called ungleich verj\u00fcngter Blenterwald.\nIn many areas chimneys are equipped with filtres. Our chimney has a steel tube with a 30,000 Volt DC electrode magnetising any unburnt soot particles, which will then settle on the steel tube, where the chimney sweep will vacuum them up.\nThe claims made by the article are unsustainable. They only apply if forests are cut down wholesale, as they will be for cattle grazing or soy bean production, or for coconut palms. Instead of castigating wood burners, the authors might have pointed out the effects of meat production in Brazil. Or beef, pork or chicken production and consumption in our parts, with soy beans used as fodder.\nBurning wood alongside sustainable forestry is climate friendly. The statement above to the contrary else is untenable. Eat less meat if you wish to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In the process you will also lower methane emissions by cattle. And methane is a far for potent climate gas than carbon dioxide.", "recommendation_count": "2", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "112947446", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1519955724000}, "author": "djw300", "author_id": "2947349", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "I'm astounded that after years of trying to clean the environment and banning domestic fires, wood burning heaters have been allowed to become popular.

If you harvest from a large enough area, and know the limits, it's easily possible to 'grow' more carbon than you burn. The yield is variable, obviously, depending on tree types and terrain.\nMany hardwood forests in S.E. Ontario are woefully mismanaged as woodlots. You can tell this from the size of the logs generally harvested for firewood. It's not uncommon for people to destroy the unwanted smaller trees in order to pull out the big stuff.\nWith 'selective thinning' you'll see stretch marks on the remaining trees after only a few years - as growth accelerates, the canopy is opened up, and competition is removed. You hardly ever need to cut big healthy trees. Dead and dying trees are often dangerous to cut and are such a wonderful wildlife resource that they are best left. Intelligently harvested firewood consists mostly of smaller dia. trees. The best trees are grown on and individually harvested at maturity for fine furniture etc. Firewood should only be a small part of the overall harvest. Of course as you go back and rework an area (always with the same philosophy) the thinnings you harvest are inevitably of increased size. It's essentially just horticulture - on a larger scale. As we've only just begun to understand the symbiotic complexities of what's going on under the forest floor, whatever we do in terms of harvest should be done with a very high degree of humility. If you're not tearing up the forest with heavy machinery and ATV's it's almost impossible to see where you've been working after six months or so. After five or six years the growth on the remaining trees can be quite remarkable.\nA wood stove should only be considered as part of an equation. Buying and burning wood in a city, outside of that equation, makes absolutely no sense. English woodlands flourished for centuries while supporting a whole raft of different crafts. Trees were often selected decades in advance for particular uses and cultivated accordingly. Semi-industrialised mass clear cutting for ship building and steel making was the death knell for many areas. Excepting that, local people, intimately familiar with their locality, knew pretty precisely just how much they could sustainably harvest. You never clear-cut an area. You go out of your way to preserve the ground cover. You never open up areas to erosion. You avoid the temptation to clean up too much.

The argument being that burning wood produces more general unwanted material (CO2, CO, SO2, soot and particulates) per KWh generated than burning fossil fuels. The fact that is definitely correct is not disputed. The only issue being the dubious definition of \"renewable\" in that a replanted tree will take up most of released CO2 but that will take a hell of a long time and of course all those other serious irritants (especially particulates) will have done serious damage to the environment and people in the meantime.So it should go without saying that we should really stop as much combustion as possible to improve matters for everyone. The options are therefore non combustion renewables (as appropriate to area) and any other ultra low carbon energy sources.To look at the energy density aspect (what will give you banks for your buck) here are some comparisons.Water atop a 100m high hydro electric dam has 0.001MJ/Kg in potential energyWind about a global average 0.005MJ/square metre Solar about a global average 0.03MJ/square metreClearly these options have very low energy density compared to fossil fuels where for example diesel fuel is around 48MJ/Kg which is 48,000 times more energy than the hydro equivalent.

It demands Rio Tinto reveal all membership fees paid since 2012, review the consistency of the MCA\u2019s lobbying positions with those held by Rio Tinto, and disclose what it would take for Rio to quit its membership of the MCA.\nThe action was coordinated by the Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), which is fresh from successfully forcing the country\u2019s biggest miner, BHP, to agree to similar demands.\nIf the campaign successfully forces both companies to leave the MCA, it would remove about a third of the MCA\u2019s revenue from membership fees. As such, even the threat of leaving could force the MCA to shift its lobbying positions.\nWhen ACCR coordinated a similar motion filed at BHP\u2019s annual general meeting, despite it not winning a vote, BHP agreed to conduct a review of industry associations. That review announced plans to leave the World Coal Association, and declared BHP would quit the MCA if it did not change the way it lobbied for coal.\nThe resolution filed today was submitted by the Australian Local Government Super, the Church of England Pensions Board and the Seventh Swedish National Pension Fund (AP7).\nTogether they have $84bn worth of assets under management, and collectively are thought to hold more than $100m worth of Rio Tinto shares.\nThe resolution is unlikely to gain a majority of votes at the two AGMs held in the UK and Australia (Rio is listed in London and Sydney), but even a significant minority of votes would send a strong signal and could secure a win for ACCR, as it did with BHP.\nDespite BHP already agreeing to many of the demands before the AGM voted on the resolution, and the board recommending shareholders vote against it, about 10% of shareholders voted in favour. Brynn O\u2019Brien, the executive director of ACCR, said that was significant, and anything above 5% was taken very seriously by a board.\nO\u2019Brien expected more shareholders to support the Rio Tinto motion because it was backed by large institutional investments, unlike the BHP motion, and hoped the board would recommend that shareholders support the motion.\n\u201cWe think this is really in the company\u2019s interest, so the board should support it and recommend that shareolders vote for it,\u201d she said.\nSuch a move would not be unprecedented for Rio Tinto. In 2016, the company was faced with a shareholder motion calling for greater transparency on how it deals with climate risk, and the board supported it, recommending shareholders vote in favour.\nBill Hartnett, head of sustainability at Local Government Super, one of the co-filers of the motion, said high energy prices in Australia were a result of the prolonged climate and energy debate here, and that was harming the value of their investment in Rio Tinto.\n\u201cWe estimate that these high electricity prices are adding tens to hundreds of millions of dollars to Rio Tinto\u2019s overall costs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shareholder value in supporting industry groups with contrary energy and climate positions is not clear to LGS, particularly as Rio has exited the thermal coal business in Australia.\u201d\nAdam Matthews, head of engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board, said Rio\u2019s support of the Paris climate agreement demanded that it not support lobbying that is counter to the agreement\u2019s aims.\n\u201cFor Rio Tinto to be part of the solution to climate change requires consistency in all the company\u2019s activities and from the organisations it supports to lobby on its behalf,\u201d Matthews said.\nThe wording of the resolution is similar to that filed with BHP, and laments climate and energy policy, when it exists in Australia, being \u201cshort-lived policy subject to relentless scrutiny and adversarial campaigning by industry bodies\u201d.\nIt also outlines the way the MCA and other pro-coal lobby groups supported by Rio Tinto have campaigned for the destruction of Australia\u2019s carbon tax and mining tax, and pushed for government funding for coal power stations.\nO\u2019Brien said the shareholder motion is part of a growing and unstoppable movement from investors around the world.\n\u201cThe drumbeat of opposition to coal lobbyists like the Minerals Council of Australia is only growing louder. The interest by European funds in this resolution reflects the fact that Australia\u2019s inaction on climate and energy has impacts beyond our borders,\u201d she said.\nDylan Tanner is executive director of InfluenceMap, a UK-based NGO that tracks how corporations influence climate policy around the world. He said his group has seen a rise in interest from investors to improve the role companies in their portfolios play in climate and energy debates.\n\u201cWe have detected a genuine uptick in concern recently and I personally feel 2018 will be the year shareholders get tough on companies who maintain links to egregious lobbyists holding back critical policy progress on a key existential threat to our common future,\u201d he said.\nThe shareholder revolt has come on the same day as the corporate regulator began legal proceedings in the federal court against Rio, its former chief executive Tom Albanese, and its former chief financial officer Guy Elliott. \nThe proceedings relate to statements in Rio Tinto\u2019s annual report for 2011, which the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) alleges were misleading or deceptive.\nIn December 2010, Rio announced a takeover offer for Riversdale Mining Limited which was completed in August 2011 at a total cost of over US$4bn. Following the acquisition, Rio delisted Riversdale and renamed it Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique.\nAsic alleges that Rio Tinto engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct by misrepresenting the reserves and resources of Riversdale in its 2011 annual report.\nOn 17 January 2013, Rio Tinto announced it expected to recognise a non-cash impairment charge of approximately US$14bn (post-tax) in its 2012 full-year results, including roughly US$3bn relating to Riversdale. It was also announced that Albanese, an American, had stepped down from his role as CEO.\n", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/mining", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/mining", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/business-australia", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Global shareholders file motion calling for rethink on membership of coal lobby groups", "date_published": {"$date": 1519948806000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1519973831000}, "authors": ["Michael Slezak"], "article_section": "Business", "article_tags": ["Rio Tinto", "Coal", "Australia news", "Mining", "Mining", "Energy", "Fossil fuels", "Business (Australia)", "Paris climate agreement", "Climate change", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "COP 21: UN climate change conference | Paris", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/02/rio-tinto-faces-84bn-shareholder-revolt-over-membership-of-minerals-council", "og:description": "Global shareholders file motion calling for rethink on membership of coal lobby groups", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17329c37c53189d10a6b99a8d2d011ea50ec5564/0_123_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=3e7c70026f449d58a06bcccca9a8f5fb", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Rio Tinto faces $84bn shareholder revolt over membership of Minerals Council"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17329c37c53189d10a6b99a8d2d011ea50ec5564/0_123_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a15f496c5e0a2dc94b0ad78564f862aa", "width": "3500", "height": "2101", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17329c37c53189d10a6b99a8d2d011ea50ec5564/0_123_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5954785befd6d4c2da059aa142d49b96", "description": "The Rio Tinto action was coordinated by the same group which forced BHP to agree to similar demands.\nPhotograph: David Gray/Reuters"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc083e9a2c3613145ed9019"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/02/arctic-spring-is-starting-16-days-earlier-than-a-decade-ago-study-shows", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "The Arctic spring is arriving 16 days earlier than it did a decade ago, according to a new study which shows climate change is shifting the season earlier more dramatically the further north you go.\nThe research, published on Friday in the journal Scientific Reports, comes amid growing concern about the warming of Greenland, Siberia, Alaska and other far northern regions, which have recently experienced unusually prolonged and frequent midwinter temperature spikes. \nThe authors from the University of California, Davis, based the study on temperature records and 743 previous phenological studies looking at timings of bird migrations, flowers blooming and amphibians calling. The results showed a curve, with spring events occurring earlier further north of the equator. \n\u201cSpring is arriving earlier, and the Arctic is experiencing greater advances of spring than lower latitudes,\u201d said lead author Eric Post, a fellow of the John Muir Institute and polar ecologist at UC Davis.\nOver the past 10 years, this means the end of winter will come about a day earlier in Los Angeles, but two weeks earlier in the Arctic. The authors say the northward increase in the rate of springtime advance is roughly three times greater than indicated by previous studies.\nThis underlines how pronounced climate change is in the Arctic, where temperatures are rising twice as fast as the global average and ice fields are rapidly shrinking. \nThe warming trend has been unusually apparent in recent weeks. Although the sun has not reached the high Arctic since October, temperatures has been above freezing for 61 hours \u2013 more than three times the previous record \u2013 at Greenland\u2019s northernmost weather monitoring station.\nMartin Stendel, lead scientist of the Polar Portal and a senior researcher at the Danish Meteorological Institute, said temperatures in the central Arctic have been 4C warmer than average this winter. In February, several regions were 10C above historic norms. Despite fluctuations, he expects this trend to continue. \n\u201cThink of waves on the beach. Some are high, some are low. That\u2019s the weather. But in the background the tide is coming in. That\u2019s climate change. Even though the waves haven\u2019t changed their properties, they come closer and closer to your feet,\u201d he says. The consequences would include increased melting of the ice sheet, less sea ice, thawing permafrost both on land and under the sea, less snow and more rain even in winter.\nThe weather has appeared out of joint seasonally and geographically. As much of northern Europe was hit by blizzards and chills, the Danish media joked that residents should visit the Arctic special forces base at Daneborg because it is warmer there.\nThe Information newspaper interviewed a member of the Sirius Dog Sled Patrol at the base \u2013 one of the most northern permanent outposts of humanity \u2013 who said the high temperature had turned slow into slush and made sledding heavy.\nThe handful of troops at the base are used to spending months in cold and darkness. \u201cThe first day the sun doesn\u2019t come up you think \u2018Wow\u2019,\u201d one member told Greenland Today in 2015. \u201cThe water and the rivers stop running because they freeze. The fjord freezes too, so there are no waves or swells that lap at the shore. The small birds fly south so there is no birdsong. Only the ravens overwinter. And then a thick layer of snow comes that muffles everything even more.\u201d\nOn some patrols, they encounter blizzards that last for days and temperatures as low at -51C.\nBut there is increasingly frequent respite in the form of warm \u201cfoehn wind\u201d. This abrupt warming and drying of moist winds as they pass over ice-masses or mountains is commonly seen in the Alps. Similar phenomenon are the Chinook or \u201csnow eater\u201d of the North American Rocky Mountains; the Zonda of the South American Andes; and the Helm wind of the English Pennines.\nFebruary has seen such warmth arrive with unprecedented frequency. \nOne member of the Arctic Patrol described the effect as surreal. \u201cOutside, the dogs lie on their backs boiling and we dance around in our underwear enjoying it, until the cold returns.\u201d\n\n", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/arctic", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Climate change is causing the season to start comparatively earlier the further north you go, say scientists", "date_published": {"$date": 1520005793000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1520028039000}, "authors": ["Jonathan Watts"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "Arctic", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "World news", "Climate change", "Science"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/02/arctic-spring-is-starting-16-days-earlier-than-a-decade-ago-study-shows", "og:description": "Climate change is causing the season to start comparatively earlier the further north you go, say scientists", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a0932009c5506f8d0e2e9bffeb583a647f4cd6b/0_0_4045_2427/master/4045.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=4aad68909c162dd84c631038bf3854e5", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Arctic spring is starting 16 days earlier than a decade ago, study shows"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a0932009c5506f8d0e2e9bffeb583a647f4cd6b/0_0_4045_2427/master/4045.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8450569db904f37de2e03fbc15c78b53", "width": "4045", "height": "2427", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a0932009c5506f8d0e2e9bffeb583a647f4cd6b/0_0_4045_2427/master/4045.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=41e2d3b52c587423d0ad269ab7977cdf", "description": "A snowshoe hare stands near Thule air base in Pituffik, Greenland.\nPhotograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc083eba2c3613145ed901a"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/03/antarctica-diary-environment-matthew-taylor-threat-greenpeace", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "I have arrived in Punta Arenas on the southern tip of Chile after a 24-hour whistlestop tour of South American airports. Pleased to see my bags have made it too. I was asked to avoid packing synthetic and down clothing wherever possible because it could contaminate the environment, so was pleased all those carefully selected natural fibres had made it with me across the Atlantic. Luke, my press contact at Greenpeace, meets me, which is just as well as I don\u2019t really speak Spanish. We get a taxi to the dock and I have my first view of the Arctic Sunrise \u2013 the Greenpeace ship last in the news when it was stormed by the Russian FSB in the Arctic. It is bustling with people fixing things, loading things, working and chatting. Everyone is friendly. I wonder about the different stories that bring them all here. Are they the kind of people who want to jump off the edge of the map, as Werner Herzog found in his documentary about the Antarctic? The ship is smaller than I\u2019d imagined and more \u201cworkmanlike\u201d. If I had ever been in any doubt, I now realise that the next two weeks, crossing some of the roughest water in the world to a place that is mostly uninhabitable, isn\u2019t going to be a cruise. \nWe were meant to set sail first thing this morning. But the ship is still a flurry of activity and the weather in the Drake Passage \u2013 the notorious stretch of water between South America and the Antarctic \u2013 is described as \u201cnot good\u201d, so we have to wait. I decide to stretch my legs with a walk into the centre of Punta Arenas. It starts off well with a magical view out over forbidding seas towards the Southern Ocean, and I think I spot an albatross. But it ends more prosaically when I am attacked by a dog.\nAt breakfast I hear sobering tales of the passage ahead. Apparently the ship is notorious for its pitching and rolling, and known affectionately as the \u201cwashing machine.\u201d The ship\u2019s doctor, a lovely man, said it can be so severe the walls become the floor and if you hold on to the rail on the bridge your legs fly up behind you so you effectively do a handstand. In the afternoon, I work in my cabin \u2013 I want to make sure I make the most of the trip journalistically. Greenpeace is supporting an EU-backed proposal to create the world\u2019s biggest ocean sanctuary in the waters around Antarctica \u2013 seas controlled by a disparate group of countries including the UK, US and Australia. While here I hope to report on the undiscovered ecosystems discovered by scientists on board the ship, the threats facing wildlife because of climate change and krill fishing, and the state of the Antarctic ice shelves. But at least as important for me is to soak up as much as I can of this place, and to absorb any wider lessons there may be here for the broader environment movement.\nDid some exercise in the makeshift gym in the hold (a couple of yoga mats, some free weights, a rowing machine and exercise bike) before breakfast. At 8am it is cleaning duty \u2013 as I am not crew I don\u2019t have to help out but was told that it aids morale if people pitch in. Surprisingly I have found I quite enjoy sweeping the corridors and cleaning the toilets \u2013 it makes me feel, in a very small way, part of the daily routine of life on board. We are due to set sail today and at lunch I overhear the captain and some of the engineers laughing as the \u201cnewbies\u201d (journalists, photographers, Greenpeace campaign team) tumble into the mess, talking and laughing. They say something along the lines of \u201clook at them all laughing and happy now ... they have no idea what is coming\u201d.\nI wake to a moderate swell. During cleaning duties I begin to feel a bit rough so finish an article and lie down, which helps a lot. Later I go up on the bridge and speak to the first mate, Fernando, who shows me the weather forecast for the next few days \u2013 five-metre-plus swell and 40-knot headwinds. \u201cIt will be rough,\u201d he tells me cheerfully. \u201cYou will not enjoy it, but it is not dangerous.\u201d\nI have not been able to leave my bunk for two days as the ship is tossed around by huge waves. The pitching and rolling don\u2019t seem to have any rhythm. One minute I am being pushed with some force into my mattress - the next I am lifted, almost hovering, above the bed. My head is repeatedly shunted into the headboard, my feet into the wall at the end of the bed. Every so often a wave catches the boat just right and I am lifted and shunted at the same time so I am left standing, pretty much vertical, on the wall at the bottom of my bed. I try to make it to the mess but the stairs, which in normal times are steep, become momentarily horizontal when each wave hits. My brain, in its current scrambled state, cannot work out when it is safe to try to get up them, so I retreat to my bed. Luke very kindly brings me a banana. \nApparently I am not the only one who has been suffering. Many people have been confined to their bunks and one crew member has been so ill he has been put on a drip. Managed to get up for a bit this afternoon and watch Pulp Fiction on the ship television but soon retreat to my bunk. Been told that tomorrow we will wake up in Antarctica proper \u2013 and calmer waters!\nA different world. I see an iceberg through the porthole in the cabin before I get out of bed. After my first breakfast in three days I go onto deck \u2013 the first time we have been allowed outside in days. The sea is much calmer and the air bitterly cold. It is quite a scene. Low cloud obscures the tops of the ice-covered mountains rising straight out of the sea and icebergs loom up on either side of the ship. Before I have finished my cup of tea, I see three pods of whales, several seals and innumerable penguins. The place teems with life. To my deprived modern eye, used to sparsely populated \u201cnature\u201d, it feels an almost claustrophobic, disconcerting level of abundance. Another whale \u2013 a humpback \u2013 arches its tail out of the water and dives into the deep 100 metres from the ship. We have arrived.\nGreenpeace takes its responsibilities here seriously. The expedition involves lots of landings to view penguin colonies and seals close up. We have had several biosecurity briefings explaining how to avoid spreading diseases on our boots and clothes. And today we have to abort a trip to a penguin colony for the wonderful reason that there is too much wildlife. It is impossible to land without disturbing them. As one of the ship\u2019s crew says, \u201cthis has to be a place where the needs of the wildlife come before anything else.\u201d\nI\u2019m supposed to be going on a helicopter ride across the peninsula to land \u2013 the first time it\u2019s been done \u2013 on the huge iceberg the size of London that broke away from the Larsen C ice shelf last year. So far, however, the weather has not been good enough. I am slightly anxious about the trip as the pilot, who is very experienced in the region, is obviously not convinced it is a good idea (too far, difficult terrain, etc). But we are on standby to fly at first light tomorrow if weather permits.\nA bad night\u2019s sleep, due in part to the prospect of the helicopter trip and in part to dreams haunted by the wonderful book I am reading \u2013 Apsley Cherry-Garrard\u2019s The Worst Journey in the World, a fascinating and terrifying account of the bravery of the men involved in the British attempt to reach the south pole in 1910. At a 4am meeting, it is decided the weather is too bad. Later, Greenpeace decides to cancel the trip altogether because of the pilot\u2019s concerns. It is a shame, but the right decision. It is the second mate\u2019s birthday and there\u2019s a bit of a party in the evening, booze flowing and good fun all round.\nA magical day. It is my favourite kind of weather: clear blue sky and sharp cold air. The visibility is pin-sharp and the views from the ship are quite incredible \u2013 some of the ridges and peaks I can see would be famous if they were anywhere else in the world. Spent a couple of hours in a penguin colony just watching them waddle to and from the sea, as seals bobbed in and out of the surf and whales glided past in the distance. A day that will stay long in the memory.\nLast morning on the ship. We don\u2019t have to brave the Drake Passage on the way back, but our flight on a small plane to Chile is weather-dependent, so I\u2019m a bit tense. I have been away for nearly three weeks and I\u2019m keen to be reunited with my young family. But after a couple of hours\u2019 wait we get the all-clear from the airport \u2013 which I later discover consists of a couple of huts on a bleak, wind-ravaged island \u2013 and we are on our way. I take one last look out of the window at the Antarctic being swallowed up by the cloud below. What a privilege it has been.\nI sit in the airport, having a beer and waiting for my 14-hour flight back to London. The images of ice and mountains, and the abundance of life in Antarctic waters, are still fresh in my mind: they bring a smile to my face as I write. I have discovered I don\u2019t possess sea-legs but have nevertheless managed to publish articles from the ship, trying to give readers an idea of what is at stake down here \u2013 and how a new ocean sanctuary might begin to address some of those issues. I feel I have gained a lifelong appreciation for this truly remarkable place and an understanding \u2013 which I hope has come across in my reporting \u2013 that although Antarctica seems like an untouched, pristine wilderness, it is threatened by the all-too-familiar perils of climate change and industrial-scale fishing.

The finding, based on penguin guano originally noticed on satellite imagery, led to a penguin census in the region using drone-based cameras before teams were sent in to the region. It\u2019s a story of hope. Ad\u00e9lie penguin populations have fallen by more than 65% in the past 25 years. Over the last seven years, thousands of chicks have died in a \u201ccatastrophic breeding failure\u201d in the west of the Antarctic peninsula.\nSo the discovery of an additional 1.5 million Ad\u00e9lie penguins living quietly on the Danger Islands, in the east Antarctic peninsula, is the conservation equivalent of finding a substantive amount of change down the back of a sofa on the day rent is due. Eviction and extinction have seemingly been postponed.\nBut we shouldn\u2019t count our chicks. Announcing the secret colony to the world will be an anxious time for the scientists. In popular imaginations, populations are either endangered or fine. The nuances get lost. Society at large has a binary approach to species conservation. Hopeful news throws us off the scent of the enormous amount of work and funding needed to stem what some scientists are calling the \u201cbiological annihilation\u201d of wildlife in recent decades.\nOne of the greatest conservation conundrums is that public support (essential) tends to flow towards species but generally we couldn\u2019t give two hoots about protecting the actual spaces where the species live. Last week\u2019s penguin discovery has been wrapped in important assertions. The site of the find of 700,000 breeding pairs on the Danger Islands in the Weddell Sea is an area where the impacts of climate change have not yet been felt and there is little human activity.

The bottom is falling out of the market, to the point where one of Lavery\u2019s managing directors couldn\u2019t persuade his own mother to buy one: \u201cHis mum is 74, has driven a diesel for the last 15 years and has now changed it for a petrol one \u2013 a higher carbon-emitting, more polluting car.\u201d\nYet while diesel vehicles were pushed by the industry and government on the promise of cutting carbon dioxide emissions, the world is now more urgently addressing its dirty corollary: the NOx emissions which have fouled urban areas and contribute to 40,000-50,000 premature deaths a year in the UK alone from air pollution. \nThe drumbeat against diesel picked up pace this week as judges decided that German cities, in the heart of Europe\u2019s biggest car market, have the right to ban diesels on their streets, and Rome\u2019s mayor proposed an outright ban from 2024, a year before Paris expects the same. \nIn London, in April 2019 an ultra-low emission zone will double the congestion charge payable to drive in the city centre for any but the very newest, Euro 6, diesel cars, and campaigners are pushing for even tougher sanctions. Boroughs including Islington and Camden have introduced higher parking charges for diesel drivers. \nOther UK cities are still considering how to implement so-called \u201ctoxin taxes\u201d on drivers of older vehicles, although Manchester and Leeds have made clear that ordinary car drivers would not be charged. \nSome manufacturers see the writing on the wall: this week, Fiat Chrysler announced plans to end production of diesel cars by 2022; Porsche has ditched two models and Toyota has indicated it will never launch a new diesel. \nBut British manufacturers are keen to resist: Jaguar Land Rover in particular is on the hook, with diesel representing around 90% of its cars sold in 2017. It invested heavily four years ago in a new, multi-billion pound Euro 6 engine plant in Wolverhampton, just as Ford was spending almost \u00a3400m on its diesel plant in Dagenham. \nIn 2017, UK car sales fell, marginally, for the first time in five years \u2013 but diesel numbers tumbled spectacularly, by 17.1%. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) pointed to relatively small tax reforms announced by the chancellor in the autumn as prompting a further exodus, with 30% fewer diesels sold last November and December than the same time in 2016.\nEven if measures are far short of any ban, David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston University, said: \u201cIn a sense the damage is already being done. Consumers have been spooked.\u201d \nBailey predicts that diesel\u2019s UK market share will drop from one in two cars sold in the first half of this decade to one in seven by 2025. \nGrowing evidence about the health damage from diesel pollution was thrust to the forefront by the Volkswagen scandal. While only the German manufacturer was found to be deliberately rigging emission tests, virtually every other carmakers\u2019 model was found to be far dirtier outside the lab. As the industry lobbied to delay stringent, real-world emission tests, the interim period saw some models licensed as Euro 6-compliant that would breach limits set after September 2017. \nGreenpeace has now unearthed data showing many Euro 6 models on sale emit far more NOx than industry rhetoric about their cleanest cars might lead people to believe. Bailey says: \u201cThat\u2019s likely to add to confusion for consumers over whether they should buy diesel at all. On this, the industry seems to have collectively shot itself in the foot.\u201d\nResale values have fallen: according to comparison website motorway.co.uk, the average price of a used diesel car fell 5% between the first and final quarter of 2017, while petrol models grew 10% more expensive. \nLavery is unsurprised: \u201cIn and around the M25, there\u2019s a massive switch to hybrid and petrol \u2013 less so outside. The conversation is, I want out of my diesel and into a petrol.

When most wealthy people think about their carbon footprint, or their contributions to climate change, they\u2019ll think about where their electricity and heat come from or what they drive. They\u2019ll think about fossil fuels and miles per gallon, about LED lights and mass transit \u2013 but not so much about combine harvesters or processed meals or food waste. Few consider the impacts of the food they eat, despite the fact that globally, food systems account for roughly one quarter of all manmade greenhouse gas emissions. That\u2019s more than the entire transportation sector, more than all industrial practices, and roughly the same as the production of electricity and heat.\nMeanwhile, the most immediate threat of climate change for most of the global population will be at the dinner table, as our ability to grow critical staple crops is being affected by the warming we\u2019ve already experienced. Between 1980 and 2008, for instance, wheat yields dropped 5.5 % and maize yields fell 3.8% due to rising temperatures. Climate change threatens the food security of millions of poor people around the world. Young people are increasingly keen to protect the environment by shifting to animal-product-free diets. They seek plant proteins which taste like meat, while insects are also growing popular as an alternative.\nWhat these inverse challenges \u2013 that food and agriculture are both enormous contributors to climate change, and massively impacted by it \u2013 really tell us is that our food systems, as currently structured, are facing major challenges.\nThere is a much larger problem that implores us to look beyond farm and agricultural practices. We need to open our eyes to solutions that address the full scope of the challenge to create more sustainable and equitable food systems. That way, we can provide healthy food for all people while we protect our planet\u2019s resources at the same time.\nSo what are food systems? Everything from seed and soil to the supermarket to the plate to the landfill. Food systems include the growing, harvesting, processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items.\nWhile farming alone accounts for 10-12% of global greenhouse gas emissions, when we look at entire food systems the contributions to climate change more than double. A recent report published by the Meridian Institute lays out the many factors throughout food systems that spell trouble for the climate, and also explains why a broad systems-wide perspective is necessary for implementing effective changes.\nConsider deforestation and soil. A narrow view of agriculture alone would neglect the fact that a full 80% of the forests that are clear cut or destroyed are done so to create farmland. Forests are massive carbon sinks. So is soil, locking away two to three times as much carbon as there is present in the atmosphere. But farmers can help restore ecosystem functions and build resilient communities by producing crops and livestock in productive ways that sequester carbon and protect forests.\nOr consider food waste. Not just the scraps that you throw away, but throughout the entire food system. A staggering 30-40% of the food produced in the world is never eaten. Some never gets harvested, some spoils before it reaches consumers, and a lot is tossed away by retailers, restaurants, and at home. For the sake of comparing emissions, if food waste were its own country it would be the third largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world, after only China and the United States. \nThis says nothing of the gross injustice of wasting so much food while so many in the world go hungry. In the developing world, improving infrastructure along the food chain \u2013 including cold storage \u2013 would prevent much good food being lost. In the developed world, retailers can prevent large amounts of waste by finding outlets for slightly blemished goods and consumers can limit waste by buying food in amounts they actually want and need.\nThere are countless more examples of challenges and solutions all throughout the food system \u2014 from production of fertiliser to distribution systems to the production of dried and purified foods that make up processed meals to the diets and lifestyles of the public. Everyone has a role to play; these challenges cannot be solved in a vacuum.\nThe complex, dynamic, and widely diverse forms of the world\u2019s many food systems yield some wildly divergent outcomes in terms of nutrition, health, and environmental and climate impacts. It is critical that we start to better examine what works in some systems and what must be improved in others, in order to produce more equitable, just, and sustainable outcomes around the world.\nJust as there\u2019s no universal crop that grows everywhere, there\u2019s no \u201cone size fits all\u201d model food system to implement across the world. A broader systems-wide perspective is necessary if there is any hope for truly transformative change. It\u2019s time to look beyond farming and agriculture and to see the whole picture, to create systems that cause less harm to the climate and are more resilient to the impacts we\u2019re already suffering from global warming. \nFood is a fundamental human need and to eat is a basic human right. Our food systems must deliver that need, fairly and equitably, without worsening the impacts of climate change.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/food", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Ruth Khasaya Oniang\u2019o: Our food \u2013 from what we eat to how it is grown \u2013 accounts for more carbon emissions than transport and yet staple crops will be hit hard by global warming", "date_published": {"$date": 1520236810000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1520863717000}, "authors": ["Ruth Khasaya Oniang'o"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Food", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/05/why-what-we-eat-is-crucial-to-the-climate-change-question", "og:description": "Ruth Khasaya Oniang\u2019o: Our food \u2013 from what we eat to how it is grown \u2013 accounts for more carbon emissions than transport and yet staple crops will be hit hard by global warming", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d90426919c965f54d9cf03ec472e88aa5c487c85/0_14_4209_2525/master/4209.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=31faffffb11427f76c4a32aad4eaefa8", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Why what we eat is crucial to the climate change question | Ruth Khasaya Oniang\u2019o"}, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d90426919c965f54d9cf03ec472e88aa5c487c85/0_14_4209_2525/master/4209.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=af9e0bfaa41e3b8d08bfbc583843e80b", "width": "4209", "height": "2525", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d90426919c965f54d9cf03ec472e88aa5c487c85/0_14_4209_2525/master/4209.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e3c9f089b31cf5dc05e7455d7e62c3db", "description": "A worker loads palm oil seeds in Serba Jadi, East Aceh.

However, his latest \u2013 Enlightenment Now \u2013 has some serious shortcomings centering on Pinker\u2019s misperceptions about climate change polarization. Pinker falls into the trap of \u2018Both Siderism,\u2019 acknowledging the Republican Party\u2019s science denial, but also wrongly blaming liberals for the policy stalemate, telling Ezra Klein:\nthere is implacable opposition to nuclear energy in much of the environmental movement ... There are organizations like Greenpeace and NRDC who are just dead set opposed to nuclear. There are also people on the left like Naomi Klein who are dead set against carbon pricing because it doesn\u2019t punish the polluters enough ... the people that you identify who believe in a) carbon pricing and b) expansion of nuclear power, I suspect they\u2019re a tiny minority of the people concerned with climate \u2026 What we need are polling data on how many people really would support carbon pricing and an expansion of nuclear and other low carbon energy sources.\nHere Pinker has created a strange straw man that bears no resemblance to the real population of American liberals and environmentalists. In fact, the polling data he wonders about already exists.\nFor example, a 2016 survey by Yale and George Mason universities found that 73% of Democrats support a carbon tax or a combination of tax and regulations (a further 17% favored carbon pollution regulations only). In fact, most consider putting a price on carbon pollution the single most crucial step in tackling global warming. Even Naomi Klein has said, \u201cI don\u2019t think a carbon tax is a silver bullet, but I think a progressively designed carbon tax is part of a slate of policies that we need.\u201d\nWhile it\u2019s true that a majority of liberals oppose building more nuclear power plants, 38% support the idea. Some environmental groups like Greenpeace do oppose nuclear power, but Pinker\u2019s other example, NRDC merely points out that new nuclear plants are currently uneconomical, and even suggests, \u201cThe federal government should continue to fund research into nuclear energy.\u201d There are strong economic reasons to oppose building new nuclear power as an inefficient use of resources when renewables today are cheaper and can be deployed more quickly. That being said, were nuclear power funding included in comprehensive legislation to tackle climate change, most liberals and environmentalists would accept that deal in a heartbeat. \nThere\u2019s cultural pressure to place the blame on \u2018both sides,\u2019 for example by claiming that while conservatives reject science on climate change and evolution, liberals reject it on the safety of GMOs and vaccines. However, research has shown this is simply not the case \u2013 Democrats and Republicans are equally likely to distrust GMOs, and conservatives are the group that most opposes vaccines.\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that the Republican Party is the only major political party in the world whose leaders reject the need to tackle climate change. And their president made America the only country to reject the Paris climate agreement. There simply is no equivalent on the political left.\nIn The New York Times, Nicholas Kristof pointed to research led by Yale\u2019s Dan Kahan showing that when presented with data about a politically charged issue like gun control, the mathematical and cognitive abilities of \u201cDemocrats and Republicans alike went to pieces,\u201d as Kristof interpreted it. But Kahan\u2019s data showed the problem was much more pronounced among conservatives. \nIn the experiment, numerically-adept Democrats were about 33% more likely to misinterpret (made-up) data when it suggested that gun control increases crime, but numerically-adept Republicans were 70% more likely to misinterpret the same data when it suggested that gun control decreases crime. Democrats who are weak at math weren\u2019t biased at all, whereas Republicans who are bad at math were 50% more likely to get the answer right when it confirmed their ideological biases. The difference between conservatives and liberals in both cases was stark. \nI tracked down this study. It wasn\u2019t easy since Kristof\u2019s column doesn\u2019t link to it. Or provide the title. Or name any of the authors. Or say when it was published. The study can be found here, and its main results are in the screencap below. https://t.co/NcEYCFK04c pic.twitter.com/NJTbWLB4nZ\nSurveys have shown that increased general science knowledge makes Democrats more likely to accept human-caused global warming \u2013 the same is not true for Republicans. Thus, it\u2019s certainly true that ideology is preventing conservatives from accepting certain scientific realities. The problem is in the temptation to assume \u2018both sides\u2019 are equally guilty of letting ideological bias cloud their judgment. As Kahan\u2019s research showed, some liberals are certainly guilty of this sort of bias, but it\u2019s a far bigger problem among conservatives.\nSo how did America get here? Political polarization has been on the rise in America on both sides of the political spectrum for the past four decades. But a rating of ideology-based voting in Congress created by Kenneth Poole and Howard Rosenthal found that while Democrats are gradually becoming more liberal, Republicans in Congress have become radically more conservative since 1980. \nIn 1987, the FCC under Reagan repealed the Fairness Doctrine, which required television and radio stations to be equitable and balanced. The Rush Limbaugh Show then launched in 1988, and so came the rise of right-wing radio. Fox News launched in 1996, providing conservatives a source of politically-biased news coverage. Combined with conservative news websites like Breitbart, Drudge, and Infowars, the right-wing echo chamber can envelop anyone who seeks only news spun to confirm their ideological biases.\nIn a 2012 survey, participants who only watched Fox News were less likely to correctly answer questions about domestic or international events than viewers of any other news source (NPR, Sunday political shows, The Daily Show, talk radio, MSNBC, or CNN), or even people with no news exposure. And on the subject of climate change, the vast majority of Fox News coverage has been factually inaccurate. \nUnsurprisingly, public trust in science over the past 40 years has only fallen among one group \u2013 conservatives. That aligns with research showing that watching Fox News or listening to Rush Limbaugh decreases viewer trust in scientists.\nHere's how it works--the \"liberal\" New York Times has 3 right-wing columnists who each write 2 columns a week; the right wing Wall Street Journal has no liberal columnists. \"Liberal\" PBS just created a new show for conservatives, no liberals ever appear on right-wing Fox.\nAmerica\u2019s climate inaction simply cannot be blamed on \u2018both sides.\u2019 Democrats have proposed cap and trade legislation \u2013 a concept invented by Republicans \u2013 to address the issue. House Democrats even passed the legislation before a lack of Republican support doomed it in the Senate. More recently, Democrats have proposed revenue-neutral climate legislation in order to appeal to small-government, free market conservatives. President Obama took America\u2019s first comprehensive steps to tackle climate change by joining the Paris climate accords and implementing the Clean Power Plan \u2013 his Republican successor revoked both.\nQuite simply, the Republican Party is the problem. Some within the party are slowly making progress in fixing it, for example in the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus. But breaking through America\u2019s climate policy gridlock may require bursting the right-wing media bubble.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change-scepticism", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-tax", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/nuclearpower", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Dana Nuccitelli: The fault lies entirely with the GOP.

However you have said that the tidal gauges rate \"is roughly half of the rate of rise claimed from satellite altimetry\". This is incorrect and Church does not claim this.\n3.

There have been three large winter storms already this year; and there will be droughts and accelerated glacial melt that should be refilling water tables in places like Colorado. Storm surges are now commonplace, affecting most of the east coast. Wildfires etc.\nAnd then there is the mistaken belief that fracking is the way towards a low-carbon society. It is the opposite - in no way is fracking low-carbon even given a potential reduction in the methane that is in the atmosphere now, sometime later this century; even if they do manage to use more low-cost renewable electricity, energy efficiency and electric transport. The dependence on gas will continue to haunt. \nIt is a twisted motivation that tries to construe something that is patently bad into something good; but this is the only resort for these Republicans who cannot see reality through the fog of some kind of 60s fantasy that is long over, and the economics just don't work out any more.\nBecoming a 'fossil fuel superpower' whatever that might try to mean is probably the least intelligent thing they can try to do right now; and I will explain why: fracking is just not profitable. On a basic economics level and they aren't making any money - they are barely covering the costs of not importing oil & gas, and are now exporting it at net cost to themselves; presumably just to make headlines and impress oil & gas industry analysts. What they don't know is that they are now famous for the opposite reasons and are simply hoping everyone won't notice. Coal is over yet they try and revive it like giving shots to a corpse. Utterly pointless and the situation with excess gas-fired generation is starting to look frighteningly similar - people are not making gas turbines anymore yet they still try to sell the dream of fossil fuels as if no lower-cost alternative had been found - while spending $48 billion in upgrading LNG export terminals that will continue to generate losses for years to come - and thats if they are able to find enough gas in the first place. \nAustralia has a high gas price, and Japan has 170 hydrogen refueling stations finalised by the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and very little natural gas supplies of their own. With solar at ever lower cost electrolysis is finally undercutting the cost of steam methane reforming - the traditional way of making hydrogen - and so will start exporting in the approaching few years. \nHowever, this is just the start. Between massive subsidies, wildly fluctuating wholesale prices, geopolitical dependencies and a host of other reasons - the economics of renewable hydrogen production are going to beat the lowest prices that government-subsidised fracking or any other form of fossil methane can go. And when that happens its game over - there will be no more need to talk down politicians on the basis of their environmental credentials.

Internal variability thus diminishes the relevance of trends over periods as short as 10 to 15 years for long-term climate change (Box 2.2, Section 2.4.3). Furthermore, the timing of internal decadal climate variability is not expected to be matched by the CMIP5 historical simulations, owing to the predictability horizon of at most 10 to 20 years (Section 11.2.2; CMIP5 historical simulations are typically started around nominally 1850 from a control run). However, climate models exhibit individual decades of GMST trend hiatus even during a prolonged phase of energy uptake of the climate system (e.g., Figure 9.8; Easterling and Wehner, 2009; Knight et al., 2009), in which case the energy budget would be balanced by increasing subsurface\u2013ocean heat uptake (Meehl et al., 2011, 2013a; Guemas et al., 2013).\nhttp://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter09_FINAL.pdf", "recommendation_count": "18", "in_reply_to": "113361115", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "113397691", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1520800227000}, "author": "SoloLoMejor", "author_id": "12475077", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "The science is not settled my friend, however you like to put it and however much consensus is claimed.

Science solved the basic relationships - the solution is political (in democratic nations). If not one would argue for Technocracy or Scientism. \nNow - one can of course argue that politics already is \"Econominism\" to an unhealthy level - especially since economics is not based on laws of nature and has an exceptional failure-rate wen it comes to predictive skill compare to any natural science. \nAnyhow - since democracy has it's advantages compared to other options - the solutions to AGW must involve politics. Although it has to be said - politics based on \"alternative realities\" is really not good. Even economics go extra pear-shaped if politicians think that the solution to a problem is simply to print more currency, for example. When health-politicians think that HIV can be fixed with alcohol and root-fruits (as being popular in southern parts of Africa that happens to have crazy AIDS issues) - it is really not helpful. In other nations - it is popular to think that climate change is caused by a Chinese hoax - and that is not helpful either. It is better if political discussions are based on facts. Just look at them 350 millions going straight to healthcare in the UK as of soon. \nAnd this is what we see at present. Reality free democracies doing all sorts of bonkers things, contradicting on purpose the best evidence that human cooperation can provide - for some gooey lovely political feeling. And allowing politics to support free will to the extent that voters soon will demand aircraft to Spain with no wings - to make the journey cheaper - because free will is promised by democracy - and according to some - wings on air planes is a scientific conspiracy to make travel more costly - as equivalent. \nI am actually pondering being for that group being given access to those types of aircraft. Douglas Adams style. It includes Air Force One. Wings are clearly a hoax for a president that think that CO2 is political. He should demand his flight is wing-less. This would be a nice addition to Darwin Awards 2018 - and help the gene pool - well - maybe not after seeing his kids. \nMy point still stands - politics is involved. Science only present a challenge. Like - it is stupid to make floors of paper. So politics can make a law that those who build a paper with a thin paper-floor - actually are breaking the laws of criminality - by selling a product that does not sustain the laws of gravity - for example. \nThe laws against shooting people has similar scientific arguments behind it - to propell a bullet out of a barrel at high speeds has by science been found to have catastrophic consequences for the receiver. After intenst scientific investigations and many many scientific papers - there is no a consensus that there is a difference between having \"an open mind\" and a \"hole in the head\", for example. \nHence - to take students into school and open minds is legal - to create hole in head is illegal. This is a political decision in most nations - based on rigorous scientific analyses. \nBut of course - in politics it is perfectly possible to disregard the laws of science - and as president argue for shooting people in the pussy, as a current example that even makes UN-delegates consider that psychiatry is called for and they are diplomats without any heart. \nScience has a thing or two to say about that as well. And the consensus is that it is not good for a whole set of reasons. Now you can disregard the scientific consensus of how people bleed to death - enter shock - becomes physically traumatised - and you can of course disagree with other softer sciences tell you that it is not really perfect to shoot women in the pussy. You can even disagree with the \"pick-up-artists\" that write a book about picking up girls - and claim that to shoot them in the pussy first seems to be a turn off for them. \nThis could be a conspiracy of course. And it clearly does not stop a democracy. \nSo where does this leave us? Well - I think a bit of reality is supported by facts. \nAnd I think a lot of voters should learn a bit more about ethical relativism - especially since many seems to have a rather non-consequential take on this relativism.

I think the United States\u2019 decision to withdraw from this Paris agreement really creates a serious problem,\u201d Ban said in an interview with the Guardian.\n\u201cThey [the Trump administration] have given serious damage to the political side. All the countries are very serious and concerned about this [the US declaring its withdrawal from the climate deal].\u201d\nAlthough Trump indicated in a recent interview that the US may not leave the global accord, Ban said the remarks were not clear. He said the apparent shift in position may have been the result of lobbying from European leaders such as the French president, Emmanuel Macron.\nBan said he hoped Trump would take better advice. \u201cWhat President Trump has been saying is politically shortsighted and scientifically based on wrong advice; I don\u2019t know who advised him,\u201d he said.\nWhile Europe has been seen as a champion of global climate talks and international efforts to rein in temperature rises, Ban said he was worried this role could be put at risk by political strife.\n\u201cI am concerned because of the divisions that are now happening within the EU, not to mention this Brexit, and political difficulties and issues such as refugees,\u201d he said. \nHe said he hoped Macron and Angela Merkel would take on a leadership role and he had pressed the French president on the issue during an hour-long meeting in December.\nBan said Britain had a duty to keep up action on climate change despite Brexit. \u201cThey [the UK government] still have a political and moral responsibility on this issue,\u201d he said.\nThe US saying it would withdraw from the Paris agreement had imperilled the $100bn-a-year of climate aid the world\u2019s richest countries have pledged to the poorest by 2020, Ban said.\n\u201cWithout the US, we have a lot of difficulties, particularly mobilising financing,\u201d he said, adding that he was particularly concerned about the one-third of funding the US would normally provide to committees administering billions of dollars in climate money.\n\u201cWho will make up all this losses which will not be paid by the US? That\u2019s a serious problem now,\u201d he said.\nHe said the private sector may have to play a greater role than previously envisaged, and he was working with the World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, the former UN secretary general Kofi Annan and the former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres to address the challenge.\nDespite these setbacks to climate action, Ban said he was encouraged that China was still fully committed to reducing emissions. \u201cPresident Xi Jinping clearly mentioned that China is fully onboard, understanding that the climate is changing,\u201d Ban said of a meeting with the Chinese leader in November.\nAnother promising sign was the We Are Still In campaign, a group of US cities, states and businesses that have pledged to stick to the Paris targets regardless of Trump. \u201cThis is a groundswell of people,\u201d Ban said.\nHe said he would dedicate his life beyond the UN to continuing climate change advocacy.\nDespite the US\u2019s backtracking, Ban said he remained confident the world could meet the target of limiting temperature increases to less than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and the aspiration to keep them under 1.5C. \u201cI am quite optimistic we will make it happen,\u201d he said.\nBan was recently appointed president of the Seoul-based Global Green Growth Institute, which he hopes to expand beyond its 28 member countries.",

"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "A landmark court case in the Northern Territory is set to consider a challenge to a massive land-clearing approval based on its impacts on climate change.\nThe case, brought by the Environment Centre NT, is believed to be the first of its kind in Australia, using the consideration of greenhouse gas emissions from clearing as a lever to seek to have an approval overturned.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s groundbreaking,\u201d said Shar Molloy, director of ECNT.\nIn November 2017, the Northern Territory government approved the clearing of 20,432 hectares of land on the Maryfield station property \u2013 an area more than three times the size of Manhattan.\nThe clearing application was referred to the Northern Territory Environmental Protection Agency, which decides whether an action requires a full environmental assessment.\nThe NTEPA briefly considered the greenhouse gas emissions from the action concluding that they \u201care likely to make a considerable contribution to the NT\u2019s annual greenhouse gas emissions\u201d.\nBut the assessment went on to say the NTEPA did not consider that would be a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on the environment. The reasoning they gave was that the NT government does not have a policy on the matter.\nDespite the proposed clearing being the largest ever approved in the NT, and previous smaller applications forced to undergo environmental assessment, the NTEPA decided a full environmental assessment was not needed for the Maryfield clearing.\nIt went on to recommend to the pastoral lands board, which is the final decision maker, that the clearing be approved with a number of conditions related to biodiversity.\nThe pastoral lands board then approved the clearing, but ignored some of those conditions.\nThe ECNT, represented by the Environmental Defenders Office NT, is alleging that both the NTEPA and the pastoral lands board failed to properly consider the impacts of the clearing on greenhouse gas emissions.\nIt is widely thought to be the first Australian case to challenge the approval of a land clearing action on the basis of its impact on climate change.\nGiven the scale of the clearing, EDO NT principal lawyer Gillian Duggin said \u201cit is of substantial public interest for the court to explore the errors we say exist in their decision making processes\u201d.\n\u201cThe decisions challenged by this case have drawn attention to the significant weaknesses in the current legal and policy frameworks for land clearing and climate change in the Northern Territory \u2013 this is a major concern for our client,\u201d Duggin said.\nMolloy said they decided to take up the case because they were shocked by the scale of the approval, and the fact it occurred without a full environmental assessment.\n\u201cThis huge clearing permit granted should never have been granted. It will wipe out intact forest and woodland, threatens native wildlife, and will increase the NT\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said Molloy.\n\u201cIt is the biggest clearing permit ever granted in the NT. For the NT EPA to find a full environmental assessment was not necessary is completely untenable.\u201d\nGlenn Walker from The Wilderness Society said the clearing is likely to cause up to about 3 megatonnes of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions. That figure is based on detailed scientific studies of clearing on nearby properties, and is difficult to get a firm estimate of.\n\u201cOn a territory scale, the emissions from this one station, and the deforestation that could occur, is equal to 15 to 20% of the Northern Territory\u2019s annual emissions,\u201d said Walker. \u201cThat\u2019s an enormous dent in their emissions reduction efforts.\u201d\nDuggin said that while it is concerning that the NT government has failed to put in place an emissions or climate change policy, that does not mean the EPA can avoid considering greenhouse gas emissions when assessing clearing proposals.\n\u201cIn this case, however, it is the responsibility of the EPA to make its decisions according to the legislation that exists, notwithstanding the absence of a climate change policy. Our client will argue that hasn\u2019t occurred in this instance\u201d, said Duggin.\nBruce Lindsay, a lawyer at Environment Justice Australia in Melbourne said the case would be keenly watched by environmental lawyers around the country, and there could be scope for similar challenges elsewhere.\n\u201cI think under our amended Climate Change Act 2017 in Victoria there is scope for decision makers and policy makers to be required to take account of climate change, although in rather hedged language,\u201d said Lindsay. \u201cThis has not yet been tested in a judicial proceeding.\u201d\nLand clearing in Australia has been a significant contributor to the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn 1990, before short-lived land-clearing controls came into law in Queensland, a quarter of Australia\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions were caused by deforestation. Emissions from land clearing dropped after 2010 but are rising sharply again.\nWhile in recent decades, the majority of the country\u2019s clearing has occurred in Queensland, other states and territories look like they could be following in Queensland\u2019s footsteps.\nIn 2016 and 2017, the NT government approved about 45,500 hectares of land for clearing through the Pastoral Lands Board. That was an almost tenfold jump over the average of the previous 12 years of about 4,600 hectares, which was already an area two-thirds the size of Manhattan", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/logging-and-land-clearing", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/forests", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/northern-territory", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change"], "description": "Northern Territory government-approved land clearing likely to cause up to 3 megatonnes of C02-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions", "date_published": {"$date": 1520528414000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1520542720000}, "authors": ["Michael Slezak"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Environment", "Australia news", "Logging and land-clearing", "Trees and forests", "Northern Territory", "Climate change"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/09/landmark-case-challenges-land-clearing-based-on-climate-change-impact", "og:description": "Northern Territory government-approved land clearing likely to cause up to 3 megatonnes of C02-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acf6835bb690af6e15f914ce5de0a910b69eab27/0_261_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=c6fca54bc441a34aaf1ad7a01f386799", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Landmark case challenges land clearing based on climate change impact"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acf6835bb690af6e15f914ce5de0a910b69eab27/0_261_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f201838b1064ff348af3b792033c458a", "width": "4896", "height": "2938", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acf6835bb690af6e15f914ce5de0a910b69eab27/0_261_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a9079e67260a9686f02e5137ea545654", "description": "The majority of Australia\u2019s land-clearing has occurred in Queensland, but other states and territories look like they could be following in its footsteps.\nPhotograph: Not required"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556127789967}, "comments": [{"id": "113377175", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1520763313000}, "author": "GoldenAppleCorps", "author_id": "17327071", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "I think the conventional wisdom is that agricultural yields will always expand to meet demand.

Belfast Coastal Reserve is one of the most significant sites for threatened hooded plovers, critically endangered orange-bellied parrots, and numerous migratory shorebirds.\nThe horses are intimidating local beachgoers, risking the safety of the general public, and putting our vulnerable wildlife at risk.\nHooded plovers cannot co-exist with commercial racehorse training because it churns up the sand, disturbs the chicks and nesting birds, crushes eggs and damages protective nest fencing. \nBut the Andrews Government plans to reward the commercial racehorse trainers by giving them a licence to continue, and allowing a major increase of up to 250 racehorses per day thundering along the beach!\nIn January 2018, Parks Victoria released the draft coastal management plan for the Belfast Coastal Reserve, which reversed a cap on racehorses numbers put in place in 2016. Just 12 months earlier a factsheet produced by the state government acknowledged the rapid increase in horse numbers. The draft management plan itself recognises that it fails to reduce risks to high conservation zones.Community concerns continue to mount about the impacts of commercial racehorse training on the reserve\u2019s natural, cultural and recreational values; the protection of which was the reason for the reserve being created in the first place during the 1980s. This is essentially an act of privatisation of our public beaches.\nYou can help!Make a submission: Submissions are open until next Friday 16 March.

Inclusion and equity concerns means we are losing momentum and public support on climate change.\u201d\nThe quibbling comes as climate change tightens its grip on the west coast. San Francisco can lay claim to being one of the greenest cities in the US, through its embrace of clean energy, mandated recycling and banning of single-use plastic bags, yet it faces a steep challenge to avoid the ravages of sea level rise.\nResearchers using satellite-based radar and GPS have discovered large areas of land beside the San Francisco bay is sinking, exacerbating the threat from sea level rise and storms. Places such as San Francisco airport, Foster City and Treasure Island are subsiding by as much as 10mm a year, doubling the area previously considered at risk of flooding by the end of the century, according to the Science Advances-published study.\n In all, around 48 to 166 sq miles of the bay\u2019s shoreline is set to be prone to flooding, even under a moderate rate of sea level rise. This scenario would worsen if melting glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica trigger a far faster rate of ocean expansion. \n \u201cThere are about 7 million people living on the bay who could be vulnerable\u201d said Patrick Barnard, a geologist at the US Geological Survey who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.\n\u201cA huge number of people along the west coast are in low-lying areas, in Los Angeles and San Francisco all the way up to Seattle. All the options will have to be on the table, from replenishing coastal marshes to sea walls to managed retreat.\u201d\nCalifornia is facing a buffeting from increased flooding \u2013 around $763bn if its assets are exposed to inundation \u2013 at the same time as parts of its agriculture base declines due to rising temperatures.\n Recent University of California research found that the yield of some crops could drop by 40% by 2050, with the situation becoming so severe by the end of the century that peaches, walnuts and apricots may be unviable in the central valley. Almonds, avocados, cherries and strawberries also face sharp crop declines.\nFaced with such threats, the governors of California, Washington and Oregon have spearheaded criticism of Trump for taking a hammer to national climate policies and withdrawing the US from the Paris climate accords. But progress hasn\u2019t been much easier closer to home.\nWhile California has a statewide emissions reduction scheme, it has clashed with the Trump administration over the state\u2019s stringent vehicle fuel standards. And California\u2019s neighbors to the north are struggling to demonstrate that states can compensate for the lack of federal action on climate change, even those where Democrats have a firm grip on power.\n Last week, an effort to introduce the first straight tax on carbon dioxide emissions failed in Washington state, with governor Jay Inslee admitting it couldn\u2019t pass the Democrat-controlled senate. \u201cOn the arc of history, we\u2019re not quite far along enough on the arc,\u201d said Inslee, a Democrat and vocal proponent of action on climate change. \u201cThat day will come, but it wasn\u2019t quite here yet.\u201d\n The tax, which would\u2019ve started at $20 per ton CO2 emitted, faced criticism it would increase the cost of energy or, conversely, that it wouldn\u2019t generate sufficient money for clean energy programs. Meanwhile, in Oregon, another state dominated by elected Democrats, lawmakers failed to agree on a cap on greenhouse gases and will instead revisit the issue in 2019.\nThe stuttering progress of climate change policies sits awkwardly with international assurances from the broad coalition opposed to Trump that the US has not given up on tackling dangerous global warming.\n\u201cRather than getting bogged down in how money from a carbon tax would be spent, we need to make climate change a bipartisan issue again,\u201d said Aseem Prakash, the director of the center for environmental politics at the University of Washington. \n\u201cEnvironment groups need to reach out to Republicans for workable policy, not policy that\u2019s perfect in every single way.\u201d ", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/sea-level", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-francisco", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oceans", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "California, Washington and Oregon have led criticism of Trump\u2019s climate policies, but change hasn\u2019t been easier closer to home", "date_published": {"$date": 1520450450000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1530823576000}, "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Sea level", "San Francisco", "Environment", "California", "US news", "Trump administration", "US politics", "Oceans", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/07/san-francisco-rising-sea-level-threat-climate-change", "og:description": "California, Washington and Oregon have led criticism of Trump\u2019s climate policies, but change hasn\u2019t been easier closer to home", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c1c8731b5d9b554b7eb68e127b554ec763ff069/0_0_5170_3103/master/5170.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=37193a7213b83998f8c1062ad4d853a0", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Climate change tightens grip on US west coast despite progressive aspirations"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c1c8731b5d9b554b7eb68e127b554ec763ff069/0_0_5170_3103/master/5170.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ede71760365d6115da27a44110686805", "width": "5170", "height": "3103", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c1c8731b5d9b554b7eb68e127b554ec763ff069/0_0_5170_3103/master/5170.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0c75d7db3064ca4ca30532fb9e264931", "description": "An aerial view of San Francisco.

There never, not just in human but in ALL of earth's history, a change like this, this fast and due to the causes.\nWe can analyse the CO2 - the isotope content - that is added and appearing in higher concentration in the atmosphere. The natural occuring CO2 has a different isotope count then that which is released when we burn CO2. Easy to measure. The CO2 that is massively increasing matches the isotope counts of CO2 that is released when burning Fossil Fuels. That, too, is simply measurable. There's no known natural source of CO2 of that type. No modelling, actual data, and clear evidence that we humans are the source of the added greenhouse gas. \nDetails here, among many other places: http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/how-do-we-know-that-recent-cosub2sub-increases-are-due-to-human-activities-updated/", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "113309397", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "the causes", "effect": "this fast and"}]}, {"id": "113290032", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1520548605000}, "author": "DennisHorne", "author_id": "4446531", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "You can't scare climate science deniers.

Particularly recently, as deeply entrenched institutional inequalities and biases are brought to light \u2013 not only in food but across numerous industries \u2013 a nagging question presents itself: am I doing something meaningful with my life?\nThese panicky moments vary in severity. Some are passing irritations that strike as we stand at the sink peeling a bucket of carrots, or while staring blankly at white pixels on a screen trying to come up with yet another word for \u201cdelicious\u201d. Other times, it feels existential. More than a few people have left successful restaurant careers to pursue something they find more consequential. But the narrative you hear more frequently is about the person who leaves their desk job to work with something more tangible \u2013 namely food.\nThis is more or less my experience. I worked for the better part of a decade editing books \u2013 oral histories documenting human rights crises, experimental fiction, literary nonfiction, that sort of thing. If you\u2019d asked me at the time, I would have labelled such work as serious work, as opposed to my lifelong interest in food, which I would have described as frivolous. And I would have been correct on some level. While for most of human existence, food has been a survival necessity, it hasn\u2019t been confined to that role for more than a millennium. In the economically advantaged parts of the world, the majority of us don\u2019t eat most of our meals because we need to; we eat because we want to.\nBut my experience of working in the food world has been different from what I expected. Seven years ago, I left my serious publishing job to make a food magazine called Lucky Peach. At one point during the magazine\u2019s run, I doubled down on the food world and started a nonprofit organisation called ZeroFoodprint, which helps restaurants understand and reduce their climate impact. Whenever I ask myself what the hell I\u2019m doing, I try to take the long view of these two endeavours.\nI won\u2019t get too deep into the nitty-gritty of restaurants\u2019 relationship to climate change, but the long and short of it is that growing, shipping, cooking and disposing of food is a major contributor to greenhouse gases. It\u2019s not impossible to counteract the effect \u2013 in fact, it\u2019s easier than people think \u2013 but it still takes time and thought and a little bit of money. But the payoff for doing so is largely intangible: you feel better about yourself and there\u2019s some unsubstantiated logic that, if you do right by the world, people will notice and come to your restaurant.\nBut even with such vague rewards, restaurants have been eager to do their part. Chefs and restaurateurs reach out to our organisation to ask how they can contribute. They open up to us about how much money they spend on ingredients and energy, where it comes from and how they use it. Then they listen to what they can do better. It\u2019s a mind-boggling and uplifting thing to witness.\nWe\u2019ve helped multiple restaurants go completely carbon-neutral, and dozens more reduce their emissions. For instance, a few years ago, the restaurant Noma in Copenhagen learned through our study that they were getting their electricity from a coal-fired power plant. By sending an email to their power company and requesting their power source be switched to a sustainable one, they reduced their emissions by 30%. Their energy bill went up, but they didn\u2019t flinch.\nThere are limitations to what restaurants can change, of course. Of all the things we eat, commodity-raised beef is the single largest contributor to climate change, owing mostly to poor manure-disposal techniques. High-end restaurants can turn to more sustainable choices (grass-fed and \u201ccarbon-ranched\u201d cattle are better alternatives) but as long as diners want $1 cheeseburgers, feedlot cows will continue to fart and poop our planet warmer. Plus, in the grand scheme of things, the restaurant industry makes up only a small part of the food system, which accounts for somewhere around a third of the world\u2019s greenhouse gases. Even if we recruited a thousand restaurants to go carbon-neutral, it wouldn\u2019t change the trajectory of the climate.\nBut this is where the frivolous side of food is important. Food is not simply a commodity \u2013 it\u2019s a cultural undertaking. In fact, it\u2019s pop culture. People admire chefs and covet restaurants. If chefs as a group decide that sustainable food is better food, consumers will follow. Twenty-five years ago, organic produce meant very little to most people. Thanks largely to the work of chefs, organic is now a widely held value.\nAnd there\u2019s the rub. Food\u2019s not a worthwhile pursuit in spite of its frivolity, but rather because of it. Whenever my chosen profession has me questioning my purpose, I think about the countless meals I\u2019ve had in the pursuit of good food and good stories \u2013 many of them with people who look differently, speak differently and believe and uphold opposing values to my own. It\u2019s too optimistic to say food can bridge these divides, but I think it can be shared ground.\nWe can choose to believe we have nothing in common with people on the other side of the aisle or the world, but the way we eat proves otherwise. I\u2019ve sat in restaurants with people whom I\u2019d never want to socialise with and had dinner with people whose opinions differ totally from mine except for a mutual affection for pizza and cold, cheap beer. That might not sound like much, but it\u2019s enough to get us around the same table. \u2022 Chris Ying is appearing at the Melbourne Food and Wine festival; he is presenting at the Theatre of Ideas \u2013 Sustainability on 17 March ($20-$40) and at the Eat Your Words by Cordon Bleu food-writing course on 17-18 March ($478).

The real-world testing showed a reduction in harmful emissions, but emissions from nitrogen oxides were still four times the levels observed in lab testing.\nConsumer group Choice said the results underscored the \u201curgent need\u201d to update the process used for testing cars sold in Australia.\n\u201cCalculating fuel use in a lab does little to help consumers understand the running and environmental costs of the cars they\u2019re buying,\u201d said Katinka Day, head of campaigns and policy at Choice. \u201cLab tests have also produced inconsistent results, which make realistic comparisons nearly impossible.

Almost 100,000 Australians own a car affected by the \u201cdefeat device\u201d software.\nA class action against Volkswagen on behalf of Australian owners is being heard in the federal court in Sydney. \nAs the federal government prepares to release new vehicle emissions standards, the AAA has argued there is no point setting tougher standards \u201cunless information on real-world performance is in the hands of consumers\u201d.\nVolkswagen has rejected the AAA\u2019s findings on the fuel efficiency of its recalled cars. \n\u201cThe German government approved Volkswagen\u2019s software update on the basis that it did not adversely affect the emissions or fuel economy of vehicles in test conditions,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThe leading motorists\u2019 organisations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland have tested vehicles and concluded that vehicles continue to perform as expected after the software update.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/business/automotive-industry", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/air-pollution", "https://www.theguardian.com/money/consumer-affairs", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/motoring", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Australian Automobile Association calls for real-world testing after finding nitrogen oxide emissions four times the levels observed in lab", "date_published": {"$date": 1520816344000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1520820549000}, "authors": ["Amy McNeilage"], "article_section": "Business", "article_tags": ["Volkswagen (VW)", "Automotive industry", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "Air pollution", "Consumer affairs", "Climate change", "Motoring", "Australia news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/12/volkswagens-in-australia-using-more-diesel-after-recall-research-finds", "og:description": "Australian Automobile Association calls for real-world testing after finding nitrogen oxide emissions four times the levels observed in lab", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25f2f699f59b99e388703e57ecefa672ce92cc03/0_224_5446_3268/master/5446.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=0b159694a1b4028b4de8f801827657b6", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Volkswagens in Australia using more diesel after recall, research finds"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25f2f699f59b99e388703e57ecefa672ce92cc03/0_224_5446_3268/master/5446.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c8441747247eb7765494ff6714a842df", "width": "5446", "height": "3268", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25f2f699f59b99e388703e57ecefa672ce92cc03/0_224_5446_3268/master/5446.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=10291e1ca671adaa5145b5822d54b1f6", "description": "Volkswagens in Australia have been found to use more diesel after a recall.\nPhotograph: Alexander Koerner/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc08406a2c3613145ed9025"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/12/climate-change-is-a-disaster-foretold-just-like-the-first-world-war", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "\u201cThe lamps are going out all over Europe, we shall not see them lit again in our life-time.\u201d\nThe mournful remark supposedly made by foreign secretary Sir Edward Grey at dusk on 3 August 1914 referred to Britain\u2019s imminent entry into the first world war. But the sentiment captures something of our own moment, in the midst of an intensifying campaign against nature.\nAccording to the World Wildlife Fund\u2019s 2016 Living Planet Report, over the last four decades the international animal population was reduced by nearly 60%. More than a billion fewer birds inhabit North America today compared to 40 years ago. In Britain, certain iconic species (grey partridges, tree sparrows, etc) have fallen by 90%. In Germany, flying insects have declined by 76% over the past 27 years. Almost half of Borneo\u2019s orangutans died or were removed between 1999 and 2015. Elephant numbers have dropped by 62% in a decade, with on average one adult killed by poachers every 15 minutes.\nWe inherited a planet of beauty and wonders \u2013 and we\u2019re saying goodbye to all that.\nThe cultural historian Paul Fussell once identified the catastrophe of the first world war with the distinctive sensibility of modernity, noting how 20th century history had \u201cdomesticate[d] the fantastic and normalize[d] the unspeakable.\u201d\nConsider, then, the work of climate change.\nIn February, for instance, scientists recorded temperatures 35 degrees above the historical average in Siberia, a phenomenon that apparently corresponded with the unprecedented cold snap across Europe.\nAs concentrated CO2 intensifies extreme events, a new and diabolical weather will, we\u2019re told, become the norm for a generation already accustomising itself to such everyday atrocities as about eight million tons of plastics are washed into the ocean each year.\nIt may seem impossible to imagine, that a technologically advanced society could choose, in essence, to destroy itself, but that is what we\u2019re now in the process of doing.\u201d\nThis passage from the New Yorker\u2019s Elizabeth Kolbert concluded a piece on global warming, which was published way back in 2005. Over the 13 years since, the warnings from scientists have grown both more specific and desperate \u2013 and yet the march to destruction has only redoubled its pace.\nThe extraordinary \u2013 almost absurd \u2013 contrast between what we should be doing and what\u2019s actually taking place fosters low-level climate denialism. Coral experts might publicise, again and again and again, the dire state of the Great Barrier Reef but the ongoing political inaction inevitably blunts their message.\nIt can\u2019t be so bad, we think: if a natural wonder were truly under threat, our politicians wouldn\u2019t simply stand aside and watch.\nThe first world war killed 20 million people and maimed 21 million others. It shattered the economy of Europe, displaced entire populations, and set in train events that culminated, scarcely two decades later, with another, even more apocalyptic slaughter\nAnd it, too, was a disaster foretold, a widely-anticipated cataclysm that proceeded more-on-less schedule despite regular warnings about what was to come.\nAs early as 1898, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia initiated a conference to discuss international arbitration and limit the arms race taking place in Europe. At its opening session at The Hague, he noted that the competition between nations, in which each country was building up its forces to defend against its neighbours, had \u201ctransform[ed] the armed peace into a crushing burden that weighs on all nations and, if prolonged, will lead to the very cataclysm that it seeks to avert.\u201d\nOver the next years, the rivalries intensified, leading to further militarisation and a complex series of (often secret) treaties, as, between 1908 and 1913, the military spending of the major powers increased by 50%.\nIn 1912, the international socialist movement had staged an emergency meeting in Basel in Switzerland in which representatives from almost every nation spoke out for peace.\n\u201cThe great European peoples are constantly on the point of being driven against one another,\u201d the congress resolved, \u201calthough these attempts are against humanity and reason cannot be justified by even the slightest pretext of being in the interest of the people.\u201d\nYet in early 1914, Winston Churchill noted that \u201cthe world is arming as it has never armed before\u201d. The eventual declaration of war in August that year was still a shock \u2013 but only in the sense that those attending a patient expiring from a long illness might be startled by the death rattle.\nThe appeals to humanity and reason did not move states jostling for trade and commercial advantages. For the people of Europe, the arms race was disastrous; for specific governments, it made perfect sense, for those who did not compete risked falling behind.\nThe same might be said today.\nFrom a global perspective, the necessity to abandon fossil fuels cannot be denied. But for individual economies, change risks undermining comparative advantages.\nIf we don\u2019t sell coal, says Malcolm Turnbull, our competitors will \u2013 which was, of course precisely the logic of the British fleet expansion in 1908.\nThe devastation of the first world war eventually engendered a wave of revolt from a populace appalled at the carnage their politicians had wrought.\nClimate change has not yet spurred an equivalent of the mutinies in France or the revolution in Petrograd or the uprising in Berlin.\nYet Labor\u2019s appalling equivocation over the Adani mine \u2013 a piece of environmental vandalism for which there can be no justification \u2013 illustrates the urgency with which we need a new and different type of politics.\nThe stakes could not be higher. Lamps are going out all over the natural world \u2026 and no one will ever see them lit again.\n\u2022 Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/science/extinct-wildlife", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/firstworldwar", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The warnings about an unfolding climate catastrophe are getting more desperate, yet the march to destruction continues", "date_published": {"$date": 1520816544000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1520821431000}, "authors": ["Jeff Sparrow"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "Extinct wildlife", "First world war"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/12/climate-change-is-a-disaster-foretold-just-like-the-first-world-war", "og:description": "The warnings about an unfolding climate catastrophe are getting more desperate, yet the march to destruction continues", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d99b3bc855947c5ec9985427f91bec7fec9d3cc/0_289_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=429698122526e7a9bedf241fe596720d", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Climate change is a disaster foretold, just like the first world war | Jeff Sparrow"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d99b3bc855947c5ec9985427f91bec7fec9d3cc/0_289_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3517fbb61074ebaa211b334863d12f14", "width": "5616", "height": "3370", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d99b3bc855947c5ec9985427f91bec7fec9d3cc/0_289_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ffca5667969a7406de53ef780644fa08", "description": "\u2018The extraordinary \u2013 almost absurd \u2013 contrast between what we should be doing and what\u2019s actually taking place fosters low-level climate denialism\u2019\nPhotograph: Guido Dingemans/Alamy Stock Photo"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556127801223}, "comments": [{"id": "113556895", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1521067910000}, "author": "RJander", "author_id": "15758543", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Ah.

This warming sharply reversed the long- term cooling trend that had likely been caused by the orbitally- driven decreasing summer insolation with the positive feedbacks from ice and snow albedo (e.g., Otto-Bliesner et al., 2006b). Subglacial material exposed by retreating glaciers in the Canadian Arctic corroborates that modern temperatures are higher than any time in at least the past 1600 years (Anderson et al., 2008). An even longer perspective for the outstanding magnitude of the modern warming and related ice loss is provided by the history of ice shelves at the northern coast of Ellsemere Island, which are made of super- thickened landfast ice supported by pack ice in the adjacent Arctic Ocean. These ice shelves have been stable for most of the last 5.5 kyr based on driftwood ages (England et al., 2008), but declined by more than 90% during the 20th century and continue to break at a notable rate (Mueller et al., 2008).\nBQEND\nBQSTART\nthe accelerated ice loss during the last several decades lead to conditions not documented in at least the last few thousand years.\nBQEND", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "113445357", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "all", "effect": "the same conclusion that current sea ice is lower than any time in the past few thousand years"}, {"cause": "the orbitally- driven decreasing summer insolation with the positive feedbacks from ice and snow albedo", "effect": "that"}, {"cause": "bqend bqstart the accelerated ice loss during the last several decades", "effect": "conditions not documented in at least the last few thousand years"}]}, {"id": "113455019", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1520901429000}, "author": "Tony B", "author_id": "13732825", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\"Then they wonder why the guardian opens fewer & fewer articles for comment.\"\nWhen it comes to climate science, the comments based on scientific reason explaining why AGW is a problem are drowned out by the largely scientifically ignorant denislist claims.\nScientific enquiry is the only valid mechanism for evaluating whether climate change is happening.", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "113434648", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "113457130", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1520908074000}, "author": "ID9766495", "author_id": "3333597", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "The two are not mutually exclusive.", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "113456748", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "113457117", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1520908008000}, "author": "ID9766495", "author_id": "3333597", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Same old fiction", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "113456788", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "113454598", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1520900478000}, "author": "Shock_Horror_Not", "author_id": "18542771", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Too hard to read and make a thoughtful reply is it?

In this event, coined \u201cthe Great Dying,\u201d over 90% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species went extinct. It took about 10 million years for life on Earth to recover from this catastrophic event.\nScientists have proposed a number of possible culprits responsible for this mass extinction, including an asteroid impact, mercury poisoning, a collapse of the ozone layer, and acid rain. Heavy volcanic activity in Siberia was suspected to play a key role in the end-Permian event.\nRecently, geologist Dr Benjamin Burger identified a rock layer in Utah that he believed might have formed during the Permian and subsequent Triassic period that could shed light on the cause of the Great Dying.\nDuring the Permian, Earth\u2019s continents were still combined as one Pangea, and modern day Utah was on the supercontinent\u2019s west coast. Samples from the end-Permian have been collected from rock layers in Asia, near the volcanic eruptions, but Utah was on the other side of Pangaea. Burger\u2019s samples could thus provide a unique perspective of what was happening on the other side of the world from the eruptions. Burger collected and analyzed samples from the rock layer, and documented the whole process in a fascinating video:\nBurger\u2019s samples painted a grim picture of Earth\u2019s environment at the end of the Permian period. A sharp drop in calcium carbonate levels indicated that the oceans had become acidic. A similar decline in organic content matched up with the immense loss of life in the oceans during this period. The presence of pyrite pointed to an anoxic ocean (without oxygen), meaning the oceans were effectively one massive dead zone. \nBacteria ate the oversupply of dead bodies, producing hydrogen sulfide gas, creating a toxic atmosphere. The hydrogen sulfide oxidized in the atmosphere to form sulfur dioxide, creating acid rain, which killed much of the plant life on Earth. Elevated barium levels in the samples had likely been carried up from the ocean depths by a massive release of methane. \nLevels of various metals in the rock samples were critical in identifying the culprit of this mass extinction event. As in end-Permian samples collected from other locations around the world, Burger didn\u2019t find the kinds of rare metals that are associated with asteroid impacts. There simply isn\u2019t evidence that an asteroid struck at the right time to cause the Great Dying.\nHowever, Burger did find high levels of mercury and lead in his samples, coinciding with the end of the Permian period. Mercury has also been identified in end-Permian samples from other sites. Lead and mercury aren\u2019t associated with volcanic ash, but they are a byproduct of burning coal. Burger also identified a shift from heavier carbon-13 to lighter carbon-12; the latter results from burning fossil fuels.\nThe Permian was the end of the Carboniferous period, which means \u201ccoal-bearing.\u201d Many large coal deposits were created in the Carboniferous, including in Asia. Previous research has shown that the Permian mass extinction event didn\u2019t coincide with the start of the Siberian volcanic eruptions and lava flows, but rather 300,000 years later. That\u2019s when the lava began to inject as sheets of magma underground, where Burger\u2019s data suggests it ignited coal deposits.\nThe coal ignition triggered the series of events that led to Earth\u2019s worst mass extinction. Its sulfur emissions created the acid rain that killed forests. Its carbon emissions acidified the oceans and warmed the planet, killing most marine life. The dead bodies fed bacteria that produced toxic hydrogen sulfide gas, which in turn killed off more species. The warming of the oceans produced a large methane release, which accelerated global warming faster yet. As Burger put it,\nThings went from bad to worse, and you can now begin to understand how life nearly died out. Global warming, acid oceans, anoxia, not to mention a toxic atmosphere. We are lucky to be alive at all!\nScientists are observing many of the same signs of dangerously rapid climate change today. There\u2019s more lighter carbon-12 in the atmosphere because the increase in atmospheric carbon levels is due entirely to humans burning fossil fuels. There are an increasing number of dead zones in the oceans. Burning coal was causing acid rain, although we largely solved that problem through Clean Air Acts, and in the US, a sulfur dioxide cap and trade system implemented by a Republican administration. \nWe\u2019ve had less success in tackling carbon dioxide pollution, which continues to rise. As a result, the oceans are becoming increasingly acidic, and temperatures increasingly hot.

The mean coal rank weighted by volume can't be determined from data either of us has found (yet). The mining takes place in sub-bituminous coals is a really all we know (and we don't even know that for sure but it seems probable given it's use as a thermal coal). This is an over simplification, but the \"natural\" rank of the coal, i.e. that based on it's depth of burial appears to be low. Only the coal subjected to the heat of intrusion, i.e. normally an \"unnatural\" event for coal, reaches the grade of anthracite, and probably then only very close to the dyke/sill/pipe. The 80 to 90% carbon by weight in-situ would only be correct if the coal was all anthracite, or maybe low-volatile bituminous, which is flat out false. Don't forget the ash ranges between 9 and 25% by weight, so even if the coal was all anthracite, it wouldn't reach 90% carbon in situ (although the specific gravity would be higher of course for high ash samples of anthracite).\n2. All the coals in your referenced study are bituminous. You can tell this by looking at the mean maximum vitrinite reflectance values.

The rank probably spans the range of Hi-Vol B to Low volatile bituminous coals in this study, so it's not a relevant counterpoint.\n3. \nBQSTART\nIt is obvious by the context of this paragraph that the \"moderately thick coal bed of 20-30 m\" refers to cumulative thickness.\nBQEND\nNo it's not.

Nobody has done more for advancing clean energy on the grid than France. In light of this knowledge, we are also writing to express our alarm at your decision to move France away from clean nuclear power.\nFew nations have done more than France to demonstrate the humanitarian and environmental benefits of creating a high-energy, nuclear-powered, and electrified society. Not only was France host of United Nations climate talks, it also has some of the lowest per capita carbon emissions of any developed nation.\nAny reduction in France\u2019s nuclear generation will increase fossil fuel generation and pollution given the low capacity factors and intermittency of solar and wind. Germany is a case in point. Its emissions have been largely unchanged since 2009 and actually increased in both 2015 and 2016 due to nuclear plant closures. Despite having installed 4 percent more solar and 11 percent more wind capacity, Germany\u2019s generation from the two sources decreased 3 percent and 2 percent respectively, since it wasn\u2019t as sunny or windy in 2016 as in 2015.\nAnd where France has some of the cheapest and cleanest electricity in Europe, Germany has some of the most expensive and dirtiest. Germany spent nearly 24 billion euros above market price in 2016 for its renewable energy production feed-in tariffs alone, but emissions have remained stagnant. Germany is set to miss its 2020 emission reduction goals by a wide margin. Despite its huge investment in renewables, only 46 percent of Germany\u2019s electricity comes from clean energy sources as compared to 93 percent in France.\nSolar and wind can play an important role in France. However, if France is to make investments in solar and wind similar to those of Germany, they should add to France\u2019s share of clean energy, not inadvertently reduce it. Renewables can contribute to the further electrification of the transportation sector, which France has already done with its trains and should continue to do with personal vehicles.\nShifting from nuclear to fossil fuels and renewables would grievously harm the French economy in three ways: higher electricity prices for consumers and industry, an end to France\u2019s lucrative electricity exports, and \u2014 perhaps most importantly \u2014 the destruction of France\u2019s nuclear export sector. If the French nuclear fleet is forced to operate at lower capacity factors, it will cripple the French nuclear industry by adding costs and shrinking revenues. Eventually this will lead to poorer safety standards and less opportunities to fund research, development and efforts to export French nuclear technologies. Nations seeking to build new nuclear plants rightly want to know that the product France is selling is one that France itself values.\nThe French nuclear program has historically been the envy of the world. It demonstrated in the 1970s and 80s that the decarbonization of an industrialized country\u2019s electricity sector is in fact possible. For France, the next necessary step to help combat climate change and improve air quality is to increase clean electricity from all non-fossil sources and massively reduce fossil fuels used in heating and the transportation sector. Nuclear power must play a central role in this.\nSigned,James Hansen, Climate Science, Awareness, and Solutions Program, Columbia University, Earth Institute, Columbia University... and 47 othershttp://energyforhumanity.org/en/news-events/news/campaigns/open-letter-president-macron/\nI agree with the scientists Rob - you say you do too....", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "113443482", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "nuclear plant closures", "effect": "actually increased in both 2015 and 2016"}, {"cause": "this", "effect": "poorer safety standards and less opportunities to fund research"}]}, {"id": "113619954", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1521189337000}, "author": "GoldenAppleCorps", "author_id": "17327071", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Read the paper - 5% risk of greater than catastrophic climate change - including existential threats.

Such an eruption would last only 14 days as the coal/ magma mix is soon depleted. The intrusion of magma would work its way through the coal seams producing further vents and small eruptions. While these small vent eruptions would be explosive any craters created would be small and would have been buried by the non-intrusive Triassic basalts that followed.\nWhile craters or more correctly calderas 11,000 sq km in size are formed in island arc volcanism - for example Lake Toba, the mafic intrusion of coal seam volcanism produces instead a series of short lived small vents and small craters.\n\"1000 cubic km is approximately 1.5 trillion tons of coal-in-situ, but many orders of magnitude of interburden above the coal would need to have been 'exploded' to surface.\"\nAt the time of the mafic intrusions the Siberian coal measures would have been relatively young with at most only 60 millions years of overburden above them - its thickness dependent on the erosion and depositional history that followed its deposition.

This why paleo scientists now call it the Medieval Climate Anomaly.

That tax would be imposed on top of the existing 33% luxury vehicle tax for cars in that price range and is expected to generate $500m a year over a limited four-year run.\nA University of New South Wales researcher, Gail Broadbent, who is studying electric vehicles at the university\u2019s school of biological, earth, and environmental sciences, said the targets were achievable and would increase Australia\u2019s sluggish adoption of electric vehicles, provided exemptions were included for remote Indigenous communities that were unlikely to have access to a charging station.\nBroadbent said introducing strict vehicle emissions targets was essential for increasing the uptake of hybrid, electric, fuel cell and other zero-emissions vehicles in Australia.\n\u201cThere is no incentive for vehicle manufacturers to bring them into the country so we just get fobbed off the old vehicles,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cElectric vehicles are cheaper to maintain so there\u2019s no incentive for manufacturers to bring them here if the policy settings do not shift.\u201d\nThe proposal would also impose targets on large car manufacturers so that 2% of all car and light vehicle sales in Australia in 2020, increasing to 10% by 2050, were of zero-emissions vehicles.\nElectric cars make up just 0.1% of new car sales in Australia, compared with 20% in Norway and the Netherlands, which have both introduced targets to phase out fossil fuel emitting cars by 2025 and 2030 respectively. \nBroadbent said research by UNSW showed concern about the lack of charging stations was the biggest barrier to Australians purchasing an electric car. According to the environment and energy minister Josh Frydenberg, Australia has 476 public car charging stations.\nThe Turnbull government, through the ministerial forum on vehicle emissions, proposed introducing a mandatory 105g CO2 per km fuel efficiency standard by 2025, prompting strong backlash from the automotive industry and lobby groups. \nA discussion paper excluded consideration of the fuel standards which would provide \u201cthe greatest health and environmental benefits\u201d.\nFrydenberg has said the federal government supports the rollout of electric vehicles, including offering a discount to the luxury car tax for low-emissions vehicles. He says he expects the number of electric vehicles on Australian roads to increase almost 60-fold to 230,000 cars by 2025.\nThe Greens climate change and energy spokesman, Adam Bandt, called on Labor to support the policy, which was to be announced as part of the Batman byelection campaign.\n\u201cThis plan is the quantum leap we need to reduce emissions, meet our paltry Paris targets and to stop people dying from air pollution,\u201d Bandt said.\nFederal Labor\u2019s emissions reduction policies are focused around a 50% renewable energy target by 2030, but the South Australian Labor government, which will go to the polls on the same day as Batman, has pledged to waive stamp duty and five years\u2019 registration costs for new electric or zero-emissions cars if re-elected.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-greens", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/motoring", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/travel-and-transport", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Tax on luxury fossil fuel cars to fund expansion of Australia\u2019s charging network", "date_published": {"$date": 1520891037000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1520956083000}, "authors": ["Calla Wahlquist"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Electric", "hybrid and low-emission cars", "Australia news", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "Australian Greens", "Australian politics", "Climate change", "Motoring", "Travel and transport", "Josh Frydenberg", "Batman byelection", "Tax", "Road transport", "Adam Bandt"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/13/greens-electric-car-push-end-sale-of-petrol-and-diesel-vehicles-by-2030", "og:description": "Tax on luxury fossil fuel cars to fund expansion of Australia\u2019s charging network", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4dad5fbe1268d075b55ef5a4c6e3176a6aa641e/0_612_4908_2946/master/4908.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=d1c63fd5ed1eaab8a0101856c318e234", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Greens electric car push: end sale of petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030"}, "headline": "0", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4dad5fbe1268d075b55ef5a4c6e3176a6aa641e/0_612_4908_2946/master/4908.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4668318742db1094a511e98cb5c3db18", "width": "4908", "height": "2946", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4dad5fbe1268d075b55ef5a4c6e3176a6aa641e/0_612_4908_2946/master/4908.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0df37a8576bc800332a5ba42307779c6", "description": "The Greens have promised a $151m national fund to build 3,000 electric vehicle charging points.\nPhotograph: Southern Stock/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc08416a2c3613145ed9028"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/12/weatherwatch-over-southern-ocean-clouds-are-made-to-a-different-recipe", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "What is the recipe for a cloud?

They get not only the clouds wrong, but the Ozone Hole, the influence of the various acronyms that populate climatology and meteorology-such as ENSO, STR, SAM, IOD, PDI, etc., the currents, and the fact that along the southern fringes of the various landmasses the air is unmediated by any other obstruction between them and Antarctica but big seas.", "recommendation_count": "5", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "113452361", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1520896162000}, "author": "Erik Frederiksen", "author_id": "15131989", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Within the last year or so there was a paper which analyzed satellite data going back to the 80s and found that clouds are moving towards the poles where there is less sunlight to reflect, an amplifying feedback.\nThe data also showed that clouds have been moving higher in altitude which is also an amplifying feedback.", "recommendation_count": "16", "causal_relations": null}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc08418a2c3613145ed9029"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/13/extreme-winter-weather-becoming-more-common-as-arctic-warms-study-finds", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "The sort of severe winter weather that has rattled parts of the US and UK is becoming more common as the Arctic warms, with scientists finding a strong link between high temperatures near the pole and unusually heavy snowfall and frigid weather further south.\nA sharp increase in temperatures across the Arctic since the early 1990s has coincided with an uptick in abnormally cold snaps in winter, particularly in the eastern US, according to new research that analyzed temperature data from 1950 onwards.\nExtreme cold winter weather is up to four times more likely when temperatures in the Arctic are unusually high, the study found. Researchers compared daily temperatures from across the Arctic region with something called the accumulated winter season severity index, which grades winter weather based on temperature, snow fall and snow depth, across 12 US cities.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a remarkably strong correlation between a warm Arctic and cold winter weather further south,\u201d said Judah Cohen, a climatologist at Atmospheric and Environmental Research. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex story \u2013 global warming is contributing to milder temperatures but is also having unforeseen consequences such as this.\u201d\nThe Arctic has just experienced its toastiest winter on record, with parts of the region 20C (68F) warmer than the long-term average, a situation scientists have variously described as \u201ccrazy,\u201d \u201cweird,\u201d and \u201csimply shocking\u201d. The far north latitudes are warming around twice as quickly as the global average, diminishing glaciers and sea ice and imperiling creatures such as polar bears.\nTwo large winter storms recently swept the US east coast in less than a week, unloading up to three inches of snow per hour in places, resulting in several deaths, thousands of cancelled flights, closed schools and snarled traffic.\nThe cold front even reached Florida, contributing to a recent surge in manatee deaths. So far this year, 166 of the marine mammals have been found dead off the state\u2019s coast, with stress from the cold the leading cause of mortality. \u201cManatees may join polar bears as one of the first iconic victims of extinction in the wild from climate change,\u201d said Jeff Ruch, executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility.\nThe US storms follow freezing winds from Siberia \u2013 dubbed the \u2018beast from the east\u2019 \u2013 that battered parts of Europe, with the British army deployed to help liberate hundreds of stranded drivers on UK motorways.\n\u201cThis winter is a great example of what we can expect from climate change,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cIn the US we had the \u2018bomb cyclone\u2019 in January, followed by July-like warm weather in February that I\u2019d never seen before. And now we\u2019ve had a parade of powerful winter storms and the beast from the east. It\u2019s mind boggling.\u201d\nThe research didn\u2019t look at the reasons behind the trend of see-sawing temperatures between the Arctic and areas to the south but Cohen said it was consistent with the theory that the polar vortex \u2013 which shot to public consciousness during a 2014 cold spell \u2013 is being disrupted as the earth heats up.\nThe polar vortex is a low pressure system that swirls around the polar region. Sometimes it can stray further south, bringing cold Arctic air with it. There is continuing conjecture over the impact climate change is having but some scientists believe warming temperatures could be weakening the polar vortex\u2019s flow, allowing it to meander towards the equator.\nThis nuanced picture of the consequences of climate change has been derided by Donald Trump, with the president using Twitter to mockingly reference cold weather during almost every winter in recent years. In December, Trump tweeted that \u201cperhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming\u201d amid plunging temperatures.\nScientists say this stance overlooks the complicated changes underway in the environment as the world warms due to human activity, by an average of around 1C over the past century. This temperature rise hasn\u2019t been uniform across the globe and has fueled an array of conditions, from increased flood risk in some areas to drought conditions and heatwaves in others.\nRichard Alley, a leading glacier and climate expert at Penn State who was not involved in Cohen\u2019s research, said the study is \u201cfascinating\u201d and \u201cimportant\u201d but added the discrepancy between Arctic temperatures and winter weather elsewhere could have other drivers, such as a warm Gulf of Mexico feeding extra energy into storms along the US east coast.\n \u201cThe broadest picture is that we are indeed warming the world\u2019s climate, primarily from carbon dioxide release from fossil-fuel burning, and this will impact us and other living things,\u201d said Alley. \nThe Arctic\u2019s role is seen quite differently by some other scientists, however, who point out that occasional outbursts of cold weather haven\u2019t altered the trend that winters in the US northeast have been getting warmer, particularly since the 1970s.\n\u201cThere have always been cold outbreaks. The cold air has to go somewhere,\u201d said Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.\n\u201cThe issue is whether the air stays put or gets loose. Some years it is contained, other years it breaks out. The question is where and what is the cause. This study reaffirms the relationship but not its cause. The Arctic likely plays a modest role in terms of feedbacks but it is unlikely it is a cause.\u201d", "share_count": "0", "description": "Scientists found a strong link between high temperatures near the pole and unusually heavy snowfall and frigid weather farther south.", "date_published": {"$date": 1520956843000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1520956920000}, "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "US news", "Environment", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/13/extreme-winter-weather-becoming-more-common-as-arctic-warms-study-finds", "og:description": "Scientists found a strong link between high temperatures near the pole and unusually heavy snowfall and frigid weather farther south.", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/128ca7a3a20fcd700898d376fda1a356f481a297/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=3fb29dab43d1bf849c12a2466b56a884", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Extreme winter weather becoming more common as Arctic warms, study finds"}, "headline": "d", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/128ca7a3a20fcd700898d376fda1a356f481a297/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a706204422d63241a558af736429611f", "width": "4000", "height": "2400", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/128ca7a3a20fcd700898d376fda1a356f481a297/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=703b853e62f9728e79a96cc1836c6cdd", "description": "Freezing weather conditions dubbed the \u2018Beast from the East\u2019 brought snow and sub-zero temperatures to the UK.\nPhotograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc0841fa2c3613145ed902a"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/14/worlds-great-forests-could-lose-half-of-all-wildlife-as-planet-warms-report", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "The world\u2019s greatest forests could lose more than half of their plant species by the end of the century unless nations ramp up efforts to tackle climate change, according to a new report on the impacts of global warming on biodiversity hotspots.\nMammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds are also likely to disappear on a catastrophic scale in the Amazon and other naturally rich ecosysterms in Africa, Asia, North America and Australia if temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, concludes the study by WWF, the University of East Anglia and the James Cook University.\nThe research in the journal Climate Change examined the impact of three different levels of warming \u2013 2C (the upper target in the 2015 Paris agreement), 3.2C (the likely rise given existing national commitments) and 4.5C (the forecast outcome if emissions trends remain unchanged) on nearly 80,000 plant and animal species in 35 of the world\u2019s most biodiverse regions.\nIf governments fail to set more ambitious commitments than those currently on the table, the report projects devastating losses of more than 60% of plant species and almost 50% of animal species in the Amazon at a temperature rise of 3.2C. \nIf countries lift their efforts sufficiently to reach the 2C goal, the outlook is improved \u2013 but still grim \u2013 with more than 35% of species at risk of local extinction in the region. If no actions are taken, the picture is apocalyptic, with a likely loss of more than 70% of plant and reptile species and a more than 60% decline of mammal, reptile and bird species in the Amazon.\nThe picture was similarly alarming in the two other worst affected areas \u2013 south-west Australia and the Miombo woodlands in Africa. But nowhere among the selected 35 hotspots escaped massive losses of wildlife, which would have a dire knock-on effect on human society and wellbeing.\nThe authors considered how warmer weather and wilder rainfall patterns (more droughts and storms) could negatively affect savannas in Africa, jungles in Bangladesh, the Cerrado-Pantanal in Brazil, the Yangtze delta and coastlines in Europe, Madagascar and the Caribbean. It noted how this would create tensions over water between humans and animals, for example African elephants, which drink as much as 250 litres (50 gallons) a day. Sea-level rises would also be devastating for many species, such as tigers in the Sundarbans, which would see 96% of breeding grounds submerged.\nThe losses might even be higher because the disappearance of one species - such as a tree - can have a knock-on effect on other ecosystems. Fewer plants can also means less rain, according to other recent studies on the role played by the Amazon. More pressing risks \u2013 such as habitat loss from land clearance and pollution \u2013 were not accounted for.\nWilliam Laurance, director of the Centre for Tropical Environmental and Sustainability Science, said: \u201cFor the Amazon and Guianas, the WWF report is scary as hell. The loss of half or more of the region\u2019s stunning plant diversity would be a biological blow of almost unimaginable severity.\n\u201cHowever, such computer models with all their assumptions and complexities are really \u2018scientific cartoons\u2019 giving us only a rough sketch of the future. But even if they\u2019re only half right, these are very frightening cartoons indeed.\u201d\nThe study considered two main ways to reduce these losses: adaptation (helping species to migrate to new territories) and mitigation (cutting greenhouse gases more aggressively). The former produced modest improvements thanks to the creation of eco-corridors between protected areas, but this was little help to slow-moving or almost stationary groups, such as orchids, plants, amphibians and reptiles. WWF said there may be a need to translocate such species, which would otherwise be outrun by the pace of climate change.\nA partial solution may be relocation. Some animals, such as wolves, have been successfully reintroduced to their former ranges. A paper published today by the Royal identified 130 areas across the globe that might be suitable for carnivore reintroduction and concluded that rewilding will be essential for conservation in the future.\nFar better, the authors say, is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to keep warming as close to 1.5C as possible.\n\u201cThe numbers are a bit of a wake-up call,\u201d said Stephen Cornelius, chief adviser to WWF on climate issues. \u201cIf there is one message it is that mitigation makes a big difference. But even that is not enough for a lot of species ... What will be the new normal in coming decades is not something that wildlife has seen before.\u201d\nExperts on Amazon wildlife said the findings were alarming, though they noted that such projections are a rough guide to the future.\n Last month, a separate study predicted an ecological tipping point if 25% of the Amazon is deforested, which would cause droughts and environmental degradation over a wider area. The authors argue the 2014-15 drought in S\u00e3o Paulo is a precursor to what may come unless deforestation is halted and more trees are planted. While this is contentious and relates to the size of the forest rather than the number of species, it highlights the wider impacts of a diminished Amazon, which would apply to a different extent with the weakening of forests in other countries.\n Many species are already at risk from other factors, such as habitat destruction, invasive rivals and disease.

So, what can we do now to help the future? \nThe easiest answer is to use energy more wisely and quit wasting our precious resources. Second, we can increase our use of clean energy, particularly wind and solar power. These are great starts but we will still need some liquid fuels and for those, we can make decisions about the best fuels for the environment. There has been extensive conversation recently about biofuels and how they may help solve the climate problem. \nThe term \u201cbiofuels\u201d has many meanings, but basically they are grown fuels (like corn ethanol) that we can use instead of fossil fuels (like petroleum). While biofuels can be any fuel produced from plant material, historically they have been produced from food crops such as corn and soy. But, new technologies are enabling biofuel production from non-edible gases, wood, and other plant waste material.\nThe beauty of biofuels is that they suck carbon dioxide out of the air as they grow. When we burn them in our automobiles, we release carbon dioxide, but it is the same carbon that the plants absorbed while growing. Just on that basis, biofuels appear to be zero net emitters. \nBut this view is too simplistic. It takes energy to grow biofuels; it takes fertilizer, tractors, transportation, and energy to convert the plants to liquid fuels. Planting and growing these crops can also change how much carbon is stored in the soil. And using existing food crops or arable land for biofuel production might lead to deforestation if farms are expanded elsewhere to make up for lost food production.\n So, if you want to accurately assess the impact of biofuels, you need to look at what\u2019s called a \u201clife cycle analysis,\u201d which basically means the effort it takes to grow the crops, harvest them, convert them to fuel, transport them to distribution sites, and combust them. \nI have done some research in this area. Back in 2009, I did a study with my former student Fushcia-Ann Hoover, and we compared different feedstocks for ethanol. You can have corn, soybeans, sugarcane, switchgrass, poplar trees, and others. What is the best crop? Which is easiest to grow? Which is best for the environment?\nWhat we found, way back in 2009, is that if non-commercial crops were grown, you could actually end up with fuel that was significantly cleaner than petroleum. The trick was finding clean crops that don\u2019t need a lot of fertilizer, water, and other inputs. Corn ethanol for instance is not the best choice. You need so much water, fertilizer, and other costs, that it almost doesn\u2019t make it worthwhile. But other crops such as switchgrass, grown on marginal lands, have real a potential. Marginal lands are farmlands that are not optimal for growing crops.\nOur conclusion in 2009 was straightforward. Don\u2019t use good cropland for biofuels. Rather, use marginal croplands, with minimal water and fertilizer, to create plants that can be converted to biofuels. \nBut our conclusion wasn\u2019t the end of the story. There are other details that researchers should consider. For instance, how far from the croplands to the refinery? How much energy is needed to transport the fuels? All these issues matter and they were the focus of a recent research paper just published in Nature Energy. This study used an actual biofuel refinery located in Kansas for the basis of the study. And the authors counted all the emissions that occur during the lifecycle analysis of these biofuels. They realized that marginal croplands give lower yields, so there are competing issues of productivity and greenhouse gas reduction.\nThen there\u2019s the complicating factor of economics. The price of biofuels and the price of greenhouse gases matter. If society is willing to pay a small pollution charge like a carbon tax, it supports the producers of clean energy. But if society doesn\u2019t put a premium on clean energy, it\u2019s harder for clean industry companies to thrive.\nIn the new study, the authors discovered something fascinating. The found that the choices a farmer may make regarding what land to use for biofuels and how much fertilizer to use depend strongly on the price of clean fuels and the cost of greenhouse gases. Simply put, it we put a reasonable price on carbon pollution, farmers will be able to grow switchgrass, poplars, and other species, reduce greenhouse gases, and make money. \nBut, if there is no cost to carbon pollution, farmers will be motivated to spend more money on fertilizer and that, in the end, will lead to more emissions. While all the scenarios resulted in large emissions reductions compared to gasoline, the reductions were especially large for the scenarios that included a carbon price. \nSo, there is a delicate balance. The balance is made more clear when we realize that farming location matters. If biofuels are grown close to refineries, less pollution is created in transporting the fuels to the refinery. However, this limits cropland choices to those nearer to refineries. \nWith this balance of competing factors, the authors find room for improvement; currently we are not optimizing the performance in terms of both economic and environmental factors. In order to do this right, we have to balance all these mentioned issues. We can\u2019t just focus on transportation costs, fertilizer costs, and land quality costs; we have to consider these costs all together as a system.\nI spoke to the lead author of the paper, Dr. John Field, from Colorado State University and asked him about the significance of this work.\nAgriculture is being challenged by increasing food demand, and changes to regional climate. On top of this, most plans to combat climate change rely on the agricultural sector to increase carbon storage in soils, and to produce raw materials for the large-scale production of biofuels and power. Modeling studies like ours attempt to predict on a farm-by-farm basis where the best opportunities for biofuel crop production and soil carbon storage lie, how much they might cost, and how those two goals trade off. \nOur results suggest that biofuels can have a wide range of environmental outcomes depending on exactly where and how those crops are grown, but climate benefits can be increased at relatively low cost.\nThis is another great example of clean energy technologies that will help us solve the climate problem while continuing our use of fuels that drive the economy.

We are, as far as we know, the only people on the planet who could bridge Dr. Field's theory with actual data. We don't know Dr. Field. He has never contacted us. His work is certainly for us in no way informative; it is not even informed.\nTo our surprise, when we ran the numbers based on how things work in the real world, our corn ethanol has 80% GHG savings.

Algae can be grown in concrete ponds of salt water, on barren or desert land. \nProduction of advanced biofuels made from algae could grow rapidly in the late 2020s, according to Synthetic Genomics, the biotech company that has formed a partnership with ExxonMobil to develop the fuel.\nThe two companies said last week that by 2025 they were aiming to set up one or more demonstration plants to produce 10,000 barrels a day of diesel and jet fuel from genetically modified algae. Synthetic Genomics argues that scaling up production could be relatively quick.\u00a0\nThe aim is to produce biofuels that will be cost competitive with conventional oil-based fuels at crude prices of about $60 to $65 a barrel.\u00a0\nOliver Fetzer, chief executive of Synthetic Genomics, said: \u201cOnce we\u2019re past 2025, if our trajectory stays on track, there\u2019s no reason why we would not be able to scale up quickly.\u201d\nBQEND\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/f31c4778-267a-11e8-b27e-cc62a39d57a0\nAnother avenue that Audi are pursuing now are the 'Sunflow' e-fuels made purely from bacteria, any type of water, and a carbon dioxide stream. However, looking at the website it seems obvious that the way they are using this carbon dioxide is to utilise a lot of it in bulk at concentrations that are unlikely to be derived from just biomass - so its just getting a second use out of carbon, using bacteria. Interesting, but not technically a biofuel and wholly dependent on the source of CO2.https://fleetworld.co.uk/audi-makes-breakthrough-in-e-gas-prodution/\nThe absolute best answer to the question of bio-based fuels is a combination of these types of things used specifically for air travel, which I think is going to be difficult to decarbonise considering the maturity of the various technologies currently in use, and the testing etc required to effect a change to a new technology.\nWhat genuinely needs to happen is a wholesale shift to bio-gas/biomethane. The advantages of biogas are as follows and can be easily verified by farmers' reports, studies etc - this is what needs to happen.a) Biogas is carbon negative as the remaining substrate from AD units goes back on the soilb) This reduces or replaces the fossil fertilizer that would otherwise be usedc) Not using fossil fertilizer halts the chemical decomposition of the soil, which halts the emission of nitrous oxides - a powerful GHGd) Fertilizer pollution and run-off are minimised, as can be verifiede) This industrially-produced organic fertilizer creates healthier, more climate-resiliant crops that need less waterf) Obviously the farmer is producing a lot of energy which within an effective logistics environment, produces approx \u20ac800,000 of biogas per silo annuallyg) Various local quality of life impacts such as reduced smell etc.\nMany gas network operators and providers plan to reduce their carbon emissions before 2050. This is because it can be cheaper than refitting a very old metal gas network, or some appliances (potentially, we are still waiting for studies on this) for hydrogen. Plastic pipes work a lot better with no problems regarding an increased pressure within the pipe, and various issues. So if a country cannot or does not want to go 100% hydrogen, then combining biogas with hydrogen can both make up a significant proportion of domestic gas use with zero change to appliances or pipes. This is because biogas contains carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide which are easy to combine with hydrogen via biomethanation; producing a chemically-identical gas to the one we use today in most homes. Of overall domestic gas use in most western countries (without including transport of industry), this biogas could replace over 1/3 of domestic consumption; and in combination with H2 about two-thirds. With fuel cells or higher efficiency; lower demand, the figure is close to 100% - this is why many studies point to this being a viable and cost-effective route for gas companies to take going out to 2050. Personally, I believe hydrogen will play a more prominant role but certainly biogas is very much a growth industry and carries many other advantages for agriculture that cannot be avoided if we are to cope with these various problems concurrently.\nBiogas is in this way almost the opposite of biofuels.", "recommendation_count": "1", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "it can be cheaper than refitting a very old metal gas network or some appliances waiting", "effect": "this is"}, {"cause": "biogas contains carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide which are easy to combine with hydrogen via biomethanation producing a chemically identical gas", "effect": "this is"}]}, {"id": "113693827", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1521355870000}, "author": "AvMichelCroz", "author_id": "13022945", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\u201cAnd this seems to go against your defence of the status quo regarding heather-covered uplands, doesn't it?\u201d\nSorry - I don\u2019t see that.

So how is trust regained? The need for stronger leadership, ethics, greater transparency, open communications and improved culture feature prominently in current responses. \nBut a far more fundamental requirement is ignored, namely that business must lead on really critical issues, particularly the point raised long ago by economist Kenneth Boulding: \u201cAnyone who considers economic growth can continue indefinitely in a finite system is either a madman or an economist\u201d. The constraints Boulding anticipated have now arrived, as burgeoning population and economic growth crash into global biophysical limits which cannot be circumvented.\nThose constraints, encompassing resource shortages, biodiversity loss and pollution in various guises, do not feature in the capitalist economic lexicon, as technology and the market are supposed to overcome all as we march toward the sunlit uplands of the neoliberal nirvana. In the real world, the entire growth model under which Australia and global economies operate, is no longer sustainable; it sowed the seeds of its own destruction some time ago and is rapidly driving itself into the ground as growth rates decline. This is the great \u201cblack elephant\u201d of business and politics; a known, knowable fact that no one wants to acknowledge \u2013 the unmentionable in the recent Business and Governance Summits around the country, as our leaders strive to compound the problem with self-defeating subterfuges to maximise growth, not least corporate tax cuts and trade agreements.\nTo the community, these constraints are increasingly obvious as the quality of life for the average person deteriorates in myriad ways. The rhetoric of much-vaunted corporate social responsibility no longer holds water when our supposed leaders are not prepared to address the issues that really count for our survival, let alone prosperity. \nThese range from basic considerations such as ensuring food and water availability, to the creation of genuinely sustainable global societies. However, the first priority must be human-induced climate change, manifest as the lack of an atmosphere into which we can continue dumping carbon pollution from the burning of fossil fuels, agriculture and deforestation, without causing catastrophic consequences. \nClimate change is accelerating far faster than expected, to the point where it now represents an existential threat to humanity, that is a threat posing permanent large negative consequences which will be irreversible, an outcome being locked in today by our insistence on expanding the use of fossil fuels. This should be a major concern in Australia given that we are more exposed than most, but instead our leaders would have us embark on massive fossil fuel expansion. Already one of the world\u2019s largest carbon polluters when exports are included, Australia is complicit in destroying the conditions which make human life possible. There is no greater crime against humanity.\nThe economic and social impacts will be devastating unless that policy is rapidly reversed. The unprecedented hurricane season in the Atlantic, bushfires in the Californian winter, extreme heat in many parts of South Asia and rapid heating of the Arctic with associated instability in the northern hemisphere weather system, are only the most recent portents of what is to come. The worst outcomes can only be avoided now by emergency action, akin to restructuring economies on a war-footing.\nIt finally seems to be dawning on corporate and investor leadership that climate change is a real and present danger which is not going away.\nCompany directors are personally liable for failing to assess and act upon climate risk, but the greenwash continues. Major corporates parade their credentials in support of serious climate action, but none of their scenarios and policies are in line with the Paris objective of constraining global temperature increase \u201cwell below 2.0C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.50C\u201d.\nFortunately, as understanding of the risks improves, regulatory pressure mounts. The recommendations triggered by Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, via the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) are gradually being taken up, with companies voluntarily disclosing the impact which a 2C policy framework would have on their organisation, assuming such a framework was ever put in place (by governments?). Progress, but reactive and certainly not leadership. The question that must be answered is: \u201cwhat are you doing proactively as a company to create a 2C world\u201d \u2013 more realistically closer to 1.5C, as it is now patently clear that 2C is far too high?\nIf business genuinely wishes to regain trust, it must proactively face up to the challenge posed by climate change and initiate emergency action. Beyond that, it must open up honest debate on a new economic model to replace conventional growth. It is the only way business will be sustainable in the 21st century with a real social licence to operate.\nIn Churchill\u2019s words: \u201cSometimes we have to do what is required\u201d.\n\u2022 Ian Dunlop was formerly an international oil, gas and coal industry executive, chair of the Australian Coal Association and CEO of the Australian Institute of Company Director", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Empty rhetoric from corporates is not enough as climate change is accelerating far faster than expected", "date_published": {"$date": 1521070152000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1521102334000}, "authors": ["Ian Dunlop"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Business", "Environment", "Paris climate agreement", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "COP 21: UN climate change conference | Paris"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2018/mar/15/if-business-leaders-want-to-regain-our-trust-they-must-act-upon-climate-risk", "og:description": "Empty rhetoric from corporates is not enough as climate change is accelerating far faster than expected", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00c82eaf7a742bc90a2a311fc2f6dd26e946e18c/0_0_5244_3145/master/5244.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=2c92c7535ca6efefc0bb44b080757582", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "If business leaders want to regain our trust, they must act upon climate risk | Ian Dunlop"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00c82eaf7a742bc90a2a311fc2f6dd26e946e18c/0_0_5244_3145/master/5244.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e93cd09407a426930cf296fc17f2b266", "width": "5244", "height": "3145", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00c82eaf7a742bc90a2a311fc2f6dd26e946e18c/0_0_5244_3145/master/5244.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=29bdb96b2f8ca06297f62b7543f3008c", "description": "\u2018Already one of the world\u2019s largest carbon polluters when exports are included, Australia is complicit in destroying the conditions which make human life possible\u2019\nPhotograph: Dan Peled/AAP"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556127843044}, "comments": [{"id": "113684431", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1521324208000}, "author": "glacier", "author_id": "4706143", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "90% of the added heat from AGW goes into the oceans. \nHow about this: \nhttps://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/1_15_16_upton_ocean_warming_LLNL_720_473_s_c1_c_c.png", "recommendation_count": "3", "in_reply_to": "113620648", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "113665094", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1521283363000}, "author": "JacopoManfredi", "author_id": "18130674", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "I suggest your dreaming if you believe that a \"democratic government is there to serve the people\".\nThe issues of plastic pollution has been highlighted for decades, just as climate change has been but not one democratic government has ever done anything beyond a token gesture to combat either, or any other major issue - the prevailing mantra is to claim to want to do something, but then push the actual work onto the next administration, and so on.", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "113656560", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "113661907", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1521276766000}, "author": "GoldenAppleCorps", "author_id": "17327071", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "You are unwilling to say what the \u2018short and medium\u2019 term risks are.

Sounds about right. So why does the guardian never ever investigate the political and moral implications.

I would say that is a pretty optimistic political prediction of what will happen when the results of these crimes become unavoidable in the next decade or two - the flooding of cities, the collapse of food supplies, the bankruptcies of states.

Famed Nasa scientist James Hansen would not testify before Congress that \u201cglobal warming has begun\u201d for another 20 years. And the US would not enter into \u2013 only to later pull out of \u2013 the Paris climate accord for nearly half a century.\nThe anniversary of SRI\u2019s report to the API on climate change represents not just a damning piece of evidence of what the fossil fuel industry knew and when, but a signal of all that we have lost over the decades of policy inaction and interference. It should also serve as a potent motivator in the fight for climate accountability and justice.\nAt the time, CO2 levels in the atmosphere stood about 323ppm. The planet was warming but was still well within the historical norm. Sea levels had risen by about 4in compared with 1880 levels. The report, however, cautioned that \u201cman is now engaged in a vast geophysical experiment with his environment, the Earth\u201d and that \u201csignificant temperature changes are almost certain to occur by the year 2000\u201d.\nThose predictions proved to be correct: by the turn of the century, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had risen to 369ppm, causing a temperature increase of nearly half a degree over pre-industrial averages. Today, virtually all climate scientists agree there is little or no chance the world can stay within the goal of 1.5C, the limit of what scientists believe to be safe.\nWith each decade of delay and denial the impacts and costs of climate change have continued to mount\nOver the next 20 years, the scientific community and policymakers around the world began to reach a consensus on the threat posed by rising CO2 levels. Scientists at least one major oil company, Exxon, did their own climate modeling, which agreed with the scientific consensus. During this period a budding movement to cut emissions began.\nTo counter and slow down that effort to address climate change, the fossil fuel industry began its long and powerful strategy of climate denial and obstructionism. Even though they knew the science, they also realized that attempts to control emissions could seriously damage their bottom lines.\nIn 1998, as the first global attempt to rein in climate pollution, the Kyoto protocol, was headed to the Senate for ratification, API circulated what has come to be known as the Victory Memo, a detailed road map to undermining science and promoting denial of climate change. According to API\u2019s top strategists: \u201cVictory will be achieved when: those promoting the Kyoto treaty on the basis of extant science appear to be out of touch with reality.\u201d\nThe memo\u2019s end goal was clear: create doubt about science where none existed, deceive the media and Congress about the risks of climate change, and block the momentum that was building to address rising emissions through the Kyoto protocol, a precursor to the Paris accord. ExxonMobil alone would go on to spend upwards of $30m on ads, front groups, and pseudoscience intended to carry out the plan. That\u2019s in addition to the cash that flooded the coffers of climate deniers in Congress who are rewarded amply for willful ignorance.\nAPI\u2019s strategic deception campaign was a success, which is why we now stand at the brink of the highest global temperature considered safe. Just what it will mean to cross that line remains an ongoing question for atmospheric scientists, but we\u2019ve already started to get a glimpse and it doesn\u2019t look good.\nThe damage is all around us, from hurricanes on steroids \u2013 scientists attribute 15-40% (8in-24in) of the epic rain of Hurricane Harvey to climate change \u2013 to California\u2019s deadly wildfires which were set up by five years of drought, followed by record snowfall, then record heat that turned huge areas of the state into tinderboxes. In 2017 there were 16 separate billion-dollar disasters in the US, resulting in a total of $306bn of damages, nearly $100bn more than the second highest year 2005 (Katrina). While technically climate change did not \u201ccause\u201d these disasters, most of the carnage was aggravated in some way by climate change and the fossil fuel emissions that cause it in the first place.\nOther impacts are more long-term and irreparable. Anyone born after 1985 has never experienced a month with average temperatures that fall below the historical norm and, without action, probably never will. Mass coral bleaching events due to warming waters and ocean acidification have rendered large swaths of some of the ocean\u2019s most diverse ecosystems lifeless. The vanishing Arctic ice cap appears already to be affecting global weather patterns, and the loss of ice in Antarctica may have reached a tipping point that many now view as irreversible, a development that will require tough and costly decisions for coastal cities.\nIt never had to be this way. But with each decade of delay and denial the impacts and costs of climate change have continued to mount. Now taxpayers are left holding the bill for a literal rising tide of impacts that pose the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced. Meeting that challenge must begin with accountability on the part of climate polluters, and justice for citizens who did nothing to cause the problem other than drive to work and heat their homes when they had no other alternatives.\nWe can\u2019t turn back the clock, but we can turn off the fossil fuel firehose that\u2019s been pumping CO2 into our atmosphere and demand that those who left it running help foot the bill for the cleanup. Already we\u2019ve seen cities like New York, San Francisco, and other coastal cities file lawsuits against climate polluters, seeking to recover costs associated with planning for and adapting to a warming world. With massive costs facing hundreds more cities and no remedy in sight, more litigation will follow.\nMaking up for 50 years of delay and denial will not be easy, nor will it be cheap. But taxpayers should not have to shoulder the burden alone. The API and its climate polluters knowingly and deliberately caused this mess. They must help pay to clean it up.

Whilst that statement may suit the readers it's not entirely accurate. The fossil fuels \"discredit the science\" campaign was \"successful\" ( and continues to be in large area's of the USA) because \"they\" had a audience ( the general public) whom were not that difficult to convince.\nAs a analogy , a sociopath is someone whom has little empathy for other people. However, they are also intelligent thus know how to manipulate people in order to get what they want. In other words, someone whom has more of a agreeable character can easily be fooled by these individuals. The \" truth \" doesn't matter to them in pursuit of their objectives ( quite often sexual conquests). \nLarge industry has also been known to display sociopathic \"personality\" disorders. However, this combined group behaviour is excused as just \" business\" in the pursuit of money ( resources) in order to justify to society why it's acceptable. \nSo, many players ( high management/political level) with close links to the fossil fuel industry will not suddenly \"wake up\" to the scientific evidence on anthropogenic climate change. As their primary objective is resource acquisition ( Inc power) thus are cognitively biased towards any information which upholds that agenda ( including having their own scientists on the payroll in order to attempt to skew the general scientific consensus). \nHowever, this cognitive dissonance goes far deeper than a few high level players in the fossil fuel industries and their associated buddies in governments. The average psychology of humans tends to be a \"glass half full\" subjective view ( a evolutionary strategy). Which has been another significant causal effect why the evidence on the predicted negative impacts on anthropogenic climate change hasn't yet particularly \"sunk\" into the average ( majority of the populations ) cognitive processes. \nThus as ecosystems begin to unravel those whom have kept their heads in the sand will literally have no where left to hide ( flight). \nIt's going to be a difficult future.

However, we of the Beyond Extinction Economics (BEE) network have reservations about the article\u2019s diagnosis of its causes, and proposals for addressing the crisis.\nFirst, to say \u201cwe\u201d or \u201chuman activity\u201d is responsible for biodiversity loss sidesteps the more serious challenge of identifying the specific socio-cultural, and, more centrally, economic drivers of destruction. Second, to slip easily from population rises to industrial development, housing and farming as the causes of the destruction of wild areas evades critical questions about what sort of industry, producing what sort of consumer goods and what kind of farming and food distribution system \u2013 let alone questions as to who has the power to decide and who gets to consume and who doesn\u2019t.\nProposing remedies such as commercial big game hunting and \u201csustainable\u201d tourism misses the central point of the article\u2019s analysis: while loss of iconic big mammals is dreadful, the future of humanity and of life itself is threatened by deeper, wider and less visible processes such as the vast scale of loss of invertebrate species and populations, soil microorganisms and oceanic flora. The drastic declines in biodiversity not only compete with climate change for importance, but are intertwined with it and with the other processes of environmental degradation which together constitute a multi-dimensional crisis in the relationship between the dynamics of our global economy and society and the earth that sustains us. As to \u201cnatural capital\u201d, this approach is well meant but risks of capitulating to the language and values of the very economic forces that are the most powerful drivers of destruction. Popular pressure and inter-governmental cooperation to restrain these forces by such measures as planning and regulation are urgently needed. In the longer term, only deep economic and social transformations give us any hope of\u00a0a liveable and genuinely sustainable world.\n \nVictor AndersonTed Benton Professor emeritus, University of Essex, and Red-Green Study GroupJohn Blewitt Schumacher InstituteRussell Elliott Compas, CymruBrian Heatley Green HouseJenneth Parker Schumacher InstituteIan RappelPritam Singh Professor of economics, Oxford Brookes UniversityMartin Stott Chair, Garden OrganicSian Sullivan Professor of environment and culture, Bath Spa University\n\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation", "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/economy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Letters: Academics and environmental campaigners from the Beyond Extinction Economics (BEE) network say challenging questions about confronting the risk to global biodiversity were left unanswered by a recent Guardian briefing article", "date_published": {"$date": 1521132074000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1521151221000}, "authors": ["Letters"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Biodiversity", "Wildlife", "Conservation", "Environment", "Economic policy", "Politics", "Climate change"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/15/awkward-questions-about-diversity", "og:description": "Letters: Academics and environmental campaigners from the Beyond Extinction Economics (BEE) network say challenging questions about confronting the risk to global biodiversity were left unanswered by a recent Guardian briefing article", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47d26d173da48f59731e504c7619f4dff17505d4/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=6f165371dee2db7eab3f25a9dd3bb2a3", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Awkward questions about biodiversity | Letters"}, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47d26d173da48f59731e504c7619f4dff17505d4/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fb333fe9dcf99f146a2629dc1e42dbdc", "width": "4256", "height": "2554", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47d26d173da48f59731e504c7619f4dff17505d4/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=aa8d0f6be11f55d161746ad0a46fd367", "description": "Part of a wetland forest in Borneo, where the rich biodiversity is under threat.\nPhotograph: Romeo Gacad/AFP/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc0842aa2c3613145ed9030"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/17/offsets-for-emissions-breaches-prove-australia-has-a-carbon-market-labor-says", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Sixteen Australian industrial sites have breached government-imposed greenhouse gas emissions limits and had to buy millions of dollars in carbon credits.\nThe breaches came despite big emitters being granted generous carbon limits, in many cases above their highest previous pollution levels.\nThey were revealed in the first batch of emissions data released under the Coalition\u2019s \u201csafeguard mechanism\u201d, part of the Direct Action climate policy introduced by carbon pricing opponent Tony Abbott.\nLabor and industry body the Carbon Market Institute both said the use of Australian carbon credit units \u2013 mostly created through land-use based greenhouse gas reduction projects \u2013 was evidence the country had a carbon market despite the government claiming otherwise.\nThe opposition climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said businesses were now trading credits at prices the Coalition had claimed would wreck the economy under Labor. He said it showed the hypocrisy and ineffectiveness of the government\u2019s approach to climate change.\n\u201cThe Turnbull government should stop trying to mislead the Australian people and their own backbench,\u201d he said. \u201c[It should] admit that carbon pricing and trading is not only needed to take effective action on climate change, but their ineffective climate change policy also includes carbon trading.\u201d\nThe Labor-Greens carbon price for all big emitters was $24.15 a tonne when the scheme was repealed and replaced by Direct Action under then prime minister Abbott in 2014. The price had been expected to fall to less than $10 a tonne the following year when international carbon trading began.\nComparatively few credits \u2013 about 448,000 \u2013 were bought last year under the safeguard mechanism, mostly for $14-$15 a tonne, suggesting a total cost to business of more than $6m.\nThe majority of the 154 emitters covered by the safeguard mechanism emitted less than their limit, known as a baseline, allowed last financial year. The biggest purchases of credits were by miners Anglo Coal (133,104 tonnes worth at the Capcoal mine in Queensland), Glencore (81,851 tonnes at the Tahmoor coalmine in NSW) and Rio Tinto (68,305 at the Alcan Gove bauxite mine in Arnhem Land).\nThe environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, did not directly address whether Australia had a carbon market. He said the safeguard mechanism was developed through consultation with a broad cross-section of industry, and provided flexible options for businesses to comply.\nHe said Labor had introduced a carbon tax that hit households and businesses, and was now promising a deep cut in emissions by 2030 without backing it up with a plan or costings. \u201cIn contrast, the government\u2019s approach is to address climate change with policies that ensure we have an affordable and reliable energy system and competitive industries,\u201d Frydenberg said.\nButler said the ALP supported the further development of carbon markets. \nThe safeguard mechanism was promised to ensure cuts paid for using the main part of Direct Action \u2013 the $2.55bn emission reduction fund \u2013 were not undone by emissions increasing in other parts of the economy.\nGovernment agency the Clean Energy Regulator sets an emissions limit for each large industrial site based on its highest level of emissions over the previous five years. But companies can apply to have the limit recalculated.\nConsultants RepuTex last month found 57 industrial sites had been allowed increased baselines beyond previous emissions levels, prompting claims the safeguard mechanism was pointless. The new data shows eight of these operations breached their increased baseline.\nThe government is now considering making the safeguard mechanism less tied to historic emissions. A climate policy review released in December suggested emission limits could be loosened so they \u201cincrease with production, supporting business growth\u201d.\nThe Greens climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, said most companies were compliant under the safeguard mechanism only because the system was broken \u2013 baselines were either too high to begin with or businesses had been granted higher baselines to avoid breaches.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a pollution reduction policy that doesn\u2019t reduce pollution, it\u2019s time to start over,\u201d he said.\nEnvironment department data shows national emissions have risen each year since 2014. Under their current trajectory, the department projects emissions would be about 2% higher in 2030 than in 2005. The government\u2019s target is a 26% to 28% cut over that time frame; Labor has proposed a 45% cut.\nThe Carbon Market Institute chief executive, Peter Castellas, said the safeguard mechanism data showed Australia clearly had a functioning carbon market that had been able to meet the demand of businesses that required credits.\nIt is understood most credits purchased were from surplus emissions cuts by companies that had won contracts under the emissions reduction. The carbon price spiked to as high as $18 a tonne \u2013 well beyond the average $11.90 under the emissions reduction fund \u2013 due to limited supply.\nCastellas said industry had not been expected to breach the safeguard mechanism. Its operation augured well for a time when the demand for carbon credits increased.\n\u201cSafeguard mechanism baselines will inevitably have to decline if we are to meet below business as usual emissions required under Australia\u2019s Paris agreement commitments,\u201d he said.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-offset-projects", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Industrial sites have spent millions on carbon credits under Direct Action\u2019s \u2018safeguard mechanism\u2019", "date_published": {"$date": 1521234015000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1521250551000}, "authors": ["Adam Morton"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Australia news", "Carbon offsetting", "Coalition", "Australian politics"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/17/offsets-for-emissions-breaches-prove-australia-has-a-carbon-market-labor-says", "og:description": "Industrial sites have spent millions on carbon credits under Direct Action\u2019s \u2018safeguard mechanism\u2019", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f746bda9b1db6184a0426eb1f0da424acb0089ac/0_88_2500_1501/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=b93d0afb28cb08c964cf3f02dea27b3a", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Offsets for emissions breaches prove Australia has a carbon market, Labor says"}, "headline": "O", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f746bda9b1db6184a0426eb1f0da424acb0089ac/0_88_2500_1501/master/2500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=07e206eddcaf443cfbe659bf0b4dca1c", "width": "2500", "height": "1501", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f746bda9b1db6184a0426eb1f0da424acb0089ac/0_88_2500_1501/master/2500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e06b06ec9d1dc099eb36f73ed497d858", "description": "Rio Tinto made one of the biggest credit purchases for breaching emissions limit at Alcan Gove bauxite mine.\nPhotograph: Torsten Blackwood/AFP/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc0842ba2c3613145ed9031"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/18/billion-dollar-polar-geoengineering-to-slow-melting-glaciers-global-flooding", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Scientists have outlined plans to build a series of mammoth engineering projects in Greenland and Antarctica to help slow down the disintegration of the planet\u2019s main glaciers. The controversial proposals include underwater walls, artificial islands and huge pumping stations that would channel cold water into the bases of glaciers to stop them from melting and sliding into the sea.\nThe researchers say the work \u2013 costing tens of billions of dollars a time \u2013 is urgently needed to prevent polar glaciers melting and raising sea levels. That would lead to major inundations of low-lying, densely populated areas, such as parts of Bangladesh, Japan and the Netherlands.\nFlooding in these areas is likely to cost tens of trillions of dollars a year if global warming continues at its present rate, and vast sea-wall defences will need to be built to limit the devastation. Such costs make glacier engineering in polar regions a competitive alternative, according to the team, which is led by John Moore, professor of climate change at the University of Lapland.\n\u201cWe think that geoengineering of glaciers could delay much of Greenland and Antarctica\u2019s grounded ice from reaching the sea for centuries, buying time to address global warming,\u201d the scientists write in the current issue of Nature. \u201cGeoengineering of glaciers has received little attention in journals. Most people assume that it is unfeasible and environmentally undesirable. We disagree.\u201d\nIdeas put forward by the group specifically target the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctic because these will contribute more to sea rise this century than any other source, they say. Their proposals include:\n\u2022 Building a 100-metre high wall on the seabed across a 5km wide fjord at the end of the Jakobshavn glacier in western Greenland. This would reduce influxes of warming sea water which are eroding the glacier\u2019s base;\n\u2022 Constructing artificial islands in front of glaciers in Antarctica in order to buttress them and limit their collapse as their ice melts due to global warming;\n\u2022 Circulating cooled brine underneath glaciers such as the Pine Island glacier in Antarctica \u2013 in order to prevent their bases from melting and sliding towards the sea.\nIn each case, the team \u2013 which includes scientists in Finland and the US \u2013 acknowledges that costs would be in the billions. Construction is also likely to cause considerable disruption. For example, building a dam across the Jakobshavn fjord could affect ecology, fisheries and tourism, and large numbers of workers would have to be shipped in to complete the project.\nSimilarly, building artificial islands in front of glaciers would mean importing about six cubic kilometres of material, a task that would be immensely difficult in stormy Antarctic waters. And drilling through ice that is kilometres thick to pump down cooled water would also stretch the capabilities of engineers.\nHowever, the team insists that such projects should be carefully assessed now as the likely costs appear to be compatible with those of other large energy and civil engineering works being planned across the globe. The issue is simple, they state: should we spend vast sums to wall off all the world\u2019s coasts, or can we address the problem at its source?\n\u201cPotential risks, especially to local ecosystems, need careful analysis,\u201d they conclude. \u201cIn our view, however, the greatest risk is doing nothing.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/glaciers", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/poles", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/antarctica", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/greenland", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Underwater sea walls and artificial islands among projects urgently required to avoid devastation of global flooding, say scientists", "date_published": {"$date": 1521331502000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1521331502000}, "authors": ["Robin McKie"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Geoengineering", "World news", "Glaciers", "Polar regions", "Environment", "Climate change", "Antarctica", "Greenland"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/18/billion-dollar-polar-geoengineering-to-slow-melting-glaciers-global-flooding", "og:description": "Underwater sea walls and artificial islands among projects urgently required to avoid devastation of global flooding, say scientists", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc5bbb18fa40bc1d2c7400e13dce56f3c44472a/0_89_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=8ec9952ca61c5bb75360bfaa74709bfc", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Billion-dollar polar engineering \u2018needed to slow melting glaciers\u2019"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc5bbb18fa40bc1d2c7400e13dce56f3c44472a/0_89_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1dba1c6b3549ef4ec44f1061454014d9", "width": "2200", "height": "1320", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc5bbb18fa40bc1d2c7400e13dce56f3c44472a/0_89_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=043fbd8ea5d36c5726efd7b40d8410c9", "description": "The Jakobshavn fjord in western Greenland.

I don\u2019t plan to get into a debate here, everyone is welcome to their opinion, but I do want to avoid misunderstandings. This is my personal response \u2013 I am not representing my co-authors here.\nWe didn\u2019t at any point in the comment suggest building a wall as a direct physical obstacle to hold back a glacier.\nThe Nature comment is edited but not peer-reviewed. This is because it presents ideas and opinions rather than scientific results. I think that it is worth carrying out further scientific studies to investigate the viability of these polar geo-engineering projects (indeed such research is already underway), and such studies WILL be peer reviewed before publication. The peer review process is not a 100% guarantee of accuracy but it certainly helps.\nI don\u2019t want to see these projects implemented. I would rather see hard mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. I am glad to see that a lot of posters here want the same thing. But if such mitigation cannot be implemented (and this is the responsibility of policy makers not just scientists) then targeted geoengineering may be the lesser of two (or more) evils while emissions are brought down more gradually. I do not think that any kind of geoengineering should be viewed as a long term solution to human-induced climate change. I don\u2019t know anyone who does.\nWe did not calculate the CO2 costs of the projects suggested in this Nature comment. Much research is needed before a decision can be made on any of these projects, including both scientific and engineering viability.

The last such major retreat occurrred between 19,000 and 9,000 years ago in response to a Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation (NHHLSI) peak which provoked the oxidation of carbon rich ocean sediments in the Southern Ocean causing global greenhouse warming. Natural processes are defined as those independent of human agency. As there was no human agency in the oxidation of those Southern Ocean sediments, the global greenhouse warming from 19,000 to 9,000 years ago was natural.\nThis natural deglacial warming resulted in a world at 9,000 ybp warmer than preindustrial centuries of the last millennium. This world stayed warm for another 4,000 years, then temperatures declined as NHHLSI declined resulting in the expansion of glaciers in recent millennia up until last century.\nThe very rapid warming and consequent current retreat of glaciers is caused by CO2 from the oxidation of coal and other fossil fuels by combustion which has involved human agency and is therefore not natural.\nMany glaciers in retreat have revealed tree stumps of earlier forestation, screeds\" (screes) \"where they terminated in earlier times, and in a few cases human settlements\".\nThe human settlements reflect the warmer times particularly before around 5,000 ybp as do the terminal and higher lateral moraine screes and evidence of a higher tree line.\n\"Sea level is not rising any faster than it was before according to tidal gauges.\"\nSea level was stable from 200 BC to 1000 AD, then rose at an average rate of 0.6 mm per year up to 1400 AD.

A 2030 ban on combustion engine models would boost sales of electrified cars in the UK and even raise the prospect of the country becoming an net vehicle exporter, the Green Alliance said.\nWhile the UK lags behind Germany on conventional car manufacturing, a fifth of the electric cars sold in Europe in 2016 were made at Nissan\u2019s Sunderland plant in north-east England. BMW has pledged to make its electric Mini at its plant in Oxford, but UK-headquartered Jaguar Land Rover chose to build its first flagship electric car, the i-Pace, in Austria.\nDustin Benton, policy director at Green Alliance, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s recent industrial strategy cites clean growth as one of the biggest economic opportunities for the UK, but if we keep building and buying dirty cars we\u2019ll miss the growth opportunity of the century.\u201d\nThe transport sector overtook energy in 2016 as the UK\u2019s single biggest source of carbon emissions, as power generation has switched away from coal and towards renewables.\nCarbon emissions from the average new car also rose last year for the first time in nearly two decades, as drivers opted for bigger models.\nThe Green Alliance found that an earlier phase-out for new diesels and petrol cars would affect the looming gap in the UK\u2019s legally binding 2030 climate target. A 2030 deadline would cut the gap by 85%, or 98 million tonnes CO2e.\nSticking with a 2040 date would also lead to fossil-fuelled cars causing air pollution until the second half of the century, the thinktank said, given the average UK car is scrapped after 14 years. Four committees of MPs last week warned that air pollution is a \u201cnational health emergency\u201d and called on the government to take tougher action.\nEarlier action would also ease the UK\u2019s reliance on oil imports at a time when oil and gas production from the North Sea is declining. Imports would be cut by nearly 50% by 2035, saving up to an estimated \u00a36.63bn each year, the thinktank said.\nWhile ministers last summer followed France by pledging to halt new petrol and diesel car sales by 2040, other countries are looking to ban them years earlier. Scotland is aiming for 2032, India wants to only sell electric models by 2030 and Norway, the world leader on the take-up of battery-powered cars, has set a 2025 deadline.\nThe Green Alliance said the government could take several other measures to sustain the UK\u2019s leadership on electric cars, including public procurement. A grant of up to \u00a34,500 to buyers of electric cars should also be extended, the group said, and government could further help by setting manufacturers sales targets for electric cars, starting at 15% of all cars sold in 2022 and rising to 45% by 2025.\nThe car industry body, the SMMT, said outright bans on petrol and diesels risked harming the new car market, and the sector could be undermined if not given enough time to adjust.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/politics/transport", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/automotive-industry", "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/motoring", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/electric-cars", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Green Alliance says ending UK sales earlier would close climate target gap and halve oil imports", "date_published": {"$date": 1521375603000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1521410424000}, "authors": ["Adam Vaughan"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Travel and transport", "Transport policy", "Automotive industry", "Motoring", "Electric", "hybrid and low-emission cars", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Environment", "Ethical and green living", "Business", "Transport", "UK news", "Politics"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/18/uk-should-bring-2040-petrol-and-diesel-car-ban-forward-2030-green-alliance", "og:description": "Green Alliance says ending UK sales earlier would close climate target gap and halve oil imports", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed8fd6b389333006a81615664cbd6219aed93fa4/0_33_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=b6969af070a577ad488368fe39fa7d50", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Ban new petrol and diesel cars in 2030, not 2040, says thinktank"}, "headline": "0", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed8fd6b389333006a81615664cbd6219aed93fa4/0_33_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1e9c3fd34d1846e89b86732f250bcdee", "width": "3500", "height": "2100", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed8fd6b389333006a81615664cbd6219aed93fa4/0_33_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d17f383a4aeb4b42124da8a0d124cfec", "description": "A Nissan Leaf electric car on the production line in Sunderland.\nPhotograph: Anna Gowthorpe/PA"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc08434a2c3613145ed9033"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/19/climate-change-soon-to-cause-mass-movement-world-bank-warns", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Climate change will result in a massive movement of people inside countries and across borders, creating \u201chotspots\u201d where tens of millions pour into already crowded slums, according to the World Bank.\nMore than 140 million people in just three regions of the developing world are likely to migrate within their native countries between now and 2050, the first report on the subject has found. \nThe World Bank examined three regions, which between them account for 55% of the developing world\u2019s population. In sub-Saharan Africa, 86 million are expected to be internally displaced over the period; in south Asia, about 40 million; and in Latin America, 17 million.\nSuch flows of people could cause enormous disruption, threatening governance and economic and social development, but the World Bank cautioned that it was still possible to stave off the worst effects.\n\u201cClimate change-driven migration will be a reality, but it does not need to be a crisis, provided we take action now and act boldly,\u201d said John Roome, a senior director for climate change at the World Bank group.\nHe laid out three key actions governments should take: first, to accelerate their reductions of greenhouse gases; second, for national governments to incorporate climate change migration into their national development planning; and third, to invest in further data and analysis for use in planning development.\nWithin countries, the effects of climate change will create multiple \u201chotspots\u201d: made up of the areas people move away from in large numbers, and the areas they move to.\n\u201cLocal planners need to make sure the resources are made available, and to make sure it takes place in a comprehensive and coordinated manner,\u201d said Roome.\nGlobally, many tens of millions more are expected to be similarly affected, creating huge problems for national and local governments. Nearly 3% of the population was judged likely to move owing to climate change in the areas studied \u2013 a proportion that might be repeated elsewhere.\nMigration between countries has previously taken the spotlight, with its potential for cross-border conflicts, but internal migration may cause as much disruption, putting pressure on infrastructure, jobs, food and water resources.\nThe 140 million figure extrapolates from current trends, but could be reduced if changes are made. If economic development is made more inclusive, for instance through better education and infrastructure, internal migration across the three regions could drop to between 65 million and 105 million, according to the report. If strong action is taken on greenhouse gas emissions, as few as 30 million to 70 million may migrate.\nClimate change is likely to most affect the poorest and most vulnerable, making agriculture difficult or even impossible across large swaths of the globe, threatening water resources and increasing the likelihood of floods, droughts and heatwaves in some areas. Sea level rises and violent storm surges are also likely to hit low-lying coastal areas, such as in Bangladesh.\nKristalina Georgieva, the chief executive of the World Bank, in her introduction to the report published on Monday, said: \u201cThere is growing recognition among researchers that more people will move within national borders to escape the effects of slow-onset climate change, such as droughts, crop failure and rising seas. \n\u201cThe number of climate migrants could be reduced by tens of millions as a result of global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and with far-sighted development planning.

It gathers carbon dissolved in the sea and buries it below the surface, often storing similar amounts of carbon in the top metre of sediment as is stored in tropical forests.\nBut unlike forests that store carbon for about 60 years before releasing much of it, seagrass meadows often store the carbon for thousands of years until they are disturbed. That process is thought to offset up to 2% of humanity\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.\nRecent studies have shown that when the top layer of actively growing seagrass is disturbed \u2013 either by local impacts such as boat anchors or climatic impacts like heatwaves \u2013 the carbon that has been sequestered over thousands of years can be quickly released.\nSince the start of the 20th century, seagrass meadows worldwide have declined at an average rate of 0.9% per year, mostly due to direct human impacts such as coastal development and water quality degradation. Over the last century about 29% of global seagrass has been destroyed and it is estimated it is releasing carbon at a rate similar to the emissions of Australia and the UK combined.\nOscar Serrano and colleagues from Edith Cowan University in Western Australia examined how much carbon was released when the world\u2019s largest collection of seagrass meadows at Shark Bay were damaged by a marine heatwave in 2010 and 2011. Between 0.6% and 2.4% of the world\u2019s seagrass coverage exists in that one location, where it has been growing for about 8,000 years.\n\u201cDespite seagrasses having thrived over millennia in Shark Bay, unprecedented widespread losses occurred in the austral summer of 2010/2011,\u201d the authors wrote in their paper published in Nature Climate Change.\nThe stored carbon is released when the dead seagrass allows oxygen to penetrate the layers of dead seagrass, changing the bacteria that live in it. Estimates vary as to how much oxygen can penetrate the dead seagrass, and therefore how much carbon is released after a disturbance.\nThe researchers found 22% of the seagrass in Shark Bay was lost after the heatwave, compared with a 2002 baseline. Depending on how much oxygen that allowed to penetrate the layers of dead seagrass, the researchers found that caused the release of between 2m and 9m tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent, in just the three years following the heatwave.\nThey found that if the seagrass loss was counted in Australia\u2019s national emissions accounting in that period, it would have boosted Australia\u2019s emissions from land-use change by between 4% and 21%.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a carbon bomb,\u201d said Gary Kendrick, a co-author on the paper from the University of Western Australia. \u201cAnd it\u2019s one that has gone off without documentation.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not counting this carbon, then we\u2019re underestimating our footprint.\u201d\nSince seagrass meadows can take decades to repair, the researchers said the damage from the heatwave could cause up to 21m tonnes of CO2 to be released over the following 40 years.\nSerrano said the damaged seagrass has a double-whammy impact on emissions.\n\u201cSo when you have an event such as the losses at Shark Bay, you not only lose the seagrass as a way of removing CO2, but the sequestered gas is released back into the atmosphere during seagrass matter decomposition,\u201d said Serrano.\nThe researchers said local impacts such as inappropriate tourism and fishing could be managed to protect the loss of seagrass, but protecting them against climate change may require more radical interventions.\nThey suggested manually sowing seeds or transplanting seedlings as options that should be considered, since encouraging faster recovering would limit the amount of carbon lost after the disturbance.\nThey also said more controversial options \u2013 such as transplanting more resilient species not native to the area \u2013 might also need to be considered.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oceans", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/western-australia", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/natural-disasters", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/marine-life", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/plants", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "22% of seagrass in Western Australia\u2019s Shark Bay was lost after 2010-11 heatwave, causing release of up to 9m tonnes of carbon", "date_published": {"$date": 1521522513000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1521623887000}, "authors": ["Michael Slezak"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Oceans", "Western Australia", "Australia news", "Environment", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Climate change", "Marine life", "Plants"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/20/marine-heatwave-set-off-carbon-bomb-in-worlds-largest-seagrass-meadow", "og:description": "22% of seagrass in Western Australia\u2019s Shark Bay was lost after 2010-11 heatwave, causing release of up to 9m tonnes of carbon", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1f274e0c95f7c086d94e6975835f0e104fc0e27/0_377_3847_2308/master/3847.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=fdc2751a0745b3382ea12620f2421014", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Marine heatwave set off 'carbon bomb' in world's largest seagrass meadow"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1f274e0c95f7c086d94e6975835f0e104fc0e27/0_377_3847_2308/master/3847.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=187ece0388cd9a34e789e087c48c30b7", "width": "3847", "height": "2308", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1f274e0c95f7c086d94e6975835f0e104fc0e27/0_377_3847_2308/master/3847.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=74d87d075f3a4f102cb5f905b9bded11", "description": "Over the last century, about 29% of the world\u2019s seagrass has been destroyed and it is estimated it is releasing carbon at a rate similar to the emissions of Australia and the UK combined.\nPhotograph: Lin Baldock/Natural England/PA"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556127848048}, "comments": [{"id": "113881468", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1521729527000}, "author": "Shirley Hugdahl", "author_id": "16856670", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "wish i could remember the name of the \"weather forecaster\" who wrote australia off as a lost cause. too late.... whos next?

Modern, powerful kettles will. How about if you took a huge saucepan instead, one as large as your cooker, filled that with cold water, put a lid on and turned on the gas. That would take at least 5 minutes, if not 10 or 15, to heat up until steam was coming out. An enormous VAT the size of a room filled with cold water would probably take at least a day, from cold, to heat to boiling. \nThe above describes 'lag' or 'latency'.\nNow imagine the climate system, where there is anything from 20 - 50 years lag between EMISSIONS and WARMING. Fact. The climate response we've seen, the warming we've seen, is as a response to emissions from the last couple of hundred years up to about 50 years ago. Or, if we're very lucky, only 20 years ago.\nBut over the last 50 years and certainly over the last 20 years emissions haven't crashed to barely anything. They're risen inexorably over the timeframe. \nSo, if the record temperatures we've seen are as a response to historic emissions and not to what we've put into the atmosphere over the last few decades, and if as a result of those historic emissions the arctic is mush, we're seeing sea levels rising, the seas are acidified, there is increased flooding, huge increase in drought and wildfire, appalling bleaching of coral reefs and ever more catastrophic hurricanes - but that's all without what we've put into the atmosphere over the last few decades, what kind of state do you think the climate will be in in 50 years' time? Given the feedback systems? \n(Feedback systems being one thing that triggers another, as in, as the oceans warm, metahne is released from the deep seat bed, which createws further warming, which releases more methane, in a cycle which gradually intensified and speeds up.And there are many others.\nA few years ago in India temperatures rose so high (over 40C degrees) that people could not touch surfaces without blistering their hands. You took so calmly about 'adaption', 'coping', 'resilience'. But what about when temperatures reach 50C in India - ? The population won't survive that. Higher still and people will boil alive if they go outside.\nThese temperature rises are not survivable. \nThe mistake you're making, as so many do, is to imagine that global warming is linear and will increase ever so gradually and gently over several decades. That gradually the temperatures will rise, like a barometer in the summer as the day advances in to the afternoon from the cooler morning. That is slightly what is happening now, today, NOW. But when the trigger points are reached, and warming goes out of control, and the exponential effect kicks in, temperatures will soar. Very very fast. Who knows how fast? If you think back to Sunday, when temperatures were minus 0 across the country, but by the next day were several degrees warmer - who's to say that a rise from 40C to 50C to 60C or higher won't happen almost overnight? I hope it doesn't, but who's to say it won't?\nWhich leaves me very frightened. Not 'pessimistic' - just bloody terrified. You, not so much.

I wouldn't rest on your laurels in that regard, if I were you.\nAs for the internet system design, again, that's totally irrelevant. The climate isn't a series of zeros and ones. It's a vast, interconnected, planetary climate system taking in the oceans and the air and plant life and trapped methane and CO2 emissions - it's not a linear system, it doesn't rely on linear calculations (which computer calculations are).\nGlobal warming is not a lineart system.

Politicians don't know. But, they have had so many briefings, scientists have given talks, with data, with slides, with presentations, at Westminster and elsewhere for literally decades, explaining carefully how the science works. So they can't not know - can they?\nAnd yet, a few months ago I was at an event and met my local MP and mentioned this latency problem and she stared at me and said, oh, really, I didn't know that, is that so? As if she'd never heard of it. As if she too believed that if everyone within the borough 'cut back' today that would be a contributing to 'halting climate change'.\nSo then I thought, OK, they do all know, or most of them know, but they're all specialists in different fields, as politicians, they all have their briefs, so they simply put the information into a different compartment in theirminds, file it away, think it's for other people to deal with. Yet, the vast majority of politicains will have partners, families, children - and they're not shit scared?\nI'm demented with fear and I don't even have kids.\nI'm so long past the terrible grief of climate change. There was a time when I couldn't cope. When I thought of what the world will lose. Not just people, not just scientific knowledge, not just the natural world, but the inspiration of great minds, great composers, writers, architects, philosophers, dancers, artists, photographers, thinkers, entertainers. I find the thought of all human progress being chucked away deeply distressing.\nNow, I don't shrug, far from it, but I've practised for a very long time now acceptance, or, more accurately, resignation. Nothing is being done, properly, businesses are still pouring noxious fumes into the air, emissions are pretty much the same, and for decades despite knowledge of what was going on hardly anything has been done and what there is is vastly too little vastly too late. It's obvious there is no hope. We are in a planetary emergency, there will be a mass wipeout of life on earth and give the timeframe of the emissions and the rapid warming, the earth will probably end up as a ball of fire in the sky, as Stephen Hawkings said. I think he's right. Earth will become another Venus.\nSo - and I've asked this question again and again - how is it that given the reality of the science, that this newspaper, which is not a stupid paper, and others, cheerfully allow articles to be published referring to 'in 50 years' time' and talk about the impact of cuts in X decades time, or this generation ofyoung people 'when they retire' - or anything at all, as if the world is going to continue as it is?\nIs it lack of knowledge? - surely not. Is it that while the planet heats up people are just inclined to look after their own interests, make their money, create their product (this newspaper), shutting their eyes to reality?\nOr is it this. Is it that the 'don't frighten the horses' approach to the reality of climate change and the impending apocalypse is very political indeed; it's simply a case of those who could inform the public, deliberately not informing the public, so as to keep the hysteria and terror at bay, so as to maintain public order.\nBecause, frankly, if people really understood, wouldn't there be protests around the world every day of the week, every hour, people standing in groups shouting and calling out for action? And, had people known, properly, wouldn't there have been such protests for at least the last 20 years? I think there would have been. \nBut, fact, the truth is not acknowledged, the public is not told and the BBC still drags out its climate deniers for 'balance' and Nigel Lawson still comes out with his crap and there is no court action forcing misinformation to be illegal.\nI think the lack of honest reporting on what is about to happen must be public order control. Mustn't it? I can't think of another single reason why so many hundreds of politicians barely mention global warming, as if they are unaware the arctic is mush, temperatures are escalating and we're on the edge of very savage times.", "recommendation_count": "8", "in_reply_to": "113783961", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "113795285", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1521551741000}, "author": "Lawrie Griffith", "author_id": "13793892", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Now this is not my view.

He was instrumental to the Mona Loa facility (aka the Keeling Curve) and he and Suess discussed ocean carbon buffering in the 1950's. \nIn this lecture he talks about everything. The basic physics of AGW - effects (such as rainfall) the ecological problem of plant migration - and even genetic modification of plants to allow them to adapt to new seasonal and diurnal cycles, effect on global ocean and atmospheric patterns, chance for ice melt-down, human migration, renewable energy - the list goes on).

The physics does not change. As Earth warms, now because of extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere, ice will melt, and CO2 and methane will be released by warming ocean and melting permafrost. \nWhile we can't say exactly how fast these amplifying feedbacks will occur, it is certain they will occur, unless we stop the warming. There is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning.\nPrecise measurements by GRACE, the gravity satellite, reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica are now losing mass, several hundred cubic kilometers per year. And the rate has accelerated since the measurements began nine years ago. Methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost.\nWhat sea level rise can we look forward to? The last time CO2 was 390 ppm, today's value, sea level was higher by at least 15 meters, 50 feet. Where you are sitting now would be under water. Most estimates are that, this century, we will get at least one meter. I think it will be more if we keep burning fossil fuels, perhaps even five meters, which is 18 feet, this century or shortly thereafter.\nBQEND\n\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/james_hansen_why_i_must_speak_out_about_climate_change/transcript", "recommendation_count": "49", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "extra co2", "effect": "as earth warms we put in the atmosphere"}]}, {"id": "113783047", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1521534938000}, "author": "twitgit", "author_id": "16045352", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "We (UK) have a Minister (Clark, BEIS) with responsibilty for climate change policy within his brief.

Advocates aim to use the law to force stronger government action to cut\u00a0carbon emissions, and win damages from the companies responsible to cover the costs of dealing with the impacts of warming.\nThere are hundreds of cases in the pipeline around the globe from\u00a0India to\u00a0Uganda;\u00a0Ireland\u00a0to\u00a0Norway, where campaigners are seeking to block oil drilling in the Arctic. The UK government is facing its first major brought by 12 citizens through a legal group called\u00a0Plan B\u00a0and which already has the support of\u00a0the government\u2019s former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir David King. But it is in the US, the world\u2019s most litigious nation, that the greatest number of cases have been brought, with Arnold Schwarzenegger the latest to confirm he was preparing a lawsuit.\nTo date victories are rare\u200b, but campaigners say wins are more likely in future, as public opinion \u2013 and the attitudes of judges \u2013 shift with the times.\u00a0A flurry of billion-dollar cases against fossil fuel companies\u00a0brought by New York city\u00a0and\u00a0communities in California\u00a0over the rising seas has already pushed climate litigation into the limelight.\u00a0But big oil is fighting back hard, with allegations of a politically motivated conspiracy against them.\u00a0\nThey are inspired by momentous cases from the past, from the defeat of big tobacco to the racial desegregation of schools in the US. Big oil is fighting back hard, but though victories have been rare to date wins are more likely in future, as legal experts say the attitudes of judges often shift with the times.\nA flurry of billion-dollar cases against fossil fuel companies brought by New York city and communities in California over the rising seas has pushed climate litigation into the limelight. But cases are being brought across the globe, with more than 1,000 suits now logged by the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia law school in New York. \nThe UK government is now facing its first major climate change lawsuit, brought by 12 citizens through a legal group called Plan B and which already has the support of the government\u2019s former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir David King.\n\u201cThe UK carbon target for 2050 does not match the Paris agreement goal and the government knows that,\u201d says Tim Crosland, a barrister at Plan B. He says the purpose of the case is to make the government live up to its responsibilities: \u201cIt is about closing the accountability deficit which is one of the biggest problems with climate change \u2013 if everybody is responsible, nobody is responsible.\u201d\nThe UK has had climate laws in place for a decade and is seen by some as a leading nation, but Crosland argues the great dangers of global warming make this irrelevant. \u201cEither we don\u2019t want to fall off the climate cliff edge or we do. Who is doing better than others is the wrong question.\u201d\nOn Wednesday meanwhile, a landmark case in California, in which the cities of San Francisco and Oakland are suing major oil companies for damages, reaches an unprecedented moment with a day-long hearing on the science of climate change itself.\nFurther cases are under way from India to Uganda, and across Europe including the UK, Ireland, Belgium, Portugal and Norway, where campaigners are seeking to block oil drilling in the Arctic. In Colombia, 25 young plaintiffs are taking to the courts to halt deforestation.\nLawyers won a rare victory \u2013 now under appeal \u2013 in the 2015 Urgenda case in the Netherlands, with the court ruling the Dutch state must increase its cuts to emissions. A Pakistani farmer has also won a ruling that the \u201clethargy of the state in implementing [climate policies] offends the fundamental rights of the citizens\u201d. And a Peruvian farmer is suing German energy company RWE over its alleged contribution to the melting glaciers near his Andean hometown.\nBut it is in the US, the world\u2019s most litigious nation, that the greatest number of cases have been brought. The most high-profile suit against the government is the Juliana case, filed by 21 teenagers in Oregon, which saw off a Trump administration attempt to halt it earlier in March.\nThe basis of the case, says Julia Olson, lead counsel for Our Children\u2019s Trust which is fighting the case, is failure of US administrations to protect its citizens by tackling global warming. \u201cThe US government has put these plaintiffs and other young people in a dangerous situation. First and foremost it is about personal security and the danger that exists presently. Beyond that, it is about protecting other fundamental rights under the US constitution \u2013 basic liberties such as to be able to decide where to live and to raise a family safely.\n\u201cI can\u2019t convey how egregious and incredible this story is across every presidential administration of our government going back 60 years,\u201d Olsen says. \u201cThis is not a Republican versus Democrat issue. Every president made those choices.\u201d \nWhile lawsuits against governments seek stronger action, those against the fossil fuel industry seek a simpler remedy \u2013 money. The argument is that these companies knowingly sold products that caused damage and a financial settlement is required, drawing parallels with the titanic legal battle fought and won against the tobacco industry.\nMichael Burger, at the Sabin Center, says there is a similarity in that these growing cases threaten a level of legal and reputational risk to the companies that might eventually force them to settle or face financial oblivion. \n\u201cThe other obvious similarity with tobacco is you have a long history of corporate obfuscation and attempts to blur the science and public understanding,\u201d he says. Some of the characters involved are even the same \u2013 on both sides \u2013 with the same scientists defending both tobacco and oil companies and the same lawyers prosecuting them.\n\u201cBut there is also a key difference,\u201d says Burger. \u201cTobacco is a product individual people inhale and it gives them cancer. Fossil fuel production is the beginning of a long chain of causation that includes numerous corporate actors and individual consumers, as well as government licensing and permitting schemes. The causal chain is much longer.\u201d\nScientists are now confident they can quantify the emissions resulting from each big company\u2019s fossil fuels \u2013 just 90 firms are responsible for two-thirds of all emissions. But lawyers for the fossil fuel companies are robust in their response, saying a causal link to damages is \u201cunprovable\u201d. \nThe oil giants are also fighting back, with ExxonMobil in January seeking court permission to \u201cinvestigate potential claims of abuse of process, civil conspiracy, and constitutional violations\u201d by the Californian officials suing them. One of these, Serge Dedina mayor of Imperial Beach, says: \u201cThis appears to be the same kind of bullying tactic that the industry uses again and again to avoid accountability.\u201d\nIndustry lobby groups are also mobilising against climate litigation in the US, with the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) launching a campaign against \u201cpolitically motivated legal attacks\u201d in November. \u201cIt has become clear that these activist plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, sympathetic academics and agenda-driven media outlets are distorting the use of tort litigation to advance their narratives with the ultimate objective of undermining manufacturers and the engine of the American economy,\u201d said Linda Kelly, NAM general counsel.\nHowever, an international panel of senior judges concluded in January that many companies around the world may well already be in breach of existing laws in relation to their impact on climate change. \u201cVery, very few enterprises currently meet their obligations \u2013 if they did [climate change] would mostly be solved,\u201d said Jaap Spier, who was advocate general in the Dutch supreme court until 2016 and part of the panel that published the assessment.\nSpier says judges are influenced by growing concerns in society, such as worries over climate change, and are increasingly likely to look favourably on climate litigation in coming years. \u201cIf you assume companies don\u2019t [change] at some stage, I have not the slightest doubt that courts will understand that they must step in.\u201d\nMore and more climate cases are being filed, with lawyers suggesting a range of factors, from the election of Donald Trump to more extreme weather events, to revelations about what fossil fuel companies knew about climate change dangers, and a growing awareness of the urgent need to act. \nDespite this, major victories at a supreme court level still appear years off. But Burger says even wins along the way to the highest court add to the pressure for change: \u201cThere is a victory here which is just surviving the initial motions to dismiss. Having courts advance these cases towards a trial could itself move fossil fuel companies to want to start to seek some other solution.\u201d\nNick Butler, who spent 29 years at BP and is now at King\u2019s College London, says the companies do not believe the point has been reached where they are likely to lose cases but the pressure is real nonetheless: \u201cThe legal actions add a further dimension to the pressure for change in an industry that has begun to accept the need to reinvent itself.\u201d\nOlson argues that the courts are starting to recognise the urgency and highlights that the district judge in the Juliana case, Ann Aiken, said climate change needs to be addressed with \u201call deliberate speed\u201d. That is a potent phrase in the US, taken from the 1955 supreme court judgment on the Brown v Board of Education case that ordered the end of racial segregation of schools.\n\u201cWe need a decision that says you cannot discriminate against young people and deprive them of a climate system that will sustain their lives,\u201d she says. \n\u201c[Aiken] very much understands that constitutional rights are at stake and that speed is the critical factor here.

Crucially, climate change could threaten the supply of the key ingredients in these dishes, leading to substitutes.\nBritons could find themselves dining out on algae-fed chicken tikka masala, if chickens need to be fed on alternatives to soy if production is hit by higher temperatures and changes to rainfall. Other key ingredients of a tikka masala, such as rice, tomatoes and onions could all suffer price hikes and shortages as a result of fluctuating weather. \nTo mark Earth Hour, which starts at 8.30pm on Saturday 24 March, WWF is urging people to make promises to change their life in one small way to help the environment, such as refusing plastic cutlery, carrying a refillable cup or cutting back on meat. \n\u201cThe threat to these classic dishes just shows that climate change could impact every aspect of our lives in future if we don\u2019t act now,\u201d said Gareth Redmond-King, head of energy and climate at WWF. \u201cThat\u2019s why we want people to eat more sustainably. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean going vegan or vegetarian \u2013 it means each of us cutting back on the amount of fish, meat and dairy. If each of us takes a small action, together we can combat climate change and future-proof our best-loved dishes.\u201d\nBacking the scheme is One Planet Plate \u2013 a campaign by the Sustainable Restaurant Association to put sustainability on the menu and a chance for chefs worldwide to demonstrate to diners how they are sourcing and cooking sustainably.

The judge, who previously learned coding techniques for a Silicon Valley lawsuit, has set out a list of questions for a climate change \u201ctutorial\u201d on the floor of the courtroom on Wednesday.\nWe\u2019ve sought to help out the judge by answering his queries.\nThe onset and decline of ice ages on Earth over the past few million years have been primarily influenced by slight changes in the Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun, which alters the amount of sunlight bombarding the polar regions. \nThe last ice age started melting away around 19,000 years ago, which raised the global sea level by around 120 metres. The \u201clittle ice age\u201d wasn\u2019t a true ice age \u2013 rather a period of relative cooling in the northern hemisphere up until the 19th century, probably to do with volcanic eruptions and reduced solar activity. Since then, there has been a sharp decline in glaciers and sea ice driven by human-caused warming, rather than any other factor. \nIt\u2019s rather complex, but basically the molecules of gases such as carbon dioxide are able to bend and slow down solar radiation bouncing off the Earth and returning to space. Nitrogen and oxygen aren\u2019t able to do this and so do not have the same greenhouse impact upon the planet. \nInfrared radiation from the sun hits the Earth and reflects back off the surface. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere intervene by trapping this heat and preventing it from escaping. \nAs the world\u2019s factories, vehicles and farms pump out tens of billions of tons of greenhouse gases every year, this has caused the Earth to warm by around 1C (1.8F) over the past century. \nA bit, but not enough to really matter. \nAll that human activity does give off heat, although it\u2019s dwarfed by the heating caused by greenhouse gases. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates this direct heat is around one hundredth the size of greenhouse gas-driven heat. The equation is slightly different in some large cities, however, due to the urban heat island phenomenon. \nAlsup\u2019s grade school was right \u2013 humans (and other animals) breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. But this expulsion of CO2 is in balance with the world around us.\nSay you eat a potato. In the months before you ate it, the potato grew by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Your meal provides you with some energy and you then breathe back out the CO2. So the process is essentially carbon neutral.\nExtra carbon is being released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels, which have been buried in rocks for hundreds of millions of years. Plants and oceans are sucking up a huge amount of this extra CO2, but not all of it. The result is a warmer atmosphere and a warmer ocean. \nThe burning of huge amounts of coal, oil and gas to power our homes, vehicles and factories. \nLosing an area of world\u2019s forests equivalent to the size of New Zealand each year through cutting and fire isn\u2019t helping either.\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency chief, Scott Pruitt, is also puzzled by this one, but the scientific community has been clear \u2013 the primary cause of recent warming has been the emission of carbon dioxide, along with other gases such as methane. \nHuman activity is the \u201cdominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century\u201d according to the US government\u2019s latest climate assessment, with industrialization likely responsible for 0.6C to 0.8C in warming since the early 1950s.

A tropical low has formed in the Arafura Sea and forecasters have warned it could develop on Thursday or Friday into a cyclone, likely tracking south-east towards the Gove peninsula and the Gulf of Carpentaria.\nThis morning I visited Parap Primary (open) &amp; pre school (closed power trees).

Given the key role of forests for carbon storage, no RFA should be renewed without investigating their impact on climate change.\n\u201cThe unnecessary rush to push ahead with early renewal of these agreements lays bare the government\u2019s intentions: a quick and dirty escape from a complex policy issue before the 2019 state election.\u201d\nSharpe\u2019s comments came after Guardian Australia revealed on Wednesday the \u201cnow quite old\u201d science that underpins the existing RFAs and whether they \u201cremain valid for proposed extensions\u201d.\nThe move by NSW Labor puts pressure on federal Labor to toughen its position on the RFA renewals across Australia.\nA delegation of environment groups led by the National Parks Association of NSW will be in Canberra next Tuesday lobbying government and Labor MPs over the science underpinning the extended RFAs.\nOisin Sweeney, senior ecologist for the NPA, said it was significant that NSW Labor was insisting climate change be considered as part of new assessments of Australia\u2019s native forests.\n\u201cClimate science wasn\u2019t part of the comprehensive regional assessments for the old RFAs done 20 years ago, but clearly it should be now.\u201d\nAlso yesterday, the Bob Brown Foundation flagged the possibility of challenging the Tasmanian RFA, which was extended last year on a permanent rolling five-yearly basis.\nJenny Weber, campaign manager for the foundation said, \u201c[We\u2019re] not surprised by the revelations today in The Guardian that the regional forest agreements are at risk of being legally invalid.\n\u201cThe Tasmanian regional forest agreement was rolled over last year and the death warrant was signed on thousands of hectares of wild forests in Tasmania. This RFA, and any that will be rolled over in other states of Australia, is based on 20-year-old environmental and scientific assessments. That makes them a farce.\n\u201cWe know this old science is driving species to the brink of extinction, for example the critically endangered swift parrot. Despite pleas by scientists working to prevent the swift parrot\u2019s rapid spiral towards extinction \u2013 they have called for logging not to occur in the parrot\u2019s habitat \u2013 logging of their habitat continues in Tasmania\u2019s southern forests.\u201d\nLogging also continues in the Tarkine rainforests.\nA\nSharpe criticised the Berejiklian government\u2019s consultation on the long-overdue reviews of the RFAs and called for a proper assessment without a predetermined outcome.\n\u201cNo one has been fooled by this all-in-one review and sham consultation exercise being undertaken in NSW \u2013 a review for which the outcome has already been decided is not really a review, so it is no wonder that numerous key stakeholders abandoned the consultation process.\nShe said concerns about the consultation had also been raised by scientists and environment groups which have withdrawn from the consultations because the government announced that it is was committed to renewing the RFAs regardless.\n \u201cLabor has been unequivocal: Labor will not sign off on a rollover of the RFAs until there is a proper, independent, scientific assessment of their outcomes, and the assumptions of the original RFAs are revisited.\n ", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/logging-and-land-clearing", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "In wake of Guardian Australia report, Penny Sharpe says regional forest agreements must include climate change as a consideration", "date_published": {"$date": 1521651611000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1524101217000}, "authors": ["Gregg Borschmann"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["New South Wales", "Australia news", "New South Wales politics", "Environment", "Conservation", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Logging and land-clearing"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/22/nsw-labor-refuses-to-approve-forestry-agreements-based-on-out-of-date-science", "og:description": "In wake of Guardian Australia report, Penny Sharpe says regional forest agreements must include climate change as a consideration", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dd4a1ff2ba068ba4598d0e8362d179165b59de9/0_911_3499_2100/master/3499.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=554288a2de1d035f9c106670a1c42ca1", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "NSW Labor refuses to approve forestry agreements based on 'out-of-date' science"}, "headline": "N", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dd4a1ff2ba068ba4598d0e8362d179165b59de9/0_911_3499_2100/master/3499.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=49f046a8b858de4a5850530af29d9c9e", "width": "3499", "height": "2100", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dd4a1ff2ba068ba4598d0e8362d179165b59de9/0_911_3499_2100/master/3499.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=100170643335d2e09868ea0050f861a3", "description": "NSW Labor accused the government of trying a \u2018quick and dirty escape from a complex policy\u2019.\nPhotograph: DEA / N.

During that time, the Murray-Darling basin\u2019s water managers scrambled to meet demand, as the region experienced a run of days over 35C between 16 and 29 January.\nBut it is the long-term scenario that has environmentalists and water authorities worried. Growth in permanent plantings, mainly water-intensive almond trees, has dramatically increased in the region. \nIn the 20 years from 1997 to 2015 the area under irrigation in the Sunraysia district increased by 41% or 45,000 hectares, according to the Sunrise project that uses aerial photos to map land use.\nThere was some reversal during the millennium drought, but the pace of expansion has intensified in the past two years.\nAn additional 4500ha of permanent plantings (mainly almonds) was planted last winter and another 15,500ha is due to go in over the next five years along the lower Murray.\n\u201cThe whole region is booming agriculturally,\u201d Andrew Kremor, Lower Murray Water\u2019s manager of customer and stakeholder relations, said. \u201cAlmonds are booming, table grapes are booming, even wine grapes.\u201d \nKremor said Lower Murray Water had managed to meet demand during January\u2019s hot spell by planning ahead, raising the level of water in storages and reminding users of conservation measures such as watering at night.\nBut the Victorian Farmers Federation\u2019s water council chairman, Richard Anderson, said the region had been \u201cjust days off facing major water restrictions\u201d. He said: \u201cIf the hot weather had continued, we would have been in real trouble.\u201d\nAnderson said the problem was likely to get worse because many of the almond trees had yet to reach maturity, which would increase the demand for water.\nMuch of the irrigation expansion is also taking place on the basis of temporary water rights that are purchased each season, raising fears of what will happen if there is another drought.\nThere is no real sense of what water is truly available.\nThe ability to trade water throughout the Murray-Darling basin system has created a kind of gold rush. Under the Murray-Darling basin plan, it is possible to buy water rights outright or for a season from water holders and use them elsewhere in the river system. Restrictions are only triggered when river levels fall below certain thresholds.\nAs well as issues around availability of water, there are also delivery constraints. The Bambah choke limits the flow of water from the upper Murray to the Sunraysia region.\n Longtime resident of Mildura and celebrity chef Stefano de Pieri is worried. \u201cCitrus is going very well, because of China. Also table grapes. People are investing a lot of money in almonds. At the moment they are doing well, but how long is a piece of string? Where do they get the confidence from?\u201d\n\u201cI am baffled because there is no real sense of what water is truly available and what is not,\u201d he said. \u201cBuying, selling, renting. No one can really guarantee me that this water is available.\u201d\nIn the millenium drought between 2005 and 2009, farmers in Mildura went through the heartbreak of having to leave citrus orchards and vineyards to wither. A number of family farms went under. De Pieri fears it will happen again.\nThe Murray Darling Basin Authority, which has oversight of the basin plan acknowledges that the risk of not having enough water to meet demand in the lower Murray has gone up substantially.\n\u201cFrom governments\u2019 point of view \u2013 and that\u2019s commonwealth and state governments \u2013 we are aware of the increasing development and are doing quite a bit of work on understanding what that will mean for future water demand,\u201d said the MDBA\u2019s executive director of river management, Andrew Reynolds.\n\u201cWe got through that peak period this year \u2013 we managed pretty well \u2013 but we are conscious that if development continues, the risk profile increases as well.\u201d\nHe said the MDBA\u2019s role was to make sure investors were aware of the increasing risks and to provide information so they could make informed decisions.\nHe said the MDBA was doing research on when nut plantations require their peak amount of water and how this would interact with demand from other crops.\nReynolds said if another drought occurred the price of water rights was likely to rise sharply but this would likely prompt seasonal crop producers such as cotton and rice growers to sell their entitlements rather than plant.\nIn Mildura, between 2005 and 2009 during the millennium drought, large areas under irrigation were left to die after farmers who had been reliant on purchasing temporary water found themselves facing impossible prices.\nAt the moment Mildura feels like a boom town, riding on the water equivalent of a gold rush. \n When the Guardian visited last week the coffee shops were full and the main street busy. Evidence of expansion of irrigation was everywhere, with new plantings taking root, literally.\nThe local press was trumpeting the record prices being paid for irrigated properties. \nLast week CK Life Sciences International, a company owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka Shing paid $45m for citrus and grape producer Naniloc Colignan Farms. In 2016 the company snapped up Seven Fields at Redcliffs in 2016 for $90m.\n\u201cThe last 20 years has seen huge corporatisation and huge usage of big tracts of land to grow things. The game has changed. Whether the plan itself was the driver of this expansion, or the expansion itself is globally driven, it\u2019s not clear,\u201d De Pieri said.\nHe says the risk will be to the remaining small family farmers who will face skyrocketing water prices in a dry season. \u201cWe are operating in a vacuum, it\u2019s grab what you can, when you can,\u201d says De Pieri.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/water", "https://www.theguardian.com/weather/victoria", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/rural-australia", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/agriculture", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Farmers and others in Mildura region are warning trees could be left to wither and die", "date_published": {"$date": 1521661174000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1521664162000}, "authors": ["Anne Davies"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Drought", "Water", "Environment", "Victoria", "Victoria", "Australia news", "Climate change", "Rural Australia", "Agriculture"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/22/murray-darling-system-under-strain-as-tree-plantations-increase-41", "og:description": "Farmers and others in Mildura region are warning trees could be left to wither and die", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e887ff6603ad0a924d0c3b70ba5c22fe0c3fcd91/0_0_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=2a6b4fcdef99b32fdb2029b52b7b4eca", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Murray-Darling system under strain as orchard plantings increase 41%"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e887ff6603ad0a924d0c3b70ba5c22fe0c3fcd91/0_0_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=31d139ec4c45a5042b9193a1255e05dc", "width": "3000", "height": "1801", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e887ff6603ad0a924d0c3b70ba5c22fe0c3fcd91/0_0_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=61f32dd78a9570dec9e7432be5cf0f8d", "description": "Growth in permanent plantings, mainly water-intensive almond trees, has dramatically increased in the Mildura region.\nPhotograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c9ed51fcb70f07e6f922f56e0202d65aa8e599c/225_0_1050_630/master/1050.png?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d9ca8ace031452fa18de5e0137b931e4", "width": "1050", "height": "630", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c9ed51fcb70f07e6f922f56e0202d65aa8e599c/225_0_1050_630/master/1050.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0436f00a9c3e4eb4fa535fc9fe51dcc3", "description": "Stefano de Pieri, chef and Mildura resident, says despite brisk trade in water, no one can guarantee its availability.

The sea ice provides almost perfect concealment for submarines but brings problems too.\nWhile the upper surface of the ice is smooth the underside is ridged with keels extending downwards for many metres and creating a dangerous collision hazard.\nThis uneven ice surface also scatters sonar, sometimes producing phantom images and confusing navigation. From a submarine, the ceaseless creaking and groaning of the shifting pack ice above takes some getting used to; worse, the high-pitched sounds can interfere with sonar reception.\nThe military submarines use sonar to measure the thickness of the ice, helping to validate scientific models of how the cover has changed over the years.

The Coalition wanted AGL to prolong the operating life of Liddell a further five years.\nAGL rebuffed Canberra\u2019s request and is proceeding with its own plan. The company says the extra capacity to replace Liddell will come from: a gas peaker power plant at Newcastle or another New South Wales site (250MW); an upgrade of the Bayswater coal plant (100MW); a Liddell battery (250MW); demand response (up to 150MW); a second gas peaker (500MW); and renewables (1,600MW).\nThe energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, sought advice from the Australian Energy Market Operator after AGL made its decision public, and that advice will be released by the government on Friday.\nAemo concludes that extra generation capacity will be required in NSW unless AGL rolls out all three stages of its transition plan, or a competitor steps into the breach. It says without full commitment from AGL or new capacity from elsewhere \u201cthere remains a high risk of load shedding following the closure of Liddell\u201d.\nIt says if an additional 850MW of dispatchable power resources is added to the electricity market by 2026-27, that will reduce the risk of load shedding to a one-in-10-year likelihood after the closure of the coal plant.\nWhile there is a significant level of contracted capacity for renewable generation coming on stream over the next few years, Aemo says more dispatchable power is required because there is insufficient interconnector capability to ensure the reliable delivery of new electricity supply into NSW from other regions during periods of peak demand.\nThere is also a risk that generators underperform in high-demand conditions.\nThe impact of climate change is another factor. Aemo has told the government that the number of days each year involving \u201cextreme peak temperatures\u201d are increasing, requiring the market operator to work with the Bureau of Meteorology on its modelling and forecasting methods.\nIt says its experience in running the national electricity market over the past two summers indicates that a combination of higher-than-average temperatures, unplanned generation outages and loss of generation owing to weather conditions have pushed the grid into \u201clack of reserve\u201d conditions.\nAnother factor is the increasing penetration of solar panels. Aemo says embedded solar PV generation across the national electricity market is leading to a later and shorter peak in operation demand.\nThe change in the generation mix is impacting the market operator\u2019s forecasting models, as well as leaving the grid more exposed to prevailing weather conditions.\nAemo says if governments can agree on the government\u2019s proposed national energy guarantee, that will provide the underlying policy framework to drive the necessary investments in disptachable generation in NSW.\nIt says if governments don\u2019t sign off on the national energy guarantee and have the mechanism in place by next December, an alternative process to contract the 850MW of capacity will need to be pursued. It recommends a mechanism that can be used specifically in NSW, that is consistent with a pending national energy guarantee, be agreed by the end of 2018.\nThe national energy guarantee, if it is adopted by governments, would impose new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020.\nThe Energy Security Board is leading consultations with a range of stakeholders about the design of the policy, which will be considered by federal and state energy ministers on 20 April.\nWhile environment groups and several market analysts have significant concerns about the Turnbull policy, the government\u2019s chances of securing support for the national energy guarantee have improved courtesy of Jay Weatherill\u2019s departure as the South Australian premier after Saturday\u2019s state election.\nFrydenberg says the Aemo advice reinforces the need for \u201cgovernments at federal, state and territory level to get behind the national energy guarantee as our pathway to a more reliable and affordable energy system\u201d.\nHe is calling on AGL \u201cto commit as soon as possible to the next stages of their plan\u201d, saying \u201cthe existence of a major shortfall in dispatchable power following Liddell\u2019s closure would clearly present an unacceptable situation undermining the stability of the system\u201d.\nAGL welcomed the Aemo advice, saying it confirmed the NSW generation plan \u201caddresses the potential shortfall\u201d that may follow the closure of Liddell.\n\u201cWe also welcome the market operator\u2019s view that a competitive market approach to deliver the required resources is best for consumers,\u201d AGL said in a statement.\nIt noted an independent assessment of AGL\u2019s plan found the replacement generation would cost $83/MWh, compared with extending Liddell at $106/MWh. \nOn Friday Frydenberg told Radio National those figures only reflected \u201cthe costs to them as a company in terms of maintaining Liddell staying open\u201d. \n\u201cWhat they\u2019re not talking about is the cost to the market of having greater volatility in it,\u201d he said.", "keyword_urls":

San Francisco and Oakland have sued the world\u2019s biggest fossil fuel companies, arguing that they are responsible for damages related to global warming.\nWhile climate change-related cases have entered courtrooms throughout the US, the judge in the California case, William Alsup, took the unusual step of convening a formal \u201ctutorial\u201d on the subject \u201cso that the poor judge can learn some science\u201d, allowing renowned experts and some of the biggest oil companies to answer key questions. \n\u201cFrom Chevron\u2019s perspective, there\u2019s no debate about climate science,\u201d said Theodore Boutrous Jr, the attorney for the US oil giant, which chose not to have scientists or experts testify on its behalf. While he repeatedly referred to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) conclusion that it is \u201cextremely likely\u201d humans have been the dominant cause of warming since the mid-20th century, he also worked to paint the problem as an international one for which individual corporations are not liable. \n\u201cClimate change is a global issue that requires global engagement and global action,\u201d he said, later saying \u201cproduction and extraction\u201d are not responsible for increases in emissions, but rather \u201ceconomic and population growth\u201d are, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s the way people are living their lives.\u201d \nThe attorney spoke for hours in a packed San Francisco courtroom of attorneys, journalists and activists who lined up early in the dark of morning to get a seat, with dozens forced into a crowded overflow room and many live-tweeting fact-checks and commentary. \nThe communities in California, known as a leader in climate activism, have argued that greenhouse gas emissions from the companies\u2019 activities over time will cause billions of dollars\u2019 worth of damage, have locked in significant rises in sea level, and are endangering lives. The defendants are accused of long knowing the environmental impact of their emissions and working to deny and conceal this knowledge. \nThe Chevron attorney also presented a graph showing that China is burning more coal than the US, saying: \u201cIt really goes to the global nature of this.\u201d\nEnvironmentalists, however, pointed out that the assessment ignored cumulative emissions and that the US is the biggest carbon polluter in history.\nDon Wuebbles, who helped lead the 2013 IPCC assessment of climate science and 2014 US National Climate Assessment, testified for the cities and noted that Chevron was relying on outdated reports: \u201cThe science does not stop at 2012 \u2026 There\u2019s a lot we have learned over the last five years.\u201d\nHe talked about severe weather incidents becoming more intense and noted that 2014 was \u201cthe warmest year on record\u201d, adding: \u201c2015 was warmer. 2016 was warmer yet.\u201d Seventeen of the last 18 years were the warmest on record, he said. \nChevron did not present any science from climate deniers, but climate change contrarians with ties to Donald Trump\u2019s administration have also gotten involved in the litigation, offering to contribute a presentation. \nWilliam Happer, a Princeton University physicist, rumored last year to be a frontrunner for Trump\u2019s science adviser, co-authored a recent motion in the case that said: \u201cIt is not possible to tell how much of the modest recent warming can be ascribed to human influences.\u201d He has previously described climate scientists as \u201ca glassy-eyed cult\u201d. \nAlsup, known as an unorthodox judge, who memorably learned to code for a Silicon Valley intellectual property lawsuit, said he had read headlines comparing his hearing to the famous Scopes \u201cmonkey trial\u201d on evolution in the US and urged reporters in the room not to blow the event out of proportion. \n\u201cIf you get bored, you can just leave,\u201d said Alsup, who said he wore his \u201cscience tie\u201d with a solar system in honor of the hearing.\nAlthough there was no meaningful cross-examination, the five-hour hearing offered a window into how the oil corporations can attempt to simultaneously acknowledge human-caused climate change while trying to fight off this type of litigation. Courts across the globe have increasingly become the new frontline for climate action, and the San Francisco case could also build a factual foundation that could be cited in future suits. \nAt one point, Boutrous clarified that he was not speaking for the other companies, and Alsup at the end of the hearing ordered the other defendants to file motions saying whether they agreed with the Chevron attorney: \u201cYou can\u2019t get away with sitting here in silence.\u201d ", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-francisco", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california", "https://www.theguardian.com/law/law-us", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Courtroom showdown in San Francisco pitted liberal cities against oil corporations, and saw judge host unusual climate \u2018tutorial\u2019", "date_published": {"$date": 1521674320000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1540375164000}, "authors": ["Sam Levin"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "San Francisco", "Environment", "Science", "US news", "California", "Law (US)"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/21/climate-science-lawsuit-san-francisco-sues-chevron", "og:description": "Courtroom showdown in San Francisco pitted liberal cities against oil corporations, and saw judge host unusual climate \u2018tutorial\u2019", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f76b389235cfcd255ff4fc2274ac1274f1748ba3/0_176_4744_2846/master/4744.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=56ebf568f60fe7a315abbc248745b905", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Climate science on trial as high-profile US case takes on fossil fuel industry"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f76b389235cfcd255ff4fc2274ac1274f1748ba3/0_176_4744_2846/master/4744.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2b6fa0a3140f5eeab6ac7e6d3c5a7ebe", "width": "4744", "height": "2846", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f76b389235cfcd255ff4fc2274ac1274f1748ba3/0_176_4744_2846/master/4744.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=744d55dd2e45e9c0aa706de51588995a", "description": "Scientists rally in San Francisco to draw attention to attacks on climate science by the Trump administration in 2016.\nPhotograph: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3709f6a185d5c2c7f6b913a8c09cd64affc732ed/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b44dd856474d303def14c3cc60346b6a", "width": "3500", "height": "2101", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3709f6a185d5c2c7f6b913a8c09cd64affc732ed/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=953720b66f755dc8b6b2f314f75dce36", "description": "Chevron sought to paint climate change as a product of \u2018the way people are living their lives\u2019, not the fault individual corporations.

They\u2019re suing five major oil companies (Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, ConocoPhillips and BP) to pay for the cities\u2019 costs to cope with the sea level rise caused by global warming. Chevron\u2019s lawyer presented the science for the defense, and most notably, began by explicitly accepting the expert consensus on human-caused global warming, saying:\nFrom Chevron\u2019s perspective, there is no debate about the science of climate change\nChevron\u2019s first slide quotes #IPCC: \u201cIt is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.\u201d Says there is no debate on this consensus. #climatetutorial #climateliability\nDeniers filed briefs in support of the defense, but they contradicted Chevron\u2019s tutorial. For example, one brief filed by a group led by Christopher Monckton and Willie Soon began by stating, \u201cThe \u201cconsensus\u201d about global warming is 0.3%, not 97%\u201d (this is obviously incorrect). Another brief filed by William Happer, Steve Koonin, and Richard Lindzen argued that \u201cIt is not possible to tell how much of the modest recent warming can be ascribed to human influences.\u201d Chevron and the IPCC disagree.\nWhile it\u2019s normal for climate deniers to deny the 97% expert consensus that humans are driving global warming, those submitting briefs on behalf of Big Oil were clearly not on the same page as its lawyer. Perhaps the oil companies should have sent the deniers a memo to stay out of this case. Clearly these groups are accustomed to denying climate science on the oil industry\u2019s behalf.\nThe judge mandated that those submitting briefs detail their funding sources, and they listed a litany of oil companies and fossil fuel-funded think tanks. Among those listed by Monckton and Soon\u2019s group were ExxonMobil, the Heartland Institute, and the Charles G. Koch Foundation. Among those listed by Happer, Koonin, and Lindzen were the Heritage Foundation, Peabody Coal, the Cato Institute, and the Texas Public Policy Foundation.\nIt\u2019s a perfect example of the oil industry\u2019s two-faced behavior. For decades their own scientists quietly published peer-reviewed research concluding that humans are causing global warming. That was the face we saw from Chevron\u2019s lawyer. But at the same time, oil companies were funding contrarian scientists and think tanks to spread denial and doubt about that same science. That was the face revealed in the denier briefs.\nAlthough they accept the expert climate consensus, the oil companies obviously don\u2019t want to be held liable for the costs of the climate damages their products cause. In addition to emphasizing and exaggerating climate science uncertainties, Chevron\u2019s lawyer noted that the IPCC states that climate change is caused \u201clargely by economic and population growth,\u201d not fossil fuel extraction. In other words, the oil industry\u2019s strategy is to argue that individual climate impacts are difficult to pin down, and in any case, the blame lies not with the producers, but with the consumers of their products. It\u2019s eerily similar to an argument made by tobacco industry lawyers:\nThose who decide to start smoking or continue smoking should assume responsibility for a choice they make -- because no one can say they don\u2019t know about the dangers associated with smoking\nIn short, the industry lawyers argue that the consequences are the fault of smokers and energy consumers, not the companies producing the dangerous products.\nThat argument didn\u2019t work for the tobacco industry in the past, because they knew of the health risks associated with consuming their products, yet engaged in campaign to manufacture doubt to convince people to keep smoking. Ultimately, a federal judge found the tobacco industry guilty of fraud to further a conspiracy to deceive the American public about the dangers of their products.\nIt\u2019s a more difficult case to make against the oil industry because their scientists published climate research in peer-reviewed journals available to the public, and their campaign to manufacture doubt about human-caused climate change was waged through intermediaries. They funded think tanks to do their dirty work, as we saw in the denier briefs.\nTobacco industry executives continued publicly denying their own scientists\u2019 findings to the very end, even under oath. \nThe oil industry has modified the tobacco playbook by accepting the scientific consensus. And Chevron\u2019s lawyer argued that as a complex global problem, any climate remedies should be addressed through government policy rather than via the legal system.\nSince it effectively owns the Republican Party, Big Oil can afford to accept the science to avoid legal ramifications, without fearing any such legislative consequences unless the Democratic Party takes full control of the US government, which won\u2019t happen until 2021 at the earliest. \nIt\u2019s a brilliant strategy, and until Democrats take power and pass a carbon tax or other similar climate legislation (or enough Republican lawmakers stop denying the science and start finding bipartisan policy solutions), it might just work. \nBut even if they lose this lawsuit, at least the cities of San Francisco and Oakland forced the oil companies\u2019 hand. In a high-profile case, they accepted the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming. These companies have employed scientists researching climate change for four decades, and as the world\u2019s biggest and most profitable producers of carbon-polluting products, have the strongest motivation to deny climate science. If even Big Oil accepts the reality of human-caused climate change when pressed in court, it\u2019s difficult for anyone else to deny it from here forward.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change-scepticism", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/exxonmobil", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/chevron", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Dana Nuccitelli: If even oil companies accept human-caused global warming, why doesn\u2019t everybody?", "date_published": {"$date": 1521799201000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1521799373000}, "authors": ["Dana Nuccitelli"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "Climate change scepticism", "Fossil fuels", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Energy", "Climate change", "Science", "ExxonMobil", "Chevron", "Royal Dutch Shell", "BP", "ConocoPhillips", "Energy industry", "Oil and gas companies", "Oil"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/23/in-court-big-oil-rejected-climate-denial", "og:description": "Dana Nuccitelli: If even oil companies accept human-caused global warming, why doesn\u2019t everybody?", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b22eb3d90374d72f3d1012197597be3f100cb626/0_54_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=a5f747c9e53cdf6e8b2b8a85d270bdf1", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "In court, Big Oil rejected climate denial | Dana Nuccitelli"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "O", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b22eb3d90374d72f3d1012197597be3f100cb626/0_54_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=23d3cf767a2ab72546e66608ebb42758", "width": "3500", "height": "2099", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b22eb3d90374d72f3d1012197597be3f100cb626/0_54_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=717be7c605762638c0e640ab7d57510b", "description": "A combination of file photos shows the logos of five of the largest publicly traded oil companies - BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, and Total.\nPhotograph: REUTERS/Reuters"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/960e0fd164ce36fcb66e77cc8c6f0cb8ff4e953d/0_0_1020_574/master/1020.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=60611b68e02fefd150be47ee3c8bc487", "width": "1020", "height": "574", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/960e0fd164ce36fcb66e77cc8c6f0cb8ff4e953d/0_0_1020_574/master/1020.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=01af8b979c07b1a8d212be294739e54c", "description": "What #ExxonKnew vs what #ExxonDid.

The debate is not about that at all, as Nuccitelli well knows which you can confirm by reading his other writings. \nThe fact that the oil company scientists are mainstream should come as no surprise to anyone who has read their published journal papers over the years and decades, and it demonstrates how deceitful Nuccitelli is being. The actual denial is not of if, but of how much global warming is likely to occur from our accelerating CO2 emissions and its increasing concentration from 280 ppm 150 years ago to 405 ppm now, on its way to a double of 560 ppm later this century. The how much is a function of two things-1) quantity of CO2 emissions2) climate sensitivity to CO2- the amount of warming from a doubling of CO2 ppmThese two are critical factors for any understanding how much warming will occur- continued modest warming, which seems the most likely trend, and would probably be benign as Freeman Dyson, Richard Lindzen, and Bjorn Lombourg predict or serious, even catastrophic warming from high climate sensitivity, as James Hansen and a few others predict. \nFor over 50 years, determining climate sensitivity has been the main quest of climate science, but it stubbornly remains in the huge range of 1.5 to 4.5 according to the IPCC (and 0.6 to 6.0 if we include the outliers Lindzen and Hansen). The un-quantifiable positive and negative feed backs, mostly from from H20 water vapor and clouds, have so far made the determining climate sensitivity impossible. \nThe \"climate denial\" Nuccitelli characterizes as science denial is instead the well respected position that climate sensitivity is near the low end of the IPCC 1.5 to 4.5 range, based on the empirical record, global temperatures the past 20 years, and the majority of recent peer reviewed papers by climate scientists. \nWhereas, helping the public and politicians understand climate science so that we might find common ground and craft responsible policy for what is likely- a continuing warming trend (about 0.9 C degrees the past 150 years) and sea level rise (about 2-3 mm per year) Nuccitelli instead is a source of misrepresentation about climate change, climate consensus, climate denial, and climate science.

Eventually, I expect full electric to take over, but hybrids bridge the gap pretty well.

There is clearly considerable scientific research going on in an effort to improve our understanding of climate.

This is the area in which the understanding of the well-informed layperson should be little different to that of the climate professional.

Science and engineering were largely absent\u2022 Negative press that delayed a move away from fossil fuels was not a factor in the mess that was South Australia's energy policy. The state has had a green-oriented labor government for 16 years, and a population that has been generally enthusiastic about de-carbonisation. They cannot possibly claim that their strategy vacuum is the fault of others.\u2022 The notion that the fossil fuel industry, and its investors, are responsible for a lack of transparency and manipulated messages was certainly not the case in South Australia. A government commissioned review that pointed out the problems with the strategy adopted (building far more wind capacity than could be integrated with current or planned developments) was not used to correct the future approach, but was buried because it pointed out obvious flaws\u2022 Subsequent actions were more about trying to appear \"right\" than to correct the problems, with the exception of accepting that some form of energy storage was going to be essential in the short term (it was an obvious requirement from before the \"all wind\" strategy was adopted, but dismissed because of expense). The consequence being a battery whose purchase terms were a secret. Secrecy would not have been required if any part of this were good news, and no doubt the new government will present the facts for public review as soon as possible as part of the bitter pill that the energy consumers in South Australia are going to have to swallow to get reliability back into their electricity supply.\nSo, try to find scapegoats all you want. In my view, the balance of the blame (such as there is) lies firmly with those who push for ill-considered outcomes without due regard for cost and practicality, and who take stupid decisions in order to respond to what they think that the population wants - when the population is being deliberately frightened and is therefore less able to make good judgements about what they want and need. \nJust to clarify, much of the blame for wrong decision making lies with you Alarmists.", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "113970011", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "it pointed out obvious flaws\u2022 subsequent actions were more about trying to appear right", "effect": "was buried"}, {"cause": "expense", "effect": "dismissed"}]}, {"id": "113970011", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1521928827000}, "author": "AvMichelCroz", "author_id": "13022945", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\n\"I'm talking about large scale national infrastructure, not your school science project. Governments need to justify the cost of installations to the public, and \"because it's new\" doesn't work the way it does with consumer goods.\"\nBQENDActually, I was responding to your comment about the rise of the motor vehicle. Exact analogues of what you claim as the driver have been present in the form of electric and hybrid cars for some time. The uptake is small because their financial advantage is negative - less economical than diesel equivalents, but more expensive than prestige cars.\nDont you imagine that the majority of people would like to use \"green\" energy? But, like \"organic\" food, these things are price sensitive. And wind and solar are patently not delivering thus far.\nOf course some impetus is required to move governments to make changes. My concern is that Alarm & conviction cause stupid decisions to be taken. For example South Australia is doing a passable analogue of the old lady who swallowed a fly. Having built a wind source that is very large compared with State demand (and by that, I mean it is capable of producing over 100% of demand with wind), the cost of electricity skyrocketed and the distribution system and backup infrastructure was shown to be inadequate. South Australia relied increasingly on make-up power transferred from the adjacent state of Victoria, generated largely from brown coal in ancient power stations that are accounted to be the most polluting in the world (and that is not just the new definition of CO2, that is pollution). Not a great win for the environment.\nAfter high-profile failures of the electricity supply on a grand scale, and with electricity costs continuing to escalate (with increasing public anger at getting caught coming and going, and the large scale manufacturing industries in the State have now all closed down - at least in part due to energy costs), the state government decides to install storage capacity. Not just any storage capacity, a lithium array supplied by Elon Musk. To say that this was expensive would be an understatement. The key factor was that it was supplied in the shortest period of time once Jay (the premier) and his mates had decided that it was time to swallow a spider to catch the fly they swallowed when they built such a huge wind array with no complementary developments to make it work properly. And the reason for the rush? An upcoming state election. Thus the immense successes of this new battery were constantly in the press until just about the time that the election was held and Jay and his mates lost. As of early 2018 Jay and his mates are out of power and the Liberals are in.\nOne expensive battery, of very limited capacity, was/is not the answer. And indeed the elements of that battery are going to need to be replaced starting in around 12 months or so, in order to remain on the most favourable part of the cost curve of capacity/function vs operating cost. I leave the interested reader to research this more deeply themselves, my purpose is not to debate the fact that storage batteries are essentially a consumable.\nThis battery is a somewhat superficial non-solution. I'm sure we will hear a lot more about it now that there has been a change of government. In addition, perhaps the review that was carried out on the effectiveness and economics of the wind installations, draft report buried without trace in 2013, will now see the light of day.

The reality is that nuclear power is being built as part of the solution to AGW. Nuclear power is now being built globally at the fastest rate in 25 years. \nThe fact is that the IPCC has always included nuclear power in the mitigation solution (although at one time Greenpeace did manage to sneak in an activist to bias the IPCC report in favour of renewables; but that rather makes my point).\nNuclear power definitely reduced emissions; and the more it could be deployed since the 1970s, the more it displaced fossil fuel and reduced emissions\nBQSTART\nThere has always been an alternative, that of RE \nBQEND\nTell it to the judge.\nFirstly, there is no evidence whatsoever that wind or solar could have done the same as nuclear power in the 1970s. The underlying technology did not exist to produce cheap silicon panels or large wind trubines. There were serious attempts at renewables after the 1970s oil shock; plenty tried - but nobody succeeded anywhere. In contrast the technology for producing cheap nuclear reactors was already in its prime.\nSecondly, even if we assume a miraculous boost in 1970s tech level; Germany has since comprehensively proved that the solar/wind solution scales much more slowly than France's nuclear solution (as well as coming 30-40 years later).\nSo nuclear power was the best, and probably only, scalable alternative to fossil fuel in the 1970s and 1980s.

Only in my 40s did I become a person whose heart lifts whenever he hears a grosbeak singing or a towhee calling, and who hurries out to see a golden plover that\u2019s been reported in the neighbourhood, just because it\u2019s a beautiful bird, with truly golden plumage, and has flown all the way from Alaska. When someone asks me why birds are so important to me, all I can do is sigh and shake my head, as if I\u2019ve been asked to explain why I love my brothers. And yet the question is a fair one: why do birds matter?\nMy answer might begin with the vast scale of the avian domain. If you could see every bird in the world, you\u2019d see the whole world. Things with feathers can be found in every corner of every ocean and in land habitats so bleak that they\u2019re habitats for nothing else. Grey gulls raise their chicks in Chile\u2019s Atacama desert, one of the driest places on Earth.\nEmperor penguins incubate their eggs in Antarctica in winter. Goshawks nest in the Berlin cemetery where Marlene Dietrich is buried, sparrows in Manhattan traffic lights, swifts in sea caves, vultures on Himalayan cliffs, chaffinches in Chernobyl. The only forms of life more widely distributed than birds are microscopic.\nTo survive in so many different habitats, the world\u2019s 10,000 or so bird species have evolved into a spectacular diversity of forms. They range in size from the ostrich, which can reach 2.7 metres (9ft) in height and is widespread in Africa, to the aptly named bee hummingbird, found only in Cuba. Their bills can be massive (pelicans, toucans), tiny (weebills) or as long as the rest of their body (sword-billed hummingbirds). Some birds \u2013 the painted bunting in Texas, Gould\u2019s sunbird in South Asia, the rainbow lorikeet in Australia \u2013 are gaudier than any flower. Others come in one of the nearly infinite shades of brown that tax the vocabulary of avian taxonomists: rufous, fulvous, ferruginous, bran-coloured, foxy.\nBirds are no less diverse behaviourally. Some are highly social, others anti. African queleas and flamingos gather in flocks of millions, and parakeets build whole parakeet cities out of sticks. Dippers walk alone and underwater, on the beds of mountain streams, and a wandering albatross may glide on its three-metre wingspan 500 miles away from any other albatrosses. I\u2019ve met friendly birds, like the New Zealand fantail that once followed me down a trail, and I\u2019ve met mean ones, like the caracara in Chile that swooped down and tried to knock my head off when I stared at it too long. Roadrunners kill rattlesnakes for food by teaming up on them, one bird distracting the snake while another sneaks up behind it. Bee-eaters eat bees. Leaftossers toss leaves. Thick-billed murres can dive underwater to a depth of 213 metres (700ft), peregrine falcons downward through the air at 240 miles an hour. A wren-like rushbird can spend its entire life beside one half-acre pond, while a cerulean warbler may migrate to Peru and then find its way back to the tree in New Jersey where it nested the year before.\nBirds aren\u2019t furry and cuddly, but in many respects they\u2019re more similar to us than other mammals are. They build intricate homes and raise families in them. They take long winter vacations in warm places. Cockatoos are shrewd thinkers, solving puzzles that would challenge a chimpanzee, and crows like to play. (On days so windy that more practical birds stay grounded, I\u2019ve seen crows launching themselves off hillsides and doing aerial somersaults, just for the fun of it, and I keep returning to the YouTube video of a crow in Russia sledding down a snowy roof on a plastic lid, flying back up with the lid in its beak, and sledding down again.) And then there are the songs with which birds, like us, fill the world. Nightingales trill in the suburbs of Europe, thrushes in downtown Quito, hwameis in Chengdu. Chickadees have a complex language for communicating \u2013 not only to each other but to every bird in their neighbourhood \u2013 about how safe or unsafe they feel from predators. Some lyrebirds in eastern Australia sing a tune their ancestors may have learned from a settler\u2019s flute nearly a century ago. If you shoot too many pictures of a lyrebird, it will add the sound of your camera to its repertoire.\nBut birds also do the thing we all wish we could do but can\u2019t, except in dreams: they fly. Eagles effortlessly ride thermals; hummingbirds pause in mid-air; quail burst into flight heart-stoppingly. Taken all together, the flight paths of birds bind the planet together like 100bn filaments, tree to tree and continent to continent. There was never a time when the world seemed large to them. After breeding, a European swift will stay aloft for nearly a year, flying to sub-Saharan Africa and back, eating and moulting and sleeping on the wing, without landing once. Young albatrosses spend as many as 10 years roving the open ocean before they first return to land to breed. A bar-tailed godwit has been tracked flying nonstop from Alaska to New Zealand, 7,264 miles in nine days, while a ruby-throated hummingbird may burn up a third of its tiny body weight to cross the Gulf of Mexico. The red knot, a small shorebird species, makes annual round trips between Tierra del Fuego and the Canadian Arctic; one long-lived individual, named B95 for the tag on its leg, has flown more miles than separate the Earth and the moon.\nThere is, however, one critical ability that human beings have and birds do not: mastery of their environment. Birds can\u2019t protect wetlands, can\u2019t manage a fishery, can\u2019t air-condition their nests. They have only the instincts and the physical abilities that evolution has bequeathed to them. These have served them well for a very long time, 150m years longer than human beings have been around. But now human beings are changing the planet \u2013 its surface, its climate, its oceans \u2013 too quickly for birds to adapt to by evolving. Crows and gulls may thrive at our garbage dumps, blackbirds and cowbirds at our farms\u2019 feedlots, robins and bulbuls in our city parks. But the future of most bird species depends on our commitment to preserving them. Are they valuable enough for us to make the effort?\nValue, in the late Anthropocene, has come almost exclusively to mean economic value, utility to human beings. And certainly many wild birds are usefully edible. Some of them in turn eat noxious insects and rodents. Many others perform vital roles \u2013 pollinating plants, spreading seeds, serving as food for mammalian predators \u2013 in ecosystems whose continuing wildness has touristic or carbon-sequestering value. You may also hear it argued that bird populations function, like the proverbial coal-mine canary, as important indicators of ecological health. But do we really need the absence of birds to tell us when a marsh is severely polluted, a forest slashed and burned, or a fishery destroyed? The sad fact is that wild birds, in themselves, will never pull their weight in the human economy. They want to eat our blueberries.\nWhat bird populations do usefully indicate is the health of our ethical values. One reason that birds matter \u2013 ought to matter \u2013 is that they are our last, best connection to a natural world that is otherwise receding. They\u2019re the most vivid and widespread representatives of the Earth as it was before people arrived on it. They share descent with the largest animals ever to walk on land: the house finch outside your window is a tiny and beautifully adapted living dinosaur. A duck on your local pond looks and sounds very much like a duck 20m years ago, in the Miocene epoch, when birds ruled the planet. In an ever more artificial world, where featherless drones fill the air and Angry Birds can be simulated on our phones, we may see no reasonable need to cherish and support the former rulers of the natural realm. But is economic calculation our highest standard? After Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear steps down from the throne, he pleads with his elder two daughters to grant him some vestige of his former majesty. When the daughters reply that they don\u2019t see the need for it, the old king bursts out: \u201cO, reason not the need!\u201d To consign birds to oblivion is to forget what we\u2019re the children of.\nA person who says, \u201cIt\u2019s too bad about the birds, but human beings come first\u201d is making one of two implicit claims. The person may mean that human beings are no better than any other animal \u2013 that our fundamentally selfish selves, which are motivated by selfish genes, will always do whatever it takes to replicate our genes and maximise our pleasure, the non-human world be damned. This is the view of cynical realists, to whom a concern for other species is merely an annoying form of sentimentality. It\u2019s a view that can\u2019t be disproved, and it\u2019s available to anyone who doesn\u2019t mind admitting that he or she is hopelessly selfish. But \u201chuman beings come first\u201d may also have the opposite meaning: that our species is uniquely worthy of monopolising the world\u2019s resources because we are not like other animals, because we have consciousness and free will, the capacity to remember our pasts and shape our futures. This opposing view can be found among both religious believers and secular humanists, and it too is neither provably true nor provably false. But it does raise the question: if we\u2019re incomparably more worthy than other animals, shouldn\u2019t our ability to discern right from wrong, and to knowingly sacrifice some small fraction of our convenience for a larger good, make us more susceptible to the claims of nature, rather than less? Doesn\u2019t a unique ability carry with it a unique responsibility?\nA few years ago in a forest in north-east India, I heard and then began to feel, in my chest, a deep rhythmic whooshing. It sounded meteorological, but it was the wingbeats of a pair of great hornbills flying in to land in a fruiting tree. They had massive yellow bills and hefty white thighs; they looked like a cross between a toucan and a giant panda. As they clambered around in the tree, placidly eating fruit, I found myself crying out with joy. It was the sheer gorgeous fact of the great hornbill, which couldn\u2019t have cared less about me.\nThe radical otherness of birds is integral to their beauty and their value. They are always among us but never of us. Their indifference to us ought to serve as a chastening reminder that we\u2019re not the measure of all things. The stories we tell about the past and imagine for the future are mental constructions that birds can do without. Birds live squarely in the present. And at present, although our cats and our windows and our pesticides kill billions of them every year, and although some species have been lost for ever, their world is still very much alive. In every corner of the globe, in nests as small as walnuts or as large as haystacks, chicks are pecking through their shells and into the light.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/animals", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Birds are not just diverse, vivid and extraordinary.

In 2015, the International Energy Agency calculated that CCS could help reduce global carbon emissions by 13%, delivering a huge chunk of reductions needed by 2050 to keep below a 2C rise.\nCCS technology aims to capture carbon dioxide generated at coal plants and store it underground in rock formations and aquifers.\nBut so far no major coal power plant has managed to make CCS work on a grand scale. Costs have proved prohibitive - especially as low natural gas prices have made coal uncompetitive.\u00a0\nRose Dickinson, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThis is a significant victory for local residents and the climate, it means an important step forward has been taken in ending the era of fossil fuels.\u201d\nExplaining Javid\u2019s decision, officials said: \u201cHe concludes that overall the scheme would have an adverse effect on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change of very substantial significance, which he gives very considerable weight in the planning balance.\u201d\nThe communities secretary said the impact on global warming, together with harm to the local landscape, outweighed the economic benefits of the mine.\nBanks Mining, which submitted its planning application in 2015 and had argued the project would bring substantial investment to the local area, hit out at what it branded a \u201cperverse decision\u201d.\nGavin Styles, the company\u2019s managing director, said: \u201cIt has been made for purely political reasons and is totally contrary to the principles of local decision-making that previously appeared so important to Mr Javid.\u201d The company said it had not yet decided whether to appeal.\nThe use of coal for electricity generation has plummeted in the face of carbon taxes and competition from gas, but the Highthorn site is not the UK\u2019s only proposed new coal mine.\nWest Cumbria Mining wants to build a \u00a3200m mine at Woodhouse in Cumbria, south of Kendal, which would be the UK\u2019s first deep coal mine in several decades. The company plans to extract metallurgical coal for steel-making rather than power generation.\nCumbria county council has so far postponed meetings on the project, and late May is understood to be the earliest it will decide whether to approve or reject the mine. Two coal power stations this year have already announced closure plans, after which the UK will have just six coal plants.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/northumberland", "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/cumbria", "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sajid-javid", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/friends-of-the-earth", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Sajid Javid says environmental impact of Northumberland plan outweighs economic benefits", "date_published": {"$date": 1521807777000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1521844139000}, "authors": ["Adam Vaughan"], "article_section": "Business", "article_tags": ["Mining", "Business", "Northumberland", "Cumbria", "Sajid Javid", "Friends of the Earth", "Environment", "Politics", "UK news", "Fossil fuels", "Energy", "Climate change"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/23/minister-rejects-opencast-coal-mine-northumberland-citing-climate-change-fears", "og:description": "Sajid Javid says environmental impact of Northumberland plan outweighs economic benefits", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d8080c53a3e287e85356b0557310094f13308d0/0_90_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=0f7380b2caec0d9d152f9b3c1d459b80", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Minister cites climate change in rejection of opencast coal mine"}, "headline": "m", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d8080c53a3e287e85356b0557310094f13308d0/0_90_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bea445e5c29122f66e3cf295d66771e2", "width": "1200", "height": "720", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d8080c53a3e287e85356b0557310094f13308d0/0_90_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=18ed6aa0269d5cf2b15f8aa7cba40a77", "description": "Law firm ClientEarth said the decision was the first time the UK government had rejected a planning application citing climate change as the reason.\nPhotograph: Durham University/PA"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc08463a2c3613145ed9044"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/23/its-more-than-just-turning-off-the-lights-what-else-to-do-for-earth-hour", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "For one hour every March since 2007, darkness has swept the globe as grassroots environmentalists, schools, offices and those responsible for some of the world\u2019s most iconic landmarks switch off lights in a symbolic call for more action on climate change.\nThis year, the WWF, which manages the initiative, hopes to build on its growing success and says millions of actions will be taken in at least 180 countries and territories. A record 187 countries took part in the event\u2019s record breaking 10th year.\nAn hour is not going to save the world \u2013 but a key message in publicising the event is that every action counts and that energised individuals can make genuine change to the way we think about human impact on the planet.\nEver wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?\nThis series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.\nReaders can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com\nThe WWF says highlights of its pushes for new legislation include the banning of all plastics in the Galapagos in 2014, planting 17 million trees in Kazakhstan and pushing new laws for the protection of seas and forests in Russia.\n Here, readers tell us how they are going further than the hour (you should switch off the lights from 8:30-9:30pm local time) with gestures such as refusing plastic, leaving the car at home and hosting events to inspire others in 2018. \nI\u2019m making my own promise for the planet and refusing plastic cutlery when eating out, and I\u2019m asking all the members of my 15k-strong Facebook community to join in, make their own pledges on 24 March and spread the word.\nWhen faced with huge issues like plastic pollution and climate change, it can feel overwhelming, as if we as individuals could never hope to achieve anything meaningful, but this is so wrong! Earth Hour is a brilliant event to raise awareness of the plight of the planet and allows people to show that they care. If everybody who makes a promise carries through with it, and the changes continue beyond Earth Hour, it really will make a difference in reducing the amount of plastic and carbon overloading the planet.\nI am part of a local community group called Sustainable Chard. We have organised a day of events called Earth Hour Chard, including events aimed at the younger members of our town where they can learn about upcycling, renewable energy, planting and growing. During the afternoon there will be eco talks and workshops where people can learn how to reduce their impact on the planet with topics on travel, food, the home and carbon footprints and in the evening we have assembled live bands, musicians, poets, green traders and therapists for an Earth Hour extravaganza. \nWe aim to engage as many people as possible, showing that the event is more than just switching off the lights: if we are to make any impact on climate change we will need to look at every part our lifestyles.\nI am not just going to turn the lights off for an hour, I want to try to live in as environmentally friendly way as possible for the day. I will tell as many people as possible at school and locally to convince them to contribute to the effort. \nAt home, I\u2019ll unplug all electrical devices and lights during Earth Hour. I\u2019ll try to persuade my parents not to use the car and to use public transport instead. I will not buy any plastic (food in plastic wrappings, bottles etc) or meat (which I don\u2019t do anyway, as I am a vegetarian). In the evening when it\u2019s dark I will try to not turn on any lights and use candles for light instead. \nOur voluntary organisation Mid-Ohio Valley Climate Action has convinced Parkersburg city government, the county government and the federal buildings to turn off all the lights that they can. We\u2019ll have a candlelit event with acoustic music at a park in the midst of dimmed downtown on the night. \nWe hope to make people mindful of the need for conservation and energy efficiency and to educate on anthropogenic global climate change while encouraging environmental and climate activism and continued coalition-building. \nAt the school where I teach, we all wrote promises for the planet and hung them on our \u201cpromise tree\u201d. I made 120 vegan flapjacks so that we could have a plastic-free breaktime and the children brought wild cuddly toys to school to raise money to sponsor four endangered animals. At home I am holding a candlelit Earth Hour dinner for 12 people, for which none of the ingredients can have been packed in plastic or use unsustainable palm oil. It\u2019s quite a challenge! \nEarth Hour is largely symbolic, but it gets people thinking about the environment and what they can do personally. My message is that if we all do something, together we can make a big difference. By making promises about what we can do ourselves, it forces us to consider our own impact on the environment and our own responsibility. Governments and big companies have the power to do more, but this does not absolve us of responsibility. By holding the dinner party and asking some of my guests to make a plastic-free pudding, we have all become more aware of how plastic surrounds almost everything we buy. I now look at my shopping in a different way and I hope that other people will do so too.\nI run a Guide unit in Groomsport, County Down, and we are participating in this year\u2019s Earth Hour by running the entire evening in the dark, with no electricity. We are doing an environmental scavenger hunt around the local area as we meet beside the sea, gathering items such as plastics and litter to clean up our village a little bit, toasting marshmallows under tealights and trying to draw pictures in the dark.\nWe hope to raise awareness of both Earth Hour itself and the WWF aims and values locally within our community. We want to do our bit in helping save the planet and show the Guides that you do not need to use so much electricity. We hope this event will inspire other local Guide, Brownie and Rainbow units to do the same and make this an annual event.\nI run a social enterprise called the Gastro Hub in Folkestone aiming to connect people through sustainable food, cooking, conversation and communal dining experiences. Our overall mission is to reduce avoidable food waste and carbon emissions by preventing surplus food from going to landfill, through a community-led infrastructure to divert and transform this food into delicious and nutritious meals. \nFor Earth Hour we are hosting a community candlelit supper serving warming soup made with surplus vegetables rescued from farms by the Gleaning Network in Kent. We are hoping to spread awareness of the individual and collective power we have to affect change on our environment. By bringing local people together in a way that demonstrates simple actions we can all take to reduce our carbon footprint, we hope that it will inspire a positive behaviour shift-change in others.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wwf", "https://www.theguardian.com/society/girl-guides", "https://www.theguardian.com/society/scouts-and-scouting"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Readers share their plans and inspirational messages for others planning to get involved in Earth Hour, a major electricity switch off on 24 March", "date_published": {"$date": 1521819855000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1551698570016}, "authors": ["Guardian readers"], "article_section": "World news", "article_tags": ["Earth Hour", "Climate change", "Environment", "WWF", "Guides", "Scouts and scouting"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/23/its-more-than-just-turning-off-the-lights-what-else-to-do-for-earth-hour", "og:description": "Readers share their plans and inspirational messages for others planning to get involved in Earth Hour, a major electricity switch off on 24 March", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/909e51d897f876c286569261d7a3b6ee9f756f46/320_76_2516_1509/master/2516.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=0ff91c508398fec5a1b911fa8886c86e", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "'It's more than just turning off the lights': what else to do for Earth Hour"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/909e51d897f876c286569261d7a3b6ee9f756f46/320_76_2516_1509/master/2516.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9779572942c735191955d8f4eb3e2da5", "width": "2516", "height": "1509", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/909e51d897f876c286569261d7a3b6ee9f756f46/320_76_2516_1509/master/2516.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9d9d4a9ec58029c51b601770b3a37e77", "description": "Sydney Opera House, which will go dark for Earth Hour.\nPhotograph: Greg Wood/AFP/Getty Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac38fc95a7f180937742ec8971939162ade328ad/328_0_1310_1638/master/1310.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1f724f4bdb88610af37af6ed9997eba3", "width": "1310", "height": "1638", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac38fc95a7f180937742ec8971939162ade328ad/328_0_1310_1638/master/1310.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f19beb63e55bb4167efe40dade9afec6", "description": "Jen Gale is pledging to refuse plastic cutlery when eating out."}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/897adc512fb2f6073566270b4372269ae74d9a7f/478_260_1563_1954/master/1563.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cd0082edcf604c4df8ba10798fb44fc2", "width": "1563", "height": "1954", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/897adc512fb2f6073566270b4372269ae74d9a7f/478_260_1563_1954/master/1563.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=58dac9935106e59a631be38d4f37c512", "description": "Jo Harper is holding a candlelit dinner for which no ingredient will have been packed in plastic."}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b498cb5e9e5c70b4db95d0af94be56fd78641711/154_97_327_408/master/327.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=52d316ad1ed096887ba50cc1445a22e9", "width": "327", "height": "408", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b498cb5e9e5c70b4db95d0af94be56fd78641711/154_97_327_408/master/327.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fafae4b0f95b64493816acb57cdb4545", "description": "Charmaine Jacobs aims to reduce avoidable food waste with a candlelit soup supper."}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556127899979}, "comments": [{"id": "113940045", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1521845470000}, "author": "CommunityMod", "author_id": "2902769", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Comments on this thread will close shortly.

I think everyone should be asked to turn off their lights and commit to do one thing differently going forwards. Many good ideas here like refusing plastic cutlery if not planning on eating away from somewhere which can reasonably wash knives and forks. don't use straws. Ideas include:\nNever open a window (or leave a door open) if the heating is on - if humidity is your concern, buy a dehumidifier. Plan meals so as not to throw food away (probably the number 1 thing any individual can do) Walk to the shops, or take a bus - can be surprisingly pleasantTake a train to a city center, then use a taxi or Uber.Recycle intelligently, it harms recyclers to put the wrong things in there or food encrusted items (but never heat water to clean something for recycling)\nBigger things include next time you buy a car buy the most fuel efficient one which meets your needs. Invest in insulation, it will pay you back and the environment. Campaign for the reforestation of land which is unfarmed. Campaign for tidal power - essential to provide electricity on windless days (energy storage is important in general). Campaign to get a digester in your local area to take food waste (better than composing, which is better than land-fill)\nFinally, ignore any idiot who tells you to stop using plastic items. They are almost always better for the environment that any alternative other than using nothing. Just be sure to recycle or throw in regular rubbish.

We now know celebrations should be put on hold. Figures for 2017 published last week show global emissions from energy have jumped back up again, to a historic high.\nThe data from the International Energy Agency shows we still have much to do when it comes to stopping global warming. Three years ago experts cautioned that 2015\u2019s near standstill in emissions might be only a temporary pause before resuming the upward march as India and China developed. Those warnings were prophetic.\nGlobal energy demand last year grew by 2.1%, more than double the rate in 2016, driven largely by Asia. The problem for the climate is that more than 70% of the growth came from fossil fuels. Gas was the fastest-growing fossil fuel. But even coal, the most carbon-intensive fuel, reversed two years of declines and was up by 1%, as coal burning in China, India and South Korea grew.\nTo compound matters, progress on energy efficiency slowed dramatically in the face of lower energy prices and weakening government policy. On the plus side, renewables were the fastest-growing source of new energy and had another unprecedented year. China added as much solar power in a single year as the total installed capacity across France and Germany. The US scored the steepest drop in emissions, despite Donald Trump\u2019s first year as president, as new renewable generation bloomed.\nIndeed, with renewables records being broken seemingly every week \u2013 last weekend the UK set a new high for wind power \u2013 it is easy to think the fight has been won. But the IEA\u2019s work is a sobering reminder that stratospheric growth in renewables is not enough. Renewables put a brake on emissions but they don\u2019t stop coal, oil and gas from being dug out of the ground.\nThe most sobering figure in the agency\u2019s research is 81%: the amount of global energy that comes from fossil fuels. It\u2019s been about the same for the past three decades.\nSo, if the energy sector is still nowhere near compatible with the demands of climate science, and the goals set by nearly 200 governments in Paris three years ago, what do we do?\nDespair is not an option, and there are reasons for hope. One is Beijing\u2019s self-interest in tackling air quality, which means coal plant closures and bans, and the promotion of electric cars. India, the coal industry\u2019s last great hope, has witnessed a faster than expected rise in solar power, squeezing out coal projects. Germany\u2019s new government finally has plans to tackle the country\u2019s outmoded reliance on coal. Globally, coal capacity will begin shrinking in 2022 at the current rate of retirements, according to a new report.\nArguably the brightest and most promising trend is that renewables are on the brink of being economically viable without government subsidies. In the UK alone, an estimated \u00a320bn worth of wind and solar farms could be built without subsidies between now and 2030.\nThis year the UN is undertaking a stocktake of countries\u2019 climate plans and it should keep the IEA numbers at the forefront of its thinking.\nBut getting to the top of the carbon emission mountain and down again will not be achieved solely with more favourable economics and stronger government support.\nLeaders must take the much more politically difficult decision to penalise fossil fuels. The means are many: economy-wide carbon taxes are an obvious one that many energy firms claim to support. Bans on extraction of fossil fuels are a more extreme example. We must vote for those politicians who are bold enough to do this. We must renew pressure on them to say no to dirty energy, as well as yes to clean energy. Only then do we have a hope of permanently reducing emissions.\nNext boss Lord Wolfson has described 2017 as \u201cthe most challenging year we have faced for 25 years\u201d. It was quite a statement from Wolfson, the FTSE\u2019s second longest-serving chief executive (after WPP\u2019s Martin Sorrell), who has a reputation for being restrained and serious-minded.\nBut the problems facing the high street are mounting. Last week there was a raft of bad news \u2013 New Look is closing 60 stores, axing 980 staff and cutting rent payments to landlords. Carpetright is likely to close 100 stores and also wants rent cuts. Mothercare is in talks with its banks to restructure its finances. There was a grim profits warning from Moss Bros while Conviviality \u2013 the firm behind Bargain Booze \u2013 said it needed to find \u00a3125m or was likely to go bust.\nAll this a few weeks after Maplin and Toys R Us collapsed into administration. Debenhams and House of Fraser also have difficulties. Each, of course, has its own problems: mountainous debts, unpaid tax bills, or merely buying the wrong\u00a0stock.\nBut there are also major behavioural and structural\u00a0issues\u00a0\u2013 like the shift away from shopping towards leisure spending. Barclaycard data shows spending on women\u2019s clothing was down 3% last year, while spending on pubs, restaurants and entertainment was up more than 10%.\nThen there is the massive shift to buying online \u2013 and its impact on the bottom line. Next lost \u00a3141m of full-price high street sales last year, which resulted in lost profits of \u00a385m. At the same time online sales rose \u00a3167m \u2013 but that generated only \u00a332m of extra profit. So every pound lost on the high street costs the firm 60p of profit, while a pound gained online generates only 19p.\nThat is serious margin erosion, which many store chains and retail landlords have yet to fully acknowledge and prepare for.\nAs is often the case with Donald Trump, he might think his stand against Chinese \u201ceconomic aggression\u201d will add to his reputation as a wildcard US president breaking with convention to get results.\nBut as has been the case before in his presidency, he ought to be more careful. Trump\u2019s latest move of economic gunboat diplomacy \u2013 to impose punitive tariffs on up to $60bn (\u00a342bn) of annual imports from China on certain goods \u2013 could be his biggest gamble yet.\nAlthough the plan is to protect American manufacturers from being undercut by Chinese producers, most economists reckon it could push up prices for US consumers and lead to a damaging trade war.\nShould China retaliate by imposing tariffs on US imports of soya beans or aircraft parts, as has been suggested, that would also unpick any benefit Trump may derive from imposing tariffs on China. Farmers and ranchers in the south, some of his biggest supporters, would be hardest hit.\nIn effect, the president is starting a giant game of economic whack-a-mole: he may find a way to fix one problem only for another, potentially greater, to emerge.\nTrump has legitimate cause for concern when it comes to Chinese trade practices. China\u2019s protectionist policies and state support for industry make it hard for other countries to compete on the world stage. The US had a record $375bn trade deficit with China last year, which made up two-thirds of a global $566bn US trade gap with the rest of the world. Chinese use of western intellectual property also undercuts US firms.\nBut Trump\u2019s unilateralism risks alienating European allies from whom he might have found support for taking multilateral action against China. Throwing the EU a temporary reprieve from higher steel tariffs will not be enough to secure solid support from Brussels.\nPast experience suggests trade wars can have damaging consequences, while even moderate barriers erected by several nations at once could disrupt the complex global supply chains built up in recent decades.\nThe world should hope Trump\u2019s latest steps follow another well-worn path of his presidency so far: tough talk followed by measures falling short of the rhetoric.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbonfootprints", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-offset-projects", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "New data shows global emissions are at a historic high.

CO2 was involved then as was the placement of continents and other land masses around Antarctica. Tectonic removal of one such land mass leading to the development of the circum-Antarctic current and a significant drop in atmospheric CO2 led to global cooling 70 million years later; and led with the assistance of cyclic variations in Southern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation Antarctic to widespread continental glaciation on the great southern continent. Changes in Atlantic currents following the growth of the Isthmus of Panama and a decline from higher Pliocene CO2 levels led, in combination with variations in Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation (NHHLSI), to the glacial and interglacial periods of the last 2.6 million years. Each deglacial warming that transitioned from glacial to interglacial over thousands of years while initiated by NHHLSI was largely carried out by CO2. So a wide ranging view of the evidence for the causes of global warming shows that CO2 often plays a major part.\nThis time NHHLSI is declining and no other likely suspects have panned out; but CO2 has increased by 40% since the 19th century.

Debt is not a problem if you have willing investors or willing banks- westinghouse has neither.\nand here is the confusion- it is Nugen who calm its investors by saying just a few months ago that Kepco was willing to step in and it was made clear they were not going to step in and build a westinghouse design.\nway back in 2010 [if not before ] the UK govt had the intent to replace the old fleet [and that was supposed to happen 2023-25] and have 50% or so more nuclear by 2025.\nCurrently it is only EDF who are committed to building 3.2 GWthere may be plenty of intent- and plenty of serious interest.According to your ONR link it is only Anglesea that has actual paper work being processed.\nand that is the state of new nuclearby 2030 the UK will have lost 9-10 GW of nuclear.will definitely have Hinkley [unless EDF really screw it up and even the EDF execs have warned this project could 'bankrupt' them- although the French govt has bailed half the industry].Anglesea looks promising with another 2.5 GW Everyone else is very interested- even very very interested with a bucketful of intentbut one of them are in the bag.On a purely business level - right or wrong- the market sees offshore wind having no problem securing investment. There are no deals going on [such as with nugen] for the government to offer cheap loans and investment guarantees.nuclear is going to the govt with a legitimate USP- low carbon 24/7 but it comes at a cost.Of course the UK's is doing the most expensive thing- having one of every design instead of 10 reactors of the same design.I suppose it made some kind of sense- not putting all the eggs in one basket.\nBut if the nuclear industry fails it will be because of the nuclear industry. I really don't know which way it is going to play out - but something will happen in the next decade.On a language level the objective is not to cut CO2, that is the aim- the general intent. The objective in the UK is to do it using the market, to take the risk, to do it in a way that spreads risk- i.e. one each of every reactor, and wind and ... and ...etc. To keep the voters happy, without frightening the consumer- and sadly to appear like a good AGW fighting country so as to not lose face on the global stage.The quickest and cheapest route is 50% or so of onshore wind- after that it gets tricky but it would make a massive contribution- but nimbys vote conservative.", "recommendation_count": "3", "in_reply_to": "114021812", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "the nuclear industry", "effect": "it will be"}]}, {"id": "114028608", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1522078447000}, "author": "SunRoad", "author_id": "18399512", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nThen why bother?

So instead of talking about \"low carbon intensity energy\", \"renewables\" is preferred because it excludes Nuclear. Despite Nuclear being generally accepted by the well-informed as being an essential part of providing the quantities of cheap energy we require for our civilisation.\nMany so-called environmentalists are also vehemently anti-Hydro. In the USA there is now a worrying groundswell of people who want to \"free our rivers\". As a result, although renewable, Hydro is tacitly excluded. Sadly, Hydro has the excellent characteristic of being potentially variable in a way that make solar and wind energy reliable. However, this is not widely discussed, because Hydro is widely opposed. China's efforts at renewables are truly trivial, in terms of the promotion of China's energy that they supply - with the exception of Hydro. China has done a halfway reasonable job of installing Hydro capacity and the potential to install more.

From the day that we start selling only electric vehicles, it is likely to take roughly 7-8 years to halve the current rate of emissions from transport (20% of fossil CO2)\nWorld energy demand is going to continue to grow.

All the evidence points to the assertion that \"fossil fuels have had their day\" looks like wishful thinking.

I am not clear in what form the iron would have to be presented in order to be most effectively available. It would be nice to imagine that various iron-rich but otherwise inert industrial residues could potentially be introduced into the sea in order to enhance CO2 uptake.\nPeople are not going to stop commuting to work, or travelling internationally for business and pleasure.

The two energy sources I am most interested in are wind and solar power; however, there are other sources that have great potential.\nSome people doubt how much wind and solar can supply to a country\u2019s electricity grid. This is a particularly challenging question to answer in part because both solar power and wind power fluctuate in both space and time. We all know solar panels work well during the day, when the sun shines \u2013 they don\u2019t work so well at night. And wind turbines only send electrons when the wind is blowing. \nFortunately, these two sources of energy fluctuate in ways that complement each other. For instance, solar power generation is highest in the summer and lowest in the winter. Wind power is greatest in the spring and fall. Wind turbines work at night when solar panels are dormant. So, can these complementing variations help balance out the power that the two technologies can provide? \nThis question was addressed in a very recent paper published in the journal Energy and Environmental Science. The author list included Dr. Ken Caldeira, who is extremely well known for his years of work in environmental science and energy.\nThe authors analyzed 36 years of hourly weather data (1980\u20132015) in the US. They calculated the available wind and solar power over this time period and also included the electrical demand in the US and its variation throughout the year.\nWith this information, the researchers considered two scenarios. In scenario 1, they imagined wind and solar installations that would be sufficient to supply 100% of the US electrical needs. In the second scenario, the installations would be over-designed; capable of providing 150% of the total U.S. electrical need. But the authors recognize that just because a solar panel or a wind turbine can provide all our energy, it doesn\u2019t mean that will happen in reality. It goes back to the prior discussion that sometimes the wind just doesn\u2019t blow, and sometimes the sun isn\u2019t shining.\nWith these two scenarios, the authors then considered different mixes of power, from all solar to all wind. They also included the effect of aggregation area, that is, what sized regions are used to generate power. Is your power coming from wind and solar in your neighborhood, your city, your state or your region?\nThe authors found that with 100% power capacity and no mechanism to store energy, a wind-heavy portfolio is best (about 75% wind, 25% solar) and using large aggregate regions is optimal. It is possible to supply about 75-80% of US electrical needs. If the system were designed with excess capacity (the 150% case), the US could meet about 90% of its needs with wind and solar power.\nThe authors recognized that sometimes these systems generate too much power to be used. Under this situation, you could store the energy for later use. Imagine a solar panel generating excess energy during the day and able to store that power for night use. Power can be stored in several ways, for example in batteries or by pumping water into elevated tanks and then letting the water fall at night and turn a turbine. \nThe authors modified their study to allow up to 12 hours of US energy storage. They then found that the 100% capacity system fared even better (about 90% of the country\u2019s energy) and the optimal balance was now more solar (approximately 70% solar and 30% wind). For the over-capacity system, the authors found that virtually all the country\u2019s power needs could be met with wind, solar, and storage.\nThis study considered only wind and solar. If other sources, such as hydroelectricity, biofuels, or even nuclear power were added, it would be relatively straightforward to reach 100% clean energy. Furthermore, people are learning to use energy more wisely, either by using more efficient products or purchasing electricity during off-peak hours. These behavioral changes can also help us reach a 100% clean energy target.\nThe point is, the use of clean energy to power an entire country (or a group of countries) is achievable. It\u2019s no longer viable to say \u201cwe can\u2019t.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/windpower", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/solarpower", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog"], "share_count": "0", "description": "John Abraham: Wind, solar, and storage could meet 90\u2013100% of America\u2019s electricity needs", "date_published": {"$date": 1522058427000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1522058475000}, "authors": ["John Abraham"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Renewable energy", "Wind power", "Solar power", "Energy", "Environment", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Science"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/26/study-wind-and-solar-can-power-most-of-the-united-states", "og:description": "John Abraham: Wind, solar, and storage could meet 90\u2013100% of America\u2019s electricity needs", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5189c5c59d450946b9665d8258ea221430e36d7/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=34447155d2b370671c832ad4860fc8a4", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Study: wind and solar can power most of the United States | John Abraham"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5189c5c59d450946b9665d8258ea221430e36d7/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fa67a83dc97329e9722ef94773996d73", "width": "5616", "height": "3370", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5189c5c59d450946b9665d8258ea221430e36d7/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8db514a947e92a0a7909d4d4e2f51b7b", "description": "Wind turbines and solar panels.\nPhotograph: Alamy"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556127902304}, "comments": [{"id": "114274109", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1522667507000}, "author": "loco_p_man", "author_id": "13126382", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nWell then.... qualify it with a more updated fact if you have one rather than bloviating.\nBQEND\nIs there no beginning to your competence ?

How about 10 km \u00d7 10 km?\u0088 A plain old intermittent tide-pool of this size (3.3 MW/km2)would deliver 330 MW on average (assuming, as usual, a 4 m tidal range).\nWith pumping to 5 m above and below mean sea-level, a singlelagoon would deliver a net power of 650 MW.\u0088 The two-lagoon solution that does its own pumping woulddeliver a steady 450 MW.\u0088 It could also be used as a pumped storage system for intermittentor unwanted electricity. For example, it couldturn 550 MW (average) of bursty wind power into 750 MWof steady power. (A round-trip efficiency of 135%!) Or itcould turn 1.8 GW of bursty wind power into 1.9 GW of steadypower. A round-trip efficiency of 105% compares favourablywith Dinorwig\u2019s 75%.\u0088 For comparison of pumped storage capacity with Dinorwig\u2013 a profitable power station with a capacity to store 9 GWh\u2013 these tide pools would have a capacity of about 20 GWh(assuming a height change of 13 m). So this facility wouldbe worth two Dinorwigs. Indeed, it would be worth more,since it would be better than 100% efficient, in contrast toDinorwig\u2019s 75%.We need at least half of this water to have a depth of about13 m below mean sea-level. There\u2019s lots of shallow water aroundBritain. We need the tidal range to be as large as possible, too. Anideal location might be an area of shallow sea surrounding a smallisland, where the pumping facilities could be built. Alternativelythe high pool could be built on land. Offshore lagoons have manyadvantages, as advocated by Tidal Electric limited, and Friends ofthe Earth Friends of the Earth Cymru [2004]. I think the best twolocations in the British Isles are, on the East Coast, The Wash(where the mean spring tidal range exceeds 7 m) and, on the WestCoast, anywhere in the Irish Sea from the Mersey to the mouth ofMorecambe Bay (where there have been proposals to build a 12-mile bridge with built-in tidal and wind power)...............e other atCleveleys. Together these will have around 50 turbines.\u2019 The Washwould be big enough to fit one 10 km by 10 km tidal facility, butperhaps not more. The Irish sea is bigger. Both locations have atidal range bigger than I assumed, so the potential power is bigger\u2013 perhaps about twice as big, on average..........\n550 MW of bursty wind power seems to be valued at \u00a32.25 billion.The pumped storage solution presented in figure 9(a), requiringwalls of height 9 m above mean sealevel, would turn this 550 MW ofbursty wind power into 750 MW of steady demand-following power.It seems plausible to me that this service would be worth the estimatedcost of \u00a31.3 billion.\nIf the cost needs to be reduced, we simply make the systembigger. For example, we multiply the area by four (to 20 km \u00d720 km) and double the length of all the walls. The estimated costroughly doubles (to \u00a32.6 billion, say), but the storage quadruplesto 40 GWh (more than four Dinorwigs).

But the state is losing land to the seas at such a gallop that even its seemingly impregnable landmarks are now threatened.\nThe home of Tabasco, the now ubiquitous but uniquely branded condiment controlled by the same family since Edmund McIlhenny first stumbled across a pepper plant growing by a chicken coop on Avery Island, is under threat. An unimaginable plight just a few years ago, the advancing tides are menacing its perimeter. \n\u201cIt does worry us, and we are working hard to minimise the land loss,\u201d said Tony Simmons, the seventh consecutive McIlhenny family member to lead the company. \u201cWe want to protect the marsh because the marsh protects us.\u201d \nI mean, we could make Tabasco somewhere else. But this is more than a business,\u200b this is our home\nSimmons allows a silent pause as he mulls a situation where Tabasco is forced off the island. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it will come to that, but we are working to do everything we can to make sure it won\u2019t happen to us,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, we could make Tabasco somewhere else. But this is more than a business: this is our home.\u201d \nA geologic oddity, Avery Island rises to 163ft above sea level, making it a towering giant amid the supine flatness of Louisiana\u2019s coast. The 2,200-acre island \u2013 more accurately a hill of buried salt surrounded by bayou and marsh a couple of miles inland from Vermilion Bay, an inlet of the Gulf of Mexico \u2013 has long provided a sturdy home to Tabasco but now faces the danger of being marooned.\nThe Avery Island marshes are retreating by around 30ft a year as salt water seeps in, ushered in by canals dug by the oil and gas industry and the level of the land itself, which is gradually sinking by around a third of an inch a year. The salty brine kills off vegetation, loosens soils and accelerates erosion. \nFierce storms clatter into what\u2019s left of the marsh, which is also being slowly drowned by a warming ocean that\u2019s rising faster than almost anywhere else in the world. A further sea level increase of 2ft, almost certain given the warming that\u2019s already occurred, will leave only the lofty core of Avery Island dry, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \n \u201cThe marsh stands between us and Vermilion Bay, and we don\u2019t want to be right on the bay,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cWe have to be very aggressive about dealing with the land loss. We almost can\u2019t work fast enough.\u201d\n The threat posed to Tabasco is replicated along much of Louisiana\u2019s coast, where a football field of land is lost every 100 minutes. Around 2,000 sq miles of land, roughly the size of Delaware, has vanished from the state since the 1930s due to a cocktail of maladies and self-inflicted wounds, stemming from the overdevelopment of the Mississippi river and an unquestioning embrace of extractive drilling, topped off by the wrenching global consequences of climate change. \n The US has already been stripped of half of its wetlands since Europeans arrived and Louisiana, which accounts for a bulk of these losses, is on course to lose all of its wetland within two more centuries, according to the US Geological Survey. \n A master plan set out by the state government last year forecast a further 2,250 sq miles of Louisiana could be lost over the next 50 years, forcing 27,000 buildings to be flood-proofed, elevated or bought out.\n The plan sets out billions of dollars in work building protective seawalls, restoring marshland and increasing the amount of nourishing sediment carried to wetlands by the Mississippi, which hasn\u2019t been left to meander naturally since New Orleans was established 300 years ago. Thousands of people still face being relocated, but while state authorities have acknowledged this fate they have yet to grapple with the vast cost and emotional whiplash it will entail. \n \u201cYou go to Plaquemines parish and people will say they are already flood-proofed because they can pull their boat up to their door,\u201d said Rudy Simoneaux, an engineer at the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority. \u201cIt asks a lot of a shrimper or a crabber to relocate inland to Baton Rouge. They depend on the water. People are prepared to just rebuild and rebuild.\u201d\n The western half of Louisiana, where Avery Island sits, is particularly vulnerable as it is starved of the wetland-creating sediment dispersed by the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers. There \u201caren\u2019t many options\u201d for the region under the master plan, Simoneaux conceded.\n \u201cThe area doesn\u2019t have the materials to build wetlands \u2013 it has been torn to pieces by canals and pipelines and it has no natural barriers, so hurricanes come pounding in unobstructed,\u201d said Oliver Houck, an expert in land loss at Tulane University.\n \u201cIt is a ripped-up rug. It would take decades to put it back together, even without sea level rise. Avery Island is going to become an actual island, there won\u2019t be much left. The state has decided to put all its eggs into restoring the eastern part of the state. I hate to use the words \u2018written off\u2019, but those coastal communities are on their own.\u201d\n Unlike nearby residents who have resorted to rudimentary house elevations to stay above the foaming surf, the McIlhenny company has financial muscle to swing at its relentless foe. After Hurricane Rita turned much of the Tabasco production area into a pond in 2005, the company erected a 17ft earth levee, complete with pump system, to wrap the red brick factory in a protective hug. \n It has thrown itself into the task of wetland restoration by planting hardy cord grasses, refilling canals and erecting weirs that halt the advance of salt water. Wildlife, such as black bears, alligators and snowy egrets, have a protected area to roam on the island. \nClimate change has cast a shadow over several everyday staples, menacing the production of chocolate, the harvesting of hops for beer, the growing of coffee beans. Tabasco has no plans to join this list, with the company insisting the production of its peppers isn\u2019t at risk and that its ancestral home can be safeguarded. \n \u201cWe worry about anything that impacts our land,\u201d said Simmons, a craggy, genial man who wears pressed trousers and slathers Tabasco sauce on virtually any food bar his morning cereal. Paintings of peppers are displayed alongside the wooden ducks that sprout from his shooting trophies. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are working so hard on this.\u201d \nPepper plants used to blanket the slopes of Avery Island until the 1960s, when the property switched to seed cultivation and shifted the bulk-growing and mashing of peppers to various South American countries. The pulped peppers return to Avery Island and are aged for three years in stacked oak barrels towering in a pungent, cobwebbed warehouse before salt and vinegar is added in huge vats.\n Today, this company that was born shortly after the death of slavery pushes 750,000 bottles of product off its rattling production line each day, levered into cardboard boxes by mechanical arms and sent to more than 185 countries \u2013 the Japanese are particularly voracious consumers, dousing pizzas and spaghetti. \n Throngs of tourists visit a museum and shop that plays off this heritage. Many of them come straight from the other attraction two hours\u2019 drive to the east, New Orleans, which itself faces an existential crisis despite its huge investment in protective levees after Hurricane Katrina crunched into the city in 2005.\n The problem is apparent from the air, with much of the wetland that would buffer New Orleans from another Katrina in a state of decay, rotting and curling up like chewed cloth, dotted by boats and trucks that were swept away by the huge storm and never salvaged.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve had 300 years of bad decisions,\u201d said David Muth, director of Gulf restoration at the National Wildlife Federation. The lower reaches of the Mississippi have long been aggressively channeled via levees and other barriers, with this process accelerating in the 1930s after a major flood prompted Congress to authorise further intervention. Distributaries were severed and wetlands were drained or cut apart for farming, cypress logging and oil and gas drilling. \nThe result has been the choking off of sediment carried by the river to the marshes, causing the delta peat, grass and shrubs to dissolve away to open water in places. \n Meanwhile, New Orleans drained swamps for housing developments that now sit below sea level behind levees. \n \u201cThis area has been neglected for so long,\u201d said Happy Johnson, head of a community sustainability group in the Lower Ninth Ward neighborhood, worst damaged by the hurricane. He is concerned about lack of consultation locally.\n\u201cThere is very little trust in the government because there isn\u2019t consistent engagement with communities of colour. New Orleans is 60% black. How can you restore the wetlands and not have black and brown people involved? You can\u2019t save a place with half the people.\u201d\n There are signs of hope, at least environmentally. Recent diversions of sediment have provided a jolt of growth to patches of the delta, a restoration that would be further bolstered by the master plan\u2019s projects. \nThe branching wetlands, with white pelicans soaring overhead, remain an ecological wonder, persisting despite the scars of pipelines and the ongoing plight of its native communities, such as Isle de Jean Charles, that will be among the first climate change refugees in the US.\n ", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/louisiana", "https://www.theguardian.com/food", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "With thousands of square miles of land already lost along the coast, Avery Island, home of the famed hot sauce, faces being marooned", "date_published": {"$date": 1522126804000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1533228731000}, "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Louisiana", "Environment", "Food", "US news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/27/climate-change-louisiana-tabasco-avery-island", "og:description": "With thousands of square miles of land already lost along the coast, Avery Island, home of the famed hot sauce, faces being marooned", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebbf7b19b5e1a14a25970178c45a3612d65e81cb/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=f8182726752ab6e80b820541fc25cff8", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Hotting up: how climate change could swallow Louisiana's Tabasco island"}, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebbf7b19b5e1a14a25970178c45a3612d65e81cb/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c5a1b22f631ebccfafdfb220e91b0cfa", "width": "3000", "height": "1800", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebbf7b19b5e1a14a25970178c45a3612d65e81cb/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8735d4a91d8827f946ef64592bc92250", "description": "Avery Island, Louisiana, is home to Tabasco sauce.\nIllustration: R Fresson"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fcdfd88ff9b9524b047a54ff3b2f503d705dd7d/0_0_3000_2002/master/3000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=01a7f8446068bb9651ac64c0f4417fcd", "width": "3000", "height": "2002", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fcdfd88ff9b9524b047a54ff3b2f503d705dd7d/0_0_3000_2002/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2f3e72d84baac0abecf35d82792a93ff", "description": "Avery Island, the home of Tabasco hot sauce.

So more plants, and alternative sources of proteins such as peas, beans and nuts. \u201cIt\u2019s basically about eating less processed food, less meat, and more local food,\u201d says Tony Juniper, head of campaigns at WWF. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to preach but to lay out the facts and explain our choices.\u201d\nThere is no definitive ranking of the dishes with the lightest footprint, but Bon Appetit, an American chain of sustainable cafes, worked with the Ecotrust charity to suggest dishes based on assessments of the impacts of their ingredients over their life cycles (including the energy used in production and transportation, as well as fertiliser use).\nThe results, available at the Eat Low Carbon website, are as wholesome as you might imagine. Top of the list: a three bean soup, with CO2 emissions of just 54 grams per portion.

His book The Population Bomb predicted starvation in the 1970s, something that was avoided by the \u201cgreen revolution\u201d in intensive agriculture. The green revolution was the point at which farmers turned away from natural techniques (eg mixed farms and crop\u00a0rotation) and instead started using chemical fertilisers and pesticides along with hybrid plants whose seeds could often not be harvested for re-use. This led to higher yields at first, but then to exhausted and polluted soil and increasing debt to\u00a0suppliers.\nThe role of the green revolution was to \u201cdelay the calamity\u201d. But at a great cost to nature. So what was humankind\u2019s reaction to these developments? Instead of stopping to take stock, we became addicted to the consumerist traits of \u201ccheap and abundant\u201d with no thought for the real cost and inherent risk.\nThe world is now moving into further \u201crevolutions\u201d involving GM crops, the establishment of mega-farms and digitalisation. For me these are newer, more aggressive techniques for \u201coverdrawing our account\u201d with the natural world. And\u00a0everyone knows that a surefire way to ultimate calamity is to try to pay a debt by taking on more debt.\nHats off to Paul Ehrlich but shame on the human race.Alan MitchamCologne, Germany\n\u2022 It is depressing to see the Guardian recycling Paul Ehrlich\u2019s discredited views. The key fact of contemporary population trends is that the birth rate in the developing world is now lower than it was in rich countries a few decades ago. There are no good estimates of the population-carrying capacity of our planet, but it is almost certainly well above the likely peak of population that will be reached in the second half of this century. Reducing the vast global inequalities in energy consumption will do far more for the environment than the ultimately racist idea that the poor have too many children.Prof John MacInnesCentre for Population Change, University of Edinburgh\n\u2022 Paul Ehrlich\u2019s prediction of half a century ago \u2013 of the end of civilisation in a decade or two \u2013 may be the most obvious aspect of his theory, but it is not the most fundamental. Far more important is his failure to recognise that what he calls the \u201cperpetual growth of human enterprise\u201d is linked not to human activities as such, but to the economic system of capitalism whose raison d\u2019etre is profit making. Every time goods or services are sold, profit is made which is then reinvested to start another cycle of profit making.\nThis process takes place regardless of whether the profit is directly reinvested to make more commodities, or indirectly by passing it on to others to invest by purchasing their goods or services or by depositing it into a bank which lends it to others to invest. It follows that economic growth and its complementary growth in consumption, what he calls overconsumption, are byproducts of profit making and if they are to be unnecessary, then we have to do away with profit making altogether.Fawzi IbrahimAuthor, Capitalism Versus Planet Earth\n\u2022 Paul Ehrlich\u2019s views on population are understandable although such concerns go back millennia. The\u00a0elephant in the room is that human numbers will only fall if deaths exceed births; we can all complain about other people\u2019s kids but contemplating our own obituary is less popular.\nA further concern is squeezing the same population into less space. Climate change is now being fuelled by emissions from melting ice sheets and their knock-on effects; these could easily outweigh reductions from human emissions. Huge numbers of climate refugees may need rehousing in decades to come, to say nothing of food, clothing and the jobs required to afford decent lifestyles. Given the current attitudes to migrants, how keen will richer countries be to take people or to fund moving them to less populous but still habitable areas?Iain ClimieWhitchurch, Shropshire \n\u2022 The issue of overstretched cities is an important one (The 100 million city: is 21st century urbanisation out of control? on 1, 19 March). But it is vital not to take \u201cextreme scenarios\u201d as fact or as a call to drastically limit urban growth. Cities do not simply continue to grow along the lines predicted by past trends, but are affected by economic, development and ecological pressures. Urban growth can also help manage total population growth. The evidence shows that as people move into cities they have fewer children because of economic and social pressures.\nThe implication that African cities are exploding can have damaging consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people. It can result in governments clearing or cracking down on shanty towns and slums as an excuse to curb population growth. If Africa\u2019s governments see urban growth as an opportunity to provide decent housing and livelihoods for their current populations, rather than panicking about what these may be in the years to come, then an urban future can be created that benefits all and ensures that no one will be left behind as cities grow.

The significant dissenters were One Nation voters, with only 36% supportive.\nA majority of Australians also supported increasing ambition on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, with 58% support, including 47% of Coalition voters in the sample.\n\u201cThe strong majority support for phasing out coal power shows how far the community is ahead of the government on climate change,\u201d said the Australia Institute\u2019s deputy director, Ebony Bennett.\nShe said the Turnbull government\u2019s approach on climate and energy policy meant Australia was at risk of missing out on jobs and investment associated with a global boom in renewable energy, and was out of step with public sentiment.\nThe research follows a declaration on Wednesday at the National Press Club by the resources minister Matt Canavan that he was not interested in contemplating a discussion about a just transition for workers displaced by any phase out of coal consistent with Australia\u2019s international climate obligations.\nCanavan said workers suffered when industries shut down or were phased out so euphemisms like \u201cjust transitions\u201d were best avoided. \u201cI don\u2019t like the term transition, let\u2019s be frank, if you want to shutdown the coal industry, say it \u2013 that\u2019s what will happen.\u201d\nThe resources minister said expanding the coal industry was \u201cnot inconsistent with the obligations we\u2019ve got to reduce carbon emissions\u201d.\nHe said countries were increasing investment in high-efficiency coal plants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the Paris accord. Canavan did not mention that some countries,\u00a0such as Japan, are increasing investment in high-efficiency coal because of a phase-out of nuclear power.\nCanavan also declared in response to a question about balancing his portfolio responsibilities to boost the resources sector with his responsibilities to the Queenslanders who elected him that he had been elected to parliament \u201con a platform that is unashamedly pro-coal\u201d.\nWhile Canavan was elected because he was given a winnable position on the LNP\u2019s Queensland Senate ticket, the resources minister said: \u201cI got elected on the basis I will support the resources sector.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "50% of Coalition voters and 67% of Labor voters want to phase out coal, and majority also support striving to cut greenhouse gas emissions", "date_published": {"$date": 1522256408000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1531187456000}, "authors": ["Katharine Murphy"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Energy", "Coal", "Climate change", "Australia news", "Australian politics", "Fossil fuels", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Coalition", "Queensland", "Energy", "Environment", "Matthew Canavan"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/29/majority-of-australians-support-phasing-out-coal-power-by-2030-survey-finds", "og:description": "50% of Coalition voters and 67% of Labor voters want to phase out coal, and majority also support striving to cut greenhouse gas emissions", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/611b111fec9de241a7e3d056bf351101357209ff/0_339_5168_3103/master/5168.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=9c30487fa45edc906c45381d24071703", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Majority of Australians support phasing out coal power by 2030, survey finds"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "0", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/611b111fec9de241a7e3d056bf351101357209ff/0_339_5168_3103/master/5168.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96843064c5bcacd801fb9c06456c1ca0", "width": "5168", "height": "3103", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/611b111fec9de241a7e3d056bf351101357209ff/0_339_5168_3103/master/5168.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=16bf22b755f5ad57e9ec1f7a483fecfd", "description": "Anti-coal mining protesters join thousands at a march in Sydney on 24 March.\nPhotograph: Rushton/EPA"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556127909377}, "comments": [{"id": "114212117", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1522490621000}, "author": "LocknessMunster", "author_id": "17443130", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nwhen they do finally succumb to reason\nBQEND\nOh Please.

Such a situation is common. You need about a week's electricity storage to make up the difference. \nIf you are expecting 25 GW of wind power, and get 12 GW average over 2 weeks, you need 4.4 TWH of storage to make up the difference. That's about 34,000 batteries the size of the one Tesla recently installed in South Australia. That battery costs somewhere between $50 million and $100 million. That works out at $1.7 - $3.4 trillion.\nYou could try to replace batteries with pumped hydro. That's much cheaper. Snowy 2 would add 350 GWH of storage, so you'd only need about 12.5 of those, at about $5 billion each. That's \"only\" $63 billion. But that assumes there are a dozen places you could build something the size of Snowy 2, and of course there aren't. You'd end up with a lot of smaller sites and the price would be much higher.\nThe cheapest site identified in the UK for a future large pumped hydro scheme is Coire Glas. That would provide 30 GWH for \u00a3800 million. Australia would need 147 of them, costing \u00a3118 billion.\nAnd then you'd face the problem of what happens if wind speeds remain low for 3 or 4 weeks instead of 2, which happens much less often, but still needs to be accounted for.\nThere isn't a single significantly sized country in the world running on a mix of intermittent renewables and storage. Even the places that have tried, like El Hierro in the Canary Islands, still rely on fossil fuel backup. Germany, for all the money it's spent building wind and solar, still relies on coal and lignite for firm power capacity.\nIf you look at the ACOLA report into a high renewables scenario for Australia it still relies on fossil fuel backup providing about 25% of supply over the year. You cannot replace reliable supply with systemically unreliable sources like wind and solar, because the cost of storage to make it work is prohibitive.\nSadly the thrust of the argument amongst renewable supporters, egged on by the anti-nuclear brigade like the Guardian, is to build wind and solar and wait until batteries become cheap enough before we get rid of coal and gas. But batteries aren't going to become cheap enough, and a mixed wind/solar/gas scenario results in emissions being far higher than required.\nIf you look at the countries of Europe, only 3 meet future emissions targets. Norway, which is almost entirely conventional dammed hydro, Sweden, which is a mix of conventional hydro and nuclear, and France, which is mainly nuclear. Germany, despite all the investment in intermittent renewables, has emissions roughly 10 times higher than France.\nThe choice is simple. To meet emissions targets you build a lot of nuclear power. That's the only technology that can currently get emissions low enough.

The first is in line with the tradition of Classical Liberalism, as expressed in the Bill of Rights of 1688 in Britain and the American Bill of Rights. Of course the French experiment had a more collective edge than the two preceding revolutions in the Americas because of the influence of French philosopher Rousseau\nThe other documents is decidedly from a Social liberal tradition far different in it's conception of liberty. The biggest problem with the 2005 Charter is it expands the power of the state and creates many positive freedoms which potentially infringe upon fundamental core negative freedoms. The clauses are far too broad to be effective but also too broad to effectively define the limits of government power. Our current system has sufficient mechanisms of protections for environmental damage through the tort system if another person is damaged e.g. lead in the water would create a tort.

It won't be instantaneous as with say nuclear annihilation. It will be a long slow cook which initially we will counter with things like air conditioning and growing more vegetables that can tolerate heat. Flora and fauna on land and sea are already reeling from climate change, but humans have continued on their merry way as if nothing is happening. The old, very young and those island nations that are threatened with sea level rises will be the first to pay. But as time goes on and the multiplier affect comes into play those who have lived by using up the oxygen of others will start to reap their rewards. Electricity bills will go through the roof. Those who live on the coast will see their property values plummet. Heat stress for humans will become an increasingly prevalent cause of hospital admissions and death. Initially food security in the gluttonous West will be little affected but as time goes on this will change as deserts and salinity spreads and our oceans become more acidic. Our weather patterns are already changing and they will change more and more rapidly. Storm events, flooding, and wild fires will escalate both in number and ferocity. Humanitarian crises will escalate as more and more people are displaced and food security causes civil strife and violence. Cities will start to experience more utility difficulties particularly in the supply of electricity. The cost of fuels will escalate as certain countries combat heat stress by raising the price of non-renewables. As countries like China and India continue to grow their middle classes and their consumer expectations emissions will not be able to be brought down. The predicted increase of 1-2 degrees may well be blown out of the water in which case we can kiss good bye to the poles. That's when the fun really begins.

Many other climate scientists were skeptical of this result, and the journal recently published a critique from a team led by the University of Edinburgh\u2019s Andrew Schurer.\nThe debate lies in exactly how the Paris climate target is defined and measured, which has not been precisely established. Millar\u2019s team used the UK Met Office and Hadley Centre global surface temperature dataset called HadCRUT4, which begins in 1850 and estimates global surface temperatures have warmed about 0.9\u00b0C since that time. The team thus calculated the remaining carbon budget that will lead to an additional 0.6\u00b0C warming.\nBut HadCRUT4 has some significant flaws. First, it only covers 84% of Earth\u2019s surface. There are large gaps in its coverage, mainly in the Arctic, Antarctica, and Africa, where temperature monitoring stations are relatively scarce. And the Arctic is the fastest-warming part of the planet, which means that HadCRUT4 somewhat underestimates global warming.\nA second issue is that over the oceans, HadCRUT4 uses sea surface temperatures, which haven\u2019t warmed quite as fast as air temperatures directly above the ocean surface. There\u2019s also a third issue \u2013 what\u2019s the start date from which we want to stay below 1.5 or 2\u00b0C warming? The starting point in HadCRUT4 is 1850, but another recent study led by Schurer found that starting even earlier would add up to 0.2\u00b0C to the warming we\u2019ve already caused, and thus shrink the remaining carbon budget.\nTaken all together, these three issues could mean that we\u2019ve already warmed 0.2\u20130.3\u00b0C more than estimated in the Millar study, which would mean a significantly smaller carbon budget. Each additional 0.1\u00b0C warming shrinks the remaining 2\u00b0C carbon budget by about 20%, so in that sense even one-tenth of a degree is important in answering this question about our chances of meeting the Paris targets.\nUltimately, climate scientists are asking for a more specific definition of the Paris climate target. The agreement says we want to limit global warming to no more than 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels (preferably closer to 1.5\u00b0C), but when is the post-industrial start date, and which temperature measurement is the target based on?\nHowever, the 2\u00b0C target itself is somewhat arbitrary. It\u2019s based on two factors: science and politics. On the scientific side, we can probably accept and adapt to the adverse climate change consequences at that degree of climate change. On the political side, transitioning away from a fossil fuel-based global economy is a tremendous undertaking. From a practical standpoint, it will take everything we\u2019ve got just to stay below 2\u00b0C. That\u2019s why the 1.5\u00b0C target in the Paris agreement is \u2018aspirational.\u2019 The latest IPCC report considered 116 potential scenarios for staying below 2\u00b0C, and 101 of those scenarios (87%) included negative emissions in the form of carbon capture and storage. In other words, it\u2019s difficult to envision meeting the Paris target by cutting carbon pollution alone.\nThe 2\u00b0C target is simply a nice round number that represents what the international community considers an acceptable amount of climate change risk and is also a practically achievable (although daunting) goal.\nTackling climate change boils down to risk management. Global temperatures are likely already hotter than at any time in the history of human civilization, and warming at a rate 20 to 50 times faster than Earth\u2019s fastest natural climate changes. Climate contrarians like Trump\u2019s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt often ask what\u2019s Earth\u2019s ideal temperature \u2013 the answer is that an ideal climate is a stable one. Rapid climate changes like the one humans are currently causing create problems that are difficult for species to adapt to. We need to shift away from dangerously rapid climate change to a stable climate as soon as possible.\nThe ideal Paris target would thus have simply been \u201ccut carbon pollution as much as possible, as fast as possible.\u201d However, governments need a concrete target on which to base their climate policies. \u201cAs much and as fast as possible\u201d is vague and subjective, while \u201can 80% carbon pollution cut by 2050\u201d is concrete, specific, and translates into policy.\nThe scientific debate over these few tenths of a degree of warming is in some ways important and in other ways unimportant. It\u2019s unimportant because climate scientists are trying to assess our chances of meeting the Paris targets, but the 2\u00b0C itself is somewhat arbitrary. However, the Paris targets are important because they provide a concrete goal that governments and policies can aim for. And each additional tenth of a degree represents a greater risk that we\u2019ll trigger a dangerous climate feedback, like a large release of methane from beneath the permafrost or oceans, or the collapse of a major ice shelf.\nThanks Chris. Policy implications not so big, imho. Whoever is right, in either case we need to hit the brakes on CO2 emissions as fast as we can. If the optimist study is right we might stop warming at 1.5 \u00b0C, if not the best we can hope for is ~2 \u00b0C, and coral reefs are gone.\nThe one point to take away from this debate is that no matter who\u2019s right, we still need to cut carbon pollution as much as possible, as fast as possible. Using the choices in the Millar paper would suggest that we have a better chance of successfully meeting the Paris target, but even if the international community decides they like those choices best, it will still take everything we\u2019ve got to stay below that definition of 2\u00b0C warming. \nIf governments decide that based on the Millar paper they have a larger carbon budget and can thus afford to act less quickly, that would be an incorrect and dangerous interpretation. Climate policies need to keep progressing and improving at full steam ahead.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/global-climate-talks", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Dana Nuccitelli: Ultimately the only thing that matters: we need to cut carbon pollution as much as possible, as fast as possible", "date_published": {"$date": 1522317612000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1522317694000}, "authors": ["Dana Nuccitelli"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Paris climate agreement", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "COP 21: UN climate change conference | Paris", "Global climate talks", "Climate change", "Science"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/28/climate-scientists-debate-a-flaw-in-the-paris-climate-agreement", "og:description": "Dana Nuccitelli: Ultimately the only thing that matters: we need to cut carbon pollution as much as possible, as fast as possible", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06a601ed1c7b68dcd7b77e28f0075d05eae973da/0_345_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=63c668a7b21aa0f526b4980f67f35636", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Climate scientists debate a flaw in the Paris climate agreement | Dana Nuccitelli"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06a601ed1c7b68dcd7b77e28f0075d05eae973da/0_345_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dd1e7de25867bb0b9399a7d89da72250", "width": "5184", "height": "3110", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06a601ed1c7b68dcd7b77e28f0075d05eae973da/0_345_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42c268000445cd7db5c92ee94e2fc192", "description": "The slogan \u201c1.5 DEGREES\u201d is projected on the Eiffel Tower as part of the COP21, United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France, Friday, Dec. 11, 2015.\nPhotograph: Francois Mori/AP"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556127950094}, "comments": [{"id": "114384119", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1522927960000}, "author": "Bernie Thomas", "author_id": "17746707", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Excellent.

All electricity as supplied is the same no matter how it is generated.\nSolar produces power on most days and its maximum supply corresponds to the maximum peaks in demand that occur due to domestic air-conditioner use during heatwaves. Wind turbines operate during wind chill peaks in demand. Southern Australia is a windy place because it is close to the Southern Ocean. Coal fired power stations have run into trouble in drought times due to lack of water, have closed when their coal mine caught fire and as the current fleet in NSW and Victoria approach retirement age increasing experience operational problems. Hydroelectric power also experiences problems during droughts. So no form of electricity generation is reliable all the time which is why a variety of means of generation must be used.\nYou are confusing cost and price. All wholesale electricity prices are opportunistic in response to demand but wind farms in southern Australia where the wind often blows is the cheapest way to generate electricity. As I said batteries are used for their very quick response to stabilise the grid until gas turbines can be quickly brought into play. Their cost for this function is not great.\nPower generation is 22% of the retail cost of electricity while its distribution accounts for 54% of that cost. Batteries are not used to make wind, solar, coal fired, hydro or gas turbine generation 100% reliable. As described above they are used to make the grid stable in the very short term.\nAS 54% of the retail cost of electricity is the cost of its distribution or delivery, rooftop solar panels circumvent that cost for their owners and almost circumvent that cost when supplying other properties nearby. In so doing they reduce the maximum demand on the distribution network which as it must be built to handle maximum demand is a major contributor to that 54%.

The email acknowledges that communities face \u201cchallenges\u201d in dealing with the consequences of climate change.\nHowever, the email, obtained by HuffPost, also sets out ambiguous talking points favoured by Pruitt, such as: \u201cHuman activity impacts our changing climate in some manner. The ability to measure with precision the degree and extent of that impact, and what to do about it, are subject to continuing debate and dialogue.\u201d\nThe email adds that \u201cwhile there has been extensive research and a host of published reports on climate change, clear gaps remain including our understanding of the role of human activity and what we can do about it\u201d.\nJoel Scheraga, senior climate adaptation adviser to the agency administrator, Scott Pruitt, was one person to forward the email, which states Pruitt encourages an \u201copen, transparent debate on climate science\u201d.\nAn EPA spokeswoman said the points were \u201cdeveloped by the office of public affairs. The agency\u2019s work on climate adaptation continues under the leadership of Dr Scheraga.\u201d\nSince becoming EPA head under Donald Trump, Pruitt has erroneously denied that carbon dioxide is a \u201cprimary contributor\u201d to warming that has seen the Earth\u2019s average temperature increase by about 1C (1.8F) over the past century. Pruitt has also said industrialization has warmed the planet \u201cto a certain degree\u201d but that \u201chumans have most flourished during times of warming trends\u201d.\nDuring his tenure, the EPA has removed information on its website about climate change, scrapped a climate adaptation program and advocated the need for \u201cregulatory certainty\u201d by loosening emissions regulations for vehicles and the fossil fuels industry. A televised \u201cred team, blue team\u201d debate between climate scientists and those who reject the science has also been mulled. \nPruitt was a vocal supporter of Trump\u2019s decision to remove the US from the Paris climate agreement and is busy dismantling the Obama administration\u2019s clean power plan, which Pruitt fought in court when attorney general of Oklahoma.\nScientists have pointed out that while the exact ramifications of climate change are yet to play out, the science behind it is well established and points directly to human culpability. A major report released by government scientists last year reiterated that humans are the \u201cdominant\u201d driver of global warming, with it being \u201chighly likely\u201d that the release of greenhouse gas emissions has caused more than half of all warming since 1951.\nThe email forwarded by Scheraga is \u201cliterally true but carefully crafted to mislead\u201d, according to Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M University.\n\u201cThere is uncertainty in climate science, but the uncertainty spans the range of climate change being somewhat serious to extremely serious,\u201d he said. \nDessler said any gaps on scientists\u2019 understanding are not big enough to declare climate change a \u201cnon-problem\u201d. He added: \u201cAnd what we can do about it is quite clear: to stabilize the climate, we need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to near zero.\u201d\nKerry Emanuel, a meteorologist and climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: \u201cIf confronting serious risks depended on first converting risks to certainties, no one would get flu shots, there would be no attempt to reduce stockpiles of nuclear weapons and businesses would fail at a high rate, having made no efforts to mitigate their risks.\n\u201cMr Pruitt is engaged in a disingenuous effort to stall measures to mitigate climate risk under the false pretext of concern about uncertainty.\u201d\nThe leak comes as it was revealed that Pruitt, already under fire over his use of first class air travel, lived last year in a Washington DC house co-owned by the wife of a leading energy lobbyist.\nProperty records obtained by ABC News show that Pruitt lived in a townhouse partly owned by Vicki Hart, the wife of Steven Hart, chief executive of lobbying firm Williams and Jensen. Hart\u2019s clients include the NRA and gas company Cheniere Energy. \n\u201cPruitt\u2019s corruption knows no bounds and he should be fired immediately,\u201d said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, one of a coalition of environment groups who have demanded Pruitt be removed from his position.

The Nationals senator and federal minister for resources worked at the Productivity Commission before he entered politics, first as a staffer for his colleague and friend Barnaby Joyce, before being elected to the Senate himself.\nThe economic pointy head backstory makes Canavan an unconventional National, a fact that doesn\u2019t go unnoticed among his party room colleagues. It also makes some of his public commentary this week just that bit harder to get your head around.\nIn a busy week, where the government prosecuted but lost an attempt to steer its big business tax cut through the Senate, where Tony Abbott was so desperate for a \u201clook at me\u201d moment he launched Pauline Hanson\u2019s new book, where the nation roiled inconsolably about the behaviour of our cricketers \u2013 Canavan fronted the National Press Club to try and generate a couple of headlines of his own.\nCanavan, like every other resources minister I\u2019ve seen before him, is an unabashed champion of the mining sector. Boosterism comes with the territory, and the current occupant of the portfolio doesn\u2019t disappoint.\nGiven every major business sector in the country is pursuing a \u201cplease like me\u201d soft advertising campaign of some type \u2013 the Business Council of Australia launched one this week, BHP urges us on high rotation to Think Big, the banks have ads specifically to tell customers they aren\u2019t that awful \u2013 it was unsurprising to hear Canavan flagging (among other things) efforts to \u201cbolster the community support for the resources sector\u201d including through an \u201congoing campaign\u201d to inform people of its benefits.\nAll just as you\u2019d expect, right down to Stop Adani protesters bursting into the room to puncture his remarks. Where things took an unexpected turn was in the questions, when Canavan raised a balled fist of protest against the future.\nAsked whether as federal resources minister (as well as a democratically elected parliamentarian in a representative democracy) he felt an obligation to help Australian communities face up to the inevitability of a carbon-constrained future \u2013 Canavan suggested the world needed to stay as it is.\nIt was \u201cobjectionable\u201d he said, to talk about people losing their livelihoods. He said concepts like \u201cjust transitions\u201d were a con. \u201cI don\u2019t like the term transition, let\u2019s be frank. If you want to shut down the coal industry and cost people jobs, say it. Have the guts to say it.\u201d\nCanavan advised the questioner (which, full disclosure, happened to be me) to take a trip to northern Tasmania to see what a transition really looked like. \u201cReal poverty,\u201d he noted. \u201cHouse prices halve, people get locked in to an environment they can\u2019t get out of and their lives are destroyed.\n\u201cUtter heartbreak.\u201d\nYou might need to remind yourself at this point of the recount that this is a former Productivity Commission economist talking. If Productivity Commission economists are a foreign species to you, think about people mildly obsessed with transformation, structural adjustment, economic efficiency \u2013 that sort of thing.\nThey are the folks who have been saying for decades in the politest possible way: suck it up soldier, your economy needs you to understand that things change, and the way to get through these adjustments is to pursue evidence-based policy.\nCouple of things.\nCanavan\u2019s empathy for the coal and power workers \u2013 while doubtless sincere at a personal level \u2013 is a bit hard to square with his service for a government that shuttered the Australian car industry with barely a backward glance.\nI really don\u2019t remember much outward concern for falling house prices, or destroyed lives or \u201cutter heartbreak\u201d in Adelaide. Perhaps some displaced workers are more equal than others.\nThen there\u2019s the inconvenient fact that it is his own government\u2019s policy driving the transformation he says shouldn\u2019t happen.\nCanavan was part of a government that signed the Paris climate agreement \u2013 a set of commitments that make decarbonisation not optional, or hypothetical, but inevitable. Nobody held a gun to the government\u2019s head and made it sign an international agreement to reduce emissions. Abbott might have grumbled at the time, and he engages in active revisionism now, but the fact is he signed Australia up, voluntarily.\nIf Canavan thinks there should be no adjustment for coal communities, then he\u2019s actually arguing that Australia should quit the Paris agreement \u2013 except of course he doesn\u2019t argue that, because that would be problematic for Liberals trying to hold urban seats.\nThe resources minister attempts to tip-toe through the obvious contradictions by arguing that high-efficiency coal will help reduce reduce emissions and help Australia meet its Paris target. In this happy story, we can reduce our emissions and boost the coal industry too.\nBut is this happy story true?\nWhile it is self-evidently correct that \u201cclean\u201d coal plants are better in terms of emissions than ageing dirty ones, the minister omits several relevant points. \u201cClean coal will help us meet Paris\u201d ignores the fact the technology is incredibly expensive; that taxpayers would bear significant risks because clean coal plants are not financeable in Australia unless the government agrees to indemnify projects against the future risk of a carbon price being introduced, and against the cost of delays prompted by likely community protest action. And the electricity grid in Australia is moving inexorably in the opposite direction \u2013 towards decentralisation.\nThere\u2019s one more point that we can make about who should bear the transition. If Canavan thinks coal communities shouldn\u2019t be made to adjust, but it\u2019s OK for Australia to remain in the Paris deal, then he should be arguing in public and around the cabinet table for other sectors of the economy to do their fair share of heavy lifting.\nThe government is trying to pass off the as-yet-unfinished national energy guarantee as a settled climate and energy policy, which it most decidedly isn\u2019t. Assuming they can land it, this is not mission accomplished. The national energy guarantee is a policy for only one sector of the economy \u2013 electricity \u2013 and a sector of the economy where emissions are already falling.\nThus far, the government has produced no plans for other sectors of the economy \u2013 say transport, or agriculture, where emissions are currently rising \u2013 presumably because the Coalition can\u2019t ever have a rational conversation about emissions reduction without someone having a brain explosion.\nSo what are the facts?\nIf Australia remains in the Paris agreement, and we honour the undertakings we have made (and the government keeps saying we will do both those things), then a transition is coming.\nThe transition can\u2019t be avoided. It is already under way.\nUltimately, the question I asked Canavan wasn\u2019t about whether he was intrinsically opposed to the future, but about who takes responsibility for it.\nThis government, and future Australian governments, will determine whether the transition associated with decarbonisation is fair and orderly and structured, or whether it is chaotic and ugly and deeply unfair to the regional communities the resources minister says he cares about. \nEmpathy is fine from politicians, welcome in fact, but truth is better, because these communities aren\u2019t stupid, and they won\u2019t be bought off by facile storytelling that suggests coal magic means everyone wins, and no one has to pick up the tab.\nThey want to know that someone in elected office is thinking about a new pipeline of blue-collar jobs.\nThese communities need a plan, and they need political representation with the foresight to give them one, and to do that, our elected representatives have to be very clear about why they are in public life, and who it is they actually represent.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-national-party", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Empathy is fine from politicians, but truth is better because these communities aren\u2019t stupid", "date_published": {"$date": 1522436407000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1531187456000}, "authors": ["Katharine Murphy"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Australia news", "Australian politics", "Liberal National party", "Coalition", "Climate change", "Coal", "Fossil fuels", "Environment", "Energy", "Matthew Canavan"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/31/sorry-matt-canavan-no-one-believes-coal-magic-means-everyone-wins", "og:description": "Empathy is fine from politicians, but truth is better because these communities aren\u2019t stupid", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9df672121c9557e2c0558902d796e2a0e4cfaaf6/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=c6f788cae60201c8417ad8f29ed6069c", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Sorry, Matt Canavan, no one believes coal magic means everyone wins | Katharine Murphy"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9df672121c9557e2c0558902d796e2a0e4cfaaf6/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a9af20b2ebcdbcfa9f7bf58f412e8f4a", "width": "5568", "height": "3341", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9df672121c9557e2c0558902d796e2a0e4cfaaf6/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c708d564b3a27f74420b4fde8ec183a5", "description": "Matt Canavan at the National Press Club on Wednesday.\nPhotograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556127970443}, "comments": [{"id": "114281541", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1522683214000}, "author": "Wolframite", "author_id": "16262897", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "The technology has been available for some time.

Their contact with real people, outside election periods, is minimal. Their public face is largely mediated via the mendacious propaganda of the TV networks, or photo opportunities that don\u2019t address issues of inequality and environment of which matters to voters the most. They declined to step down and talk to the people whose worlds they have destroyed. They tend towards paranoia, treating any serious national discussion as disloyalty, and now grow increasingly dependent on spin doctors and fake news to propagandise their policies.\nAll these have been exacerbated by the now ubiquitous \u2018Commercial in Confidence\u2019 principal that has crept into public life from the Howard years until now, denies the community this right, and for no legitimate reason. \nThe \u2018Commercial in Confidence\u2019 doctrine formalises a shift in the relationship between three of the community\u2019s stakeholders; the government, the community and the corporate sector. The government and the corporate sector are doing deals with each other from which the community - which is paying the bills - is excluded. The community is being sidelined, even treated with contempt.\n\u2018Commercial in Confidence\u2019 rests on the extraordinary premises that private companies have a greater right to know what is happening with the public\u2019s money than the public itself. There is totally no reason why prices of commercial services provided to the public under a government contract should be concealed, any more than the price of bread at the local supermarket should be concealed. What the government is saying when it cites \u2018Commercial in Confidence\u2019 is that it owes a sacred duty to protect the interests of business ahead of its obligations to the constituents it is being paid good money to represent.\n\u2018Commercial in Confidence\u2019 culture not only interposes a veil of secrecy between the government and its constituents, it also hides the activity of one part of government from another part of government. Once information is put on the restricted list, it becomes less accessible to anyone and everyone, whether the public at large, civil servants in the bureaucracy or even ministers themselves. A culture of secrecy is installed that throws up barriers everywhere. Bureaucrats can maintain their ministers in the dark the same way that Sir Appleby kept Minister Hacker in the dark in the TV series, \u2018Yes Minister\u2019.\nIncreasing use of the \u2018Commercial in Confidence\u2019 principles, raises the inevitable question, if the government has nothing to hide, why go to the trouble of trying to hide it?

This is something we really need to implement as soon as possible, preferably on a consistent international basis.

He admits that changes the parameters somewhat, although he also says it is \"not a panacea\". I assume by that he means storage is not free and cannot be pulled out of a hat, which is obviously true. Still, it does exist and it is usable. I don't think anyone these days is seriously suggesting renewables without storage.\nThere's no reason why some storage could not be owned by the companies who are generating power via renewables. In fact that is looking like it will become common, which would mean that the duck curve should be less problematic for company revenues. I'd also expect widespread use of domestic solar plus battery storage, given how it's taking off already, and given that prices for both panels and batteries are still decreasing.\nThe Jenkins tweet you linked to, and its mention of his upcoming study, says \"Least cost final zero carbon mixes in my forthcoming study rarely close to 80% wind/solar\". That's interesting, in that he is saying that in some cases 80% wind+solar is the least cost option. He's not saying what those cases are, but apparently they do exist, so as you say is should be a good read.\nWhat is economically viable in the real word depends to some extent on what result we want. It's common to put in place requirements that increase cost if the benefits are seen to be worthwhile. A price on carbon is an obvious example. It makes sense for any decarbonisation policy, but in terms of present day business it is just another cost. It's justified on the basis of its long term benefits to others.\nThis is going to become a big factor later this century. All the IPCC pathways to <2 degrees C require large (bloody huge) negative emissions in the latter part of the century. That is going to require rolling out some large scale CCS technology, and that is going to cost a lot of money, and pretty obviously it will be funded/incentivised by a high carbon price.. Apparently it has to happen anyway, so in that sense that cost is not relevant. If there's no alternative, you just pay up.\n I also have to say that the privatisation of power generation in this country really does not seem to have been an outstanding success. The Queensland government had to intervene to stop its own subsidiary rorting the spot power market and driving prices sky high, and similar rorting was the reason the SA government wanted control of some of the output from the Hornsdale/Tesla battery. This rorting was perfectly legal under power market rules, and provided better returns for shareholders, but curtailing it was in the public interest even if it wasn't \"business-friendly\". Power is an essential service, and there are good arguments for not privatising essential services.\nAnyway, Jenkins' article says there is no real problem with up to 50% grid-scale wind+solar, even without storage. So, Labor's policy of 50% renewables by 2030 seems perfectly sound as a starting point, particularly when storage is added to the mix. On top of that we have an extra 7% from hydroelectricity (although there are some doubts as to its long term reliability under difficult rainfall patterns). I expect there will also be minor generation from geothermal and biogas (there is some already) so that should bring us close to 60% renewables.\nGiven that nuclear is not currently feasible in this country, for a variety of reasons, I think Labor's current policy is looking like an excellent place to start. If we need to re-assess things as 2030 gets closer then we (and Jenkins) can do that with the benefit of the better information that will be available by then.", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "114241204", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "114234574", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1522568969000}, "author": "RossHosking", "author_id": "12104671", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "The pope is a catholic.

I\u2019m worried about the pollution in the water, the pollution in the ground, and the pollution in the air from the busy arterial roads and airports. It\u2019s affecting me and it will affect the crops on my allotment. I have a bike, but in order to go out on a bike now I have to wear a mask which, with my asthma, makes it difficult. When I was arrested last week for spraying \u201cair pollution is criminal\u201d on City Hall, the mayor of London\u2019s office, I was singing \u201cmaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a Londoner\u201d \u2013 I don\u2019t believe Londoners should have to suffer these conditions any longer.\nI am taking visible action, and risking time in prison, to pressure our politicians into acting now\nPeople need to be made aware of the issues of air pollution and climate change and start communicating with each other about them. I\u2019m taking this visible action because I want to give people something to talk about; we are calling on the mayor to sit down with community groups and discuss solutions to air pollution. There are already thousands of people in this country and across the world standing up to say now is the time to act on the climate. I am standing up with them, and risking time in prison, to pressure our politicians into acting now.\nAlong with other clean air defenders, we sprayed \u201cair pollution is criminal\u201d on the walls of City Hall five times last week and were arrested every time. At the police station, the police officers were respectful to us in spite of clearly being overworked and understaffed. In some cases there was even genuine understanding of our action for clean air, even if they did not approve of the methods.\nTaking action in the way we did, a kind of \u201cart drama\u201d politics, is a rollercoaster of emotions. Part of me says why bother, why not just enjoy the rest of my life, but my awareness of the danger and future damage won\u2019t let me. I have not given up on provoking people to act on what is happening, to work to cut air pollution and avert climate breakdown. For instance, so far a dozen London community groups have started working in coalition to put increasing pressure on Sadiq Khan to take urgent action. The London Coalition for Clean Air is holding an open introductory meeting on 17 April and I hope that more people and groups will get involved with it. If that happens, then our actions last week will have been worth it.\nThe mayor should be providing ways for people to get involved and excited about fixing our air pollution crisis \u2013 something that is so crucial to the health of all citizens. Money needs to be used to spur people to be creative around technology and to change our cities so we have room for all people to move through them without these deadly health risks. Room for disabled people, room for cyclists, space for people who go slow or fast. I want to see lots of trees, and every house using alternative energy, with plants growing everywhere. Open the parks, don\u2019t close them.\nWe must get rid of pollution. We need to keep the fossil fuels in the ground. We need an urgent transition; we should all be demanding it and encouraging others to do so too, whether that is through acts of protest, writing to our politicians or talking to our neighbours.

We want to repower NSW, we want a renewable energy-powered NSW.\u201d\nThe state government approved 10 industrial solar farms in 2017 \u2013 twice as many as the previous year, and has committed to an ambitious zero emissions target by 2050 as part of its climate change policy framework.\nHowever, legislation has threatened to weaken environmental protections, and several proposed or operating mining ventures have been the targets of long-running community opposition, as well as several applications for extensions.\n#time2choose hooray for the farmers pic.twitter.com/hdCkeS10G8\nOrganisers pointed to the proposed CSG mining in Narribri, open cut coal mining in the Bylong valley, the Southern Highlands Hume Coal project, and Shenhua Mining\u2019s attempts in the Liverpool plains as among the threats to the state\u2019s environment and communities.\n\u201cThere is no safe place for coal seam gas in NSW. It threatens communities, precious groundwater aquifers and farmland, and the climate, wherever it goes,\u201d said Naomi Hodgson of the Wilderness Alliance.\nGlenn Morris, who made headlines in 2016 after riding his horse Hombre across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to raise awareness about climate change, was one of the 25 farmers on horseback.\n\u201cThere is devastation because of climate change all across NSW,\u201d the Inverell farmer said. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to destroy any more healthy land.\u201d\nBob Clarke came from Wollar, a small village near Mudgee, where he said the open-cut Wilpinjong mine was destroying the region. \nThe Peabody mining company was granted an extension last year, but it has been challenged in the land and environment court.\nClarke, who has lived in Wollar for 30 years, said Peabody had recently started buying nearby land, and the exodus of people had \u201cbroken the community\u201d.\n\u201cThere\u2019s only four of us left there now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going nowhere, we\u2019re still hanging in there.\u201d\nBill Ryan, in his 90s, said he wanted governments to realise citizens wanted renewable energy now.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to take into consideration that this is what the people want. So we\u2019ve got to get out and let them know they can\u2019t get away with backing the mining sector all the time. They have to listen to the citizens.\u201d\nThe Greens MLA David Shoebridge praised the size and breadth of the turnout at the rally.\n\u201cWe have First Nations peoples, farming communities, inner city environmental and activist groups, all coming together under the same banner.\u201d\nShoebridge said people wanted to put the environment and climate change on the agenda.\n\u201cThe community is concerned. They\u2019re talking about renewable energy and a fresh way forward that doesn\u2019t involve coal. It\u2019s a concern the parliament is almost entirely deaf to.\u201d\nHe said there needed to be a \u201cjust transition plan\u201d into renewables to support people and communities that relied on industries that had closed.\n\u201cWe know for a fact that jobs in the coal industry are drying up. Conditions for those workers are getting more and more severe.

In 2009, the EPA completed its review of the climate science literature and correctly concluded in its Endangerment Finding that carbon pollution poses such a threat via climate change. That document is the foundation for all government climate policies, including the Obama Administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan. Climate deniers have thus long had their sights set on revoking the Endangerment Finding.\nThat\u2019s a tall order, since the scientific literature is crystal clear on this question. House Republicans first tried to simply rewrite the Clean Air Act to state the greenhouse gases aren\u2019t pollutants, but they failed to get nearly enough support to pass that legislation. Next they proposed setting up a \u2018Red Team\u2019 of climate deniers to debate the mainstream climate science \u2018Blue Team.\u2019 But Trump\u2019s chief of staff John Kelly worried that having this prominent debate on the record would be a distraction and potentially expose the administration to litigation, so he killed the idea. \nHowever, E&amp;E News reports that Pruitt has a safer Plan B: take public comments on petitions asking EPA to revisit the Endangerment Finding. This would appease the deniers by allowing them to officially make their case, but the EPA wouldn\u2019t be under any obligation to take action. It\u2019s a fight Pruitt knows he would lose in court, because the science is not on the deniers\u2019 side, so he would prefer to simply weaken the Clean Power Plan, eliminate as many other federal climate policies as possible, and delay all US climate action until the clock runs out on the Trump administration.\nThere have been two petitions filed against the Endangerment Finding. The first was submitted by a group of climate contrarians who failed to understand basic climate science. I discussed the fundamental mistakes in their arguments last year.\nThe second petition was submitted by two fossil fuel-funded think tanks: the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Science and Environmental Policy Project. It tried to refute the Endangerment Finding\u2019s three lines of evidence supporting human-caused global warming: \n1) Scientists\u2019 basic physical understanding of factors that impact the climate system like the increasing greenhouse effect and natural influences.\n2) Scientific evidence that global warming over the last several decades is \u2018unusual.\u2019\n3) The use of climate models to simulate the patterns resulting from natural and human-caused climate change.\nTo refute the first point, the petition claimed that there\u2019s been \u201cthe absence of any strong warming trend.\u201d To support this argument, the deniers considered only atmospheric temperature estimates from satellite data, which have much larger uncertainty than data collected by thousands of thermometers at Earth\u2019s surface. Even the satellite data best estimates is that the lower atmosphere has warmed 0.15\u20130.3\u00b0C over the past 20 years, depending on which data set we use.\nBut atmospheric temperatures are just a small part of the global warming story. Surface temperatures have warmed about 0.35\u00b0C during that time. 2014, 2015, and 2016 each broke the record, and 2017 was the hottest year on record at Earth\u2019s surface without an El Ni\u00f1o event. Moreover, the oceans have continued to break heat records and natural thermometers like melting ice and earlier seasons have also continued to show signs of rapid global warming.\nAnd the petition didn\u2019t even dispute the Endangerment Finding\u2019s point that climate scientists understand the factors like the greenhouse effect that impact global temperatures. So their effort to refute this point failed on every possible level. Instead of successfully refuting the Endangerment Finding\u2019s basis, they basically just denied the very existence of global warming once again.\nTo refute the Endangerment Finding\u2019s second point that recent global warming is unusual, the petition argued that global temperatures have been both hotter and colder in the past, so we\u2019re \u201cwithin the bounds of natural variability.\u201d This fails to address the point that global temperatures are now warming 20 to 50 times faster than during Earth\u2019s fastest natural climate changes. The petition then again went off-topic, arguing that recent warming is due to solar activity (which has had a cooling effect over the past 60 years) and natural cycles (which don\u2019t cause long-term temperature trends).\nAnd to refute the Endangerment Finding\u2019s third point, the petition argued that climate models are inaccurate. To make this argument, the deniers relied on an error-riddled chart produced by John Christy, which was refuted by a peer-reviewed study last year (which the petition neglects to mention). And again, the chart only considered atmospheric temperature estimates from satellite data; the petition ignored the remarkable accuracy of climate models in simulating global surface temperatures and other climate change patterns.\nThe evidence supporting human-caused global warming is overwhelming, which is why there\u2019s a 97% expert consensus on the subject. To argue the contrary, or at least that global warming is overblown, deniers are forced to resort to cherry picking data. And even their cherry-picked data confirms global warming.\nDeniers have already lost this debate in the peer-reviewed literature. John Kelly is right to fear the distraction and potential liability of associating the Trump administration with these terrible arguments. Kelly is a military man, and the military doesn\u2019t have the luxury of denying the threats posed by climate change. \nBut if they can appease the deniers by allowing them to make these bogus arguments in comments that the EPA can largely ignore, Pruitt and Kelly will view it as a win-win outcome. As long as the Endangerment Finding stands so that the next administration can use it to implement climate policies, it\u2019s a win for all of us.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change-scepticism", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/epa", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Dana Nuccitelli: Let fossil fuel-funded think tanks make their case, then ignore it", "date_published": {"$date": 1521453630000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1521720988000}, "authors": ["Dana Nuccitelli"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Climate change scepticism", "US Environmental Protection Agency", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "Climate change", "Science", "Donald Trump"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/19/john-kelly-shut-down-pruitts-climate-denial-red-team-but-they-have-a-plan-b", "og:description": "Dana Nuccitelli: Let fossil fuel-funded think tanks make their case, then ignore it", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f88185b5901540be0fc001c086f167b0da577b0a/0_18_3100_1860/master/3100.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=b9245954ced2b4eaa17416d718f02ba8", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "John Kelly shut down Pruitt\u2019s climate denial \u2018red team,\u2019 but they have a Plan B | Dana Nuccitelli"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f88185b5901540be0fc001c086f167b0da577b0a/0_18_3100_1860/master/3100.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b2ecf728d4c863dd68fa7b472cb255e4", "width": "3100", "height": "1860", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f88185b5901540be0fc001c086f167b0da577b0a/0_18_3100_1860/master/3100.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=be75a635e47236af49f4f901bedcb37c", "description": "John Kelly, White House chief of staff, listens as U.S. President Donald Trump, left, speaks during a briefing with senior military leaders in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, D.C. on October 5, 2017.\nPhotograph: UPI / Barcroft Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9df253fa6f0f5ae6b6ab30f52e9995bf5cd9a7b7/0_0_720_405/master/720.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7229edc300b3bdb876d3ae538869713a", "width": "720", "height": "405", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9df253fa6f0f5ae6b6ab30f52e9995bf5cd9a7b7/0_0_720_405/master/720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8364c2e40d3e5cdc6ffe0f90a992db52", "description": "John Christy\u2019s chart, annotated to detail its problems.

At the time Queensland was under an undemocratic extreme right wing regime and US creationists were providing hundreds of thousands of dollars per annum finance to local creationists to set up a base here. I went with my supervisor and Ian Lowe to a number of creationist talks to provide some scientific balance. Ian later became President of the Australian Conservation Foundation and an early communicator of the reality uncovered by climate science. \nIn 1988 David Fosold returned to Mt Tendurek accompanied by Australian geologist and concluded that the boat shaped structure was a natural geological phenomenon. Ian Pilmer had became a campaigner against creationists some time after me.\nIn the late noughties Ian Pilmer criticised the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for being unscientific and was quoted by then Opposition Leader Tony Abbott to that effect. In 2010 he toured with Christopher Monkton as a support act in Australia.\nIn late 2010 I attended the Woodford Folk Festival with My daughter and her not yet one year old son where as Minister for Climate Change she was delivering a talk with Ian Lowe on climate change and global warming. While my duties were mainly toddler focused, I met Ian and reminded him of our encounters with creationists and he of course mentioned the similaries both in personnel, organisations and techniques of both groups. While Ian Pilmer may seem to be an exception to this pattern, he was a late adopter and a hard rock person.", "recommendation_count": "2", "in_reply_to": "113865577", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "113872461", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1521718741000}, "author": "JulesBywaterLees", "author_id": "4738374", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "enough with the flame wars everyone- it is getting boring.", "recommendation_count": "4", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "113872025", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1521718147000}, "author": "AvMichelCroz", "author_id": "13022945", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\u201cTalking of unsupported assertions, when you call everyone here who disagrees with you \"astroturfers\", that's a very specific allegation.

And this is important- he only focuses on one data point- i.e. hot days.Global warming is the entire globe- so an area with less heatwave days tells you little, and AGW was not only predicted to push up averages but for the Arctic to have more warming, as well warmers winters [globally] and warmer nights.Next- Al Gore and James Hansen get it wrong.Al Gore is not a climate scientist so his opinion is irrelevant.James Hansen did science in studies- not in newspaper articles-But one prediction made to a journalist about the Westside Highway being under water sometime in the coming years [2008 is the supposed quoted time the prediction was for]came true in 2012.Next - NOAA is altering data - true, but they make no secret of it, and they explain why and there is no serious scientific concern, no outrage, not even an attempt by anyone to challenge it .We then have a conspiracy theory of how climate scientists have turned cooling into warming.The next piece of 'evidence' is 1970s temperature records that show the cooling of global dimming that occurred after the 1940s- associate with global economic growth and sulphur pollution.Climate scientists found cooling in the N.Hemisphere - Goddard accepts this and.... what does this mean?

Our results can be summarized as follows: \n Over the past 35 years, the troposphere has warmed significantly. The global average temperature has risen at an average rate of about 0.18 degrees Kelvin per decade (0.32 degrees F per decade). Climate models cannot explain this warming if human-caused increases in greenhouse gases are not included as input to the model simulation. The spatial pattern of warming is consistent with human-induced warming. See Santer et al 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012 for more about the detection and attribution of human induced changes in atmospheric temperature using MSU/AMSU data.\n \nBut....\n The troposphere has not warmed quite as fast as most climate models predict. Note that this problem has been reduced by the large 2015-2106 El Nino Event, and the updated version of the RSS tropospheric datasets.\nBQEND\nBQSTART\nOne possible explanation is an error in the fundamental physics used by the climate models. In addition to this possibility, there are at least three other plausible explanations for the warming rate differences. There are errors in the forcings used as input to the model simulations (these include forcings due to anthropogenic gases and aerosols, volcanic aerosols, solar input, and changes in ozone), errors in the satellite observations (partially addressed by the use of the uncertainty ensemble), and sequences of internal climate variability in the simulations that are difference from what occurred in the real world.

They are not mutually exclusive. In fact, t here is hard scientific evidence that all four of these factors contribute to the discrepancy, and that most of it can be explained without resorting to model physics errors.

Researchers have identified particular sets of bands that correspond to the temperature of the lower troposphere (TLT) spanning roughly 0 to 10 km, the middle troposphere (TMT) spanning around 0 to 20 km and the lower stratosphere (TLS) spanning 10 to 30 km. \n Unfortunately, these bands tend to overlap a bit. For example, TMT estimates will include part of the lower stratosphere, while TLT estimates will include some surface temperature. These overlaps matter because different parts of the atmosphere are expected to react very differently to climate change.\n Because the tropospheric temperature estimates from satellites overlap with part of the stratosphere, they end up combining a bit of stratospheric cooling with tropospheric warming and can underestimate the true rate of warming. To avoid this issue, the new study applies a correction to remove some of the stratospheric cooling from the TMT series. The approach they use for this is described in a previous paper published in the Journal of Climate.\n\nBQENDEach of these sweeps is picking up an enormous lump of atmosphere with many things happening in it. The tropopause (where the tropsophere changes to the stratosphere can vary in altitude from about 17 to about 9km, that means that these layers will including differing parts of the atmosphere at differing latitudes.\nI think it is useful trying to get a mental picture of the tropopause changing over the distance from the equator to the Arctic\\Antarctic circles then think of the difficulties in inferring temperature trends from this giant chunk of sky across the whole planet.\nIts a tough bit of science but useful in backing up the surface record.\nBQENDThis covers Santer 2017\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2973\n\nCauses of differences in model and satellite tropospheric warming rates\n\nBQSTART\n \nBQSTART\nSo what are the corrections made by the RSS team? As I mentioned earlier, the orbits of the satellites change over time which means that locations where measurements are made at a given time of the day change (it drifts). To account for these changes, RSS used a combination of satellite comparisons, climate models, and something called climate reanalysis to estimate changes in the temperature with time. They included measurements from other instruments as a check, such as weather balloons. RSS also identified bad data \u2013 when multiple measurements were made and one of the measurements disagreed substantially with the others, it was suspect. They also caught a calibration error that lead to changes in warming rate. \nBQEND\n0nly 15 instruments over 38 years. the instrument itself has calibration issues in that once it flies it has a hard time ensuring they get the degredation of the instrument right.\nBut this correction was dropping the satellites that had the most orbital drift.\nI think they dropped NOAA18 completely, NOAA 15 after 2011 and AQUA after 2009.\nI think (from Z Hausfather) the satellite data now shows warming 5% faster than the surface records from 1979.\nA cat among the pigeons to be sure.\nBQEND\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/jul/03/bad-news-for-climate-contrarians-the-best-data-we-have-just-got-hotter#comment-101434424\nAnd this covers the RSS updated dataset from Journal of ClimateMears Wentz 2017A Satellite-Derived Lower-Tropospheric Atmospheric Temperature Dataset Using an Optimized Adjustment for Diurnal Effects https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0768.1", "recommendation_count": "7", "in_reply_to": "113813899", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "different parts of the atmosphere are expected to react very differently to climate change", "effect": "these overlaps matter"}, {"cause": "that", "effect": "changes in warming rate"}]}, {"id": "113831670", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1521632488000}, "author": "dave6723", "author_id": "18522661", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nTo disbelieve climate change, you have to believe that the reported temperature data is valid and has not been tampered with to support a narrative.

Over time governments have recognized the pre-existing institution of marriage. These governments have applied civil benefits and accorded civil advantages to the institution of marriage. But marriage has a specific definition that harks back to religious ceremony. It's a holy matrimony. if your question is do I object to granting any of the legal or civil benefits to gays who wish to join in union, then of course not. Any civil right granted to a man or woman as a result of marriage should extend to any other couple. But its not holy matrimony and it's a mockery to pretend it is.

Change the political balance and there would have been a different result.\n\"The Court held that if the EPA wishes to continue its inaction on carbon regulation, it is required by the Act to base the decision on a consideration of \"whether greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change.\" \nHence the \"Endangerment Finding\". When Lisa Jackson became EPA head, she said she would seek to overturn the Bush administration \u201cmidnight regulations\u201d, especially the memorandum by outgoing EPA chief Stephen Johnson, which stated that carbon dioxide was not a pollutant to be regulated and officials assessing applications by utilities to build new coal-fired power plants could not consider their greenhouse gas output when approving power plants.\nJackson also revealed the administration\u2019s pre-determined policy on CO2, when she said that:\u201cOur first steps on taking office were to resume the CO2 endangerment finding and to seek fuel efficiency standards to reduce carbon pollution. The Law says Greenhouse Gases are pollution.\u201d \nEPA then commissioned an \"Endangerment Technical Support Document\" which was based on the IPCC reports, although Jackson claimed it was independent research by EPA scientists. It was written mainly by economists and environmental policy specialists, with qualifications like Masters in International Affairs or Public Policy and Management, although there were a couple of chemists, some engineers and one meteorologist.\nThe TSD stated:\"This document provides technical support for the endangerment analysis concerning greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that may be addressed under the Clean Air Act.\"\n\"The conclusions here and the information throughout this document are primarily drawn from the assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the U.S. Climate Change Science Program.\nThis document itself does not convey any judgment or conclusion regarding the question of whether GHGs may be reasonably anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, as this decision is ultimately left to the judgment of the Administrator.\"\nSo \"The Law\" did not specifically say that CO2 was a danger, neither did the EPA's own \"Technical Support Document\", but the Massachusetts ruling had opened the door for Lisa Jackson to implement the decision she had already made before taking office. The judgement of one Administrator was that it was not a pollutant to be controlled, a political change occurs and the next Administrator says the opposite. \nPolitics not science.", "recommendation_count": "3", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "113785731", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1521539594000}, "author": "James Holland", "author_id": "18387395", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "It's what AV would call \"the wisdom of crowds\".", "recommendation_count": "4", "in_reply_to": "113780932", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "113784817", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1521538420000}, "author": "justanotherflyboy", "author_id": "12039745", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "they sure know how badly their local climates are coming unzipped due to AGW; farmers and pastoralists can't help but notice when the monsoon fails, or when the desert claims another town or farm. think you might be surprised. bone-idle ignorance isn't worshipped elsewhere to the degree it is in the States.", "recommendation_count": "5", "in_reply_to": "113775320", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "agw", "effect": "how badly their local climates are coming unzipped"}]}, {"id": "113784674", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1521538244000}, "author": "justanotherflyboy", "author_id": "12039745", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "fuckin' ridiculous, the shite these deniers get up to. there orter be a law...\noh, snap.", "recommendation_count": "2", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "113784471", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1521537956000}, "author": "DennisHorne", "author_id": "4446531", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nOr is it because they don\u2019t fit with the orthodox view?\nBQEND The equilibrium climate sensitivity is the eventual increase in temperature for a doubling of CO2 from 280 to 560ppm.\nYou've read a bit about climate science.

Niwa has recorded seas of 24C to 26C around Auckland, compared with 18C to 22C at the same time last year.\nNew Zealand was tracking towards its warmest January on record, Noll said, with high temperatures expected to continue into February.\nHe added: \u201cIn New Zealand its quite rare to get above 30C or even 35C, so New Zealanders are finding this tough because it\u2019s not something they\u2019re accustomed to.\n\u201cWe have no fans left and air conditioning is much less prevalent than in many other countries.\u201d\nThe Howard League for Penal Reform told RNZ it had heard reports of prisoners fainting from the extreme heat in unventilated cells and of prison guards struggling to cope in stab-resistant body armour.\nThe chief coroner, Judge Deborah Marshall, issued a warning for people with health issues to take extra precautions, after a woman died in Christchurch from heatwave conditions. Hospitals around the country have reported an increase in patients \u2013 many of them elderly \u2013 presenting with heat stress and severe sun exposure.\nA nationwide shortage of fans prompted prime minister Jacinda Ardern to improvise, with her partner Clarke Gayford refurbishing a broken fan to keep the couple cool. \n\u201cClimate change means summer temperatures are expected to rise across both the North and South Island, increasing the risk of heat stress and subtropical diseases,\u201d said associate health minister Julie Anne Genter.\n\u201cClimate change is also likely to result in more droughts, wildfires, floods and infectious disease across the country. These are potentially big challenges for the health sector and I want to make sure it is ready to tackle them.\u201d\nArdern has called tackling climate change \u201cmy generation\u2019s nuclear-free moment\u201d. \nThe regions of Otago and Southland were expected to declare drought conditions this week after months of little to no rain. Some cattle and sheep farmers have taken to moving stock in the middle of the night to avoid the heat.\nDroughts have already been declared in the lower North Island and the South Island\u2019s west coast, with the government offering farmers emergency relief funding. \n\nNew Zealand\u2019s current hottest temperature on record was 42.4C, recorded in Rangiora in the South Island in February 1973, according to Niwa.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/natural-disasters", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/asia-pacific", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Temperatures forecast to hit 40C as even prime minister Jacinda Ardern struggles to keep cool", "date_published": {"$date": 1517274633000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627425000}, "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "article_section": "World news", "article_tags": ["New Zealand", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Climate change", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/30/new-zealand-heatwave-health-alerts-scramble-fans", "og:description": "Temperatures forecast to hit 40C as even prime minister Jacinda Ardern struggles to keep cool", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad2283a8dc00ec6eb4007edcbc5067fa48c1e33d/0_46_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=1e8f5f32b316a113120c3f68121214a7", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "New Zealand heatwave sparks health alerts and scramble for fans"}, "headline": "N", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad2283a8dc00ec6eb4007edcbc5067fa48c1e33d/0_46_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1396756c6a08c702a75da793da2775ff", "width": "3000", "height": "1801", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad2283a8dc00ec6eb4007edcbc5067fa48c1e33d/0_46_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dae91d954806a79951a2947850376568", "description": "Supporters take shelter from the heat during the under-19 Cricket World Cup match between New Zealand and England in Queenstown.\nPhotograph: Dianne Manson-IDI/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc08094a2c3613145ed8f35"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/18/europe-microwave-ovens-emit-nearly-as-much-co2-as-7m-cars", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Popping frozen peas into the microwave for a couple of minutes may seem utterly harmless, but Europe\u2019s stock of these quick-cook ovens emit as much carbon as nearly 7m cars, a new study has found.\nAnd the problem is growing: with costs falling and kitchen appliances becoming \u201cstatus\u201d items, owners are throwing away microwaves after an average of eight years, pushing rising sales.\nA study by the University of Manchester worked out the emissions of carbon dioxide \u2013 the main greenhouse gas responsible for climate change \u2013 at every stage of microwaves, from manufacture to waste disposal.\n\u201cIt is electricity consumption by microwaves that has the biggest impact on the environment,\u201d say the authors, who also calculate that the emissions from using 19 microwaves over a year are the same as those from a car.\n\u201cEfforts to reduce consumption should focus on improving consumer awareness and behaviour to use appliances more efficiently. For example, electricity consumption by microwaves can be reduced by adjusting the time of cooking to the type of food.\u201d\nEach year more microwaves are sold than any other type of oven in the EU: annual sales are expected to reach 135m by the end of the decade.\nDavid Reay, professor of carbon management at the University of Edinburgh, pointed out that the damage done by microwaves is still a fraction of that done by cars. \u201cYes, there are a lot of microwaves in the EU, and yes they use electricity,\u201d he said. \n\u201cBut their emissions are dwarfed by those from cars \u2013 there are around 30m cars in the UK alone and these emit way more than all the emissions from microwaves in the EU. Latest data show that passenger cars in the UK emitted 69m tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2015. This is 10 times the amount this new microwave oven study estimates for annual emissions for all the microwave ovens in the whole of the EU.\u201d\nThe energy used by microwaves is lower than any other form of cooking. uSwitch, the price comparison website, lists microwaves as the most energy efficient, followed by a hob and finally an oven, advising readers to buy a microwave if they don\u2019t have one. However, they urge owners to switch them off at the wall after use, to avoid powering the clock.\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s important to use microwaves efficiently,\u201d said Simon Bullock, senior climate change campaigner for the charity Friends of the Earth. \u201cBut so is making sure the electricity that powers them is as low pollution as possible. The government should reverse its policy attacks on solar and onshore wind. We need green electrons powering all the nation\u2019s tellies, microwaves and fridges.\u201d\nAlejandro Gallego-Schmid, one of the report\u2019s authors, said: \u201cThe aim of our study was not to compare microwaves to other cooking appliances but to look at the environmental impacts of microwaves as ubiquitous devices in households in Europe and draw attention to the need to make their design, use and end-of-life waste management more efficient.\u201d\nThe report also reveals that the lifespan of microwaves has reduced by nearly seven years over the last 20 years \u2013 from more than a decade to six-eight years. By the end of this decade 16m microwaves are expected to be discarded each year. \n\u201cGiven that microwaves account for the largest percentage of sales of all types of oven in the EU, it is increasingly important to start addressing their impact on resource use and end-of-life waste,\u201d said Gallego-Schmid. \nExisting regulation is not enough to reduce those environmental impacts, and specific regulations are needed for microwaves, says the report.\n\u201cMy microwave\u2019s not too high impact at the moment,\u201d said Bullock. \u201cIt\u2019s broken, waiting in a corner for me to work out where best to recycle it.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The biggest impact comes from electricity used to power the microwaves, but study also highlights rising environmental cost of our throwaway culture", "date_published": {"$date": 1516266407000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518629441000}, "authors": ["Juliette Jowit"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Energy", "UK news", "Environment", "Europe"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/18/europe-microwave-ovens-emit-nearly-as-much-co2-as-7m-cars", "og:description": "The biggest impact comes from electricity used to power the microwaves, but study also highlights rising environmental cost of our throwaway culture", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0a731873425efa192d04360c221eec495e64f6c/0_175_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=3a4875f59c91b7c5147b0d03d3c8a410", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Europe's microwave ovens emit nearly as much CO2 as 7m cars"}, "headline": "O", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0a731873425efa192d04360c221eec495e64f6c/0_175_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f6b9f78096f9dc46342bb2b3b4c5b6f8", "width": "5250", "height": "3150", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0a731873425efa192d04360c221eec495e64f6c/0_175_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1d363d82325b739f4cbe8061486c6350", "description": "Using your microwave more efficiently and turning it off when not in use can help cut energy consumption.\nPhotograph: Huw Jones/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc08096a2c3613145ed8f36"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/10/australia-had-third-hottest-year-ever-in-2017-weather-bureau-says", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Queensland and New South Wales experienced their warmest years on record in 2017 as the trend of warmer than average temperatures across Australia continued, the Bureau of Meteorology said.\nThe bureau\u2019s annual climate statement released on Wednesday revealed 2017 was Australia\u2019s third-hottest year on record, with the annual national mean temperature 0.95C above the average. \nIt meant the 11-year mean temperature between 2007 and 2017 was now the highest on record, and seven of Australia\u2019s 10 warmest years had occurred since 2005.\n\u201cDespite the lack of an El Ni\u00f1o \u2013 which is normally associated with our hottest years \u2013 2017 was still characterised by very warm temperatures,\u201d the agency\u2019s head of climate monitoring, Karl Braganza, said.\nThe national mean temperature of 22.76C \u2013 or 0.95C above the long-term average \u2013 was the third-highest since records began in 1910. \nThe bureau said background warming associated with climate change had seen Australian annual mean temperatures increase by about 1.1C since 1910, and most of that warming had occurred since 1950.\nWill Steffen, a climate change expert from the Climate Council, said the exceptionally warm year included \u201csome of the worst impacts of climate change seen in Australia to date\u201d, including severe heatwaves and devastating coral bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef.\n\u201cAnother year has passed and we have another set of records driven by intensifying climate change,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIn recent days Australians have felt the impact of a disruptive climate, with a severe heatwave across the south-east. Parts of the Hume Highway melted in the heat and on Sunday the temperature at Penrith hit 47.3 degrees Celsius, making it the hottest place on Earth during that 24-hour period.\u201d\nBoth day and night-time temperatures were warmer than average, with the maximum for the year the second-highest on record. Prolonged high sea surface temperatures led to the first instance of back-to-back years of mass coral bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef.\n\u201cAustralia has been looking at an increased frequency of heatwaves and other extremes that have been positively associated with climate change,\u201d Braganza said.\nAustralia\u2019s above average temperatures coincided with what the bureau called an \u201cexceptionally warm\u201d year globally, part of a continuing trend. \nThe estimated global mean temperature for 2017 was 0.09C above the 1961 to 1990 average, and the bureau said it was \u201clikely 2017 will be the second or third-warmest year on record since 1850\u201d. \nThe warmest two years were 2016 and 2015, records that were assisted by a strong El Ni\u00f1o, making 2017 the hottest year so far without the assistance of the weather pattern. \nGlobal temperatures increased by just over 1C since the pre-industrial period, and all of the 10 warmest years on record occurred between 1998 and the present.\nIn the United States, 2017 was typified by climate-related disasters: California\u2019s hottest-ever summer helped contribute to the state\u2019s record wildfire season, while researchers believe global warming helped boost Hurricane Harvey\u2019s record rainfall.\nBut the year was also dominated by climate denial, particularly in the US where the president, Donald Trump, led a dramatic withdrawal from efforts to curb global warming.\nIn June he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate accord, confirming the fears around the world of scientists and politicians about the US\u2019s repositioning on climate change.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/natural-disasters", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/weather/usa", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Bureau says despite the lack of El Ni\u00f1o, Queensland and New South Wales experienced their hottest year on record", "date_published": {"$date": 1515534004000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627282000}, "authors": ["Michael McGowan"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Australia weather", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Australia news", "New South Wales", "Queensland", "Climate change", "United States", "Climate change", "Australasia"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/10/australia-had-third-hottest-year-ever-in-2017-weather-bureau-says", "og:description": "Bureau says despite the lack of El Ni\u00f1o, Queensland and New South Wales experienced their hottest year on record", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7891629fc6ca0c2ee606cbb4e1375bb470c6ddba/0_175_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=1f0ce004ec3ed45ba5d7e642fef4799d", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Australia had third-hottest year ever in 2017, weather bureau says"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "0", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7891629fc6ca0c2ee606cbb4e1375bb470c6ddba/0_175_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8a12dcf80f6ca17cb746b512d77480d4", "width": "3000", "height": "1800", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7891629fc6ca0c2ee606cbb4e1375bb470c6ddba/0_175_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=85902faf5d3af0fa459006588c056af3", "description": "The national mean temperature of 22.76C was the third-highest since records began in 1910.\nPhotograph: Glenn Campbell/AAP"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556126932743}, "comments": [{"id": "110756794", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1515775525000}, "author": "James Holland", "author_id": "18387395", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\"Yet you find nothing I post\"No. Well, except for the two direct quotes from your posts, of course, which were the basis of my whole point.

For the first time in more than 40 years, the largest source of greenhouse gas pollution in the US isn\u2019t electricity production but transport \u2013 cars, trucks, planes, trains and shipping.\n Emissions data has placed transport as the new king of climate-warming pollution at a time when the Trump administration is reviewing or tearing up regulations that would set tougher emissions standards for car and truck companies. Republicans in Congress are also pushing new fuel economy rules they say will lower costs for American drivers but could also weaken emissions standards. \n Opponents of the administration fret this agenda will imperil public health and hinder the effort to address climate change. \n \u201cThis Environmental Protection Agency doesn\u2019t seem to have met an air regulation that it likes,\u201d said Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board and a former EPA assistant administrator. \u201cI\u2019ve not seen any evidence that this administration knows anything about the auto industry, they just seem to be against anything the Obama administration did.\n\u201cVehicle emissions are going up, so clearly not enough is being done on that front. The Trump administration is halting further progress at a critical point when we really need to get a grip on this problem.\u201d\nThe 1970 Clean Air Act, signed by Richard Nixon, set standards for a cocktail of different pollutants emitted from new vehicles. New cars and trucks, which account for more than 80% of transport emissions, now have to meet fuel efficiency standards and display this information to consumers. This approach has helped cleanse previously smog-laden American cities and tamp down greenhouse gas emissions.\n But in 2016, about 1.9bn tons of carbon dioxide emissions were emitted from transportation, up nearly 2% on the previous year, according to the Energy Information Administration. This increase means that transport has overtaken power generation as the most polluting sector in the country, and it\u2019s likely to stay that way. \n Cheap gasoline prices have led to a recent uptick in vehicle emissions, despite the fuel standards, at the same time that coal is being rapidly displaced by an abundance of cheap natural gas and the steady rise of renewable energy, driving a sharp decline in CO2 emissions from the power grid. \n While coalminers have lost their jobs to technological advancement and environmental protesters have thrown their bodies in the path of oil pipelines, there has been far less to disrupt the basic emissions-emitting models of cars, trucks and planes. \nAmericans are buying larger cars and taking more flights \u2013 domestic aviation emissions grew 10% between 2012 and 2016 \u2013 and face little opposition in doing so.\n \u201cThe change in power generation has been very impressive over the past 10 to 15 years,\u201d said Brett Smith, assistant director of the Center for Automotive Research.\n \u201cIn the automotive sector, there isn\u2019t the same push. There are certainly Americans concerned about global warming but people are driving bigger and bigger vehicles each year. It\u2019s not a priority for them. The cost of fuel is pretty cheap and at the moment there isn\u2019t a better option out there than the internal combustion engine.\u201d\n Transport accounts for about a quarter of all US planet-warming emissions but also poses a direct health threat to about 45 million Americans who live, work or attend school within 300ft of roads that are shrouded in high air pollution levels. \n This pollution can stunt lung growth, trigger asthma attacks, exacerbate heart disease and cause developmental problems. The EPA estimates 17,000 schools across the US are located next to roads with heavy traffic, with children from low-income and minority groups disproportionately put at risk. California is the only state in the US to ban the construction of a school on the cheap land found beside major highways. \n US cities haven\u2019t emulated the likes of London and Stockholm by charging drivers a congestion fee to coax them on to public transport, cycling or walking; nor does the US feature the comparatively high rates of fuel tax seen in Europe. France\u2019s move to ban sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2040 would be politically unthinkable in the States. But the air is much cleaner in American cities than it was in the 1970s, and a world away from the fug that now envelops Beijing and Delhi, in part due to vehicle emissions standards that have progressively been ratcheted up by the EPA. \n That trajectory has been cast in doubt by the Trump presidency. In March, the EPA scrapped a deal struck between Barack Obama\u2019s administration and automakers that would require new cars to run 54.4 miles per gallon of fuel, up from 27.5 miles per gallon, by 2025. \n The White House said the new rules had been \u201cshoved down the throats\u201d of car makers, with the main industry lobby group pointing out that consumers overwhelmingly prioritize safety, driving performance and value for money over fuel efficiency. There are more than 70 car models on sale that achieve 40 miles per gallon and they account for just 1% of total new vehicle sales. \n Then, last month, the EPA cited \u201cregulatory overreach\u201d by the previous administration for its decision to waive clean truck standards that would have phased out \u201cglider\u201d vehicles that produce 55 times more diesel soot than new trucks. Scott Pruitt, administrator of the EPA, said his predecessors had \u201cattempted to bend the rule of law and expand the reach of the federal government in a way that threatened to put an entire industry of specialized truck manufacturers out of business\u201d.\n These rollbacks from the executive branch have dovetailed with an effort by Republicans in the Senate and the House to revamp fuel efficiency rules by replacing state and federal requirements with a single standard. Environmental groups and previous administration officials fear this will lead to a further weakening of emissions standards.\n \u201cAmerica\u2019s clean car standards have dramatically improved the fuel efficiency of vehicles, saving consumers billions of dollars and cutting pollution in the process,\u201d said Carol Browner, a former administrator of the EPA.\n \u201cInstead of rolling back commonsense, successful and popular clean cars standards, we should focus on innovation and technology that will continue the auto industry\u2019s growth and the pollution reductions we\u2019ve achieved since these standards were first established.\u201d\n In the short term, this new approach risks a flashpoint between the federal government and California, which has a long-held waiver to enact vehicle pollution standards in excess of the national requirements. Twelve other states, including New York and Pennsylvania, follow California\u2019s standards, an alliance that covers more than 130 million residents and about a third of the US vehicle market. \n Nichols said she had been disturbed by signals coming from Pruitt and other EPA officials that she said show the federal government is looking to end California\u2019s waiver. \n \u201cWe are very concerned because these standards are the bedrock of our whole climate change platform,\u201d she said. \u201cScott Pruitt has made threatening noises about the Californian waiver, saying that we are trying to run the country. It feels like this is going to be the next shoe to drop. If it does, we will litigate and fight for our rights in the political arena with other states and consumer advocates.\u201d\n With federal regulation set to be pared back, technological advances in electric and gas-powered cars, as well as consumer preferences, are likely to play an increasingly important role in whether vehicle emissions are forced back down. \n A flurry of recent optimistic studies have forecast that, by 2040, as much as 90% of all cars in the US will be electric. But the current conundrum is that petroleum-fueled vehicles are cheaper and seen as more reliable than their electric counterparts by most new buyers. Affordable gasoline is competing with electric recharging stations that are considered too sparse by many drivers to risk running out of puff, no matter the benefit to the environment.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a challenging position for automotive companies because they are touting electric vehicles but ultimately they have to sell more cars,\u201d said Smith. \u201cConsumers in the US aren\u2019t pushing for electric vehicles to the extent they are in Europe and unless we take a very different approach as a country, that doesn\u2019t look like it will change soon.\n \u201cYou will need to see a major change in battery technology to make it viable. People are becoming more aware and concerned about global warming, but we aren\u2019t there yet. And when you look at the vehicles being put out by the major car companies, you could argue it\u2019s not an issue for them, either.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/epa", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/pollution", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/automotive-industry", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Transport overtook power generation for climate-warming emissions in 2017 but the Trump administration is reversing curbs on auto industry pollution", "date_published": {"$date": 1514782801000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1530823637000}, "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "US Environmental Protection Agency", "Pollution", "Climate change", "Automotive industry", "Business", "Environment", "US news", "Trump administration"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/01/vehicles-climate-change-emissions-trump-administration", "og:description": "Transport overtook power generation for climate-warming emissions in 2017 but the Trump administration is reversing curbs on auto industry pollution", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c187328c1384d02c5ecba548478fbd2af8cf674/48_29_3079_1847/master/3079.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=c00885a2513f73528929775c341c9de8", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Vehicles are now America's biggest CO2 source but EPA is tearing up regulations"}, "headline": "O", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c187328c1384d02c5ecba548478fbd2af8cf674/48_29_3079_1847/master/3079.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=34ccbbba130d9bbe18b92dff28201e61", "width": "3079", "height": "1847", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c187328c1384d02c5ecba548478fbd2af8cf674/48_29_3079_1847/master/3079.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=31be2c383e8ec5dbd737125ed900027c", "description": "Early evening congestion on a Los Angeles freeway.

Here, a solitary flickering flame casts out a warm glow, illuminating the nearby ridge line of the Malvern Hills. \nBelow the light sits a mysterious green contraption resembling a cross between a giant washing machine and a weather station. This is the UK\u2019s first dog poo-powered street lamp, and it is generating light in more ways than one.\nThe idea seems simple enough: dog walkers deposit the product of a hearty walk into a hatch and turn a handle. The contents are then broken down by microorganisms in the anaerobic digester, producing methane to fuel the light, and fertiliser.\nBrian Harper, who started work on the machine three years ago after becoming fed up of seeing plump little bags hanging in trees and on grass verges, reckons that 10 bags will power the light for two hours each evening.\n\u201cThe gas light captures people\u2019s imagination and shows them dog poo has a value,\u201d says Harper, who developed the system with funding from the Malvern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. \u201cAs a result, we get it [poo] off the ground, into a receptacle, and producing something useful.\u201d The next step is to try to interest managers of urban parks in the technology.\nHumans have used animal dung as fuel since the neolithic period, and have known how to get flammable gas from decaying organic matter since the 17th century. Small-scale anaerobic digesters are commonplace in many developing countries, while larger plants producing heat and electricity from animal manure and human sewage have long been used in the west.\nYet the energy in most excrement still goes to waste. Greater exploitation of this most plentiful resource has been held back by the availability of artificially cheap fossil fuel. But now Harper is at the vanguard of a new movement of innovators finding ingenious, sustainable ways of harnessing the power of excrement.\nLocal politicians in Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, are thinking along similar lines to tackle a different problem. Dog walkers who use three parks in the city are being asked to drop their pet\u2019s poo into concrete storage units. These are periodically emptied by trucks that take it to a large central plant where it is broken down along with other forms of organic waste to produce methane and then electricity. The fertiliser byproduct is sold to farmers.\n Analysis of the first five months of an 18-month trial suggests that at the current rate, the scheme would generate enough electricity to power 13 homes and remove 630kg of CO2 from the atmosphere. Modest returns perhaps \u2013 but not the main goals of the project. \n \u201cCollecting dog waste separately prevents it contaminating our recycling streams, allowing us to divert both away from our landfill sites,\u201d says Jeff Silcox-Childs, Waterloo\u2019s director of environment and parks.\n In India, the use of small household biodigesters to get gas for fuel from cow manure is common. One social enterprise is deploying the technology on a larger scale as part of a major initiative to end open defecation in the country by 2019. \n Sanitation and Health Rights in India (SHRI) turned to biodigestion as a way to keep public toilets clean \u2013 a major issue with existing communal facilities. At an initial cost of $30,000, SHRI builds blocks of 16 free-to-use toilets, half for men and half for women. The resulting sewage is broken down in a biodigester to produce methane, which powers a groundwater pump. The water is filtered, bottled and sold for half a rupee (half a pence) per litre, to pay for approximately half of the maintenance costs.\n \u201cWe are using existing technologies in ways they haven\u2019t been connected before to help people in India get the safe, well-maintained and hygienic toilets they deserve,\u201d says SHRI\u2019s cofounder Anoop Jain. The group opened its first community toilet block in 2014 and is currently building its seventh.\n Back in the UK, the Bristol-based GENeco, a subsidiary of Wessex Water, ran its famous Bio-Bug trial in which a VW Beetle was converted to run on methane extracted from human waste. The use of biomethane from sewage plants to power cars is more widespread in other countries, such as Sweden.\n In 2014 GENeco launched its Bio-Bus, the UK\u2019s first bus powered by gas generated from sewage and food waste. Capable of running for 300km on a full tank, it produces significantly less carbon dioxide and air pollution than fossil fuel-powered equivalents. It ran in trials between Bath and Bristol Airport and then, naturally, on Bristol\u2019s \u201cNumber 2\u201d bus route. \nGENeco also runs a facility that processes human sewage and food waste to generate enriched biomethane that is injected into the grid, providing fuel for some 5,000-6,000 homes. Severn Trent also opened an anaerobic digestion plant for sewage at Minworth near Birmingham in 2014.\n \u201cOur facility is no longer a traditional sewage treatment works but a factory, taking inputs including sewage and food waste and turning them into products including gas for cooking or transport and nitrogen- and phosphate-rich fertiliser,\u201d says Mohammed Saddiq, managing director of GENeco. \u201cPeople talk about the circular economy, but what we are doing is putting that vision into practice.\u201d\n While GENeco\u2019s gas-to-grid operation is certainly greener than traditional facilities, there is another input that muddies the water. It, and others like it, receive subsidies under the government\u2019s renewable heat incentive. Moreover some argue that large-scale operations involving transporting biomass to a central location are not necessarily the best of solutions.\nThis was the starting point for SEaB Energy, a Southampton-based company assembling modular, automated, odour-free anaerobic digesters in shipping containers. So far it has mainly sold units designed to process food waste, but it is currently assembling its first commercial Muckbuster units, due for installation in Japan and in Brazil in 2018.\n Sandra Sassow, CEO and cofounder of SEaB, warns that some facilities that turn biomass, including excrement, into energy may not be as green as they appear, if, for example, they use fuel to transport waste a long way before it is turned into an energy source.\n Right now, waste is collected, trucked, moved and processed, often ending up in landfill at worst or having some energy extracted from it at best, says Sassow. \n\u201cWe want to disrupt that completely to incorporate decentralised, distributed, on-site appliances into farms and buildings around the world. A lot of things have been tried, but it\u2019s a case of finding a technology that produces an energy benefit over the full life cycle, not just an apparent energy benefit.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/pollution", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Turning turds into power is not new but most of this energy still goes to waste.

Let's have a look at that for a moment. I walk my dog (see profile pic) for two or more hours every day. I often see dog poo in fields an on paths, only very rarely abandoned in poo bags (although I often find empty bags, presumably dropped when fishing a bag out of a pocket - these can be useful if I'm running low myself), and ALMOST NEVER hung in trees, in nearly four years of doing this. I'm beginning to think these poo bag sightings should be reported to the X Files.\nAnyway; poo bag etiquette. My dog tends to do what he has to do near the beginning of a walk. If I know there's a bin nearby, no problem - carry the bag to the bin. On most walks I know there isn't a bin en route: if it is a circular walk, I carry the bag with me (you can't be squeamish with a dog); but if it is a there-and-back walk, I leave the bag in a convenient but not in the way place, and pick it up on the return leg, that doesn't seem unreasonable. If you see a poo bag near a path, don't assume it has been abandoned- the owner may well be on their way back for it, even if it's in a tree.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n(On the actual subject of this article; I'm slightly alarmed at the description of the street lamp's digester as being like a giant washing machine - how big would a production model need to be?

The year: 1959. Robert Dunlop, 50 years old and photographed later as clean-shaven, hair carefully parted, his earnest face donning horn-rimmed glasses, passed under the Ionian columns of Columbia University\u2019s iconic Low Library. He was a guest of honor for a grand occasion: the centennial of the American oil industry. \nOver 300 government officials, economists, historians, scientists, and industry executives were present for the Energy and Man symposium \u2013 organized by the American Petroleum Institute and the Columbia Graduate School of Business \u2013 and Dunlop was to address the entire congregation on the \u201cprime mover\u201d of the last century \u2013 energy \u2013 and its major source: oil. As President of the Sun Oil Company, he knew the business well, and as al director of the American Petroleum Institute \u2013 the industry\u2019s largest and oldest trade association in the land of Uncle Sam \u2013 he was responsible for representing the interests of all those many oilmen gathered around him.\nFour others joined Dunlop at the podium that day, one of whom had made the journey from California \u2013 and Hungary before that. The nuclear weapons physicist Edward Teller had, by 1959, become ostracized by the scientific community for betraying his colleague J. Robert Oppenheimer, but he retained the embrace of industry and government. Teller\u2019s task that November fourth was to address the crowd on \u201cenergy patterns of the future,\u201d and his words carried an unexpected warning:\nLadies and gentlemen, I am to talk to you about energy in the future. I will start by telling you why I believe that the energy resources of the past must be supplemented. First of all, these energy resources will run short as we use more and more of the fossil fuels. [....] But I would [...] like to mention another reason why we probably have to look for additional fuel supplies. And this, strangely, is the question of contaminating the atmosphere. [....] Whenever you burn conventional fuel, you create carbon dioxide. [....] The carbon dioxide is invisible, it is transparent, you can\u2019t smell it, it is not dangerous to health, so why should one worry about it?\nCarbon dioxide has a strange property. It transmits visible light but it absorbs the infrared radiation which is emitted from the earth. Its presence in the atmosphere causes a greenhouse effect [....] It has been calculated that a temperature rise corresponding to a 10 per cent increase in carbon dioxide will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. All the coastal cities would be covered, and since a considerable percentage of the human race lives in coastal regions, I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.\nHow, precisely, Mr. Dunlop and the rest of the audience reacted is unknown, but it\u2019s hard to imagine this being welcome news. After his talk, Teller was asked to \u201csummarize briefly the danger from increased carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere in this century.\u201d The physicist, as if considering a numerical estimation problem, responded: \nAt present the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen by 2 per cent over normal. By 1970, it will be perhaps 4 per cent, by 1980, 8 per cent, by 1990, 16 per cent [about 360 parts per million, by Teller\u2019s accounting], if we keep on with our exponential rise in the use of purely conventional fuels. By that time, there will be a serious additional impediment for the radiation leaving the earth. Our planet will get a little warmer. It is hard to say whether it will be 2 degrees Fahrenheit or only one or 5. \nBut when the temperature does rise by a few degrees over the whole globe, there is a possibility that the icecaps will start melting and the level of the oceans will begin to rise. Well, I don\u2019t know whether they will cover the Empire State Building or not, but anyone can calculate it by looking at the map and noting that the icecaps over Greenland and over Antarctica are perhaps five thousand feet thick.\nAnd so, at its hundredth birthday party, American oil was warned of its civilization-destroying potential.\nTalk about a buzzkill.\nHow did the petroleum industry respond? Eight years later, on a cold, clear day in March, Robert Dunlop walked the halls of the U.S. Congress. The 1967 oil embargo was weeks away, and the Senate was investigating the potential of electric vehicles. Dunlop, testifying now as the Chairman of the Board of the American Petroleum Institute, posed the question, \u201ctomorrow\u2019s car: electric or gasoline powered?\u201d His preferred answer was the latter:\nWe in the petroleum industry are convinced that by the time a practical electric car can be mass-produced and marketed, it will not enjoy any meaningful advantage from an air pollution standpoint. Emissions from internal-combustion engines will have long since been controlled.\nDunlop went on to describe progress in controlling carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, and hydrocarbon emissions from automobiles. Absent from his list? The pollutant he had been warned of years before: carbon dioxide.\nWe might surmise that the odorless gas simply passed under Robert Dunlop\u2019s nose unnoticed. But less than a year later, the American Petroleum Institute quietly received a report on air pollution it had commissioned from the Stanford Research Institute, and its warning on carbon dioxide was direct: \nSignificant temperature changes are almost certain to occur by the year 2000, and these could bring about climatic changes. [...] there seems to be no doubt that the potential damage to our environment could be severe. [...] pollutants which we generally ignore because they have little local effect, CO2 and submicron particles, may be the cause of serious world-wide environmental changes. \nThus, by 1968, American oil held in its hands yet another notice of its products\u2019 world-altering side effects, one affirming that global warming was not just cause for research and concern, but a reality needing corrective action: \u201cPast and present studies of CO2 are detailed,\u201d the Stanford Research Institute advised. \u201cWhat is lacking, however, is [...] work toward systems in which CO2 emissions would be brought under control.\u201d\nThis early history illuminates the American petroleum industry\u2019s long-running awareness of the planetary warming caused by its products. Teller\u2019s warning, revealed in documentation I found while searching archives, is another brick in a growing wall of evidence.\nIn the closing days of those optimistic 1950s, Robert Dunlop may have been one of the first oilmen to be warned of the tragedy now looming before us. By the time he departed this world in 1995, the American Petroleum Institute he once led was denying the climate science it had been informed of decades before, attacking the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and fighting climate policies wherever they arose. \nThis is a history of choices made, paths not taken, and the fall from grace of one of the greatest enterprises \u2013 oil, the \u201cprime mover\u201d \u2013 ever to tread the earth. Whether it\u2019s also a history of redemption, however partial, remains to be seen.\nAmerican oil\u2019s awareness of global warming \u2013 and its conspiracy of silence, deceit, and obstruction \u2013 goes further than any one company. It extends beyond (though includes) ExxonMobil. The industry is implicated to its core by the history of its largest representative, the American Petroleum Institute.\nIt is now too late to stop a great deal of change to our planet\u2019s climate and its global payload of disease, destruction, and death. But we can fight to halt climate change as quickly as possible, and we can uncover the history of how we got here. There are lessons to be learned, and there is justice to be served.\nBenjamin Franta (@BenFranta) is a PhD student in history of science at Stanford University who studies the history of climate change science and politics.

I asked what you meant by extreme weather as you do not seem to consider extreme extreme El Nino events, extreme heat waves and extreme hot days to be extreme weather. \nFood production is hampered by droughts. During the neutral ENSO years leading up to the 2015-16 extreme El Nino event, the west of my state, parts of the central highlands and even usually wet coastal sugar growing regions were subject to a long and crippling drought. Beef became an expensive item and I had to eat more imported pork. Drought had reduced my state's food production. During the millennial drought locally grown rice became in short supply and we had to rely on Asian and European grown rice. We're a rich country which can afford to import food when there are shortages in our local production, but not all countries, affected by the increased rate of onset of drought due to global warming and the increased drought due higher frequency of the extremes of the ENSO spectrum due to global warming, are so fortunate. When such countries are also affected by problems of governance, the world community is alarmed but not alarmist at the reality of famine.\nGlobal warming has increased the length and intensity of the Australian bushfire (wildfire) season. This has made the task of fire management authorities more difficult as rapidly rising spring temperatures reduce the time available to carry out fuel reduction burns near human habitation and to maintain firebreaks. The increase in extremely hot dry spring, summer and autumn days combined with hot dry winds can result in fire fronts that are not stopped by fuel reduction and firebreak perimeters with wind borne embers flying 5 km ahead of the fire front and starting new fires.

The F-test show that the improvement obtained with the quadratic fit is statistical significant at a very high confidence level.\"\"We showed that a detailed analysis of the GRACE time series over the time period 2002\u20132009 unambiguously reveals an increase in mass loss from both ice sheets. The combined contribution of Greenland and Antarctica to global sea level rise is accelerating at a rate of 56 \u00b1 17 Gt/yr2 during April 2002\u2013February 2009, which corresponds to an equivalent acceleration in sea level rise of 0.17 \u00b1 0.05 mm/yr2 during this time.

Remarkably, 2017 was also hotter than 2015, which at the time was by far the hottest year on record thanks in part to a strong El Ni\u00f1o event that year.\nFor comparison, the neutral El Ni\u00f1o conditions and the level of solar activity in 1972 were quite similar to those in 2017. 45 years later, the latter was 0.9\u00b0C hotter than the former. For each type of year \u2013 La Ni\u00f1a, El Ni\u00f1o, and neutral \u2013 the global surface warming trend between 1964 and 2017 is 0.17\u20130.18\u00b0C per decade, which is consistent with climate model predictions.\nI\u2019ve been writing for the Guardian for almost 5 years now, and every year I\u2019ve had to write a similar headline or two:\nThose early years were the height of the denier frenzy about the mythical global warming \u2018hiatus.\u2019 At the time, John Abraham and I frequently wrote pieces pointing out that while various factors were temporarily dampening global surface warming, the oceans (which absorb over 90% of the excess heat from the increased greenhouse effect) continued warming rapidly. \nIt was only a matter of time until short-term effects stopped holding back the rise of Earth\u2019s surface temperatures. That\u2019s now happened, and as a result we\u2019re seeing unleashed global warming causing record temperatures year after year. In fact, in February 2014 I wrote about a study that predicted this would happen:\nthe [ocean] heat uptake is by no means permanent: when the trade wind strength returns to normal - as it inevitably will - our research suggests heat will quickly accumulate in the atmosphere. So global temperatures look set to rise rapidly out of the hiatus, returning to the levels projected within as little as a decade.\nTemperatures have in fact risen so quickly, it appears to have taken just a few years for that prediction to come true and for the denier focus on the short-term surface warming slowdown to look quite foolish.\nSpeaking of climate denial, on the 362nd day of the hottest year on record without an El Ni\u00f1o, the US president tweeted this:\nIn the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year\u2019s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!\nClimate scientist Sarah Myhre aptly described the tweet as \u201cPhenomenally dumb,\u201d for several obvious reasons. \nTrump also began the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement in 2017, leaving America as the only country in the world denying the urgent need to address global warming. Fortunately, every other nation is taking action to mitigate this existential threat, but there\u2019s a shocking gap between reality and the \u2018fake news\u2019 beliefs of arguably the most powerful man in the world.\nAmerica was also battered by climate-fueled extreme weather events in 2017. Research has already shown that global warming boosted Hurricane Harvey\u2019s record rainfall (and associated flooding) by about 38%. California\u2019s record wildfire season was similarly fueled by the state\u2019s hot summer. The southwestern states were cooked by record hot summer temperatures this year, and global warming is making droughts in America and Europe worse. America was hit by 15 billion-dollar weather and climate disasters in 2017, and it will likely be the costliest such year on record once all of the hurricane damages are tallied.\nThese extreme weather events are expensive. Until we manage to cut global carbon pollution, temperatures will continue to rise and climate change consequences will become more severe. While it broke many of today\u2019s records, 2017 is just a taste of what\u2019s to come.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change-scepticism", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/global-climate-talks", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/elnino", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Dana Nuccitelli: Climate scientists predicted the rapid rise in global surface temperatures that we\u2019re now seeing", "date_published": {"$date": 1514890826000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627443000}, "authors": ["Dana Nuccitelli"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Climate change scepticism", "Environment", "Paris climate agreement", "COP 21: UN climate change conference | Paris", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Global climate talks", "El Ni\u00f1o southern oscillation", "Climate change", "Science", "Donald Trump"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jan/02/2017-was-the-hottest-year-on-record-without-an-el-nino-thanks-to-global-warming", "og:description": "Dana Nuccitelli: Climate scientists predicted the rapid rise in global surface temperatures that we\u2019re now seeing", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f7923380ab99780370a68af30e7fcf926fbf760/0_186_3986_2392/master/3986.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=d05371fb1db00263409dff3b36b7d076", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "2017 was the hottest year on record without an El Ni\u00f1o, thanks to global warming | Dana Nuccitelli"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "\u00f1", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f7923380ab99780370a68af30e7fcf926fbf760/0_186_3986_2392/master/3986.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7a6bf39b10e09b6db66e9bc82bb52e93", "width": "3986", "height": "2392", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f7923380ab99780370a68af30e7fcf926fbf760/0_186_3986_2392/master/3986.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=893e50d930e03179757ff5d12eb0ea38", "description": "Firefighters lighting backfires as they try to contain the Thomas wildfire in Ojai, California on on December 09, 2017.\nPhotograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c4a12b1edd089c4ef1f3605e4bb24b675edb6a1/0_0_1406_957/master/1406.png?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=370abab87c25f9f611b11fe94e7ee6ab", "width": "1406", "height": "957", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c4a12b1edd089c4ef1f3605e4bb24b675edb6a1/0_0_1406_957/master/1406.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f6a1ee5a29b91579450955136be3573f", "description": "1964\u20132017 global surface temperature data from Nasa, divided into El Ni\u00f1o (red), La Ni\u00f1a (blue), and neutral (black) years, with linear trends added.

The study suggested that equatorial regions and countries at high latitudes could get wetter.\nProf Tim Osborn, also one of the study\u2019s co-authors from UEA, said: \u201cThe areas of the world which would most benefit from keeping warming below 1.5C are parts of south-east Asia, southern Europe, southern Africa, Central America and southern Australia where more than 20% of the world\u2019s population live today.\u201d\nThe findings are published in the journal Nature Climate Change.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "A global temperature rise to 2C above pre-industrial levels could see many regions facing an increased threat of drought and wildfires, study suggests", "date_published": {"$date": 1514908273000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627442000}, "authors": ["Hannah Devlin"], "article_section": "Science", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Science", "Environment", "Climate change"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/02/keep-global-warming-under-15c-or-quarter-of-planet-could-become-arid", "og:description": "A global temperature rise to 2C above pre-industrial levels could see many regions facing an increased threat of drought and wildfires, study suggests", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75898484497e17359f60d4a459bc7da92480f95a/0_30_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=42edf707213f0a7bdb1936ff4989b757", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Keep global warming under 1.5C or 'quarter of planet could become arid'"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75898484497e17359f60d4a459bc7da92480f95a/0_30_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=79bbf4e8af9b83f74b47829a164e3cda", "width": "2835", "height": "1701", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75898484497e17359f60d4a459bc7da92480f95a/0_30_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2e57f60af366d1252a9aa0dce00b75c1", "description": "Aridification is a serious threat \u2013 as well as leading to droughts and wildfires it can also have an impact on agriculture, water quality, and biodiversity.\nPhotograph: Javier Blasco/EPA"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc08220a2c3613145ed8fa0"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/02/weatherwatch-scientists-develop-speed-breeding-to-feed-rising-population", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Scientists are engaged in a race against time to breed staple crops that can both survive climate change and yield bigger harvests. Their aim is to feed a growing population in a warming world.\nThe method used for centuries of growing one crop a year in variable weather conditions and then selecting the seeds from the best plants is no longer viable in fast-changing climatic conditions. Scientists are concerned that for some years there have been few improvements in yields of grain.\nA new system called speed breeding, designed to grow six crops a year, has been developed in glasshouses to accelerate the process. Using LED lighting to aid photosynthesis, intensive regimes allow the plants to grow for 22 hours a day. This new form of lighting is a lot cheaper and also more efficient than using the old sodium vapour lamps that produced too much heat and not enough light.\nAmong the crops that can now be grown up to six generations a year are wheat, barley, peas and chickpeas. Canola, a form of rapeseed, can achieve four cycles.\nUsing this technology, scientists can study the way plants deal with diseases, and their shape and structure and flowering time, and the growing cycle can be repeated every eight weeks.\nIt is hoped the technique will yield new varieties of crops that can be grown on a commercial scale within 10 years. If this could be achieved, it would increase productivity in the same way as the green revolution of the 1960s, when new crop varieties, modern farm practices, and use of fertilisers saved millions of people from starvation. \n\n", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/food", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/farming", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/plants", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/weather", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Researchers are developing a system to enable six harvests a year of staple food crops that can survive climate change", "date_published": {"$date": 1514928627000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1520072391000}, "authors": ["Paul Brown"], "article_section": "Science", "article_tags": ["Agriculture", "Science", "Food", "Environment", "Farming", "Plants", "UK news", "Climate change", "Climate change", "UK weather", "Meteorology"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/02/weatherwatch-scientists-develop-speed-breeding-to-feed-rising-population", "og:description": "Researchers are developing a system to enable six harvests a year of staple food crops that can survive climate change", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d8fcdbf6f2158e1d158f50bbc10fdd0e5476ee6/0_0_750_450/master/750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=000f57405ce640cf000b2feb58b7dfc0", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Weatherwatch: scientists develop 'speed breeding' to feed rising population"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d8fcdbf6f2158e1d158f50bbc10fdd0e5476ee6/0_0_750_450/master/750.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9ba4cdff86955112996eb03cdfe50a1d", "width": "750", "height": "450", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d8fcdbf6f2158e1d158f50bbc10fdd0e5476ee6/0_0_750_450/master/750.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ba3e4ba90491d03bb4150f81aee02dbe", "description": "Dr Brande Wulff, of the John Innes Centre, Norwich, joint author of a new report on \u2018speed breeding\u2019"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556127323685}, "comments": [{"id": "110459201", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1515165505000}, "author": "user403", "author_id": "16567249", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "What about the soil?

For this reason, this chapter considers only those effects associated with warming and increases in the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone. Crop weather records of the past 20-30 years reveal wodespread evidence of warming.\n* Inter-annual crop yield deviations often show a negative relationship to inter-annual variations in growing season mean temperature (Tmean). For cereals, yield sensitivity is around -2 % to -5% per degree C warming, but this includes the response to other weather parameters that vary in association with Tmean. Measurements and crop simulation modelling suggest cereal yield responses to growing season Tmean alone range from -4% to -7% per degree increase in temperature.\n* Chronic warming reduces yield largely by hastening crop development, although shorter hot spells can also exert negative effects on seed number and grain size. CO2 rise currently benefits C3 crops (such as wheat) by ~0.2% p.a. but has little effect on C4 crops (such as maizw).

"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "The Australian Industry Group has warned that Tony Abbott\u2019s call to rule out the use of international carbon credits will push up the cost of meeting emissions targets.\nThe Turnbull government\u2019s review of its climate policies, released before Christmas, flagged the Coalition\u2019s intention to allow use of international permits to help Australia meet its international emissions reductions commitments.\nCarbon credit schemes would allow Australian energy companies to buy credits for abatement projects, such as tree-planting in developing countries, to meet restrictions on emissions in the proposed national energy guarantee.\nOn Wednesday Abbott said he did not support overseas carbon credits being available to Australian businesses because it was a form of \u201ccarbon trading, which is a carbon tax under a different name\u201d.\n\u201cThat just means that Aussie consumers end up shovell\u00ading our money to foreign carbon traders and we all know the \u00adpotential for rorts there,\u201d he told the Australian.\nThe Australian Industry Group chief executive, Innes Willox, said industry had advocated for international credits for many years \u201cas a cost effective means of achieving our obligations\u201d.\n\u201cThe sensible approach is to meet our obligations in the least costly ways possible,\u201d Willox said. \u201cAnd in some cases it will be less expensive to meet these obligations by reducing emissions [or sequestering carbon dioxide] in other countries.\n\u201cIt makes absolutely no sense to rule out this option by insisting that our commitments can only be fulfilled within our borders.\n\u201cThis can only increase the costs of meeting our international obligations.\u201d\nWillox said Australians would need to be \u201ctotally satisfied\u201d commitments were met with genuine reductions with \u201cstrict methodologies and transparent measurement\u201d, but that was true wherever abatement was achieved.\nHe said meeting Australia\u2019s commitment in the Paris climate agreement would \u201cinevitably\u201d involve some cost.\nA spokesman for the Business Council of Australia said it also supported the use of \u201ccredible international permits as a practical measure to reduce emissions\u201d.\n He said support for international permits was a practical measure that would \u201chelp provide the flexibility and capacity for Australian businesses to participate in what is fundamentally a global issue\u201d.\nThe energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, has stood by the in-principle support for international credits but said a final decision on the quantity and quality limits would be made by 2020.\nHe hit back at Abbott\u2019s comments, arguing that international credits have been on the table since the Abbott government signed up to the 2015 Paris climate agreement.\nFrydenberg said the climate review showed that the Business Council of Australia, Australian Industry Group and the Minerals Council all strongly support international permits.\n\u201cIt is worth noting that Mr \u00adAbbott\u2019s position on international permits is closer to the Greens than that of Australia\u2019s big employers,\u201d he told the Australian.\nThe Liberal MP Craig Kelly, the chairman of the government\u2019s backbench committee on climate and energy, has backed Abbott\u2019s call to rule out the use of international permits.\nKelly has advocated that Australia backload its emissions reduction target, opting to make less abatement in the short term and achieve higher emissions reductions closer to the 2030 deadline when renewable energy technology advances may make it cheaper to do so.\n\u201cI am still relatively confident that under the Neg our Paris commitment can be achieved, taking advantage of technology, at virtually zero cost, if the trajectory is done in a sensible manner,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.\nKelly said if Australia could not meet its targets in that way \u201cyou\u2019ve got to ask yourself if we have set that target too stringently\u201d and there would be a debate about what price the community is prepared to pay to meet the targets.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics",

Hybrid vehicles accounted for 31.3%, including 18.4% for plug-in hybrids, the Norwegian Road Federation calculated.\nThis represents an increase over the previous year, when zero-emission and hybrid cars accounted for 15.7% and 24.5% respectively of total sales, making Norway a world leader in electrifying road transport. \nNorway, the biggest producer of oil in western Europe, has set itself the ambitious goal of selling only new zero-emission cars starting from 2025.\nUnlike diesel or gasoline cars, which are heavily taxed, electric cars benefit from a very generous tax system, making their purchase prices relatively competitive. Their owners also enjoy many privileges such as free city tolls, ferries, parking and recharging in public car parks, as well as having the right to drive in bus lanes.\nAuthorities plan to gradually reduce some measures whose benefits and costs are disputed by critics. \nIn 2017 the rightwing government tried to remove one of the tax exemptions on large and luxurious electric sedans in what was dubbed the \u201cTesla tax\u201d, but was later forced to pull back due to opposition from its centre-right allies.\nThe Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association welcomed the new statistics while calling for a continued state incentive: \u201cThe goal of 2025 is ambitious,\u201d said its secretary general, Christina Bu.\n\u201cWe need to go from 21% market share to 100% in seven years, which means we still have a way to go even if it\u2019s going in the right direction and the increase compared to 2016 is satisfactory.\u201d\nWhile there was a large interest in electric and hybrid cars, proven by long waiting lists for new vehicles, manufacturers had been slow to meet this demand, with lengthy delivery times and a lack of models, Bu said.

It went viral almost instantly, and soon was the best-read story in the magazine\u2019s history. A writer in Slate called it \u201cthe Silent Spring of our time\u201d. But it also garnered tremendous criticism and from more than the usual denier set.\nBeyond quibbles with the science, critics including the illustrious climate scientist Michael Mann took issue with the piece\u2019s \u201cdoomist framing\u201d because, as he wrote at the time, there\u2019s \u201ca danger in overstating the science in a way that presents the problem as unsolvable, and feeds a sense of doom, inevitability and hopelessness\u201d.\nBut others say scaring people is the only way to make them care. Perhaps the most famous purveyor of climate scare tactics is Guy McPherson. Described by the New York Times as an \u201capocalyptic ecologist\u201d, McPherson\u2019s doomsday theory of \u201cnear-term extinction\u201d has attracted something of a following. McPherson wrote on his website, which includes links to suicide hotlines, that the David Wallace-Wells piece \u201clargely captures my message\u201d.\nRather than treat emotions as levers to be pulled, they should be seen as part of a dynamic interplay\nBoth sides are wrong, from a psychological standpoint. Emotions are complicated and can vary tremendously from person to person. Trying to crudely manipulate them doesn\u2019t work.\nThat\u2019s the conclusion from behavioral scientists at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Daniel Chapman, Brian Lickel and Ezra Markowitz, who, in a recent paper published in Nature Climate Change, seek to bring the lessons of psychology to bear on communicating the importance climate change.\nTo attempt to either scare or inspire people \u201csimultaneously oversimplifies the rich base of research on emotion while overcomplicating the very real communications challenge advocates face by demanding that each message have the right \u2018emotional recipe\u2019 to maximize effectiveness\u201d, they write.\nClimate experts, after all, are not experts on human behavior and the people who are say there are better ways to communicate the climate problem. Rather than treat emotions as levers to be pulled for a desired effect, they should be seen as part of a dynamic interplay among factors that shape our behavior, exquisitely specific to the human being inhabiting them.\nWhat\u2019s more, since the vast majority of us are not very good at getting people to feel the way we want them to based on the words coming out of our mouths alone, the best approach, it would seem, is one of humility \u2013 that is, to spend more time listening, and also, to know our own limits.\n\u201cPractitioners in different fields have varying perspectives on the issue,\u201d Chapman told me. \u201cIn general, I think we need researchers and practitioners attending in an honest way to what research does and does not tell us about how to engage the public with climate change.\u201d\nFor those intent on communicating climate change in psychologically adept ways, there are some takeaways from the science. \nFor instance, though we\u2019ve been conditioned to think of anger as an undesirable emotion, research has shown it to be an important emotion for motivating action in the face of social injustice. And the pairing of certain feelings, like fear and efficacy, can be helpful too.\n Like a patient who\u2019s given both a diagnosis and a course of treatment, people respond better to risks when given both a reason and a way to act. In this sense, it seems the hope and fear camps of the climate debate are each seeing only part of the puzzle.\nBut even in places where the science is relatively strong, researchers caution against simplistic applications. Rote formulas like \u201cthree parts hope to one part scary\u201d won\u2019t translate from one person to another. Indeed, to use such information responsibly requires, if not some level of sophistication, then at least considerable forethought, as well as a concerted, ongoing effort to meet people where they are.\nThat means, above all, knowing your audience and what\u2019s relevant to them. Are they considering chopping down a nearby forest or putting their houses up on stilts? Do they need to rebuild or relocate? Parsing people\u2019s needs and sensitivities is critical in any form of communication, but particularly when it comes to talking about climate science, with its great technical complexity, profound personal impact, and tremendous political polarization.\nAbove all, it means remembering that climate change is a very big story. It isn\u2019t monolithic, and communication of it looks like many things \u2013 be it climate scientists talking to lay-people or Leonardo DiCaprio making a movie.\nThe overwhelming problem in climate communication, after all, isn\u2019t how it\u2019s talked about so much as whether it\u2019s being talked about at all. A 2016 report from Yale\u2019s programme on climate communication found one in four Americans say they \u201cnever\u201d hear someone discussing it.\nLooked at that way, David Wallace-Wells\u2019 apocalyptic horror story cum viral sensation is the best thing that\u2019s happened in climate communication some time.\u2022 Lucia Graves is a Guardian US columnist", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Communication is everything when it comes to the climate change debate, writes Guardian US columnist Lucia Graves", "date_published": {"$date": 1515042005000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627283000}, "authors": ["Lucia Graves"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Climate change", "Environment", "Science", "Media", "US news", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/04/climate-fear-or-hope-change-debate", "og:description": "Communication is everything when it comes to the climate change debate, writes Guardian US columnist Lucia Graves", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/094cdce08adc362b6455e686087e9c2ad64752db/0_109_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=d7754a8547070e8195cf25e7281b2299", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Which works better: climate fear, or climate hope?

She didn\u2019t have any home insurance. \u201cThere had been two false alarms that year \u2026 We\u2019d been told that the water would come into our house at 4.2 metres, but when the levels got to 4.3 in early December, we were still dry.\u201d She and her husband were in receipt of automated telephone calls whenever the rain started to fall \u2013 a computerised female voice would predict the height the river might reach. \u201cWhen it rains she rings up all the time,\u201d she explains; \u201cyou stop picking up to her.\u201d They went away with their young daughter for a few days over the Christmas holidays, and when they came back, the river was lapping near their ceilings. \u201cBefore we went away we moved all our things a few inches off the ground, emptied the bottom drawers, and piled everything on to the second shelf up. This was one of the most pointless things I have ever done.\u201d\nAfter the flood receded, neighbours and strangers gave up their Christmas holiday time to help her hose out sediment and clean up. \u201cI became a designated Victim with an assigned caseworker and my own reference number at the food bank.\u201d During the flood her father had swum out to the house to gather paperwork; as she laid out the papers to dry, passers-by took pictures of her with their phones. A reporter hoping to interview her feigned pity, and on the television she saw aerial footage of her street. \u201cThe flood looked very small. It wasn\u2019t like that on the ground where it was everywhere.\u201d She found catharsis in throwing away many of her possessions \u2013 a catharsis that expressed itself physically: \u201cThe sense of relief was located in my spine, it felt as if my vertebrae were spacing themselves further out, as if my body was growing longer and more loose.\u201d\nHer in-laws live in Birmingham; she and her husband took turns driving between there, to spend time with their daughter, and alone in Yorkshire cleaning the house of slime and sewage. \u201cIn spite of all the help that was offered, nobody offered to help in such a way that would allow us to keep our family together, which was all I thought I wanted at the time.\u201d\nThe premise of The Second Body is that all human beings have two bodies \u2013 the one they have immediate autonomy over, made of flesh and bone, and another which is more diffuse. Hildyard struggles to define exactly what she means by the second body, but in one place calls it \u201cthe global presence of the individual body\u201d. Elsewhere it is imagined as an entity shared and distributed across every aspect of the biosphere impacted on by humans. The flood was part of this second body \u2013 an elemental retribution brought about not just by her, but by all the collective bad decisions of Homo sapiens: \u201cMy second body came to find my first body when the river flooded my house.\u201d\nHildyard has taught Shakespeare at university level; in order to make sense of her experience she turns to Shylock in The Merchant of Venice. \u201cHe asks: what happens to a human from whom everything beyond his body has been taken away?\u201d Shylock\u2019s experience of destitution is to fall back on the carnal aspects of his humanity (\u201cIf you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die?\u201d). She explicitly compares Shylock\u2019s perspective to that of Nina Simone when, after listing everything she doesn\u2019t have in \u201cAin\u2019t Got No \u2013 I Got Life\u201d (home, shoes, money, cigarettes), Simone proclaims and celebrates all her body parts (hair, brains, tongue, boobs). \u201cShylock and Nina Simone cannot speak directly about what it is to be a living human now. What was interesting to me was that they shared a vision of an individual body that was very personal, but also overpopulated with other people\u2019s organs \u2013 this was how it seemed to me. I thought that other people acted as if that was not the case: as if their organs, and their bodies, were somehow different from those that were all around them.\u201d\nHildyard and her husband were awarded compensation by the government, which she used to take a cheap flight to a Mediterranean island with her daughter (\u201cIn a technical way I believe in climate change, but I do not much act as if I do \u2026 I didn\u2019t want to spend this money on more things\u201d). Walking in the warm evening air she comes upon beached lifeboats, an immigration Portakabin, some Red Cross tents and \u201ca queue of humans, some wearing blankets, waiting to be seen\u201d. The connection is left implicit between her own experience, internally displaced by climate change, and that of migrants on the Mediterranean beach.\nI have concentrated on Hildyard\u2019s final essay because it\u2019s there that her themes cohere most convincingly, and her writing is most compelling. The first three essays describe encounters with animals alive and dead, and with scientists who make sense of life. There\u2019s a convalescence story of an injured pigeon that she later describes as a pet, a visit to a butcher called Richard and a conversation with Gina, an American zookeeper turned prison officer turned investigator of environmental offences (such as the smuggling of exotic animals as pets, and the slaughter of orangutans to clear forest for palm oil plantations).\nIn Jena, near Leipzig, Hildyard seeks out the advice of three academic biologists \u2013 Luis, Nadezhda and Paul. Nadezhda teaches her about fungi, Luis about the origin of life. He is described as knowing more than Hildyard about almost everything, but she is puzzled by his optimism about the future of humanity, and discomfited when he explains that the definition of life is open to debate: \u201cStop,\u201d I said. \u201cYou don\u2019t actually know what life is? ... You need to get your act together.\u201d\nThese are fretful, questioning essays with occasional flashes of beauty, demanding of readers that they think about anthropogenic disruption of climate and ecology. Their structure feels disjointed, and their register wilfully banal, but perhaps their very fragmentation is a comment on modern disconnection and disaffection. They seem to come from a place of perplexity and anguish, bewilderment struggling towards expression.\n\u201cWhen Hamlet, Macbeth and Lear die \u2026 they repeat themselves increasingly until they make funny sounds,\u201d Hildyard writes towards the end of the book. She uses the example of King Lear: \u201cHowl, howl, howl, howl! It is not clear whether this is a noise or a command.\u201d\n\u2022 Gavin Francis\u2019s Adventures in Human Being is published by Profile/Wellcome.\n\u2022 The Second Body is published by Fitzcarraldo.

Most sea creatures cannot survive in these zones and current trends would lead to mass extinction in the long run, risking dire consequences for the hundreds of millions of people who depend on the sea.\nClimate change caused by fossil fuel burning is the cause of the large-scale deoxygenation, as warmer waters hold less oxygen. The coastal dead zones result from fertiliser and sewage running off the land and into the seas.\nThe analysis, published in the journal Science, is the first comprehensive analysis of the areas and states: \u201cMajor extinction events in Earth\u2019s history have been associated with warm climates and oxygen-deficient oceans.\u201d Denise Breitburg, at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in the US and who led the analysis, said: \u201cUnder the current trajectory that is where we would be headed. But the consequences to humans of staying on that trajectory are so dire that it is hard to imagine we would go quite that far down that path.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a problem we can solve,\u201d Breitburg said. \u201cHalting climate change requires a global effort, but even local actions can help with nutrient-driven oxygen decline.\u201d She pointed to recoveries in Chesapeake Bay in the US and the Thames river in the UK, where better farm and sewage practices led to dead zones disappearing.\nHowever, Prof Robert Diaz at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, who reviewed the new study, said: \u201cRight now, the increasing expansion of coastal dead zones and decline in open ocean oxygen are not priority problems for governments around the world. Unfortunately, it will take severe and persistent mortality of fisheries for the seriousness of low oxygen to be realised.\u201d\nThe oceans feed more than 500 million people, especially in poorer nations, and provide jobs for 350 million people. But at least 500 dead zones have now been reported near coasts, up from fewer than 50 in 1950. Lack of monitoring in many regions means the true number may be much higher.\nThe open ocean has natural low oxygen areas, usually off the west coast of continents due to the way the rotation of the Earth affects ocean currents. But these dead zones have expanded dramatically, increasing by millions of square kilometres since 1950, roughly equivalent to the area of the European Union. \nFurthermore, the level of oxygen in all ocean waters is falling, with 2% \u2013 77bn tonnes \u2013 being lost since 1950. This can reduce growth, impair reproduction and increase disease, the scientists warn. One irony is that warmer waters not only hold less oxygen but also mean marine organisms have to breathe faster, using up oxygen more quickly. \nThere are also dangerous feedback mechanisms. Microbes that proliferate at very low oxygen levels produce lots of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas that is 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide.\nIn coastal regions, fertiliser, manure and sewage pollution cause algal blooms and when the algae decompose oxygen is sucked out of the water. However, in some places, the algae can lead to more food for fish and increase catches around the dead zones. This may not be sustainable though, said Breitburg: \u201cThere is a lot of concern that we are really changing the way these systems function and that the overall resilience of these systems may be reduced.\u201d\nThe new analysis was produced by an international working group created in 2016 by Unesco\u2019s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. The commission\u2019s Kirsten Isensee said: \u201cOcean deoxygenation is taking place all over the world as a result of the human footprint, therefore we also need to address it globally.\u201d\nLucia von Reusner, campaign director of the campaign group, Mighty Earth, which recently exposed a link between the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico and large scale meat production, said: \u201cThese dead zones will continue to expand unless the major meat companies that dominate our global agricultural system start cleaning up their supply chains to keep pollution out of our waters.\u201d\nDiaz said the speed of ocean suffocation already seen was breathtaking: \u201cNo other variable of such ecological importance to coastal ecosystems has changed so drastically in such a short period of time from human activities as dissolved oxygen.\u201d\nHe said the need for urgent action is best summarised by the motto of the American Lung Association: \u201cIf you can\u2019t breathe, nothing else matters.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/pollution", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/marine-life", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "description": "Areas starved of oxygen in open ocean and by coasts have soared in recent decades, risking dire consequences for marine life and humanity", "date_published": {"$date": 1515092403000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1530791991000}, "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Oceans", "Pollution", "Environment", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Science", "Marine life", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/04/oceans-suffocating-dead-zones-oxygen-starved", "og:description": "Areas starved of oxygen in open ocean and by coasts have soared in recent decades, risking dire consequences for marine life and humanity", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a70234974734d3adfbb8bd21f44a91b560043632/507_0_2943_1766/master/2943.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=f54c18be96c5d9d5f53ed874462f905a", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Oceans suffocating as huge dead zones quadruple since 1950, scientists warn"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "O", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a70234974734d3adfbb8bd21f44a91b560043632/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9610902ab90b429f23823d7bcee5681a", "width": "4000", "height": "2400", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a70234974734d3adfbb8bd21f44a91b560043632/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4ab96a2be4adebf791c1f3b4c896253c", "description": "A fisherman on a beach in Temuco, Chile that is blanketed with dead sardines, a result of algal blooms that suck oxygen out of the water.\nPhotograph: Felix Marquez/AP"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556127330424}, "comments": [{"id": "110527287", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1515349648000}, "author": "colddeadhands33", "author_id": "12274172", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\" he would be more difficult to bring into this conversation.\"\nNo, chris.

There are also plants that grow in dirt but don't have roots (Comb Ferns, Lycopodium, Mosses and Liverworts). \nThe only plants in the sea that do have roots are sea grasses - angiosperm or flowering plants whose evolutionary lineage has returned to the sea. They are eaten by fish and dugongs. Kelp are large brown algae that form undersea forests in cold marine waters. They have holdfasts to keep them attached to the rocks in the surf but no roots as they get what they need from the surrounding sea water. Brown algae, red algae and green algae are regarded as plants.\nPlants are defined as members of the Kingdom Plantae which is comprised of multicellular organisms that produce their own food from inorganic molecules by photosynthesis and have more or less rigid cell walls containing cellullose. The Kingdonm Plantae consists of Thallophytes - algae brown, red and green; Bryophytes - mosses, liverworts, etc.; Pteridophytes - ferns, club mosses etc.; Gymnosperms - Pine trees, cycads, ginkos etc.; and Angiosperms - flowering plants including those with cryptic flowers such as grasses and casaurinas.\nLiving cellular things are divided into 5 Kingdoms: Monera which lack complex intracellular organelles - bacteria including Archea, blue green algae, and some other pathogens; Protista - protozoans, most algae, and slime moulds; Fungi- yeasts, rusts, moulds and mushrooms/toadstools; Animalia and Plantae. Also Phytophthora a group of fungal like organisms that cause a dieback disease in crops and ecosystems are classified in a separate Kingdom - Chromista or Stramenopila. \nNote blue green algae, or as they are now often called blue green bacteria, organisms with simple bacterial cells capable of photosynthesis, are regarded as Monera, not as plants or Plantae. First appearing in the fossil record 3.8billion years ago, they together with other bacteria, transformed the Earth over the next 3.2 billion years eventually making it an environment where the other 4 or 5 Kingdoms could evolve.\nAlgae are are diverse group of not particularly closely related eukaryotic organisms (with complex intracellular organelles) in the Kingdom Protista. Some classifications include the large multicellular kelp and other multicellular algae in the Protista. Green algae and green plants are a lineage or clade but Thallophyta is not. Protista capable of photosynthesis include green algae such as stoneworts or Chara, Spirogyra, desmids, marine flagellate Tetraselmis, Volvox, Chlamydomonas, Micromonas, Acetabularia, Ulva (sea lettuce, laver or nori); brown algae such as diatoms, loricas, golden algae, Actimonas, coccolithophorids, silicoflagellates (another group of diatoms) plus brown algae and sea weed; plus cryptomonas, red algae, dinoflagellates and Euglena.https://www.britannica.com/science/algae/classification-of-algae", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "110491475", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "that", "effect": null}]}, {"id": "110498957", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1515290908000}, "author": "Alan1987", "author_id": "11342996", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "You do know that nearly all published peer reviewed science papers are overturned at some point don't you?\nTherefore just basing all your judgements on those is guaranteeing you are wrong on most things.\nIn those situations where you have some knowledge you need to do some thinking yourself.

In May scientists warned that the central goal of the Australian government\u2019s protection plan was no longer feasible because of the dramatic impact of climate change.\nFriday\u2019s paper also determined the link between El Ni\u00f1o and mass bleaching events has diminished as global warming continues.\nPrior to the 1980s mass coral bleaching on a regional scale was \u201cexceedingly rare or absent\u201d and occurred in localised areas stretching tens of kilometres, not the hundreds of kilometres affected in recent times, the paper said.\nThese local bleaching events were largely caused by small-scale stressors like unusually hot or cold weather, freshwater inundation or sedimentation.\nThen global warming increased the thermal stress of strong El Ni\u00f1o events, the paper said, widening the impact of individual bleaching events. Now, they are occurring at any time.\n\u201cBack in the 80s it was only during El Ni\u00f1o events that waters became hot enough to damage corals and induce them to bleach,\u201d co-author Andrew Baird, a professor at James Cook University, told Guardian Australia.\n\u201cBut now it\u2019s 30, 40 years later and we\u2019re seeing those temperatures in normal years.\u201d\nBaird said it was difficult to know if the current conditions were reversible but \u201cthe window to address it is diminishing\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know if this is the end of coral reefs but it might be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really need to get on top of climate change as soon as possible.\u201d\nThere have been several large-scale and devastating mass bleaching events in recent years. The 2015-16 event affected 75% of the reefs studied by the researchers, who said it was comparable to the then unprecedented mass bleaching of 1997-98, when 74% were affected.\n\u201cInterestingly one of the first papers that effectively drew attention to the issue \u2013 back in 1999 \u2013 suggested that by 2016, 2017, 2020, we would be seeing bleaching annually,\u201d Baird said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty close to what\u2019s happening unfortunately.\n\u201cSome of these earlier works were quite prescient in their prediction and unfortunately we didn\u2019t pay enough attention back then.\u201d\nThe study follows a discovery late last year that 3% of the Great Barrier Reef could facilitate recovery after bleaching \u2013 a finding the researchers at the time suggested was akin to a life-support system but small enough not to be taken for granted.\nOn Friday scientists announced that a major outbreak of coral-eating crown of thorns starfish had been found munching the Great Barrier Reef in December, prompting the Australian government to begin culling the spiky marine animals.\nThe predator starfish feeds on corals by spreading its stomach over them and using digestive enzymes to liquefy tissue. \n\u201cEach starfish eats about its body diameter a night, and so over time that mounts up very significantly,\u201d Hugh Sweatman, a senior research scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science told ABC radio. \u201cA lot of coral will be lost,\u201d he said. \nThe crown of thorns were found in plague proportions in the Swains reefs, at the southern edge of the Great Barrier Reef, by researchers from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.\nThe authority already killed some starfish at Swains reefs in December and said it would mount another mission in January.\nThere have been four major crown of thorns outbreaks since the 1960s in the Great Barrier Reef but it recovered each time because there were always healthy populations of herbivorous fish. The outbreaks are usually triggered by extra nutrients in the water but the reason for the current outbreak was unclear, Sweatman said. \n Additional reporting by Reuters ", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coral", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/marine-life", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Study of 100 tropical reef locations finds time between bleaching events has shrunk and is too short for full recovery", "date_published": {"$date": 1515092403000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627439000}, "authors": ["Helen Davidson"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Great Barrier Reef", "Environment", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Australia news", "Coral", "Marine life"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/04/coral-reef-bleaching-the-new-normal-and-a-fatal-threat-to-ecosystems", "og:description": "Study of 100 tropical reef locations finds time between bleaching events has shrunk and is too short for full recovery", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7818df2c1f85a045e74b64e9a6d885085b83372b/0_257_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=4e6eddc7657d86f5f4880316ffd3b615", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Coral reef bleaching 'the new normal' and a fatal threat to ecosystems"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7818df2c1f85a045e74b64e9a6d885085b83372b/0_257_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=deabaa4bb61968e1b77bf1ceb77374b7", "width": "4608", "height": "2765", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7818df2c1f85a045e74b64e9a6d885085b83372b/0_257_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ffefad052e2b5d62e5249e79d24f8e8a", "description": "Coral bleaching on the Great Barrief Reef.

One ecosystem that will be seriously affected will be cloud forests \u2013 tropical jungles persistently bathed in fog.\nUntil now, little research had been done on the likely impacts of rising clouds, but one scientist is planning to change that using an enormous curtain strung up in the middle of the forest.\nCloud forest thrives on mountainsides at 500-4,000 metres above sea level, making up about 1% of the world\u2019s forest in a tropical band that hugs the equator. But, though the area covered is small, the forests are vital to much broader regions. For instance, they help regulate rivers across vast tracts of lowlands, absorbing moisture into spongy soil when the weather is wet and releasing water when it\u2019s dry. And they provide habitats for many birds, such as the coppery headed emerald hummingbird of Costa Rica and the elfin wood warbler of Puerto Rico, both of which live only in cloud forests.\nMany scientists believe the process forcing clouds higher may already have begun. This would diminish a cloud forest\u2019s moisture and it\u2019s uncertain whether forests could successfully migrate uphill in response. Examining the impact of clouds relocating is critical to understanding the future of the forests.\nDan Metcalfe, a biology professor at Lund University in Sweden, wants hard data so he can determine what will happen to the forests that remain if the models are correct. He explains he\u2019s trying something never before done: \u201can experimental approach where we actually physically try to remove clouds from a portion of the forest\u201d.\nMetcalfe had planned to encircle a square plot twice the size of a basketball court with a mesh curtain suspended from 10-storey phone poles at each corner. Fog would condense on the fabric, leaving the interior moisture-starved. He chose the Wayqecha Biological Station, a cloud forest research centre 3,000m above sea level in Peru. But he didn\u2019t factor in the difficulty of operating heavy equipment at Wayqecha. Precipitous slopes and fragile soil prevent hauling in the kind of drill rig that could set corner posts deeply enough for big nets. No roads penetrate to Wayqecha\u2019s groves, only footpaths.\nMetcalfe realised he\u2019d have to install bolted metal lattice towers. These can be hand-carried in pieces, then assembled on site. They can be built atop slender footings and stabilised by guy wires installed with lightweight equipment. But they\u2019re expensive. He couldn\u2019t afford two, let alone four, and feared that he might have to cancel the project. But then Metcalfe heard that not long before, the station had suffered a misfortune that could help him.\nWayqecha already had three lattice towers, supporting a catwalk over a ravine. Until recently, the walkway had included a fourth tower, but it had been toppled by a landslide. However, the structure\u2019s struts and decking were undamaged. Rather than completely enclosing a plot in nets, Metcalfe realised he could suspend a single mesh curtain across the path of mist blowing up a valley. The fog-catching curtain would dangle from a cable stretched between one of the undamaged towers and a new one he\u2019d build out of the one that had fallen.\nMetcalfe encountered obstacle after obstacle even carrying out his plan: a key member of his construction team got sick and needed months of recovery; a fire destroyed expensive gear; and Peruvian customs balked when they saw that a shipping container of construction supplies included the bow and arrow he\u2019d need for stringing cables. In the four years since he started the project, his wife had a child. And then another. It got tougher to leave home for Peru.\nBut finally, the curtain is nearly done. A crew built the tower in September and the last step, suspending the curtain above the forest floor, was completed at the end of October. Soon, Metcalfe will be able to shed light on the future of the forest.\n\u2022 Reporting for this story was supported in part by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting and the Whole Systems Foundation.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/forests", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/peru", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/americas", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Global warming is predicted to push clouds higher in the sky.

It examined two genetically distinct populations of turtles on the reef, finding the northern group of about 200,000 animals was overwhelmingly female.\nWhile the southern population was 65%-69% female, females in the northern group accounted for 99.1% of juveniles, 99.8% of subadults and 86.8% of adults.\n\u201cCombining our results with temperature data show that the northern GBR green turtle rookeries have been producing primarily females for more than two decades and that the complete feminisation of this population is possible in the near future,\u201d the paper said.\nThe temperature at which the turtles will produce male or female hatchlings is heritable, the paper said, but tipped to produce 100% male or 100% female hatchlings within a range of just a few degrees.\n\u201cFurthermore, extreme incubation temperatures not only produce female-only hatchlings but also cause high mortality of developing clutches,\u201d it said. \u201cWith warming global temperatures and most sea turtle populations naturally producing offspring above the pivotal temperature, it is clear that climate change poses a serious threat to the persistence of these populations.\u201d\nThe lead author, Dr Michael Jensen from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the research provided a new understanding of what the turtle populations were dealing with.\nHe said the findings were surprising and \u201ca bit alarming\u201d, with significant conservation implications.\n\u201cWhile we can hope there might be some cooler years to produce a few more males, overall we can expect the temperatures to increase,\u201d he said.\nJensen said the researchers worked around \u201cethical implications\u201d of past studies that required sacrificing some hatchlings to accurately determine sex ratios and pivotal temperature ranges.\nThis team instead studied more than 400 turtles at foraging grounds, gathering information on the sex of turtles from multiple generations.\n\u201cKnowing what the sex ratios in the adult breeding population are today, and what they might look like five, 10 and 20 years from now when these young turtles grow up and become adults, is going to be incredibly valuable,\u201d Jensen said.\nThe research was facilitated through the Great Barrier Reef Rivers to Reef to Turtles project by the World Wildlife Fund Australia.\nThe chief executive of WWF Australia, Dermot O\u2019Gorman, said it was yet another sign of the impact of climate change, following recent research that coral bleaching events were occurring far more frequently.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had two years where we\u2019ve had mass bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThat\u2019s a very visible sign of the impact of climate change. But this is an invisible change. We can\u2019t see the impact it\u2019s having on a turtle population until a study like this shows some long-term trends.\u201d\nO\u2019Gorman said more urgent action on climate change was clearly needed but conservationists were taking some practical measures, including trialling the use of shadecloth on known nesting beaches to lower the sand temperature, and reducing bycatch in the fishing industry.\n\u201c[Shadecloths] can be done in certain places but there\u2019s a limit to the scale you can do that,\u201d he said.\n The green turtle is one of the most populous species of turtle in the world but the Great Barrier Reef settlement was significant and turtles were under enormous pressure outside Australian waters, O\u2019Gorman said.\n\u201cAn additional threat to them really does sound alarm bells,\u201d he said. \u201cNow every large reproductive male is going to be even more important.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/animals", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "\u2018Complete feminisation\u2019 of northern population is possible in near future, researchers find", "date_published": {"$date": 1515430816000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627795000}, "authors": ["Helen Davidson"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Great Barrier Reef", "Environment", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Australia news", "Science", "Animals", "Wildlife"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/08/great-barrier-reef-rising-temperatures-turning-green-sea-turtles-female", "og:description": "\u2018Complete feminisation\u2019 of northern population is possible in near future, researchers find", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0e579edbd1e543c5e7b745508df2b7921f66315/0_629_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=075dabe54dc21faadbb5ded37279488e", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Great Barrier Reef: rising temperatures turning green sea turtles female"}, "headline": "m", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0e579edbd1e543c5e7b745508df2b7921f66315/0_629_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2a7c05997e0bc2216b5f19e2e60f244c", "width": "4608", "height": "2765", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0e579edbd1e543c5e7b745508df2b7921f66315/0_629_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e715f66463e780e55524994dcf9b771a", "description": "Females in a Great Barrier Reef population of green sea turtles were found to make up 99.1% of juveniles, 99.8% of subadults and 86.8% of adults.\nPhotograph: Christine Hof / WWF-Aus"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/456d6681577104bb53003f7014a563714760156a/35_0_3523_2114/master/3523.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7a46a004d803a97ea7ebdef9d559cb1d", "width": "3523", "height": "2114", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/456d6681577104bb53003f7014a563714760156a/35_0_3523_2114/master/3523.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7bf6780cb69807af9dc4045227808edd", "description": "Green sea turtles are among species with temperature dependent sex-determination.

That ties 2011 for the number of billion-dollar disasters, but the total cost blew past the previous record of $215bn in 2005.\nCosts are adjusted for inflation and Noaa keeps track of billion-dollar weather disasters going back to 1980.\nThree of the five most expensive hurricanes in US history hit last year.Hurricane Harvey cost $125bn, second only to 2005\u2019s Katrina, while Maria cost $90bn, ranking third, Noaa said. Irma was $50bn, for the fifth most expensive hurricane. Western wildfires fanned by heat racked up $18bn in damage, triple the previous US wildfire record, according to Noaa.\nAlmost certainly, according to a\u00a0statement\u00a0issued by the World Meteorological Organization on Tuesday. \u201cClimate change means that when we do have an event like Harvey, the rainfall amounts are likely to be higher than they would have been otherwise,\u201d the UN organisation\u2019s spokeswoman Clare Nullis told a conference. Nobody is arguing that climate change caused the storm, but it is likely to have made it much worse.\nWarmer seas evaporate more quickly. Warmer air holds more water vapour. So, as temperatures rise around the world, the skies store more moisture and dump it more intensely. The US National Weather Service has had to introduce a new colour on its graphs to deal with the volume of precipitation. Harvey surpassed the previous US record for rainfall from a tropical system, as 49.2 inches was recorded at Mary\u2019s Creek at Winding Road in Southeast Houston, at 9.20am on Tuesday.\nThere is a proven link \u2013 known as the\u00a0Clausius-Clapeyron equation\u00a0\u2013 that shows that for every half a degree celsius in warming, there is about a 3% increase in atmospheric moisture content. This was a factor in Texas. The surface temperature in the Gulf of Mexico is currently more than half a degree celsius higher than the recent late summer average, which is in turn more than half a degree higher than 30 years ago,\u00a0according\u00a0to\u00a0Michael Mannof Penn State University. As a result there was more potential for a deluge.\nYes, the storm surge was greater because sea levels have risen 20cm as a result of more than 100 years of human-related global warming. This has melted glaciers and thermally expanded the volume of seawater.\n\u201cWhile we have to be careful about kneejerk cause-effect discussions, the National Academy of Science and recent peer-reviewed literature continue to show that some of today\u2019s extremes have climate change fingerprints on them,\u201d said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd, a past president of the American Meteorological Society.\nAt least 362 people died in 2017 due to these natural disasters, the agency reported, including 64 killed in Puerto Rico. Outlets such as the New York Times and BuzzFeed have questioned the official death toll from the island, and estimated that Hurricane Maria has caused the deaths of about 1,000 people.\nNoaa announced its figures at the society\u2019s annual conference in Austin, Texas.The weather agency also said that 2017 was the third hottest year in US records for the lower 48 states with an annual temperature of 54.6F (12.6C), 2.6 degrees warmer than the 20th-century average. Only 2012 and 2016 were warmer. The five warmest years for the lower 48 states have all happened since 2006.\nThis was the third straight year that all 50 states had above-average temperatures for the year.\nFive states Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and New Mexico had their warmest year ever.

As we start the new year let us revisit the data and highlight just how terrible the government\u2019s record on emission reduction has been.\nThe news that the temperature in Penrith reached 47.3C on Sunday naturally had people talking of climate change. And while noting that a very hot day is evidence of climate change is not as stupid as the very stable genius, Donald Trump, suggesting that the cold snap in the east of the USA meant climate change was fake, we should remember that weather \u2013 even if it is hot \u2013 is still not climate.\nFortunately we do have data that shows the average temperatures for the entire planet over a year, and not just for a day, in a particular part of Australia. Less fortunate however, the data shows that things are very bad.\n2017 will be the second warmest year on record and easily the warmest ever for a year not affected by El Nino:\nIt means that 2017 will be first time in six years that the calendar year has not been warmer than the one which preceded it. But that is small comfort, given it is warmer than every single year that did precede it but one.\nAll this fits appropriately with the news of Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.\nI should of course note that the news is a bit old \u2013 although you might have missed it. In 2016, the government released its emissions data on the Thursday before Christmas Day. Last year they were a bit better \u2013 they did it on the Tuesday before Christmas. Rather coincidentally it was also the day Malcolm Turnbull announced the reshuffle of his ministry and the government released its energy policy review.\nI know the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, would be disappointed if you had missed the release amid all that news, so let me give you a recap: short version \u2013 they are terrible; long version \u2013 they are terrible, and there is little hope that they will get better.\nIn the 12 months to September 2016, Australia\u2019s annual greenhouse gas emissions rose to a record level of 550.2 Mt CO2-e if you include the rather dodgy emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sectors.\nThe government\u2019s report sought to paint a nice picture, noting that this was just 0.7% above the previous year and was \u201c0.8% below emissions in 2000 and 9.1% below emissions in 2005\u201d.\nBut we can all cherry pick dates. For example, while it might be below 2000 and 2005 levels the latest emissions are around 4% above where they were in June 2014.\nThe government likes to include LULUCF emissions when comparing with 2000 and 2005, because back then we had a lot of such emissions, due to tree clearing and the like:\nIf we include such emissions in our overall count it means we can reduce our emissions by simply planting trees, or not clearing land (or promising to do so). That is why both in the Kyoto protocol and in the 2005 Paris agreement, Australian governments have made sure such emissions are counted.\nUnfortunately this has been a long practice. The release of the latest cabinet papers from the final years of the Keating government showed the then ALP government sought a \u201cno regrets\u201d policy on climate change which essentially meant doing nothing that would increase electricity prices and trying to achieve reductions through limiting land clearing and planting trees.\nThe exclusion of LULUCF emissions shows just how greatly this affects our goal of reducing emissions by 26%-28% below 2005 levels by 2030:\nIncluding LULULCF has us currently 9.1% below 2005 levels, but if you exclude them, Australia\u2019s emissions are nearly 6% higher than they were in 2005.\nThe reality is \u201cno regrets\u201d and other climate change cons such as a \u201cgreen army\u201d or direct action do not work. And the latest emissions data shows this clearly.\nSince the removal of the carbon price in June 2014, annual emissions have grown every quarter:\nAnd you don\u2019t need to be a Rhodes scholar presiding over a party room full of climate change deniers to know why. Putting a price on carbon provided an incentive for firms to use less of it. Removing that price removed the incentive.\nIt\u2019s fortunate for the government that there is some good news \u2013 though this good news occurred in spite of its policies rather than due to them.\nAnnual electricity emissions have fallen \u2013 down 3.7% in the last year. But mostly this is due to a fall in demand for electricity and the reduction in the use of brown coal generated electricity due to the closure of the Hazelwood power station:\nThe problem for the government is that while the inclusion of LULUCF emissions and slowing electricity demand do help their path towards a 26% cut on 2005 levels by 2030, they remain a very long way from achieving that aim.\nThe government also released its latest emissions projection figures. And while the projections are lower than they were a year ago, they still predict Australia\u2019s emissions by 2030 will be just 5% below 2005 levels:\nThe government\u2019s energy policy \u2013 even if it allows a quasi price on carbon through buying of international permits \u2013 will not do anywhere near enough to reach the goal (no matter how much it annoys Tony Abbott).\nThe problem is that even if electricity emissions were to fall by 26% below 2005 levels, Australia\u2019s overall emissions would still be just 9% below 2005 levels (and 4% above if you exclude LULUCF emissions).\nThe time has come for our politicians to quit pretending we can reduce emissions painlessly. If that was actually possible it would have already been done by every government on the planet. Climate change isn\u2019t a problem because the solution is easy.\nTime is running out. Yes, Australia only has a small percentage of the global land mass and emissions but either we are part of the global solution or we stand complicit with the ignorant and the charlatans who would say it is all a hoax.\nThe aim is to stop temperatures from rising to more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. We are already around 1.1C above those levels. Even using a very conservative liner trend of the past 50 years (something that is close to a best case scenario) we will reach 2C by 2071 \u2013 just 53 years time.\nIf that sounds a long time away, note that according the latest life expectancy figures all Australia males under 28 and all females under 32 can expect to live till then. That means 41% of Australians will likely live to experience such temperatures, unless action is taken.\nBut while we have a government with climate change deniers in key cabinet positions and which hides emissions data under the cover of Christmas holidays and a news dump I have little faith Australia will be part of any such action.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/business-australia", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "In case you missed it, the latest greenhouse gas emissions data was released just before Christmas.

Solar thermal is looking good, but it's just not there yet as a solution to intermittency.So, intermittency means that we need storage. The only currently feasible storage option we have is pumped hydro. We would need 40GW of pumped hydro because there will always some days when we need 40GW and there are no renewables are available. Now to power the pumped hydro you need a power source, but using a \"renewables only\" constraint that means that we would need an additional, say 40 GW of solar / wind to pump for the immediate requirements of the each night / still period, giving ourselves a slight buffer to accommodate the 80% efficiency of pumped hydro.Then you have to add capacity for prolonged periods of dull, still weather. Let's say for up to 10 days maximum at a time. That doesn't add to the required generation capacity of pumped hydro - that stays at 40GW - but it certainly adds to the amount of dam storage you require and the amount of renewables capacity you require to fill that dam storage.So all up we would need a minimum of 150 - 200GW of renewable generation and 40GW of pumped hydro capacity to provide the same reliability as 40GW of gas / coal / nuclear (providing there are no periods of dull, still weather longer than 10 days). So where are we at? We require about $225bn - $500bn to build the required renewables capacity (at the current price of $1.50 to $2.50 per Watt) and if you use Snowy Hydro 2.0 as a metric, an additional investment of $60bn in pumped hydro, but frankly that sounds cheap because the current benchmark is $3.00 per Watt. So we are looking at an absolute minimum $300bn investment (but possibly as much $600bn to replace $40bn of fossil / nuclear capacity. And they are facts. You can play at the margins with the costs and assumptions, but I have erred on the side optimism, so you wont get much out of that. That is the engineering reality, Divine. So now we turn to the political reality. You have to convince the taxpayers to invest in something which is massively expensive that could make a small improvement to global climate change, but only if every other country in the world agrees to do the same thing. Good luck with that. Oh, and while you're at it, electricity generation is at best, what, 40% of total greenhouse gas production. It moves power from the States to the Commonwealth, always a popular move. Not. It requires finding sites for dams that have to supply 400GW days of power as an absolute minimum. (Remember, the Australian Greens was founded 30 years ago on getting the building of the Gordon-below-Franklin hydro dam stopped, so they would have to change their policies very substantially...)I could go on... So, Divine, when you unpack it, as lofty and as laudable as moving to renewables may be, it is not a case of believing in something. You have to be able to get it done.

Both solar and wind are intermittent. Everyone agrees with that for solar because they understand the concept of night, but there are still people who like to think of wind as continuous, or continuous enough to supply baseload. Experience in the UK and Germany has shown that there are days in both jurisdictions where total output has dropped to less than 1% of the total installed capacity.

They used this data in mathematical modelling to determine a carbon dioxide equivalent emissions factor for each sector, and to obtain an overall emissions footprint.\n\u201cWe found that the carbon footprint attributed to healthcare was 7% of Australia\u2019s total; that is, similar to the entire carbon emissions associated with the activities of 7% of Australians,\u201d the study found. This represented 35,772 kilotonnes of Australia\u2019s 494,930 kilotonnes of carbon emissions in 2014-15. The study found hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry were together responsible for two-thirds of the healthcare carbon footprint.\nIt is the first time the carbon footprint stemming from healthcare has been determined for Australia. Similar analyses conducted overseas found healthcare contributed 3% of total emissions in England and 10% in the US.\nThe co-author of the study, Dr Forbes McGain, an anaesthetist and intensive care physician with Western Health in Melbourne, said anaesthetic gases were a significant contributor to hospital carbon emissions. DEA has called on physicians to use general anaesthetic alternatives to gases, such as intravenous drugs.\n\u201cThe anaesthetic gases we pump into the atmosphere have a very high global warming potential, up there with chlorofluorocarbons,\u201d McGain said. The gases desflurane and nitrous oxide, known as laughing gas, were especially bad for the environment, he said.\nIntravenous drugs or less potent gases could be used instead, with no impact on the quality of patient care.\n\u201cThough there are some reasons why gases might be used, such as fast onset and offset, Denmark for example uses intravenous anaesthesia much more commonly than gases,\u201d he said. \u201cSo cultural factors are extremely important, as well as marketing by pharmaceutical companies to influence doctors. Gases won\u2019t be completely replaced, but they don\u2019t need to be used as commonly as they are.\u201d\nHe agreed with DEA that more hospitals needed to turn to renewable energy. Short payback times for photovoltaics and rising energy prices meant solar panels should become an increasingly viable option, McGain said.\nIn an accompanying comment piece published in the Lancet, public health researchers Professor Peng Bi and Dr Alana Hansen from the University of Adelaide wrote that reducing the number of patients attending hospitals would also curb carbon emissions. General practitioners would be essential to this, by detecting disease early and promoting disease prevention measures. \n\u201cHealth promotion efforts to encourage healthy lifestyles will help to reduce the need for access to healthcare and on the reliance for pharmaceuticals, the sectors with the highest direct carbon dioxide equivalent emissions emissions,\u201d the authors wrote. \n\u201cMessages on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle might help to reduce individual and community vulnerability to the health effects of climate change and, ironically, help lower the main contributing factor \u2013 carbon emissions.\u201d\nMcGain said it was promising that many states had committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2050.\n\u201cBut to achieve emissions reductions in healthcare will be a massive effort, requiring support and funding at the federal level,\u201d he said. \u201cClimate change is a health problem, and the health sector should be leading the way in addressing it.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Study prompts calls for more energy-efficient hospitals and for doctors to use general anaesthetic alternatives to gases", "date_published": {"$date": 1515470410000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627436000}, "authors": ["Melissa Davey"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Health", "Climate change", "Australia news", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/09/australias-healthcare-system-contributing-to-7-of-nations-carbon-footprint", "og:description": "Study prompts calls for more energy-efficient hospitals and for doctors to use general anaesthetic alternatives to gases", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5570dc9688c333da93c34aeebf113868868bd4fe/0_48_3630_2178/master/3630.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=accabd5478a1fc2543a176ea0aae909e", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Australia's healthcare system contributing to 7% of nation's carbon footprint"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5570dc9688c333da93c34aeebf113868868bd4fe/0_48_3630_2178/master/3630.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2a325d293527e4ea3d6faa08d6b4fba7", "width": "3630", "height": "2178", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5570dc9688c333da93c34aeebf113868868bd4fe/0_48_3630_2178/master/3630.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=48242545c12e04d0e3ad6cd85f9c2f06", "description": "Medical experts say reducing the number of patients attending hospitals would help curb carbon emissions.

The story was quickly echoed by the Daily Mail, International Business Times, Sputnik News, Metro, Tru News, and others. Zharkova was also behind the \u2018mini ice age\u2019 stories in 2015, based on her research predicting that the sun will soon enter a quiet phase.\nThe most important takeaway point is that the scientific research is clear \u2013 were one to occur, a grand solar minimum would temporarily reduce global temperatures by less than 0.3\u00b0C, while humans are already causing 0.2\u00b0C warming per decade. \nSo the sun could only offset at most 15 years\u2019 worth of human-caused global warming, and once its quiet phase ended, the sun would then help accelerate global warming once again.\nThe myth ultimately stems from a period climate scientists have coined \u201cThe Little Ice Age\u201d (LIA). This was a modestly cool period running from about the year 1300 to 1850. It was particularly cold in the UK, where the River Thames sometimes froze over, and \u2018frost fairs\u2019 were held. \nA team led by University of Reading physicist and solar expert Mike Lockwood wrote a paper reviewing the science behind frost fairs, sunspots, and the LIA. It included the figure below showing northern hemisphere temperatures along with sunspot number and the level of volcanic particles in the atmosphere over the past millennium:\nDuring full blown ice ages, temperatures have generally been 4\u20138\u00b0C colder than in modern times. As this figure shows, during the LIA, temperatures were at most only about 0.5\u00b0C cooler than the early 20th century. Thus, Lockwood calls the Little Ice Age \u201ca total misnomer.\u201d As the authors put it:\nCompared to the changes in the proper ice ages, the so-called Little Ice Age (LIA) is a very short-lived and puny climate and social perturbation.\nFor comparison, temperatures have risen by a full 1\u00b0C over the past 120 years, and 0.7\u00b0C over just the past 40 years.\nThe Maunder Minimum was a period of quiet solar activity between about 1645 and 1715. It\u2019s often referred to interchangeably with \u2018Little Ice Age,\u2019 but the latter lasted centuries longer. In fact, three separate solar minima occurred during the LIA, which also included periods of relatively higher solar activity. Other factors like volcanic eruptions and human activities also contributed to the cool temperatures. In fact, a 2017 paper led by the University of Reading\u2019s Mathew Owens concluded:\nClimate model simulations suggest multiple factors, particularly volcanic activity, were crucial for causing the cooler temperatures in the northern hemisphere during the LIA. A reduction in total solar irradiance likely contributed to the LIA at a level comparable to changing land use [by humans].\nSeveral studies have investigated the potential climate impact of a future grand solar minimum. In every case, they have concluded that such a quiet solar period would cause less than 0.3\u00b0C cooling, which as previously noted, would temporarily offset no more than a decade and a half\u2019s worth of human-caused global warming. These model-based estimates are consistent with the amount of cooling that occurred during the solar minima in the LIA.\nAlthough it would have a relatively small impact on the climate, it\u2019s still an interesting question to ask whether we\u2019re headed for another quiet solar period. Zharkova thinks so. Her team created a model that tries to predict solar activity, and suggests another solar minimum will occur from 2020 to 2055. However, other solar scientists have criticized the model as being too simple, created based on just 35 years of data, and failing to accurately reproduce past solar activity.\nIlya Usoskin, head of the Oulu Cosmic Ray Station and Vice-Director of the ReSoLVE Center of Excellence in Research, published a critique of Zharkova\u2019s solar model making those points. Most importantly, the model fails in reproducing past known solar activity because Zharkova\u2019s team treats the sun as a simple, predictable system like a pendulum. In reality, the sun has more random and unpredictable (in scientific terms, \u201cstochastic\u201d) behavior:\nFor example, a perfect pendulum \u2013 if you saw a few cycles of the pendulum, you can predict its behavior. However, solar activity is known to be non-stationary process, which principally cannot be predicted (the prediction horizon for solar activity is known to be 10-15 years). Deterministic prediction cannot be made because of the essential stochastic component. \nJust imagine a very turbulent flow of water in a river rapid, and you throw a small wooden stick into water and trace it. Then you do it second time and third time ... each time the stick will end up in very different positions after the same time period. Its movement is unpredictable because of the turbulent stochastic component. This is exactly the situation with solar activity.\nLockwood agrees that we don\u2019t yet have a proven predictive theory of solar behavior. He has published research examining the range of possible solar evolutions based on past periods when the Sun was in a similar state to today, but as he puts it, \u201cthat is the best that I think we can do at the present time!\u201d\nSolar physicist Paul Charbonneau at the University of Montreal also concurred with Usoskin. He told me that while scientists are working to simulate solar activity, including using simplified models like Zharkova\u2019s, \non the standards of contemporary dynamo models theirs is extremely simple \u2014in fact borderlining simplistic ... To extrapolate such a model outside its calibration window, you need an extra, very strong hypothesis: that the physical systems underlying the magnetic field generation retain their coherence (Phase, amplitude, etc.). As my colleague Ilya Usoskin has already explained, this is very unlikely to be the case in the case of the solar activity cycle.\nZharkova believes her solar model is correct, but at best it can only try to predict when the next quiet solar period will occur. Its influence on Earth\u2019s climate is outside her expertise, and the peer-reviewed research is clear that it would be a minimal impact.\nZharkova disagrees \u2013 I contacted her, and she told me that she believes a grand solar minimum would have a much bigger cooling effect. However, she also referenced long-debunked myths about global warming on Mars and Jupiter, and made a comment about \u201cthe preachers of global warming.\u201d She\u2019s clearly passionate about her research, and has the credibility that comes with publishing peer-reviewed studies on solar activity. Perhaps these factors motivate journalists to write these frequent \u2018mini ice age\u2019 stories. \nBut Zharkova\u2019s climate science beliefs are irrelevant. While she has created a model predicting an imminent period of quiet solar activity, other scientists have identified serious flaws in the model, and in any case, research has shown that another solar minimum would only have a small and temporary impact on Earth\u2019s climate.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change-scepticism", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/sun", "https://www.theguardian.com/media/sky-news", "https://www.theguardian.com/media/dailymail", "https://www.theguardian.com/media/pressandpublishing", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Dana Nuccitelli: We can\u2019t accurately predict solar activity, and a quiet solar cycle would have a small impact on Earth\u2019s climate anyway", "date_published": {"$date": 1515495617000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627436000}, "authors": ["Dana Nuccitelli"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Climate change scepticism", "Environment", "The sun", "Climate change", "Science", "Sky News", "Daily Mail", "Media", "Newspapers & magazines"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jan/09/the-imminent-mini-ice-age-myth-is-back-and-its-still-wrong", "og:description": "Dana Nuccitelli: We can\u2019t accurately predict solar activity, and a quiet solar cycle would have a small impact on Earth\u2019s climate anyway", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/860608929b525722c036d62bbbbb1a400bce7649/0_0_5339_3204/master/5339.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=4dfbe1a6a936cf52d0b17cd979924344", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "The 'imminent mini ice age' myth is back, and it's still wrong | Dana Nuccitelli"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/860608929b525722c036d62bbbbb1a400bce7649/0_0_5339_3204/master/5339.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7803099506a2f79ff097cf7a1e0b3b24", "width": "5339", "height": "3204", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/860608929b525722c036d62bbbbb1a400bce7649/0_0_5339_3204/master/5339.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f658bb5c257623b101f4ad5ce166683d", "description": "\u2018A Frost Fair on the Thames at Temple Stairs\u2019, c1684.

In addition, melting of Greenland and West Antarctic ice (still highly uncertain as to amount), along with thermal expansion of seawater and melting of mountain glaciers and small ice caps, will cause substantial future sea-level rise, affecting densely populated coastal regions, inundating farmlands, and dislocating large populations (Melillo et al, 2014; IPPC, 2013).

But just look at the way the conversation has gone here, because I dared to say my position has shifted into neutrality (and I will go through why again below). Now I am a conspiracy theorist, a Trump support, a 'denier' (neutrality is NOT denial). What I am is a 'not surer'. Anybody who dares to offer a counter view or question anything related to climate change conclusions, is attacked. Can you imagine being a scientist in that environment?\nLet's go through this logically.\n1. Because I do believe in science as being the best way to try to arrive at material truths, I accepted AGW.2. There have been a number of failed predictions, pointing to the complexity of the earth's systems. My own observations and experiences (I am a nature freak) so observe things closely, have not aligned with the dire predictions for my local environment. Nor have they aligned with the cool summers we have had recently/are having (snow is a possibility today!). One can use one's own noggin and look at what's happening in the US to conclude that it doesn't look like the globe is warming. 3. Climate goes up and down, so these may be anomalies in a long term upward trend that will continue. I understand that, but I am, quire reasonably, suspicious of any scientific theory that says whatever the weather: hot, cold, wet, dry it's climate change caused by global warming. That is NOT how science works. Science needs a clearer prediction, not merely 'change'.4. All I have said is that if the warming trend significantly reverses as predicted by the coolists, I think it would be reasonable to discount global warming theories, which all point to increasing temperatures. 5. If the coolists theories prove wrong, then it only enhances the case for AGW.6. People are saying that the science is 'irrefutable'. NO science is irrefutable. Science is based on it being refutable. Diversity of scientific viewpoint must be permitted; that is how we get to the truth.7. There have been many instances of 'consensus' science or beliefs that have proved to be totally wrong. Think about the sugar/fat debate, or the egg/cholesterol, or the butter/margarine.8.

leader \u201cwhilst the US government looks the other way\u201d.\n\u201cAlthough China isn\u2019t necessarily intending to fill the climate leadership void left by the US withdrawal from Paris, it will certainly be very comfortable providing technology leadership and financial capacity so as to dominate fast-growing sectors such as solar energy, electric vehicles and batteries.\u201d\nThe report noted the August 2017 merger of China\u2019s top coal mining company, Shenhua Group Corp, with one of the \u201cbig five\u201d power utilities, China Guodian Corp.\nThe newly named China Energy Investment Corp created the world\u2019s largest power generator, and with the clean-energy assets of Guodian, Shenhua\u2019s growth was no longer dependent on the pursuit of coal.\n\u201c[This] strategic posture [of pursuing coal] has burdened China\u2019s power companies and limited their appetite for innovative new clean energy technologies,\u201d the IEEFA said.\nThe report also found China was \u201coutmanoeuvring other economies\u201d in securing energy commodity supplies such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, allowing them to dominate manufacturing of batteries and electric vehicles.\nOn Monday, the US federal energy regulatory commission rejected a plan by the Donald Trump-led US administration to provide subsidies for coal-fired and nuclear power plants.\nLast year the energy secretary, Rick Perry, proposed moves to slow the phasing out of the ageing plants and Trump vowed to repeal Obama-era environmental regulations in a bid to end a so-called \u201cwar on coal\u201d.\nHowever, independent analysis found the subsidies plan would cost taxpayers $10.6bn a year, and the commission on Monday said there was no evidence that retiring coal-fired power plants threatened the reliability of the nation\u2019s electricity grid.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/china", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/asia-pacific",

Every manufacturer seems to have current or future models of hybrid and full EV, while almost no-one has (IIRC) hydrogen-based models available now or announced.\nIt seems like a VHS/Betamax moment - a technically inferior solution winning because of market momentum.

They do not view it as likely that governments or private bodies can deliver the infrastructure required.Ralf Speth CEO of JLR has gone on record claiming an additional 12GW of peak capacity is likely required as rapid charging is unlikely to be \"time shiftable.\"This is one of those situations were averages are pretty much meaningless.For example there would be no need for any extra generating capacity if charging could be controlled to low demand times.......but you cannot do that without 100% dedicated parking allocation.Now can you see why these execs think fuel cells (whose hydrogen electrolysers can be time controlled with modest on site storage) at just a few filling stations are such a good idea?

However, just because Turnbull thought it up doesn't mean that it's in principle a bad idea. Despite the debacle of the NBN. Having said that, batteries respond within microseconds instead of minutes, and can be distributed around the grid rather than be concentrated in one place as Snowy 2 will be. \nFor households and small businesses the cost of storage is already below retail electricity costs, and with batteries likely to halve in cost over the next 3 years, most ppl with rooftop solar will be installing batteries. I certainly will be. The Tesla Powerwall 2 would store enough electricity to provide about 70% of the average Ozzie households' daily usage (19 kWh/day). Given that households are about 25% of total elec demand, this will be a big stabiliser for the grid, if households are given price incentives to allow their electricity supplier to access the stored electricity, or to alter electricity flows to the household based on grid demand.\nThe average electric car has (now, it may be more in future) 3 to 4 days of storage of an average household's electricity usage. EVs may act as grid stabilisers just like behind-the-meter storage, by for example being charged low rates to charge up when grid demand is low.\nBoth behind-the-meter storage and EVs will reduce the need for utility-scale storage. However, IF Snowy 2.0 is real and IF it is built for less than $10 billion it will be a big step towards a 100% renewable grid.", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "110644294", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "just turnbull thought it up", "effect": "however does n't mean that it 's in principle a bad idea"}]}, {"id": "110669680", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1515606372000}, "author": "ShanghaiGuy", "author_id": "11661511", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "because their Russian friends have built a nice selection of their own tactical nuclear weapons.

It would collapse tourism,\u201d the toxinologist from James Cook University said. \nSeymour said warmer sea temperatures behind the irukandji\u2019s drift south, and they could become a regular occurrence at Mooloolaba, and even as far south as Coolangatta on the Gold Coast. \nThe lack of forward planning on the issue is a point of frustration for Seymour, who is \u201csick of\u201d warning of the risk of the highly venomous species. \n\u201cHow many more people need to get stung before it\u2019s realised it is not just a one-off?\u201d he said. \u201cBe proactive, don\u2019t wait until it becomes a larger problem. Throw money at it now.\u201d \nThe irukandji jellyfish caught on the western side of Queensland\u2019s Fraser Island on Sunday prompted a warning for swimmers to stay out of the water.\n\u201cWe\u2019re urging everyone to stay out of the water entirely on that western side of the island while conditions are hot and humid,\u201d the Surf Life Saving Queensland regional manager, Craig Holden, said on Wednesday.\nHowever, Queensland Tourism Industry\u2019s chief executive officer, Daniel Gschwind, said there was no need for panic. \n\u201cWe want people to have a great time here and go away healthy. We are concerned about any potential risk but there is no need to be alarmed at this point,\u201d Gschwind said.\nGschwind said collaborations with Surf Life Saving Queensland allowed information on risks to be communicated quickly to swimmers. \u201cTo speak about some sort of migration is misleading or premature,\u201d he said. \nSLSQ has upgraded its stinger response with daily drags to find the jellyfish after a spate of serious stingers hit the area between late 2016 and early 2017.\nThere were 10 suspected irukandji stings on the western side of Fraser Island between 22 December 2016 and 5 January last year.\nHolden said if a person was stung a triple zero call should be made immediately and the sting area should be doused with vinegar as soon as possible.\nHe advised people to take a bottle of vinegar with them if they were heading to the island. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to cause widespread panic, but it is really important for people to exercise caution and put safety first at all times.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oceans", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gold-coast", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/animals", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Expert warns Queensland\u2019s tourism industry could face future collapse after stinger found at Fraser Island and a boy stung on sunshine coast", "date_published": {"$date": 1515555067000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627630000}, "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Queensland", "Oceans", "Australia news", "Gold Coast", "Wildlife", "Climate change", "Animals"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/10/deadly-irukandji-jellyfish-drifting-south-towards-gold-coast-as-sea-temperatures-rise", "og:description": "Expert warns Queensland\u2019s tourism industry could face future collapse after stinger found at Fraser Island and a boy stung on sunshine coast", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df3387c695ba72c81e114dcf60c78b40c28ffdce/0_21_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=f37767991065417c368094ad4250f45e", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Deadly irukandji jellyfish 'drifting south towards Gold Coast' as sea temperatures rise"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df3387c695ba72c81e114dcf60c78b40c28ffdce/0_21_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ce224e2a0262caa0908e13a7dfe5dfde", "width": "5568", "height": "3341", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df3387c695ba72c81e114dcf60c78b40c28ffdce/0_21_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=169a9c811633e95118fa8b83a20ce2a9", "description": "A marine stinger warning sign is seen at a beach in Townsville in far-north Queensland.

Currently, New York City\u2019s five pension funds have about $5bn in fossil fuel investments. New York state has already announced it is exploring how to divest from fossil fuels. \n \u201cNew York City is standing up for future generations by becoming the first major US city to divest our pension funds from fossil fuels,\u201d said Bill de Blasio, New York\u2019s mayor.\n\u201cAt the same time, we\u2019re bringing the fight against climate change straight to the fossil fuel companies that knew about its effects and intentionally misled the public to protect their profits. As climate change continues to worsen, it\u2019s up to the fossil fuel companies whose greed put us in this position to shoulder the cost of making New York safer and more resilient.\u201d\nDe Blasio said that the city is taking the five fossil fuel firms \u2013 BP, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Shell \u2013 to federal court due to their contribution to climate change.\nCourt documents state that New York has suffered from flooding and erosion due to climate change and because of looming future threats it is seeking to \u201cshift the costs of protecting the city from climate change impacts back on to the companies that have done nearly all they could to create this existential threat\u201d.\nThe court filing claims that just 100 fossil fuel producers are responsible for nearly two-thirds of all greenhouse gas emissions since the industrial revolution, with the five targeted companies the largest contributors.\nThe case will also point to evidence that firms such as Exxon knew of the impact of climate change for decades, only to downplay and even deny this in public. New York\u2019s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, is investigating Exxon over this alleged deception.\nDivestment is the opposite of investment. It's the shifting of stocks, bonds or funds from certain businesses or sectors.\nIndividual people invest in various ways to generate money, but large institutions such as cities, universities and religious organizations do this on a huge scale. Traditionally, fund managers put together investment portfolios that will provide the best returns for these institutions, regardless of where the money is invested.\nThe divestment movement, primarily consisting of climate activists, is urging private and public institutions to rid their portfolios of all oil, gas and coal stocks to send a financial and ethical message that fossil fuels are harmful and shouldn't be tolerated. So far, it's estimated that funds totalling $6tn have committed to divesting from fossil fuels.\nActivists hope this momentum will deprive fossil fuels of a social license, similar to tobacco, and help accelerate the deployment of cleaner energy, such as wind and solar.\n New York was badly rattled by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and faces costs escalating into the tens of billions of dollars in order to protect low-lying areas such as lower Manhattan and the area around JFK airport from being inundated by further severe storms fueled by rising sea levels and atmospheric warming. De Blasio\u2019s office said climate change is \u201cperhaps the toughest challenge New York City will face in the coming decades\u201d.\n New York\u2019s lawsuit echoes a similar effort on the west coast, where two California counties and a city are suing 37 fossil fuel companies for knowingly emitting dangerous levels of greenhouse gases. One of those firms, Exxon, has complained that it has been targeted by a \u201ccollection of special interests and opportunistic politicians\u201d as part of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d to force the company to comply with various political objectives.\n The legal action and the divestment draw perhaps the starkest dividing line yet between New York and the Trump administration on climate change. Under Trump, the federal government has attempted the withdraw the US from the Paris climate accords, tear up Barack Obama\u2019s signature climate policies and open up vast areas of America\u2019s land and waters to coal, oil and gas interests.\nDe Blasio and the city comptroller, Scott Stringer, have come under pressure for several years from activists to rid New York\u2019s pension funds of any link to fossil fuels, with some environmentalists claiming the city has been too slow to use its clout to tackle climate change.\nStringer admitted the divestment will be \u201ccomplex\u201d and will take some time but said the city\u2019s pension funds could promote sustainability while also protecting the retirement of teachers, police officers and other city workers.\n\u201cNew York City today becomes a capital of the fight against climate change on this planet,\u201d said Bill McKibben, co-founder of climate group 350.org.\n\u201cWith its communities exceptionally vulnerable to a rising sea, the city is showing the spirit for which it\u2019s famous \u2013 it\u2019s not pretending that working with the fossil fuel companies will somehow save the day, but instead standing up to them, in the financial markets and in court.\u201d\n Christiana Figueres, former UN climate chief and architect of the Paris climate agreement, added: \u201cThe exponential transition toward a fossil-fuel-free economy is unstoppable and local governments have a critical role to play. There is no time to lose.\n\u201cIt\u2019s therefore extremely encouraging to see NYC step up today.\u201d\nNew York joins cities such as Washington DC and Cape Town in divesting, along with universities such as Stanford in California and Oxford in the UK. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund, notable for its links to the past oil wealth of John D Rockefeller, has also sought to divest.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuel-divestment", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/exxonmobil", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/bp", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/chevron", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/royaldutchshell", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Mayor Bill de Blasio: \u2018It\u2019s up to the fossil fuel companies whose greed put us in this position to shoulder the cost of making New York safer and more resilient\u2019", "date_published": {"$date": 1515609349000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627280000}, "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "article_section": "US news", "article_tags": ["New York", "Fossil fuel divestment", "Climate change", "US news", "Environment", "Business", "ExxonMobil", "BP", "Chevron", "Royal Dutch Shell"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/10/new-york-city-plans-to-divest-5bn-from-fossil-fuels-and-sue-oil-companies", "og:description": "Mayor Bill de Blasio: \u2018It\u2019s up to the fossil fuel companies whose greed put us in this position to shoulder the cost of making New York safer and more resilient\u2019", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1521a4fc673f399ec6eb50f4d8f7bc606f7942b2/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=4cf837820b9ab16ce47b44a7e3de2264", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "New York City plans to divest $5bn from fossil fuels and sue oil companies"}, "headline": "N", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1521a4fc673f399ec6eb50f4d8f7bc606f7942b2/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e4a4aa2293d95ced9ca479a5257cf891", "width": "6000", "height": "3600", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1521a4fc673f399ec6eb50f4d8f7bc606f7942b2/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4b7f0e650fae430bfa80773ba7df2c6d", "description": "Lower Manhattan was hit by a power cut during Superstorm Sandy in 2012.\nPhotograph: Afton Almaraz/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc08255a2c3613145ed8fb2"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/10/california-mudslide-montecito-death-toll-wildfires-climate-change", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "The mud cascaded down scorched, blackened slopes still blanketed with ash. With no trees or vegetation to slow the surge it swept rocks and boulders from the Verdugo mountains into a thunderous river.\nJeannette Abney, 88, watched in horror not believing slopes could so quickly turn to sludge and so quickly surround her home in La Tuna canyon.\n\u201cOh God, the rain was terrible, terrible. Outside it was like a war zone, like Niagara Falls. It pushed my big truck 60ft across the road. It sounded like a freight train. I\u2019ve never experienced anything like that.\u201d\nAbney escaped Tuesday\u2019s mudslide in this rural corner of Los Angeles with her two dogs and spoke on Wednesday from an American Red Cross evacuation center. It offered cots, blankets, food and instant coffee. A cool breeze flapped posters declaring \u201cdisaster services\u201d.\nSwaths of southern California are in need after nature\u2019s latest battering, this time in the form of heavy rains which unleashed massive debris flows, a grim sequel to a record drought and record wildfires.\nAt least 17 people died, mostly in Montecito, a wealthy enclave north-west of LA. The avalanche buried homes and swept others from their foundations, which in addition to the dead left at least 25 people injured, 24 missing and hundreds marooned, authorities said.\nRescue crews in helicopters plucked survivors from waist-high mud, including a 14-year-old girl. \u201cI thought I was dead for a minute there,\u201d she told them.\n\u201cAll hell broke loose,\u201d Peter Hartmann, a dentist, told AP. \u201cPower lines were down, high-voltage power lines, the large aluminum poles to hold those were snapped in half. Water was flowing out of water mains and sheared-off fire hydrants.\u201d He watched rescuers revive a toddler pulled unresponsive from the muck. \u201cIt was a freaky moment to see her just covered in mud.\u201d \nThe death toll was expected to rise as search-and-rescue teams took advantage of the storm\u2019s ebbing to scour several dozen damaged and destroyed homes. \u201cRight now our assets are focused on determining if anyone is still alive in any of those structures that have been damaged,\u201d Sheriff Bill Brown of Santa Barbara county told reporters.\nThe storm \u2013 the first of the rainy season \u2013 turned devastating because huge wildfires in recent months charred mountains and canyons, leaving soil unable to efficiently absorb water.\nAuthorities anticipated the danger and issued evacuation orders in recently burned areas of Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties. Only an estimated 10 to 15% of people in a mandatory evacuation area of Santa Barbara county heeded the warning.\nI\u2019ve always been more scared of fires but now I think you have to worry more about mud \u2013 it\u2019s silent and faster\nThe harrowing consequences rekindled a perennial debate about the Golden State occupying a thin line between fortune and disaster, and the lottery of never knowing which will strike.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been dodging bullets and got lucky again,\u201d said Tom Suchner, 63, a car mechanic, as he walked his dog down Kagel canyon. \u201cIt was a nice, steady rain. It got rid of a lot of the ash.\u201d\nIn this part of the Verdugo mountains, a rugged patch of nature on LA\u2019s outskirts, residents woke up on Wednesday to marshy soil and not much worse. \nBut just a few miles away a mudflow traced a burnt ridgeline and smashed into an affluent neighbourhood lining La Tuna canyon road. \n\u201cIt was a full river, boulders floating down, hitting cars,\u201d said one resident, Diana Kalaitzian, 45. \u201cI\u2019ve always been more scared of fires but now I think you have to worry more about mud because you don\u2019t see it coming. It\u2019s silent and faster.\u201d\nHelicopters hovered as Kalaitzian stood outside her home, surveying the aftermath: sludge in every direction, a landscape overnight turned brown. Neighbours were shovelling sludge.\nAt one end of the road earth-movers were clearing lanes and imposing some order on the mud. At the other, higher up in the canyon, there was no way for cars to pass and mud-splattered police were riding mountain bikes, inspecting damage. \nKalaitzian\u2019s home escaped but she was braced for a season of anxiety. \u201cYou know there\u2019s more to come.\u201d\nCalifornia has just endured its worst and most expensive wildfire season.

I mean genuine plants to process plastic from the UK and the rest of Europe, not just depots for onward reselling as seems to have been\u00a0the case.\u00a0\nThere are initiatives to use such waste plastic in innovative ways. For example there is a small startup company in Scotland, MacRebur, developing ways to reduce the amount of toxic bitumen in asphalt by substituting a proportion of waste plastic into the mix. Surely we should urge government and private industry to build and develop plants to deal with the problem now, before we are knee-deep in bottles?Ian PaulYork\n\u2022 China\u2019s huge expansion of domestic renewables and $8bn in solar technology exports last year alone is stunning (China on track to lead in renewables as US retreats, report says, theguardian.com, 10 January). I wish we had the same level of vision and drive in the UK government and parliament to follow a similar model.\nWhile there has been welcome expansion in offshore wind, solar and onshore wind are stalling as the impact of deep subsidy cuts bite. The vacillation over tidal energy is evidence of another renewable revolution being spurned, allowing our competitors to steal a march on us. This compares markedly with an attitude of bending over backwards to assist overseas operators with billions of pounds in effective subsidy support for new nuclear projects.\u00a0It is an illogical and irrational energy policy which could drive energy bills up rather than down.\nLast year was a record one for renewable energy in the UK, with solar and wind combined producing more electricity generation than coal for 315 days of the year, but will it continue as these negative policies begin to bite? \u00a0\nWith the urgent need to decarbonise heat, and transport offering other benefits to the economy, let\u2019s see some Chinese-type ambition in all sectors of our low-carbon renewable energy industry to drive an alternative energy\u00a0revolution.Feargal DaltonConvener, Nuclear Free Local Authorities Secretariat Scotland\n\u2022 We are currently in Veganuary, where people are encouraged to abandon their carnivorous ways and eat a vegan diet for the month of January.

New York\u2019s total pension fund for its teachers, firefighters and other city workers is worth about $189bn. \nBill de Blasio, New York\u2019s mayor, also revealed the city is suing the world\u2019s largest oil and gas companies over their role in knowingly creating dangerous global warming in a two-pronged assault that he said is aimed at \u201cstanding up for future generations\u201d.\nEconomists said the status of New York as a financial and cultural giant would probably spur other cities in the US and worldwide to divest and, more significantly, build momentum in the global shift required to reduce emissions and stave off the worst consequences of climate change.\n\u201cThis is a really big deal,\u201d said Jeffrey Sachs, an economist at New York\u2019s Columbia University and special adviser to the UN secretary general. \u201cPension funds of other major US cities will follow, I think. New York is the neighborhood of the very big money managers. It\u2019s a powerful, personal signal to them that they cannot keep funding the sorts of projects they have in the past.\u201d\nDivestment is the opposite of investment. It's the shifting of stocks, bonds or funds from certain businesses or sectors.\nIndividual people invest in various ways to generate money, but large institutions such as cities, universities and religious organizations do this on a huge scale. Traditionally, fund managers put together investment portfolios that will provide the best returns for these institutions, regardless of where the money is invested.\nThe divestment movement, primarily consisting of climate activists, is urging private and public institutions to rid their portfolios of all oil, gas and coal stocks to send a financial and ethical message that fossil fuels are harmful and shouldn't be tolerated. So far, it's estimated that funds totalling $6tn have committed to divesting from fossil fuels.\nActivists hope this momentum will deprive fossil fuels of a social license, similar to tobacco, and help accelerate the deployment of cleaner energy, such as wind and solar.\nNew York will be the first of the US\u2019s largest cities to divest and has jostled to the forefront of a group of global metropolises that have committed to ridding themselves of fossil fuel stocks, including Paris, Berlin, Sydney and Stockholm.\nIn November, the Norwegian central bank, which runs the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund, proposed dumping shares in oil and gas companies. Dozens of other institutions, ranging from Oxford University to the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, have also joined a movement that activists say is worth $6tn in divestments or avoided investments.\n\u201cThe divestment movement is active and growing and by its nature, New York will play a big leadership role,\u201d said Sachs. \u201cNew York hosts Wall Street, the UN and the US media, it will now be the centre of climate action too. Even with Trump turning the keys over to the oil and gas industry, it\u2019s clear that if you make egregious decisions you won\u2019t get away with it.\u201d\nThe divestment itself will be brushed off by major fossil fuel companies but could help galvanize political action even as the Trump administration peels away environmental regulations and throws open more US land and waters to drilling and mining.\n\u201cDivestment isn\u2019t about economically punishing businesses, it\u2019s a tool of collective action that can politically isolate companies,\u201d said Paul Ferraro, an economist at John Hopkins University. \n\u201cNew York is fabulous in this respect because it\u2019s so visible and it gives others room to create change. But it will only work if everyone follows, much like how everyone has to reduce their electricity use collectively for it to have a consequence for climate change.\u201d\nNew York\u2019s move on climate isn\u2019t without its critics \u2013 environmentalists have complained about De Blasio\u2019s opposition to congestion charging for vehicles and his own frequent car trips to the gym. \nRightwing groups and business interests are also opposed. Linda Kelly, senior vice-president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said the plan was an \u201cabsurd attempt to politicize natural disasters, rather than a good-faith effort at securing meaningful change\u201d.\nThe deep divisions over climate change in US politics, along with the continued strength of major fossil fuel companies, has tempered the enthusiasm even of those in favor of divestment and action to reduce emissions.\n\u201cThe big oil and gas companies still have a long way to go and a lot of money to make,\u201d said Ferraro. \u201cWhen you look at the stock prices, it\u2019s hard to believe that fossil fuels are facing imminent doom, as predicted by various environmentalists.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Economists say city\u2019s status as financial and cultural giant means move to sever ties with fossil fuel will catalyze others in US and around the world to follow", "date_published": {"$date": 1515700687000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1530823629000}, "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "article_section": "US news", "article_tags": ["New York", "Fossil fuels", "Trump administration", "Environment", "US news", "Energy", "Business", "Economics", "Climate change"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/11/new-york-city-fossil-fuel-divestment-spur-global-movement", "og:description": "Economists say city\u2019s status as financial and cultural giant means move to sever ties with fossil fuel will catalyze others in US and around the world to follow", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e29ee2b85e0753f4bcaaee4a1aee913f5e0cac5/0_168_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=6c999af65495a4158255d857911ba135", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "'A really big deal': New York City's fossil fuel divestment could spur global shift"}, "headline": "N", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e29ee2b85e0753f4bcaaee4a1aee913f5e0cac5/0_168_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2f256866f5bc9c9b101ac6ba3853519f", "width": "2992", "height": "1795", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e29ee2b85e0753f4bcaaee4a1aee913f5e0cac5/0_168_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=edece9db47e9ddf6a9669f75baf89296", "description": "The Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges in 2012, as the effects of Hurricane Sandy were felt.\nPhotograph: KeystoneUSA-Zuma/Rex Features"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f130f0e0c7be3cf71315c2e349e7d40fcb395925/0_120_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0c44047b4cec7b0392c66480ee933dfb", "width": "3000", "height": "1800", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f130f0e0c7be3cf71315c2e349e7d40fcb395925/0_120_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e74acf809b35400c46527bc9627151ef", "description": "Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city\u2019s lawsuit against oil and gas companies aimed at \u2018standing up for future generations\u2019.

You went to those areas in 2017 and they were convinced the reef was dead. And people won\u2019t do long-haul trips when they think the reef is dead.\u201d\nMcKenzie said in 2016, tourism growth in the region had returned to pre-global financial crisis levels, before \u201cthat growth died\u201d in 2017, which he blamed on Hughes \u201cnegative comments\u201d.\nIn April 2016 Hughes made international headlines after releasing his final report on extensive aerial and underwater surveys, which showed that of the surveyed reefs (911 individual reefs), only 7% had escaped coral bleaching.\nMcKenzie said that gave the impression the reef was \u201cdead\u201d. \u201cAll driven off the back of the negative comments made by a researcher paid entirely by commonwealth funds. I think it is a misuse of commonwealth funds to make false or misleading comments to the media.\u201d\nHe has previously written to ministers Christopher Pyne and Greg Hunt over the issue and said he had spoken to Josh Frydenberg \u201cinformally\u201d.\nA spokeswoman for the Australian Research Council said the council had provided $28m over the past seven years to James Cook University to fund the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, with the funding going to the centre as a whole, not an individual.\n \u201cAll projects funded through the ARC are subject to rigorous assessment and only the highest-quality applications are funded,\u201d she said in a statement. \n\u201cThe ARC monitors all projects that it funds for the achievement of their goals.

Big polluters and their political allies are to blame. We need high-quality science more than ever so we can monitor and track what\u2019s happening to the reef.\u201d\nDarrell Wade, the executive chair of Intrepid Travel, also disputed the idea that talking about environmental problems kept tourists away.\n\u201cThe idea that conservation and tourism could be at odds on this issue is crazy,\u201d Wade said. \u201cIt\u2019s been implied that talking about the issues will have a negative impact on business \u2013 but we\u2019ve actually found that the opposite is true.\u201d\nThe latest health report from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Authority found outbreaks of crown-of-thorn starfish across the reef.\nIt noted the world heritage site has experienced \u201cmultiple significant impacts\u201d over the past two years, including \u201csevere coral bleaching, outbreaks of coral disease and crown-of-thorns starfish, and a severe tropical cyclone and subsequent flood plumes\u201d.\n\u201cThe significant heat stress experienced during summer 2016-17 \u2013 along with a warmer than average winter and spring in 2017 \u2013 means corals faced continued stress and will potentially be more susceptible to bleaching and disease in early 2018,\u201d it reported.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coral", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/marine-life", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Col McKenzie calls on government to stop funding work of Terry Hughes, saying tourists \u2018won\u2019t do long-haul trips when they think the reef is dead\u2019", "date_published": {"$date": 1515783637000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627278000}, "authors": ["Amy Remeikis"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Great Barrier Reef", "Environment", "Queensland", "Climate change", "Coral", "Australia news", "Marine life", "Science"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/13/great-barrier-reef-tourism-spokesman-attacks-scientist-over-slump-in-visitors", "og:description": "Col McKenzie calls on government to stop funding work of Terry Hughes, saying tourists \u2018won\u2019t do long-haul trips when they think the reef is dead\u2019", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9904ffc17e870a869d95cdcec6953d5f27f69bb/0_230_3464_2079/master/3464.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=6f73c3daffdf5d7471b4aedf131cc2b5", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Great Barrier Reef tourism spokesman attacks scientist over slump in visitors"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9904ffc17e870a869d95cdcec6953d5f27f69bb/0_230_3464_2079/master/3464.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=86f402f02fb8ca295f0010f61343daeb", "width": "3464", "height": "2079", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9904ffc17e870a869d95cdcec6953d5f27f69bb/0_230_3464_2079/master/3464.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4cbd8ce7a3095dc17c7aa553deeecf36", "description": "A leading scientist has been accused of exaggerating the damage to the Great Barrier Reef, which a tourism representative said had hurt the region\u2019s multibillion-dollar tourism industry.\nPhotograph: Richard Fitzpatrick"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e04a96a31b872c5b9a9244aecee425ef19816785/0_337_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7ea3636290e4dea7d74558a31cb9886c", "width": "5000", "height": "3000", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e04a96a31b872c5b9a9244aecee425ef19816785/0_337_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=56ef9eb2734fc1a454e8c494eb0ac7dd", "description": "A scientist measures coral mortality in October 2016 following bleaching on the northern Great Barrier Reef.

The proposal already has the support of several countries \u2013 including the UK \u2013 and will go before a conference of the Antarctic nations in October.\nWill McCallum, of Greenpeace\u2019s new Protect the Antarctic campaign, said: \u201cThe next few years are absolutely essential for the future of our oceans and we are in desperate need for governments to come together and do what is best for these amazing ecosystems.\u201d\nHe said a decision in 2016 to create a smaller sanctuary around the Ross Sea in the Antarctic proved global cooperation to protect the oceans is possible. \n\u201cNow we want to go one better and create the world\u2019s largest protected area. We want to create that momentum that says this is not just possible, it is inevitable if we are to protect the wildlife that call the ocean home and crucially help mitigate the worst effects of climate change.\u201d\nThe sanctuary would stop industrial-scale krill fishing in the area, which scientists say is decimating key food that many larger animals \u2013 from penguins to whales \u2013 rely on.\nNorway, China, South Korea and Russia are big players in the krill fishing industry and campaigners say the success of the proposal will depend on persuading those countries to back it.\nMcCallum said: \u201cWorld leaders shouldn\u2019t allow an ocean wilderness to be exploited by a handful of companies. In the 1980s it took a global movement to protect the Antarctic\u2019s land. Now we need to protect its oceans.\u201d\nGreenpeace are setting off on a three-month expedition of the Antarctic this week and say a quarter of a million people around the world are already signed up to support the idea. \n24 national governments and the EU are members of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources [CCAMLR], which is responsible for the conservation of Antarctic waters. It will decide on the new sanctuary proposal at a conference in Australia in October.\nJulian Gutt from the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research in Germany, which put forward the original proposal, said it would be an important moment in the fight to create a sustainable global ocean system.\n\u201cThis will bring huge benefits in protecting this amazing ecosystem, in preserving the biodiversity and ecosystem functions of the ocean and in the wider fight against climate change.\u201d\nThe seas around Antarctica are some of the most important in the world with a huge diversity of species. If successful, campaigners hope the sanctuary will build momentum towards a UN ambition to create a network of marine protected areas covering international waters.\nExperts say that, as well as protecting wildlife by allowing ecosystems to recover in and around the Antarctic, the ocean sanctuary would provide global benefits, with recovering fish populations spreading around the world, encouraging vital biodiversity and providing food security for billions of people.\nCallum Roberts, professor of marine conservation at the University of York, said the sanctuary would also play a key role in tackling climate change \u2013 soaking up huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. \n\u201cThe Antarctic is very important in locking away carbon in deep-sea sediments. There is also a very rapid rate of sinking there \u2013 it has some of the coldest waters in the world \u2026 and this sinking is one of the great pumps of the global ocean system.\u201d\nHe added that the new sanctuary would be an important step to preserving a sustainable global oceans system.\n\u201cThe Antarctic is a massively important area and you mess with it at your peril.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/antarctica", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/marine-life", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fishing", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Vast 1.8m sq km fishing-free zone would protect species, such as penguins, leopard seals and whales, and help mitigate the effects of climate change", "date_published": {"$date": 1515830460000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627618000}, "authors": ["Matthew Taylor"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Oceans", "Antarctica", "Marine life", "Climate change", "Wildlife", "Conservation", "Fishing", "Environment", "World news", "Greenhouse gas emissions"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/13/worlds-biggest-wildlife-reserve-planned-for-antarctica-in-global-campaign", "og:description": "Vast 1.8m sq km fishing-free zone would protect species, such as penguins, leopard seals and whales, and help mitigate the effects of climate change", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a36a5ce9f7da403b92cc8bdc6d81b107d8594d0b/0_341_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=87567057553a57d13591f14efeb639a6", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "World's biggest wildlife reserve planned for Antarctica in global campaign"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a36a5ce9f7da403b92cc8bdc6d81b107d8594d0b/0_341_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=95a9cfcc39e1485d0b202a255c8e383a", "width": "5120", "height": "3072", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a36a5ce9f7da403b92cc8bdc6d81b107d8594d0b/0_341_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=77f56c8d320e0d57ace5d2228d3e8b4c", "description": "An emperor penguin colony on the frozen Ross Sea, Cape Washington, Antarctica.\nPhotograph: Paul Nicklen/Getty Images/National Geographic Creative"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc0825da2c3613145ed8fb7"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/15/ford-to-invest-11bn-and-have-40-hybrid-and-fully-electric-vehicles-by-2022", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Ford Motor Co will significantly increase its planned investments in electric vehicles to $11bn by 2022 and have 40 hybrid and fully electric vehicles in its model line-up, the company\u2019s chairman, Bill Ford, said on Sunday at the Detroit auto show.\nThe investment figure is sharply higher than a previously announced target of $4.5bn by 2020, Ford executives said, and includes the costs of developing dedicated electric vehicle architectures. \nFord\u2019s engineering, research and development expenses for 2016, the last full year available, were $7.3bn, up from $6.7bn in 2015. \nFord chief Jim Hackett told investors in October the carmaker would slash $14bn in costs over the next five years and shift capital investment away from sedans and internal combustion engines to develop more trucks and electric and hybrid cars. \nOf the 40 electrified vehicles Ford plans for its global line-up by 2022, 16 will be fully electric and the rest will be plug-in hybrids, executives said. \nGeneral Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG have already outlined aggressive plans to expand their electric vehicle offerings and target consumers who want luxury, performance and an SUV body style \u2013 or all three attributes in the same vehicle.\nMainstream carmakers are reacting in part to pressure from regulators in China, Europe and California to slash carbon emissions from fossil fuels. They also are under pressure from Tesla Inc\u2019s success in creating electric sedans and SUVs that inspire would-be owners to line up outside showrooms and flood the company with orders.\nGM said last year it would add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its global line-up by 2023, financed by robust profits from traditional internal combustion engine vehicles in the US and China. \nGM\u2019s chief, Mary Barra, has promised investors the Detroit automaker will make money selling electric cars by 2021. \nVolkswagen said in November it would spend $40bn on electric cars, autonomous driving and new mobility services by the end of 2022.\nToyota is racing to commercialize a breakthrough battery technology during the first half of the 2020s with the potential to cut the cost of making electric cars. \nFord\u2019s additional investments in electric vehicles contrasted with many of the vehicle launches at the Detroit show, which featured trucks and SUVs. \nDaimler AG unveiled its new G-class SUV, a bulky off-roader.\nThe Daimler CEO, Dieter Zetsche, hinted to Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger during an exchange on stage next to the G-class that Daimler would some day have an electric version of the vehicle. \nSUVs figured in Ford\u2019s electric vehicle presentation. The automaker\u2019s president of global markets, Jim Farley, said Ford would bring a high-performance electric utility vehicle to market by 2020. \nFord\u2019s shift to the electric vehicle strategy has been more than six months in the making after Hackett replaced former CEO Mark Fields in May. \nThe plan was finalized in recent months after an extensive review, a person familiar with the process said. In October, Ford disclosed it had formed a team to accelerate global development of electric vehicles, whose mission is to \u201cthink big\u201d and \u201cmake quicker decisions\u201d.\nSome of the electric vehicles will be produced with Ford\u2019s JV in China aimed at the Chinese market. \nChina, India, France and the UK have all announced plans to phase out vehicles powered by combustion engines and fossil fuels between 2030 and 2040.

Combining such a yearning wish and incorporating today's technologies in it would surely provide a solution close to what the motor car provides and thankfully less to our ever demanding selfishness.\nJust as the vested interests of the oil industry, motor-car manufacturers and politics were some of the major instruments to the demise of our Nation's railways, so too are some these players again instrumental to the coming of the electric car.\nA final note: Karlsruhe Institute of Technology has successfully produced a pilot plant using a Pyrolose backing oven (a principle long used for reducing man-made waste materials) has produced clean coke, gas and a liquid coal from straw.

Those include Fort George , a vast fortress built near Inverness after the battle of Culloden, 800-year-old Inchcolm abbey and Inchcolm island on the Firth of Forth, and the Brough of Birsay, a Pictish and Viking-settled island in Orkney\u2019s world heritage site, threatened by sea level rises and storms.\nThe agency says those 28 places, already made fragile by their age and weathering, are at an \u201cunacceptable level of risk exposure that requires immediate mitigating action\u201d.\nAmong the 70% of its sites given an amber warning is Holyrood Park in Edinburgh which includes Arthur\u2019s Seat and Salisbury Crags, and borders the Queen\u2019s official home in Scotland, Holyrood Palace, as well as the Scottish parliament.\n The park is at very high risk of being damaged by landslides and flooding, which justify red warnings in four categories, but those threats are reduced because the park is maintained by HES\u2019s ranger service, so under the new risk register published on Monday it gets an amber .\nEdinburgh Castle has red warnings for the risk of landslide and groundwater flooding, but as it too is under constant supervision by HES, it also gets an amber rating .\nThree other world famous sites, Glasgow cathedral, the Neolithic village of Skara Brae and the Maeshowe chambered cairn on Orkney, and the Viking village of Jarlshof on the southern most tip of mainland Shetland, are also given red risk ratings. \nThey too are under constant supervision, lowering the threat level to amber, but HES officials warn that even so, protected sites could still be damaged by the far more severe weather events now being forecast.\nThe study, the first of its kind, has combined climatic data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, geological information from the British Geological Survey, and the agency\u2019s own site surveys to draw up a detailed assessment of every site. \nCombined into a single database, the surveys have confirmed evidence from numerous places that already fragile or exposed historic sites are at even greater risk from heavier flooding, coastal erosion driven by stronger storms and rising sea levels, increased winter rainfall or much drier summers. Its publication will increase pressure on other conservation bodies such as the National Trust of Scotland, which owns numerous sites at risk of extreme climate events, to step up their research. \nThe database will be constantly updated and refined, said Ewan Hyslop, the agency\u2019s head of technical research and science, particularly after far more detailed and updated UK-wide projections of climate risks are published in several months.\nHES has increased the priority it gives to climate mitigation under legislation driven through by Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, which requires public bodies to factor climate change into their activities. But even so, HES faces an 8% cut in its grant under the Scottish government\u2019s draft budget. The budget of Sepa, the Scottish agency responsible for monitoring climate change, will also be cut again.\nThe research draws on forecasts from Sepa that sea levels around Scotland will increase by between 16.5 and 28 centimetres by 2050, threatening coastal sites such as Skara Brae.\nAverage temperatures will rise by 2.8C in summer and 2.2C in winter, while average rainfall will jump by 16% in winter and fall by 13% in summer, increasing the risks of grassland and forest fires at historic sites. \nThe report notes: \u201cWater is the most destructive agent of decay. On a large scale, heavy and intense rainfall can directly lead to flooding in a short timeframe, which has the potential to cause catastrophic damage to all elements of the historic environment within reach of these potential flood zones.\u201d ", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation", "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/sea-level", "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/edinburgh", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Exclusive: Many of the country\u2019s most famous ancient sites, from Holyrood Park to the Neolithic village of Skara Brae, need urgent protection, say experts", "date_published": {"$date": 1515997848000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627276000}, "authors": ["Severin Carrell"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Conservation", "Scotland", "Sea level", "Environment", "UK news", "Edinburgh"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/15/scotlands-historic-sites-at-high-risk-from-climate-change-report-says", "og:description": "Exclusive: Many of the country\u2019s most famous ancient sites, from Holyrood Park to the Neolithic village of Skara Brae, need urgent protection, say experts", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10da97519ca1fbbc339f1bb3a7f177c40cbe6ae1/0_348_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=bd6d671f282d9079943db2826f6481c6", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Scotland's historic sites at high risk from climate change, report says"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10da97519ca1fbbc339f1bb3a7f177c40cbe6ae1/0_348_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=99dc1352f7cfabb08fc3b0d8f3cb9dc9", "width": "5616", "height": "3370", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10da97519ca1fbbc339f1bb3a7f177c40cbe6ae1/0_348_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25aafc4e8388b456efb4cf8847779fe5", "description": "Brough of Birsay, a Pictish and Norse settled island in Orkney, is threatened by sea level rise and increased storms.\nPhotograph: Alistair and Jan Campbell/UKCI/Alamy"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce3eb70946d0d8461f6296c259693918fcf71db7/0_0_4992_3328/master/4992.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f310df7da4d3cb793642c44873843e03", "width": "4992", "height": "3328", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce3eb70946d0d8461f6296c259693918fcf71db7/0_0_4992_3328/master/4992.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42720b1ca45e6e1b187f2b2a0d304249", "description": "Edinburgh Castle has been given a high risk amber warning of damage from landslides and flooding.

There has been some research connecting this refugee problem with changes to the climate. In particular, the years preceding the Syrian refugee crisis were characterized by a severe drought that reduced farm output and led to economic and social strife there.\nSeparating out the influences of climate change from general social instability may be impossible, because they are intimately linked. But we do know that climate change can cause social and economic instability. We also know that these instabilities can boil over into larger problems that lead to mass exodus. The problem isn\u2019t knowing the connection between climate and refugees exists \u2013 rather the problem is quantifying it.\nAll of this is important because we want to be able to plan for the \u201cnow\u201d as well as the \u201ctomorrow.\u201d If we are already seeing climate-related migrations, can you imagine what\u2019s in store in the next few decades as temperatures and extreme weather continue to increase?\nA very recent publication appearing in the journal Science investigates this complex subject. The paper, Asylum Applications Respond to Temperature Fluctuations, was published by Anouch Missirian and Wolfram Schlenker from Columbia University. It focused not just on Syria and the Mediterranean area, but expanded their study to be worldwide.\nThe researchers identified 103 countries that contributed to asylum applications to the European Union. Collectively, these nations submitted 350,000 applications to the EU per year. The authors combed the weather histories from these 103 source sites and explored how the weather varied in the 2000\u20132014 time period. \nThey found that when temperatures in agricultural areas and seasons at the source countries varied away from an optimal value (of about 20\u00b0C), the number of people seeking asylum increased. And the increase wasn\u2019t just proportional. They found it was nonlinear, meaning that initial increases in temperature only mildly changed the asylum application numbers. But as temperatures varied more and more, the number of seekers increased more quickly. \nAfter making this connection to observations, the authors then projected into the future. Using a collection of climate models that are able to predict Earth\u2019s future climate, the authors estimated that on a business-as-usual emissions pathway (where countries don\u2019t meaningfully reduce greenhouse gas emissions), asylum applications will increase by almost 200% by the end of the century. On the other hand, under a modest warming scenario, where humans take some meaningful action to reduce emissions, the increase falls to about 30%. Again, this shows that what humans do today to combat climate change really matters.\nWhat was also interesting is that temperature is a better metric for this problem than precipitation. I wouldn\u2019t have guessed that initially; my na\u00efve expectation would be that precipitation changes would also be very good at allowing prediction of asylum seekers. But it turns out temperature is much better. The discussion by the authors also demonstrated how many moving parts there are to this problem. Not only are the economic, climate, and social situations in the source country important, but those factors in the destination country are also critical. People migrate to where they expect better conditions.\nI spoke with the authors who told me this about their choice of using temperature as the metric for asylum applications:\nThere is an emerging literature linking various sectoral outcomes in a country to weather shocks (conflict, agricultural yields, energy demand, mortality, labor productivity, labor supply, etc.). Using temperature shocks is ideal from a statistical perspective; our statistical model is not new, but well established. \nWith much study on the topic in recent years, I wanted to know what contribution this new paper had made (that wasn\u2019t known already). They said this:\nThe significance of our paper is that we are not looking at impacts in particular countries, but spillovers in the form of asylum applications. Most economic damage assessments examine the direct impact on a country, but countries are interlinked. So even if most of the economic damages occur in developing countries, there might be repercussions for developed countries. \nThere is an existing literature on migration and refugees, but previous studies usually focus on one country at the time. We use data from all over the world (103 source countries that list asylum applications to the EU in every year 2000\u20132014) to systematically examine the relationship. We picked the European Union as destination country since it receives almost half of the asylum applications. \nReaders of this column know that I study climate change \u2013 both the rate and the future projections of what will happen. But readers also know I am very interested in the studies on impacts. We\u2019ve solved the question about how much warming is happening and who is to blame. Now, the scientific community is turning its attention to the \u201cso what?\u201d questions. Questions about how climate change impacts us and what can be done to stop or prepare for the changes. This paper takes us another step toward answering those questions.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change-scepticism", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/drought", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog"], "share_count": "0", "description": "John Abraham: Higher temperatures increase the number of people seeking asylum in the EU", "date_published": {"$date": 1516014001000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627433000}, "authors": ["John Abraham"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Climate change scepticism", "Environment", "Drought", "Refugees", "Climate change", "Science"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jan/15/study-finds-that-global-warming-exacerbates-refugee-crises", "og:description": "John Abraham: Higher temperatures increase the number of people seeking asylum in the EU", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29d20f889cda08347f5b4fe7d3f05dd89cca193f/0_52_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=f2295a7767eaffc120b67af30b822275", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Study finds that global warming exacerbates refugee crises | John Abraham"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29d20f889cda08347f5b4fe7d3f05dd89cca193f/0_52_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8873d270662e6d251b4241e2b258cd00", "width": "3852", "height": "2311", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29d20f889cda08347f5b4fe7d3f05dd89cca193f/0_52_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=adea96e5ed2773b1d7fbfbb8bbe2fd29", "description": "Farmers ride in their tractor in the drought-hit region of Hasaka in northeastern Syria on June 17, 2010.\nPhotograph: Louai Beshara/AFP/Getty Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a04b9b3bebcb60e1719ebc26590361dc7dfd11b2/0_0_396_577/master/396.png?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=143254e72ca135ae07eda48f9b9a32ac", "width": "396", "height": "577", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a04b9b3bebcb60e1719ebc26590361dc7dfd11b2/0_0_396_577/master/396.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=73fcdbebc13d68b36fc7a2310e2eb593", "description": "Study lead author Anouch Missirian."}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556127388020}, "comments": [{"id": "110905896", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516088384000}, "author": "CommunityMod", "author_id": "2902769", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Comments will close here shortly, thanks for your contributions.", "recommendation_count": "1", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "110905819", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516088205000}, "author": "Anthonyhu", "author_id": "17407909", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "A quick 30 second look at the links provide: \nBQSTART\nElevated atmospheric [CO2] can dramatically increase wheat yields in semi-arid environments and buffer against heat waves\nBQEND\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.13263/abstract\nRead and enjoy, I know using links is complicated but at least have a try.", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "110902238", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "110905489", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516087421000}, "author": "RJander", "author_id": "15758543", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Weather is chaotic.

Even insects suffered a mass extinction \u2013 the only time before or since. Entire classes of animals \u2013 like trilobites \u2013 went out like a match in the wind. \n But what\u2019s arguably most fascinating about this event \u2013 known as the Permian-Triassic extinction or more poetically, the Great Dying \u2013 is the fact that anything survived at all. Life, it seems, is so ridiculously adaptable that not only did thousands of species make it through whatever killed off nearly everything (no one knows for certain though theories abound) but, somehow, after millions of years life even recovered and went on to write new tales. \nEven as the Permian-Triassic extinction event shows the fragility of life, it also proves its resilience in the long-term. The lessons of such mass extinctions \u2013 five to date and arguably a sixth happening as I write \u2013 inform science today. Given that extinction levels are currently 1,000 (some even say 10,000) times the background rate, researchers have long worried about our current destruction of biodiversity \u2013 and what that may mean for our future Earth and ourselves.  \nIn 2009, a group of researchers identified nine global boundaries for the planet that if passed could theoretically push the Earth into an uninhabitable state for our species. These global boundaries include climate change, freshwater use, ocean acidification and, yes, biodiversity loss (among others). The group has since updated the terminology surrounding biodiversity, now calling it \u201cbiosphere integrity,\u201d but that hasn\u2019t spared it from critique.  \nA paper last year in Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution scathingly attacked the idea of any global biodiversity boundary. \n\u201cIt makes no sense that there exists a tipping point of biodiversity loss beyond which the Earth will collapse,\u201d said co-author and ecologist, Jos\u00e9 Montoya, with Paul Sabatier Univeristy in France. \u201cThere is no rationale for this.\u201d \nMontoya wrote the paper along with Ian Donohue, an ecologist at Trinity College in Ireland and Stuart Pimm, one of the world\u2019s leading experts on extinctions, with Duke University in the US. \nMontoya, Donohue and Pimm argue that there isn\u2019t evidence of a point at which loss of species leads to ecosystem collapse, globally or even locally. If the planet didn\u2019t collapse after the Permian-Triassic extinction event, it won\u2019t collapse now \u2013 though our descendants may well curse us for the damage we\u2019ve done. \nInstead, according to the researchers, every loss of species counts. But the damage is gradual and incremental, not a sudden plunge. Ecosystems, according to them, slowly degrade but never fail outright. \n\u201cOf more than 600 experiments of biodiversity effects on various functions, none showed a collapse,\u201d Montoya said. \u201cIn general, the loss of species has a detrimental effect on ecosystem functions...We progressively lose pollination services, water quality, plant biomass, and many other important functions as we lose species. But we never observe a critical level of biodiversity over which functions collapse.\u201d \nThis doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t be deeply concerned about biodiversity, according to the researchers. Instead, we should worry about every species lost and not focus on a theoretical line in the sand. \n\u201cIt is in fact the planetary boundary argument that implies that there is a lot of biodiversity that has no value. There is no problem with losing a small number of species, the argument goes,\u201d Montoya said. \u201cWe argue that even small losses of biodiversity have important consequences for ecosystem function and service provisioning.\u201d \nIn other words, extinction of species may not result in a total collapse of our ecosystems \u2013 but the more we lose, the less productive, efficient, and healthy our environment will be. And the more at risk we put ourselves. \n But, the Stockholm Resilience Centre recently published a long response to Montoya\u2019s paper in the usual way of scientific sparring \u2013 publications going back and forth like boxers exchanging blows. \n Johan Rockstr\u00f6m the executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre and one of the leading researchers on planetary boundaries, said that Montoya\u2019s critique didn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny because its authors misunderstood the definitions built around the \u201cbiosphere integrity planetary boundary.\u201d \nRockstr\u00f6m agrees that there is no evidence of a planetary tipping point when it comes to biodiversity. According to Rockstr\u00f6m, biodiversity decline does not have a hard planetary boundary like, say, climate change. Instead he describes biodiversity as a variable that operates \u201cunder the hood of the planetary system\u201d because it influences the stability of our climate, ozone layer and oceans \u2013 all of which Rockstr\u00f6m contends have very clear planetary boundaries. \n\u201cWe have never suggested a planetary scale biodiversity tipping point...\u201d Rockstr\u00f6m said. \u201cInstead, the rational for biodiversity as a planetary boundary is that the composition of trees, plants, microbes in soils, phytoplankton in oceans, top predators in ecosystems\u2026together constitute a fundamental core contributor to regulating the state of the planet.\u201d \nAccording to Rockstr\u00f6m, biodiversity is one of the pillars supporting our planet \u2013 and if too much biodiversity is lost we risk \u201ctriggering a tipping point\u201d in our climate or oceans, which in turn could risk pushing the planet into a new state.\n\u201cWithout biodiversity, no ecosystems. No ecosystems, no biomes. No biomes, no living regulator of all the cycles of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and water,\u201d he added.  \nRockstr\u00f6m says biodiversity loss could risk the \u201csafe operating space\u201d for humans, leaving us in an alien world increasingly hostile to our own survival. For example, life would still survive under apocalyptic climate change \u2013 but we may not. \nWhile ecosystems may not fully collapse, scientists have found that some ecosystems can undergo what they are called \u201cregime shifts.\u201d Coral reefs, overheated by climate change, will shift to a much less productive, much less biodiverse algae-based ecosystem. Climate change, or alternatively humans with chainsaws and fire, can shift forest ecosystems to grasslands. While none of these ecosystems may wholly collapse, they will look nothing like they did after the shift occurs. \nMontoya admits that such regime shifts \u201cdo actually happen\u201d and is \u201cwell established\u201d for some ecosystems \u2013 like forests, coral reefs and Arctic sea ice \u2013 though \u201cunclear\u201d if it happens in all ecosystems or only a few.  \nAnd he adds, perhaps most importantly, that \u201cthe mechanisms [of regime shifts] have nothing to do with biodiversity loss.\u201d Instead, they have been driven by climate change or human actions \u2013 such as clear-cutting. \n It may be that unclear or shifting definitions are at the root of the dispute.  \n\u201cFatally, the boundaries framework lacks clear definitions, or it has too many conflicting definitions, does not specify units, and fails to define terms operationally, thus prohibiting application by those who set policy,\u201d Montoya, Donohut and Pimm write in the paper.\n But Rockstr\u00f6m contends that when understood correctly the planetary boundary framework holds up to scientific scrutiny. He says planetary boundaries do not mean that humanity can just destroy and upend all the way up to a red line without consequences. \n \u201cThis is of course just nonsense,\u201d he noted, arguing that the planetary boundary for biosphere integrity is magnitudes more ambitious than the Aichi Targets from the Convention on Biological Diversity, an international agreement set on preserving biodiversity \u2013 though already several goals have not been met.\n \u201cIf the world is able to reduce biodiversity loss below the planetary boundary this would not only require major conservation efforts across the world,\u201d he said, adding that \u201conce inside the safe operating space, we would of course have to continue on a sustainable pathway.\u201d\nRockstr\u00f6m said that he believes the disputing researchers have much more in common than their infighting would imply.  \n\u201cWe are [all] working to safeguard biodiversity for sustainable development. We are [all] in the same camp. Complementing each other, they at the ecosystem level, us at the planetary level.\u201d \nBut Montoya and his group stand by their criticism and are working on a second paper responding to Rockstr\u00f6m and his team.  \nWhile Montoya\u2019s paper does not critique the other eight planetary boundaries in their paper, Montoya told me that each of the boundaries \u2013 even the physical ones \u2013 have faced \u201ca lot of controversy.\u201d \n\u201cThey all suffer from the tipping-point problem,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich we argue promotes a business-as-usual ethos and distracts us from taking the action that is urgently needed.\u201d\n In many ways one could argue that the planetary boundary is an easy and simple way to explain environmental impacts to world leaders \u2013 few of whom have any education on ecology or the environment \u2013 and the public. \n But Montoya argues that the planetary boundaries concept is doing more harm than good.  \n\u201cPoor or ill-founded science ultimately brings about ineffectual policies at best \u2013 and potentially highly damaging ones \u2013 and erodes trust in scientists,\u201d he said.  And this can have real world impacts: Montoya and colleagues point to forest policy in Europe as one example. \n\u201cThe assumption that there is a critical biodiversity level below which forest functioning will collapse prompted managers [to] plant resilient tree species to climate change, pests, and disease,\u201d Montoya explained, adding, \u201cthis was recommended to avoid reaching a tipping point in forest service provisioning, primarily timber production.\u201d But the recommendations have resulted in endangered old growth forests and native species, according to Montoya. \nWhile the on-going debate over planetary boundaries is deeply academic and wonky, it is not without importance to the public. How we communicate environmental crises \u2013 and the accuracy of the science that underpins that communication \u2013 proves more important with every passing year, as the world walks into climate and ecological uncertainty.  \nYes, life itself survived the Permian-Triassic mass extinction event \u2013 but most species did not. Believe me, humans probably wouldn\u2019t have survived the tens-of-millions of years that followed the Great Dying: oxygen levels were dangerously low, food would have been scarce, and the world would have looked largely barren and wasted even as some species and ecosystems managed to survive. Outside the moral dilemma of extinction, there is no question that if humans push more-and-more species into oblivion there will be impacts on our society \u2013 and they could become catastrophic. \n Humans evolved 248 million years later in an Earth that was far more biodiverse and rich, a kind of Eden of abundance and diversity. But our current actions risk all that \u2013 and perhaps ourselves.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/biodiversity", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/biology", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/extinct-wildlife", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change"], "share_count": "0", "description": "We are destroying the world\u2019s biodiversity.

Egrets are a good example - they are colonising in response to changing climate (and in the case of the egret it is quite likely they used to be here anyway and it is habitat restoration of the broads, fens and Sommerset levels that are enticing them back coupled with climate change)\nThe specific species you mention (hare, horse chestnut etc) in the UK are less of an issue precisely because they are actually part of the same biogepgraphic region (the UK is part of the northwestern europe bioregion) so the shared 'ancestry' of the ecosystem is more recent.

You can't tell in advance which species will be invasive so you should start with the rule 'if it's not a native species it should be prevented' Again parakeets are different to egrets (hence the fact they are colonising much faster and with more negative impacts) because they haven't moved in relation to changing climate but have been introduced by people thousands of miles away from where they evolved (like American mink)\nObviously you can't stop all of them but we should be working to reduce new ones (again this is different to range changes due to climate change) and remove 9or limit) the ones that we already have.", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "110923623", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "the change in climate", "effect": "who are struggling"}, {"cause": "precisely they are actually part of the same biogepgraphic region", "effect": "the uk is part of the northwestern europe bioregion so the shared ancestry is"}, {"cause": "they have n't moved in relation to changing climate but have been introduced by people thousands of miles away from where they evolved", "effect": "if it 's not a native species it should be prevented again parakeets are different to egrets"}]}, {"id": "110923879", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516108934000}, "author": "JonathanHughes", "author_id": "12031469", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "I agree, it does seem a little odd for conservationists to be arguing about this (although in fairness it is a genuine academic difference).

But pollution from the industry is expected to increase and, by 2050, use up a quarter of the allowable greenhouse gas emissions if the world is to keep global warming at less than 1.5C \u2013 the world\u2019s \u201ccarbon budget\u201d.\nWhile Hainan and ANA tied as the most fuel-efficient airlines, they used different strategies to achieve the relatively low fuel burn.\nHainan Airways, a Chinese carrier, employed more fuel-efficient aircraft, using the Boeing 787 Dreamliner for more than 80% of its flights, and the Airbus A330 for the remainder. It also avoided having excessive empty seats, further increasing its efficiency.\nMeanwhile, the Japanese airline ANA achieved the low fuel-burn by carrying a lot of cargo, which the analysis treated as equivalent to carrying people.\nIn contrast, Qantas used the two most fuel-intensive aircraft \u2013 Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-400ER \u2013 and carried the most empty seats of any transpacific airline, filling just 74% of its seats.\nComparing all the airlines, ICCT found that how much freight an airline carried was the strongest determinant of its fuel efficiency, explaining 48% of the variation between airlines. Seating density, aircraft efficiency and passenger load were the other major factors.\nLooking at specific routes, the analysis found Delta was the most fuel-efficient airline on the Sydney-Los Angeles route, flying a passenger 33km on a litre of fuel. Virgin Australia and United were not far behind on 32km, while Qantas lagged on just 24km.\nThe most competitive transpacific route was Los Angeles-Tokyo, with six airlines flying between the two hubs. On that route United was the most fuel-efficient, taking a passenger 42km on a litre of fuel. Singapore Airlines was the least fuel-efficient, taking a passenger just 26km on a litre of fuel.\nThe report notes that Qantas is planning on using eight new Dreamliners for flights to the US, which, if operating now, would lift the airline one place from the bottom, above Korean Air and tying with Asiana in the second-bottom place.\nThe results follow an earlier analysis ICCT conducted on the efficiency of airlines on transatlantic routes in 2015, which found a significant but smaller variation between airlines than was found on Pacific routes.\nIn that report, British Airways and Lufthansa were found to have emitted 51% more carbon dioxide than the cleanest flyers, Norwegian Air.\n\u201cThis research shows that there are a variety of ways that international airlines can reduce fuel use and carbon emissions,\u201d said Brandon Graver from ICCT, the lead author of the study. \u201cBuying new aircraft, carrying large numbers of passengers and optimising freight strategies all make a difference.\u201d\nDan Rutherford, ICCT\u2019s aviation program director and co-author of the paper, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a reason airlines around the world are starting to avoid very large aircraft like the 747 and A380.\n\u201cNewer twin-engine widebodies provide the payload and range capabilities needed for transpacific flights with much lower fuel burn.\u201d\nAlan Milne, head of fuel and environment at Qantas told the Guardian that the airline ranks low in the analysis because it uses large aircraft, flies long distances and has premium cabins that leave more space between passengers. \n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to reducing carbon emissions and continually look at ways to lower them across our operations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are switching our 747s for more fuel-efficient Dreamliners and we have several data-driven programs in place to reduce fuel burn.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/business/theairlineindustry", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/business-australia", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "For each kilometre Qantas transports a passenger across Pacific, it uses 64% more fuel than two most fuel-efficient airlines", "date_published": {"$date": 1516122030000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627431000}, "authors": ["Michael Slezak"], "article_section": "Business", "article_tags": ["Qantas", "Airline industry", "Business (Australia)", "Environment", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Australia news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/17/qantas-worst-airline-operating-across-pacific-for-co2-emissions-analysis-reveals", "og:description": "For each kilometre Qantas transports a passenger across Pacific, it uses 64% more fuel than two most fuel-efficient airlines", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7762a99607f22cf6422e2eea44cd3290ade1c490/0_65_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=c438c72f5060743da6fba3d80027a8d8", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Qantas worst airline operating across Pacific for CO2 emissions, analysis reveals"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "O", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7762a99607f22cf6422e2eea44cd3290ade1c490/0_65_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a831c396dad48736fe0e26e0f181777b", "width": "3000", "height": "1800", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7762a99607f22cf6422e2eea44cd3290ade1c490/0_65_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8ec45adb2245b4cc474f7fb6622391a8", "description": "For each kilometre Qantas transports a passenger across the Pacific, it uses 64% more fuel than the two most fuel-efficient airlines, an analysis says.\nPhotograph: Matthew Lloyd/Getty Images"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556127390378}, "comments": [{"id": "111051563", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516360601000}, "author": "Walsunda", "author_id": "12483673", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Note I agree complete with your comments to Robwash regarding his attitude Al Gore.

Global warming is a terrible idea at the rate we have seen it since the 19th century. What is very amusing is that you don't understand that an optimum temperature can mean that temperatures both above and below that optimal level create problems, in the same way as a sub-optimal calorie intake can result in unhealthy weight loss and death as occurred in the potato famine while supra-optimal calorie intake can result in obesity and a consequent fear of ramps.  I may have been better for the starving Irish to migrate to where it was warm in the mid 19th century - at least there was food there, even if there was also skin cancers for Irish skins - but 170 years later the globe has warmed and it's no longer a smart idea. But Ireland has not escaped unscathed from the effects of that global warming. While the denizens of Galway got excited by a 10 degree spring day the other year, the last time I was in the Emerald Isle, in early spring, the flattening of the northern high latitude temperature gradient by global warming has produced an Arctic blast with snow in the country where my protestant and my partners catholic ancestors had starved together and a blizzard that blew in killing the gamboling spring lambs, hours after we flew out of Belfast.\n\"Rofl\" is, I understand, an acronym for \"rolling on floor laughing\". If you find the starvation of people due to sub-optimal and supra-optimal temperatures to simply be \"Too funny\", that says a lot about your morality.

However, the CCC also praised Theresa May\u2019s government for putting green growth at the centre of the nation\u2019s economic strategy for the first time when it published its Clean Growth Strategy (CGS) in October.\n\u201cThere has been a very fundamental change of stance,\u201d said Lord Deben, chair of the CCC. \u201cBut that, of course, doesn\u2019t mean there is not a very great deal more to do. There is a real pressure and urgency.\u201d \nDeben said the CCC analysis released on Wednesday was the best-case scenario and had assumed ministers will deliver all the carbon cuts pledged so far. \u201cWe have given every benefit of the doubt,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even if they do all the things they say they are going to do, to the maximum, there will still be a gap.\u201d\nThe CCC\u2019s independent assessment of the CGS analyses whether it puts the UK on course to meet its legally mandated carbon cuts in 2025 and 2030, and charts the most cost-effective path to an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050. The UK has already cut greenhouse gas emissions by 42% since 1990 and is close to phasing out coal, but it is not on track to meet the future targets, the CCC found.\nThe CCC highlighted a series of government pledges that have little or no detail on how they will be delivered, including giving all homes a good level of energy efficiency by 2035. Deben also attacked large housebuilding companies for not doing enough.\n\u201cIf Persimmon had spent the \u00a3110m bonus it has given to its chief executive [Jeff Fairburn] on the 18,000 houses it has built this last year, it could have saved very significantly the energy bills of everybody who bought a house and contributed significantly to emissions reduction,\u201d he said.\nAlso highlighted was the critical need to roll out carbon capture and storage plants (CCS) by the 2030s, to trap and bury emissions from fossil fuel plants. \u201cWe cannot underline more strongly that without CCS, meeting our statutory targets will cost a great deal more,\u201d Deben said. \u201cCCS is essential.\u201d \nThe UK\u2019s North Sea is seen as a perfect place for CCS development but former chancellor George Osborne killed a \u00a31bn programme in 2015. Since then only \u00a3100m has been pledged in its place, a sum \u201cnot commensurate with its importance\u201d according to the CCC. \nBut Deben also said oil and gas companies have not stepped up to develop CCS: \u201cIf you want to argue [against fossil fuel divestment campaigns], you have got to show you are taking really seriously the move away from fossil fuels. It is very dangerous for the industry not to take this very much more seriously.\u201d\nGaps in government policies identified by the CCC include a clear plan to drive up sales of electric cars to the upper end of its goal of 40-70% of all cars by 2030 and to approach 100% by 2035. Another is the need to plant 70,000 hectares of trees by 2025 \u2013 it would take a century to achieve that at current rates.\nThe CCC also warned that relying on new nuclear plants for low-carbon electricity carried risks. \u201cNuclear has a history of not delivering on time or on budget,\u201d said Deben. Any new nuclear plants after Hinkley \u201cwould have to come in at a much, much reduced cost\u201d, given the very low cost offshore wind now offers, CCC officials said.\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cThe UK has reduced emissions per person faster than any other G7 nation and our CGS is the next ambitious milestone. But we have always said it is only the start of a process.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/travel-and-transport", "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Vague ambitions, such as banning new petrol cars by 2040, must be turned into solid plans, says the Committee on Climate Change", "date_published": {"$date": 1516168905000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627431000}, "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Environment", "Green politics", "Travel and transport", "Conservatives", "Politics", "UK news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/17/uk-to-miss-legal-climate-targets-without-urgent-action-official-advisers-warn", "og:description": "Vague ambitions, such as banning new petrol cars by 2040, must be turned into solid plans, says the Committee on Climate Change", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af30dbb1a2391bf2d9a830b38194dd315de1d57c/0_128_4764_2859/master/4764.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=debfddb7bec8442560577cdccca8178b", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "UK to miss legal climate targets without urgent action, official advisers warn"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af30dbb1a2391bf2d9a830b38194dd315de1d57c/0_128_4764_2859/master/4764.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=acc31b09ee084d266906d6ace9ad7b88", "width": "4764", "height": "2859", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af30dbb1a2391bf2d9a830b38194dd315de1d57c/0_128_4764_2859/master/4764.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f1a34ed5025dbe346e11d8c25cb557fa", "description": "A series of government pledges have little or no detail on how they will be delivered, the Committee on Climate Change said.\nPhotograph: Marcin Rogozinski/Alamy"}}], "comments": [{"id": "110971190", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516196684000}, "author": "Mary1952", "author_id": "18404292", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "The new trains will still run on diesel then?", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "110961662", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "110971150", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516196641000}, "author": "Mary1952", "author_id": "18404292", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "I agree - the prob. is what to do about it now ....", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "110962481", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "110971094", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516196593000}, "author": "Mary1952", "author_id": "18404292", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Ignore it at their peril perhaps?", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "110964206", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "111071286", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516388857000}, "author": "funkymentalist", "author_id": "12717079", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "No answer.

However, I believe it was the case that Kings found that some 70% of the woodburning particles came from houses using open fires and that the woodburning stoves part of the story was to some extent a handy headline hook. I believe the report also said that a large part of the problem was what was actually being burnt on the fires and in the stoves - many people were using wood that was wet, had been painted or treated in other preservative ways, and that coal was still being used in many fires. I can see there is a problem here as many city-dwellers don't have places to store and dry wood in any quantity whilst suitably dried, to 20% moisture content, can be expensive to purchase in small quantities. Much easier to buy whatever is available from your local provider or gather it from skips and building sites and who has a moisture meter? I can see in the local ironmongers around me supplies of coal and kindling wood and the adverts for re-claimed wood so there is definitely a market.

It's great in summer. It's trivial to use batteries for daily shifting to cover 24 hours. But moving solar from summer to winter is 150 times as hard/expensive. You can't do it with batteries, you can't do it with hydro. I have not seen any 100% renewables plans which actually add up for the UK. You can do something like 90% renewable 10% gas, but it's a lot more expensive than a nuclear+gas solution and has much higher emissions.\nAny plan for the UK which will work and be reasonably affordable currently requires some nuclear as well as a lot more wind than solar. Power2gas may well prove to be the best way to deal with the storage issues, because gas is easy to store, even if it is energy-intensive to make, but that remains to be seen.\nThis is an excellent overview of an actually calculated half-hourly UK supply using real weather data, comparing mostly nuclear and mostly renewables to show the extremes (what we will actually get is somewhere in-between).

It is not regarded as a predictive science - basically because of humans. \nIf anyone doubt this - look at the prognosis a week before the US election/Brexit. \nOn the other side ask a sharp-shooter in the military - about what Newton and fluid dynamics can do for their precision. Or ask NASA lobbing a ton of metal in the general direction of Pluto - or measure the isotopes of oxygen in a shell or ice and other useful stuff - it is rather predictable. \nEven the extremely complex science of medisin can also with quite good predictability estimate the outcome of trying to jump off an aircraft without a parachute - by combining a bit of physics and what is known about the human body. \nAs such - estimation of global temperature effects from changes to a planet's atmosphere was figured out in the 19th century - from theory alone. Long before anyone thought about humans actually go global-scale crazy on emitting the stuff. \nSure - to get this number correct to the second decimal is difficult - but to get it right to the nearest degree - now that can be done - even with a century-scale horizon. \nAnybody think that they know who will win the election in 2100? No (unless they have some pretty good tea-leafs). \nThis being declared give a good opportunity to explain why different estimates of temperature in 2100 gives such a \"wide\" range of results: \nHumans comes into play. Because it is based on emission scenarios. \nTheoretically one could have zero cost cold fusion in 2035 - in a year pushing CO2 emissions to zero, for example. This would make the \"Business as usual\" projections wrong in 2100 - because they are based on energy generation is made as it has been. \nThis is why everyone who follow climate change is aware of RCP8.5, 6, 4 and 2.6 (if one follow it closer one is aware of many more). \nThese scenarios are not made by physics. They are made by experts of energy, political and social scientists, etc. \nThen they are fed into the physics - being calculated on the biggest computers in the world. \nOne could not predict that the US choose to elect people with outspoken ambition to radically increase emissions of course. So climate models are slaved to human randomness/counter-political nature. On the other hand - nobody guessed that China and India is over-performing either. \nDeniers like to use this confusion a lot. For example - Hansen 1981(1988 had scenario A, B and C - and deniers like to compare what happened since then with the historically unrealistic \"high emission scenario\" - instead of the scenario that best described what happen - and make a lot of noise about \"alarmism\". \nOf course - educated and non-educated political and ideological agents does this - not even understanding why they buy it - and if they do understand it - keep it quiet. \nThis, in my meaning is why Paris should not be about a 2 degree target. It should be about atmospheric CO2e loading. In other words - 500 ppm max. That is a realistic total equivalent budget. \nPer how we do things now - it means not a molecule emitted after c. 2050. If we do better we can stretch emissions a bit longer and make the crash into the wall a bit softer. \nIt is not computer models that define our future.

It is not even doing position papers on what it would take to do it.\nAnd the reason for this is that the changes, and the investment, which would be required to do it are so huge and so politically suicidal that successive governments of both the big parties have decided to quietly ignore the issue.\nThe LibDems did at one conference a few years ago announce they were going to ban cars, and then quickly became very quiet about it, and it sank without trace.\nWe have a very curious phenomenon.

To save the planet.\nOn the other hand, when confronted with the fact that the Chinese, Indians and developing world generally are both emitting far more and raising their emissions with it, the activists resort to obfuscation or denial.\nThey claim the Chinese are installing wind and solar. Yes, they are, and they are not loweriing their emissions. They claim they emitted less than us in 1900. Yes, they did, but its irrelevant, they are not lowering their emissions. This amounts to the argument that its only fair that they should destroy civilisation. They claim that they are only emitting in order to export. So what? They are not lowering their emissions, they are emitting. At twice the rate of the US. They claim also that their per capita emissions are low. Well, no they are not, they are a bit over EU levels now. But it makes no difference, all that matters is to lower the tonnage emitted, and they are not doing that.\nIf anyone is destroying civilisation with emissions at the moment, its the Chinese, and people need to get out of denial on this.\nAs you watch these endless twists and turns, it becomes clear that the activists, here and elsewhere, have no interest in reducing global emissions. It also becomes clear that no-one outside of a tiny number in the EU, Australia + NZ and North America believes that catastrophic warming is a reality.\nWhat the activists here really want and are agitating for is that the EU and the US should dismantle their industry in order to lower their emissions, while the rest of the world carries on industrializing, driving, and increasing theirs.\nNow, ask yourself why they would want this.

It\u2019s in line with his boss\u2019 recent ignorant tweet suggesting that \u201cPerhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming.\u201d \nI spoke with a number of climate scientists who agreed that to minimize the risks associated with rapid human-caused climate change, from a practical standpoint the \u2018ideal temperature\u2019 is as close to the current one as possible.\nStefan Rahmstorf, Head of Earth System Analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research pointed out that we\u2019re not concerned about specific temperatures; it\u2019s rapid temperature changes that cause problems:\nPruitt of course is trying to have a strawman debate, distracting from the fact that not a certain temperature as such is better or worse, but that a change from what we are adapted to is a problem, especially a very rapid change - in either direction, cooling or warming, this causes big disruption. \nWe should not stray too far away from what we and the currently existing ecosystems have evolved for. That is the optimum, simply because it is what we\u2019re highly adapted to, and any major change is going to be very painful.\nTexas Tech\u2019s Katharine Hayhoe agreed, noting that human civilization has developed in the relatively stable climate of the past 10,000 years.\nThere is no one perfect temperature for the earth, but there is for us humans, and that\u2019s the temperature we\u2019ve had over the last few thousands of years when we built our civilization, agriculture, economy, and infrastructure. Global average temperature over the last few millennia has fluctuated by a few tenths of degrees; today, it\u2019s risen by nearly 1\u00b0C and counting.Why do we care? Because we are perfectly adapted to our current conditions. Two-thirds of the world\u2019s largest cities are located within a metre of sea level. What happens when sea level rises a metre or more, as it\u2019s likely to this century? We can\u2019t pick up Shanghai or London or New York and move them. Most of our arable land is already carefully allocated and farmed. \nWhat happens when we can no longer grow the crops we used to, as climate shifts and water becomes more scarce in many subtropical areas? We can\u2019t just take over new land: someone else already owns it. What happens when our water resources diminish or even run out? We can\u2019t take over someone else\u2019s water rights without a war.We care about a changing climate because it exacerbates the risks we face today, and threatens the resources we depend on for our future.\nIn fact, Hayhoe specifically answered this question in one of her \u2018Global Weirding\u2019 videos for PBS:\nMichael Mann, Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science at Penn State also pointed out that we\u2019re approaching some critical temperature thresholds. For example, his research has shown that at warmer temperatures, reproduction of malaria-transmitting parasites increases rapidly.\nThere are some absolute temperature thresholds that are important when it comes to agriculture (particularly in tropics), coral bleaching, infectious disease, and heat stress (e.g. the tropics becoming essentially unlivable).\nSo while it\u2019s difficult to say what the \u201cideal temperature\u201d is, there clearly is a range of temperatures suitable for human civilization and there is a real danger that we\u2019re pushing toward the upper limit of that range.\nNaomi Oreskes, Professor of the History of Science and Affiliated Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard similarly noted that according to the peer-reviewed literature on climate change impacts, we\u2019re already headed into dangerous territory:\nOf course, there is no \u2018ideal\u2019 temperature so we should not accept that framing. We have strong scientific evidence that anything above 2\u00b0C is likely to be deeply problematic. Even the roughly 1\u00b0C change we have already seen is having measurable, adverse effects.\nThat\u2019s why with the Paris climate accords, every country in the world except the USA has agreed to try and limit global warming to no more than 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial temperatures, and preferably closer to 1.5\u00b0C. The targets would be even more aggressive if possible, but as Oreskes noted, we\u2019ve already caused 1\u00b0C of global warming, and transitioning away from fossil fuels will take time. From a practical standpoint, 2\u00b0C is the best we can plausibly achieve.\nWhen speaking with the scientific experts it quickly becomes clear that the ideal response to climate change involves a rapid transition away from fossil fuels. Global temperatures are already warming at a rate more than 20 times faster than Earth\u2019s fastest natural climate changes. It\u2019s that rapid rate of global warming that poses an existential threat. Species can only adapt so quickly. The longer we wait to slow that dangerously fast climate change, the worse the consequences will be.\nUnfortunately, the Trump Administration is doing everything it can to delay and weaken efforts to cut carbon pollution. Pruitt isn\u2019t interested in these scientific answers to his question; he\u2019s interested in helping his fossil fuel industry benefactors. He\u2019s one of Oreskes\u2019 Merchants of Doubt, but his time in power will be as finite as Donald Trump\u2019s.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change-scepticism", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Dana Nuccitelli: In short, from a practical standpoint, as little additional warming as possible", "date_published": {"$date": 1516186851000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627275000}, "authors": ["Dana Nuccitelli"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Climate change scepticism", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Paris climate agreement", "Environment", "COP 21: UN climate change conference | Paris", "Climate change", "Science", "Donald Trump"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jan/17/scott-pruitt-insincerely-asked-whats-earths-ideal-temperature-scientists-answer", "og:description": "Dana Nuccitelli: In short, from a practical standpoint, as little additional warming as possible", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6126803a963bcbd15f38aa20bf9c788242aa869e/0_26_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=3b904d3572d3a0b2cd7d49bd08f7d318", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Scott Pruitt insincerely asked what's Earth's ideal temperature.

Soil horizons in sedimentary rocks such as can be seen in the Tamala aeolian calcarenite of the Western Australian coast from Shark Bay to Albany are the product of several thousand years.\nAgriculture also needs reliable rainfall.

There is no inferred ideal global temperature but simply a sensible temperature to grow crops and maintain our ecosystems as best we can.\nHuman activities in the form of fossil fuel combustion is the cause of the warming which would if continued take away from optimal agricultural conditions.

We examined trends 1980 -2012 in break-up and freeze-up dates within the entire SH management unit and within smaller coastal break-up and freeze-up zones. We examined trends in body condition for 900 bears captured during 1984-86, 2000-2005, and 2007-2009 and hypothesised that body condition could be correlated with duration of sea ice. The ice-free season in SH increased by 30 days from 1980-2012. Body condition declined in all age and sex classes, but the decline was less for cubs than for other social classes. If trends towards a longer ice-free season continue in the future, further declines in body condition and survival rates are likely, and ultimately declines in abundance will occur in the SH subpopulation.\"", "recommendation_count": "3", "in_reply_to": "111190825", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "advances in break up", "effect": "longer ice free seasons"}]}, {"id": "111192547", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516688737000}, "author": "Walsunda", "author_id": "12483673", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\"The Alarmists have picked all sorts of emotive examples in order to focus public attention and alarm (Polar Bears; Bangladesh; the Marshall Islands; New Orleans & Eastern Seaboard USA; agricultural productivity; melting ice at the poles; the Great Barrier Reef; etc) most of which are highly questionable and some (eg.

China, on the other hand, is praised for its wind and solar (which are at trivial levels), and gets no criticism for its huge current coal consumption, the extent to which this has grown in recent years (and is likely to continue to do so, because they are mendacious, and because actions speak louder than words - building more than 500 new coal fired power stations), and yet China comes in for no criticism.\nUtterly amazing. And you reckon this is \"fair\". \nWhether or not this is the \"best that we can do\", the pressure should be coming on China to dramatically improve its performance. \nBut no. The activists protest in Australia, and whinge about new coal mines here. And not a word about China. And, interestingly, the activists seem to be failing to go to China to protest there.

If the objective measure of ideality were the maximisation of biomass, then we should perhaps be looking for a warmer, wetter world with ice-free poles, an additional available continent, huge potential agricultural area in Siberia and Greenland, and more rain on the Sahara and other dry deserts.\nThe only characteristics of \"ideality\" inferred in this article are : \u2022 something close to current conditions\u2022 no contribution from human activity\nThis is pretty intellectually bankrupt reasoning.

This metric of variability can also be calculated from observational records of global warming which enables tighter constraints to be placed on ECS, reducing the probability of ECS being less than 1.5 degrees Celsius to less than 3 per cent, and the probability of ECS exceeding 4.5 degrees Celsius to less than 1 per cent.\"", "recommendation_count": "7", "in_reply_to": "111039873", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "111120114", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516540663000}, "author": "James Holland", "author_id": "18387395", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "So just to clarify, Croz;You are simultaneously accusing ID2310987 of being a conspiracy theorist for questioning a commenter's identity AND suggesting he/she is a Chinese astroturfer?", "recommendation_count": "7", "in_reply_to": "111117080", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "111142037", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516603454000}, "author": "James Holland", "author_id": "18387395", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "When you \"had enough\" of whining when anybody \"dares to disagree with you\", or defending such \"on-topic\" subjects as 'why the great Donald Trump will make you cry', \"you might try the novel approach\" of actually trying to explain what this airy concept of an \"ideal temperature\" actually means, since you appear to be the only one here who knows.", "recommendation_count": "7", "in_reply_to": "111139961", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "111119393", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516539492000}, "author": "John Samuel", "author_id": "13496713", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Stable is best.\nYou knew that and thought hurling around accusations might deflect.", "recommendation_count": "14", "in_reply_to": "111103883", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "111141961", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516603142000}, "author": "James Holland", "author_id": "18387395", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\"If only you guys could stick to science\"And yet you've just been defending someone who's only posts were about Donald Trump's election prospects, when others declared such puffery as off-topic.Not one for intellectual consistency, are you Croz?", "recommendation_count": "8", "in_reply_to": "111139753", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "111140710", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516596846000}, "author": "Walsunda", "author_id": "12483673", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "I wondered if it did.

They have made long-term commitments. Despite the state of their energy mix, they are significant players in the development of clean technologies. And despite your links, in the real world their use of coal appears to have plateaued.\nBy contrast, the US has rejected the international process, without suggesting any alternative. Their leadership has disputed the need for any action at all, without explaining their reasons.\nIn the context of posters here, many of the people pushing a 'what about China' line, are clearly using it as a justification for inaction in the west.

That helps explain the short shrift they tend to get.\nIf you're arguing that you would like to see more ambition from China, I agree.

In November, the power consumed by the entire bitcoin network was estimated to be higher than that of the Republic of Ireland. Since then, its demands have only grown. It\u2019s now on pace to use just over 42TWh of electricity in a year, placing it ahead of New Zealand and Hungary and just behind Peru, according to estimates from Digiconomist. That\u2019s commensurate with CO2 emissions of 20 megatonnes \u2013 or roughly 1m transatlantic flights.\nThat fact should be a grave notion to anyone who hopes for the cryptocurrency to grow further in stature and enter widespread usage. But even more alarming is that things could get much, much worse, helping to increase climate change in the process. \nBurning huge amounts of electricity isn\u2019t incidental to bitcoin: instead, it\u2019s embedded into the innermost core of the currency, as the operation known as \u201cmining\u201d. In simplified terms, bitcoin mining is a competition to waste the most electricity possible by doing pointless arithmetic quintillions of times a second. \nBitcoin is the first, and the biggest, \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d \u2013 a decentralised tradeable digital asset. Whether it is a bad investment is the big question. Bitcoin can only be used as a medium of exchange and in practice has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. The lack of any central authority makes bitcoin remarkably resilient to censorship, corruption \u2013\u00a0or regulation. That means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person.\nThe more electricity you burn, and the faster your computer, the higher your chance of winning the competition. The prize? 12.5 bitcoin \u2013 still worth over $100,000 \u2013 plus all the transaction fees paid in the past 10 minutes, which according analysts\u2019 estimates is another $2,500 or so.\nThis is a winner-takes-all game, where the prize is guaranteed to be paid to one, and only one, miner every 10 minutes. Burning more electricity increases your chances of winning, but correspondingly decreases everyone else\u2019s \u2013 and so they have a motivation to burn more electricity in turn.\nThe economic outcome of all of this is laid bare in a Credit Suisse briefing note published on Tuesday: the network as a whole will reinvest almost all the bitcoin paid out as mining rewards back into its electricity consumption. (Credit Suisse\u2019s ballpark figure assumes that 80% of the expenses of bitcoin miners are spent on electricity).\nAt current prices for electricity and bitcoin, the bank calculates a maximum profitable power draw of bitcoin at around 100TWh \u2013 two-and-a-half times higher than its current rate. Any higher and the miner will lose money.\nBut it gets worse. If bitcoin were to become the global currency its supporters hope it will, its pricewould increase. And if its price increases, so too does the amount of electricity miners can afford to burn. \nCredit Suisse estimate that a bitcoin price of $50,000 \u2013 five times its level as I write \u2013 would increase the electricity consumption tenfold. And at a bitcoin price of $1.1m, it would be profitable to use almost all the electricity currently generated in the world for mining.\nThe bank views the latter prospect as not worth worrying about, for two reasons: it doesn\u2019t think bitcoin will ever reach that value, since the competition from other cryptocurrencies is too strong; and it thinks that power consumption of mining will fall over time as better technologies are used for miners. Credit Suisse explicitly compares bitcoin to marijuana cultivation and data centres, two other industries that once sparked fears they would have huge power draws.\nI\u2019m not convinced we should be so blas\u00e9. It\u2019s true that bitcoin may face competition from other cryptocurrencies, but almost all its competitors use essentially the same wasteful mining system it does. If they took over pole position, it would be out of the frying pan and into the fire. (One major competitor, Ethereum, has long discussed moving to a \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d system, which would radically change its power use for the better, but the switchover still hasn\u2019t happened. It\u2019s currently scheduled for mid-2018.)\nAnd while marijuana farmers and data centre engineers managed to reduce their power demands, the fundamentally wasteful nature of bitcoin mining means there\u2019s no easy technological solution coming. \nMining computers have become more power-efficient, with the latest generation of machines able to do roughly 20% more useless calculations per MWh of electricity. But in the zero-sum game of bitcoin mining, that just means a miner can afford to run more machines at the same time, leaving their power usage roughly stable.\nIn the end, there\u2019s only one real reason why bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption would fall, and that is if the price of the currency drops. \nOn that point, there is good news to be had: bitcoin is down to just over $10,000, almost half the level it was trading at a month ago. If it continues to fall, we might be able to return to worrying about more conventional sources of climate change, like the automotive industry, plane travel, and Donald Trump.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/technology/cryptocurrencies", "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The cryptocurrency uses as much CO2 a year as 1m transatlantic flights.

But if the fish are not carefully prepared they can be deadly. \nThe supermarket in Gamagori failed to remove the liver from the fish before putting them on sale, and unfortunately the liver is one of the organs that can harbour the potent neurotoxin tetrodotoxin. In an effort to recall the potentially poisonous fish sold, loudspeakers across the city have been warning citizens of the danger; at the time of writing, three of the five packs of fish sold had been traced.\nThe risks of eating pufferfish are widely known in Japan and the preparation and sale of the fish is tightly regulated. Nevertheless, poisonings happen every year but, because the symptoms are recognised, effective treatment can be very successful and fatalities are rare. \nHowever, pufferfish are widely distributed in tropical waters \u2013 and those consumers and those fishing outside Asian countries aren\u2019t always aware of the dangers. The fish has also invaded new territories in recent years posing new problems, especially for fishermen not familiar with the species. Relatively recently, the fish have arrived in the eastern Mediterranean. \nThe Suez Canal when it opened in 1869 brought dramatic changes to world trade. It also brought with it invasive species from the Red Sea: 925 non-native species have been recorded in the eastern Mediterranean since the opening of the canal. Migration of species in the opposite direction is relatively rare because the Red Sea is comparatively saltier and nutrient poor. One of the invading species, the silver-cheeked toadfish (Lagocephalus sceleratus), is a type of pufferfish most usually found in the Pacific and Indian oceans. The toadfish appears to be thriving off the Turkish coast and is of particular concern for several reasons.\nThe main cause for concern is its economic impact. The silver-cheeked toadfish has strong teeth that it can use to bite through fishing lines and nets to get to the trapped fish. The damage to fishing gear is one thing, but the toadfish will then go on to feast on the abundance of food it finds inside the nets, meaning several kilos of the catch are often unsaleable. The financial losses to fishermen, who are already often on very low incomes, have been increasing in recent years. \nThe other concern is the toxicity of the fish. Tetrodotoxin is found in several of the silver-cheeked toadfish organs, including the ovaries and liver. This powerful neurotoxin, when pure, can kill an adult human at a dosage of as little as two milligrams. It is far more potent a poison than arsenic or cyanide.\nIn the body, tetrodotoxin blocks sodium channels that enable nerves to fire. It kills because nerves no longer trigger muscle movement controlling breathing and the victim suffocates. The toxin can also induce heart failure. There is no antidote and treatment is to support breathing artificially until the body excretes the toxin naturally. The treatment is very successful, with many people making a full recovery. \nThere is no market for pufferfish as a delicacy in Turkey but the fishermen often eat the fish they catch because they can\u2019t sell it elsewhere. A recent survey found that 38% of surveyed fishermen had consumed pufferfish and of that group, 11% had shown symptoms of intoxication. Clearly, messages about the dangers of this fish have not been getting through. \n The poison is not produced by the fish itself. Rather, it is a product of environmental bacteria that accumulate in the fish. Pufferfish are not the only species that can accumulate tetrodotoxin in this way. There is evidence that tetrodotoxin-contaminated seafood is spreading northwards \u2013 it has even been found off the southern coast of England. In this case it the fish involved wasn\u2019t the silver-cheeked toadfish, as these are likely to remain in the eastern Mediterranean where the water is much warmer. Instead, tetrodotoxin was detected in molluscs \u2013 pacific oysters, native oysters, mussels and hard clams.\nThe studies carried out so far have been small but substantial enough to highlight a potential problem and give hints of the causes and circumstances to be wary of. For example, not all species in all conditions are affected in the same way. Pacific oysters in the summer months from shallow, low saline sites show the highest levels of the toxin. Sea temperatures of at least 15\u00b0C seem to be needed to produce detectable levels of the toxin. \nSea temperatures around the UK coastline have already shown an increase of over 0.7\u00b0C over the last 30 years. These temperatures are likely to increase, as is rainfall, due to global warming. The speculation is that conditions will become increasingly favourable for the tetrodotoxin-producing bacteria. What is certain is that more studies need to be carried out to understand the nature of any potential problem and identify what can be done. \nEducating people about the dangers is certainly one important aspect of poisoning prevention. Screening can also help stop contaminated food from going on sale, but there might be ways of reducing the levels of toxin in the first place. For molluscs this may not be easy, but there are ways of removing the silver-cheeked toadfish from the Mediterranean and reducing the threat of poisoning there. \nFishing for the toadfish and removing it from the environment is one method, but there are few incentives to do this. There is no market to sell the fish for food, so bounties have been proposed for each fish landed. Unfortunately, the amount offered per fish is unlikely to be enough to give financial incentive for Turkish fishermen to catch the species. \nFortunately, there might be another market for this fish: medicine. \nTetrodotoxin, whilst proving extremely dangerous in high doses, may have medical benefits in lower doses. Studies have shown that in some circumstances the toxin may relieve pain, particularly in cancer patients. At a time when we are increasingly looking for alternatives to opiates for pain relief, tetrodotoxin may be one candidate; it has even been shown to reduce the pain of withdrawal from opiates. It may ultimately be the case that this invasive species could provide valuable benefits.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fish", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/marine-life", "https://www.theguardian.com/food", "https://www.theguardian.com/food/seafood", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The accidental sale of potentially deadly fugu in Japan has sparked a health scare \u2013 and the same poison is now found in European species", "date_published": {"$date": 1516195699000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1534604851000}, "authors": ["Kathryn Harkup"], "article_section": "Science", "article_tags": ["Chemistry", "Science", "Fish", "Environment", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Marine life", "Food", "Seafood"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2018/jan/17/tetrodotoxin-the-poison-behind-the-japanese-pufferfish-fugu-scare", "og:description": "The accidental sale of potentially deadly fugu in Japan has sparked a health scare \u2013 and the same poison is now found in European species", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f7dd485d937508567ad5cf63a51262037e695eb/13_225_2443_1465/master/2443.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=ceb0ee5828d5f671b7785e4556ce95f2", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Tetrodotoxin: the poison behind the Japanese pufferfish scare"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "d", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f7dd485d937508567ad5cf63a51262037e695eb/13_225_2443_1465/master/2443.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=783a2ccbdc0f877a31db06cd7c7a5d37", "width": "2443", "height": "1465", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f7dd485d937508567ad5cf63a51262037e695eb/13_225_2443_1465/master/2443.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b9a7f36d0c0a79f3be3272b3b11ac606", "description": "Fugu, also known as pufferfish or blowfish, can harbour the potent neurotoxin tetrodotoxin in their organs.\nPhotograph: Itsuo Inouye/AP"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7280e3b4c12b799b8d77798dfd29854bc79d5a38/0_46_2269_1361/master/2269.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b48b7861512234348f0278a126dcdbe4", "width": "2269", "height": "1361", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7280e3b4c12b799b8d77798dfd29854bc79d5a38/0_46_2269_1361/master/2269.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a7bf4e295d3560ba7bc9e1eef8326a2f", "description": "A package of pufferfish containing the potentially deadly liver, top right.

Very high sensitivity would have made it extremely hard to limit climate change according to the Paris targets.\u201d\nThe landmark Paris climate agreement in 2015 called for capping global warming at \u201cwell under\u201d 2C compared to a pre-industrial benchmark, and pursuing efforts for a 1.5C ceiling.\nThe findings should not be seen as taking pressure off the need to tackle climate change, the authors and other experts warned. \u201cWe will still see significant warming and impacts this century if we don\u2019t increase our ambition to reduce CO2 emissions,\u201d said Forster.\nEven a 1.5C increase will have consequences. With a single degree Celsius of warming so far, the Earth is already coping with a crescendo of climate impacts including deadly droughts, erratic rainfall, and storm surges engorged by rising seas.\nA 3.5 C world, scientists say, could pull at the fabric of civilisation.\nSince industrialisation took off in the early 19th century, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have increased by nearly half, from 280 parts per million to 407 parts per million.\nUp to now global warming predictions have focused on the historical temperature record.\nCox and colleagues instead \u201cconsidered the year-to-year fluctuations in global temperature,\u201d said Richard Allan, a climate scientist at the University of Reading.\nBy analysing the responsiveness of short-term changes in temperature to \u201cnudges and bumps\u201d in the climate system, he explained, they were able to exclude the outcomes that would have resulted in devastating increases of 4C or more by 2100.\nOne wild card not taken into consideration by the new model is the possibility of rapid shifts in climate brought on by the planet itself. \u201cThere is indeed evidence that the climate system can undergo abrupt changes or \u2018tipping points\u2019,\u201d Cox said.\nThe collapse of the gulf stream, the thawing of carbon-rich permafrost, or the melting of ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica \u2013 any of these could quickly change the equation, and not in the Earth\u2019s favour.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/natural-disasters", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ipcc", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Findings should not be seen as taking pressure off need to tackle climate change, authors warn", "date_published": {"$date": 1516244902000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627430000}, "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "article_section": "Science", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Climate change", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Environment", "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)", "United Nations", "Science"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/18/worst-case-global-warming-scenarios-not-credible-says-study", "og:description": "Findings should not be seen as taking pressure off need to tackle climate change, authors warn", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a27854cf22cb5e6b2208cfc2b1b67e5869f90663/0_200_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=2f221aaef8a4ef1b5511df5df72b9b6c", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Climate sensitivity study suggests narrower range of potential outcomes"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a27854cf22cb5e6b2208cfc2b1b67e5869f90663/0_200_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c27bd9d0b521078a88feba92b9a14e41", "width": "3264", "height": "1958", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a27854cf22cb5e6b2208cfc2b1b67e5869f90663/0_200_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0855d4232128d864376eb01b194f3e2f", "description": "New calculation of greenhouse gases\u2019 effect on temperature reduces range of possible outcomes by more than half, researchers say.\nPhotograph: Ryan Tong/EPA"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556127448791}, "comments": [{"id": "110997837", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516260460000}, "author": "colddebtmountain", "author_id": "4516350", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Mmm, it should be a certainty that the science will not be settled until it is settled and absolutely sure of itself.

Extreme weather events\n2. Natural disasters\n3. Failure to halt climate change\n4. Water crises\n5. Cyber attacks\n6. Biodiversity loss\n7. Mass involuntary migration\n8. Manmade environmental disasters\nIt said all five environmental risks covered by the survey \u2013 extreme weather events, natural disasters, failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse, and human-made natural disasters \u2013 had become more prominent.\n\u201cThis follows a year characterised by high-impact hurricanes, extreme temperatures and the first rise in CO2 emissions for four years. We have been pushing our planet to the brink and the damage is becoming increasingly clear. \n\u201cBiodiversity is being lost at mass-extinction rates, agricultural systems are under strain, and pollution of the air and sea has become an increasingly pressing threat to human health.\u201d\nTrump has threatened to withdraw the US from the 2015 Paris agreement under which nations agreed to take steps to limit the increase in global temperature. He has said the commitments made by his predecessor, Barack Obama, would damage the American economy.\nOther states have said they will keep to the pledges made in Paris, an approach supported by the WEF.\n\u201cA trend towards nation-state unilateralism may make it more difficult to sustain the long-term, multilateral responses that are required to counter global warming and the degradation of the global environment,\u201d it said.\nThe survey said the extreme weather events in 2017 included unusually frequent Atlantic hurricanes, with September the most intense month on record. It was also the most expensive hurricane season.\nIt added that when data was finalised, 2017 would be among the three hottest years on record, and the hottest without an El Ni\u00f1o, the Pacific Ocean climate cycle that affects the world\u2019s weather.\nBiodiversity loss was occurring at mass-extinction rates, the WEF said, noting that the populations of vertebrate species declined by an estimated 58% between 1970 and 2012. \n\u201cGlobally, the primary driver of biodiversity loss is the human destruction of habitats including forests \u2013 which are home to approximately 80% of the world\u2019s land-based animals, plants and insects \u2013 for farming, mining, infrastructure development and oil and gas production.\u201d\nStronger than expected growth in 2017 meant economic risks were seen as less pressing, but the WEF said the upbeat picture masked continuing underlying concerns, including unsustainable asset prices; high levels of indebtedness, particularly in China; and continuing strains in the global financial system. \nThe International Monetary Fund is likely to raise its forecast for global growth when it gives its latest economic update in Davos next Monday, and the WEF survey said the recovery underway in all major economies had to led to a sharp improvement in sentiment.\nBut it expressed concern that the swing to optimism might lead to complacency and a blind spot to economic risks. \u201cThere are certainly reasons to be cautious: one does not have to look far for signs of economic and financial strain\u201d, the WEF added, calling for greater attention to be paid to the risks of another crisis erupting. \n \nThe survey warned there would be limited policy firepower in the event of a new crisis. It also warned of the disruption caused by automation, noting that \u201cfor the foreseeable future, automation and digitalisation can be expected to push down on levels of employment and wages, and contribute to increases in income and wealth at the top of the distribution.\u201d\nIt also highlighted the buildup of protectionist pressures against a backdrop of rising nationalist and populist politics and growing cybersecurity risks.\nThe WEF said cyber attacks against businesses had almost doubled in five years, and that the financial impact of cybersecurity breaches was rising.\n", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos-2018", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "World Economic Forum outlines huge increase in all five eco risks since the US president assumed office", "date_published": {"$date": 1516277500000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548413578000}, "authors": ["Larry Elliott"], "article_section": "Business", "article_tags": ["Davos", "Climate change", "US news", "Trump administration", "World news", "Business", "Environment", "Donald Trump", "Davos 2018"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/17/us-unilateralism-makes-tacking-climate-change-harder-wef-warns", "og:description": "World Economic Forum outlines huge increase in all five eco risks since the US president assumed office", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7172a2ba06cc93daf74da73ca837a0e8df9d1a96/0_246_3628_2177/master/3628.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=37483a3a1d9200b17d09406ea35f12d6", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Donald Trump is hampering fight against climate change, WEF warns"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7172a2ba06cc93daf74da73ca837a0e8df9d1a96/0_246_3628_2177/master/3628.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cf0d24af930cce10e7b7e68865d566b6", "width": "3628", "height": "2177", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7172a2ba06cc93daf74da73ca837a0e8df9d1a96/0_246_3628_2177/master/3628.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9d8918a1b92396832f0648670f4072ee", "description": "Donald Trump is accused of hampering the fight against global warming and ecological damage.\nPhotograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556127450596}, "comments": [{"id": "111080834", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516433853000}, "author": "LocknessMunster", "author_id": "17443130", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Man made global warming is basic schoolboy level physics as understood for over a century.Religion is faith without evidence.That describes the Denialist Cult.", "recommendation_count": "5", "in_reply_to": "110977364", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "111079394", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516423175000}, "author": "brianBT", "author_id": "11011075", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "#schumershutdown", "recommendation_count": "1", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "111079283", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516421766000}, "author": "reinhardpolley", "author_id": "16020012", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nKeyword: Adjusted.

Consider that since the 1820's, the US and Europe began their industrial revolution and it's gone unabated only slowed down by economic downturns. China and the rest of the world began their industrial revolutions sometime during the past century, china around the 1950's after recovering a bit from WWII. But my point here is that we've been pouring - pouring - waste into the earth for over 150 years. And we're not just talking paper and pencils. We're talking toxic waste. The US has how many superfund sites? contaminated sites not usable by businesses? Every city deals with this in a major way. Smog? Air pollutants? Add to that the reality that fresh water isn't easily available in many areas and the fact that the ocean has been a heat sink for the planet and will hopefully continue to provide that roll for as long as humanly possible. When the ocean starts expelling the heat it's been hording, that's pretty much the massive tipping point the average human will understand because climate change won't be some ice storms in florida or some other current obvious change. No, it'll be a loss of land in florida and every other coast around the world. We'll have mass migration, impacted enonomies, food and water supply issues, etc etc. So, what trump does or doesn't do won't likely impact the future of our planet as it relates to climate.

However, it does leave enough wiggle room to take in Brexit and the growing risks from technological advances, climate change and rising inequality.\nPolitical upheaval and rising populism will also be hot topics for the more than 2,500 delegates from the realms of business, politics, academia, the charity sector and the arts, plus the usual smattering of celebrities. These will be the themes to watch out for.\nDavos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it \u2013 and\u00a0the elaborate system of badges\u00a0reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy.\nFor critics, \u201cDavos man\u201d is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all\u00a0a big waste of time.Who is there?\nMore than 2,500 people \u2013 business leaders, world leaders, diplomats and the odd celebrity, such as Matt Damon \u2013 will fly in for the 49th annual Davos meeting. Most delegates are men, and although the forum boasts delegates from more than 100 countries, most hail from western\u00a0Europe, followed by the US. Sir David Attenborough is one of the most notable attendees in 2019, while Donald Trump, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron all pulled out at short notice to focus on more pressing issues at home.\nThe US president might enjoy the trappings of power and a billionaire\u2019s lifestyle, like the most ardent of globalists at Davos, yet politically he has set himself up as the very opposite of the WEF and all that it stands for.\nThe organisers set great store in \u201cmulti-stakeholder\u201d solutions and the idea that global problems are best solved by countries working together \u2013 which makes the event an unlikely stomping ground for a president bent on isolationism and putting \u201cAmerica first\u201d. Protectionism and the potential for the disruption of world trade and cooperation will be a hot topic all week.\nKlaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the WEF, gave a thinly veiled warning to Trump at his pre-meeting press conference, arguing \u201cno individual alone can solve the issues on the global agenda\u201d. He said the world was at an inflection point where there was a \u201creal danger of a collapse of our global systems\u201d.\nThat may be no bad thing for Trump, who has shown little love for global institutions. His keynote address just before the close of the meeting on Friday will be unmissable.\nAlmost 10 years on from the financial crisis, and the global economy has got its mojo back. The International Monetary Fund will deliver its latest world economic outlook update on Monday from Davos, where there are sure to be questions about the sustainability of the current upswing.\nThe IMF\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, will deliver the update and speak on several other panels throughout the week. The prospect of rising inflation and the removal of economic stimulus by central banks will be sure to feature prominently, while the theme of the conference \u2013 creating a shared future \u2013 will raise the issues of wealth and growing income inequality.\nThe increasing use of artificial intelligence, robotics and the automation of jobs has been a repeating theme at Davos, and this year is no different. The impact of AI will be one of the forum\u2019s major events, with a one-to-one interview to be held between Schwab and the chief executive of Google, Sundar Pichai.\nThe \u201cfourth industrial revolution\u201d will be a key theme once more, with a focus on how the loss of millions of jobs could undermine social cohesion. The way states respond to governing and taxing technologies and borderless business will be high on the agenda.\nAlthough unlikely to be a major theme at Davos this year, the annual summit will present UK ministers with an opportunity to rub shoulders with European leaders just before they pile into more substantive talks on trade later this year.\nTheresa May and Philip Hammond will be in attendance, while representatives from all 28 EU member states will also be heading to Davos, including the head of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the French president Emmanuel Macron.\nLabour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will be making his first visit to Davos, planning to use the event as an opportunity to explain why the rules of the global economy need rewriting. May, on the other hand, will be expected to explain how Britain still matters on the global stage as it quits the EU.\nTrump moved quickly to pull the US out of the Paris climate accords in one of his first acts as president last year. At Davos, where the environment is always among the most important issues up for debate, this won\u2019t have gone down well.\nThe former US vice-president Al Gore is attending and will speak on several panels, including one about how extreme weather events are proving more devastating and expensive.\nThe WEF\u2019s global risks perception survey, released last week, cited climate change-related issues as the top problems facing the world, while it also issued a thinly veiled warning to the US president that \u201cnation-state unilateralism\u201d will make it harder to combat change and ecological damage.\nIn the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sex abuse scandal, gender equality and issues such as bullying and harassment in the workplace will be in sharp focus at Davos this year.\nBusiness leaders have often talked about encouraging diversity in the past, although are also accused of having made very little headway. Women will only account for 21% of all of the participants this year.\nAt least three sessions will directly tackle the problems facing women at work, including one with the Microsoft executive Peggy Johnson and Canadian minister for the status of women, Maryam Monsef, titled \u201cGender, power and stemming sexual harassment\u201d.\nMore than a third of participants come from developing or emerging economies, while the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, will address the opening plenary.\nHumanitarian crises are on the agenda, with the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees out of Myanmar likely to feature prominently, as the forum considers the outlook for 2018.\nThe actor Cate Blanchett, who alongside Elton John has won a prize designated for artists who best represent the \u201cspirit of Davos\u201d, will speak to raise awareness about the refugee crisis. Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani student who fights for education and women\u2019s rights, will also speak about the importance of education and equal opportunities.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/business/global-economy", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump", "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Climate change, AI and women\u2019s issues are on the agenda but the US premier\u2019s keynote speech will no doubt cause the biggest buzz, writes Richard Partington", "date_published": {"$date": 1516463942000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1551702791015}, "authors": ["Richard Partington"], "article_section": "Business", "article_tags": ["Davos", "Global economy", "Economics", "Donald Trump", "Artificial intelligence (AI)", "Environment", "Climate change", "Business"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/20/davos-2018-wef-hottest-topics-climate-change-harassment-donald-trump", "og:description": "Climate change, AI and women\u2019s issues are on the agenda but the US premier\u2019s keynote speech will no doubt cause the biggest buzz, writes Richard Partington", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7f15d01c7a42f7a435b45ba4b34f9b393c81273/0_42_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=7533175793d8a811407ba1aac33a36dc", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Climate change, AI and harassment \u2013 the hottest topics at this year\u2019s Davos"}, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7f15d01c7a42f7a435b45ba4b34f9b393c81273/0_42_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9d465cc6578ffd3fffbbbc8149914ba3", "width": "3500", "height": "2100", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7f15d01c7a42f7a435b45ba4b34f9b393c81273/0_42_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8290a817c7d04e8f6471a1ba16838b36", "description": "The congress centre in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos, the venue of the upcoming World Economic Forum.\nPhotograph: Arnd Wiegmann/Reuters"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4211088e4b9d7ba61af8705f7f2748be85262c1/0_144_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=16ebcb7cdf2de40bb37464626ac48dc4", "width": "3000", "height": "1800", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4211088e4b9d7ba61af8705f7f2748be85262c1/0_144_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4ee039cd85fc26984c1d357024ebb216", "description": "Donald Trump has set himself up as the very opposite of the WEF and all it stands for.

Even without an El Ni\u00f1o, the year was still exceptionally hot, being one of the top three ever recorded.\nThe three main global temperature records show the global surface temperature in 2017 was 1C above levels seen in pre-industrial times, with scientists certain that humanity\u2019s fossil fuel-burning is to blame.\nThe data, published on Thursday, means the last three years have been the hottest trio ever seen, with 2017 ranking second or third depending on the small differences between the temperature records. Furthermore, 17 of the 18 hottest years recorded since 1850 have occurred since 2000.\n2017 also saw extreme weather events strike across the world, from hurricanes in the US and Caribbean to heatwaves in Australia and devastating floods in Asia. Many of these events have been shown to have been made much more likely by the heat resulting from global warming.\nScientists from across the globe warned that the limit of 1.5C of warming, set as a goal by the international Paris climate change treaty, was being approached very rapidly and that it was more urgent than ever to slash emissions to avoid the worst impacts.\nThe three global temperature records are compiled by the UK\u2019s Met Office and Nasa and Noaa in the United States. The Met Office said the average temperature in 2017 was 0.99C above that seen from 1850-1900, despite the Pacific Ocean moving into its cooler La Ni\u00f1a phase.\n\u201cWhile climate change deniers continue to bury their heads in the sand, global warming continues unabated,\u201d said Prof Michael Mann, at Pennsylvania State University in the US. \u201cAnd the impacts of that warming \u2013 unprecedented wildfires, superstorms and floods \u2013 are now plain for all to see. There has never been greater urgency.\u201d\nIn December, the US president, Donald Trump, suggested cold weather in the eastern US undermined the evidence of climate change, a statement called \u201cphenomenally dumb\u201c by climate scientist Dr Sarah Myhre.\nScientists said that the slight drop in global temperature in 2017 was unsurprising and that huge levels of carbon emissions are still being pumped out. \u201cGlobal temperatures will continue to bob up and down from year to year, but the climate tide beneath them is rising fast,\u201d said Prof David Reay, at the University of Edinburgh in the UK. \n\u201cDespite our best efforts so far, global warming continues apace,\u201d said Prof Martin Siegert, at Imperial College London. \u201cThis is yet another wake-up call to develop a zero carbon economy before it\u2019s too late.\u201d \nDr Dann Mitchell, at the University of Bristol, said: \u201cWe are getting ever closer to the Paris agreement target of 1.5C which we are so desperately trying to avoid.\u201d\nProf Stefan Rahmstorf said there had been a very significant increase in global temperature since the major El Ni\u00f1o seen in 1998: \u201cIn just 18 years, our greenhouse gas emissions have pushed up global temperature by a full 0.4C. At this rate the Paris goal of 1.5C will already be crossed in under two decades.\u201d\nThe 2016 peak in global temperature caused by El Ni\u00f1o is over. That peak was similar to the 1998 peak, but at a 0.4 \u00b0C higher global temperature due to #GlobalWarming pic.twitter.com/F7aBZt2k2J\nIn Australia, the Climate Council chief executive, Amanda McKenzie, said: \u201cThe fingerprints of climate change were seen with extreme weather events across Australia in 2017. This data is yet another warning to the government to urgently slash Australia\u2019s rising greenhouse gas levels in a bid to protect Australians from escalating extreme weather events.\u201d\nThe temperature data is all compiled using many thousands of measurements from all continents and all oceans. Small differences between them largely result from how temperatures for the fast-warming but data-sparse polar regions are calculated.\nThe El Ni\u00f1o event in 2015-16 raised the annual average temperature for 2016 by 0.2C, but most scientists agree that both 2016 and 2015 would have been record hot years even without the El Ni\u00f1o. The 2017 global temperature was accurately predicted by the Met Office a year before, adding to confidence that scientists have a good understanding of the climate system.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/science/meteorology", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/elnino", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Data shows the year was also one of the hottest three ever recorded, with scientists warning that the \u2018climate tide is rising fast\u2019", "date_published": {"$date": 1516289402000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627429000}, "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Meteorology", "El Ni\u00f1o southern oscillation", "World news", "Climate change", "Environment", "Science"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/18/2017-was-the-hottest-year-on-record-without-el-nino-boost", "og:description": "Data shows the year was also one of the hottest three ever recorded, with scientists warning that the \u2018climate tide is rising fast\u2019", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9727646f9250f47d5b763dbfb377fe85c5f6a69/136_151_966_580/master/966.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=281171e5ea91e71c4760f3f687809289", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "2017 was the hottest year on record without El Ni\u00f1o boost"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "\u00f1", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9727646f9250f47d5b763dbfb377fe85c5f6a69/0_0_1200_898/master/1200.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e4c0af20d27e43b295ea6c67e702319a", "width": "1200", "height": "898", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9727646f9250f47d5b763dbfb377fe85c5f6a69/0_0_1200_898/master/1200.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=429849704c817ab247cf84d087d7f863", "description": "Global temperature map, January to December 2017.\nPhotograph: NOAA"}}], "comments": [{"id": "111061901", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516372552000}, "author": "Breeal", "author_id": "18336656", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nGosh.

We find a large cooling bias in ERSST version 3b and smaller but significant cooling biases in HadSST3 and COBE-SST from 2003 to the present, with respect to most series examined. These results suggest that reported rates of SST warming in recent years have been underestimated in these three data sets.\nhttp://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/1/e1601207", "recommendation_count": "15", "in_reply_to": "111052858", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "the update from ersst version 3b to version 4", "effect": "an increase in the operational sst trend estimate"}]}, {"id": "111060548", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516370778000}, "author": "chrisbrown", "author_id": "3684556", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "So what would your new model make of crop failures?

Presumably it should include such things as health, GDP, and life expectancy, but, since we are focusing on climate, we might also put in a weighting directly related to human physical comfort under hot/cold/humid conditions. We can end up with a weighted index, similar to the UN Human Development Index. For the sake of argument, it could simply be labelled the Well Being Index (WBI). \nThe next task would be to plot a curve that relates the Well Being Index to the average global temperature, starting on the basis of today\u2019s technology/infrastructure/geographical dispersion. For example, what happens to the WBI if we go from 15c to 16c? How about from 16c to 17c?Given this curve, we can then say how the WBI will change over the next few decades based on current predictions for average global temperature.\nAssuming we do not take any preventative actions to directly impact the man-made portion of global warming, then what would be the cost of the required \u201cadaptions\u201d in technology/infrastructure/geographical dispersion that we would have to make to ensure the same WBI index as now? (e,g. Flooding damage repair, net impact on crop yields, ...) \nAlternatively, what would be the cost of taking direct carbon-reduction preventative actions to reach the equivalent WBI level? How does this compare to the cost of the \u201cadaption\u201d actions? How do the preventive and adaptive actions interact when we combine them? Do some preventative actions have an impact on WBI beyond their direct climate impact? (We need to ensure that the specific costs of prevention and adaptation, are not double-counted in the \"GDP\" part of our WBI index.)\nWhat will be the impact on the curve from future developments that are expected to be made anyway, regardless of climate considerations? For example, in 50 to 100 years humans are likely to have significantly \u201cmerged\u201d with computers, in terms of both \u201cbody and brain\u201d. How will this impact our response to climate related impacts? \nAlso, are there other scientific and technological developments that we would be making anyway that would make us more or less susceptible to changes in temperature? \nOnce we have determined the relationship between the WBI and temperature, then to determine the optimum we need the costs of adaptation and prevention, but we also need to monetize the WBI. For example, say we have an WBI index that goes from 100 to 98 in response to the global temperature going up by 0.5c. What is the value we should attach to this WBI change? Part of that might be estimated by using social cost factors used by various government and other organizations, such as the value of years of life.\nAnother consideration is: What \u201cdiscount factor\u201d should we use to reflect the fact that, for most of us, we put more value on a cost incurred now than the subsequent benefit gained by humans in 50 or a 100 years from now.\nAssuming we have all the input values, we can make decisions that optimize the change in WBI versus the associated cost of adaptive and preventative costs.\nOne important question is to what extent we can just deal with overall global averages, versus reflecting the fact that the impacts can vary a lot more for certain groups of people based on geography etc.\nThe context of the above has been average global temperature, but I guess the same thinking applies to climate change in general.\nI am planning to put all this together in a spreadsheet model.

Things like clothes. \nIt is our intelligence and aptness for technology that allows our adaptability. So we do well. \nBut the rest of living things - they do not have that toolbox. We can move inside during a heat-wave - a forest or field of grain - not so much. \nIn theory we as humans can tech our way out of most problems - including scrubbing CO2/making O2/desalinise ocean water/create our food in labs/factories etc. \nIn other words - we can make this planet our own high-tech space-ship - were all things living are under our supervision. \nA minor problem with this is that a lot of plant-stuff (for example) has been found very valuable in counteracting ever evolving viruses and bacteria. As such - a huge genetic pool on this planet has been a gift for us. So even for own benefit - it makes sense to keep the total gene-pool alive - and naturally evolving.\nThirdly - when USA or UK or China or Russia take active steps to optimise their national climate -how will other nations respond?\nThink about the following case (something we already can do) - You need a bit of rain - so you shoot sulfat particles into the sky as condensation particles. This brings more precipitation at your selected region. But it also empty the \"atmospheric rivers\" flowing to other states/nations. So you fixing your problem cause down-wind problems (we see the same problem with international river basins and dams - they allow climate to be weaponized, even). \nAn example - a lot of people argue for engineering global temperature by air-lifting tiny particles into the stratosphere and cause \"global dimming\" (Just like volcanoes do naturally). The problem for the UK, for example - is that this force the climate system into a permanent positive mode of the North Atlantic Oscillation - the system that gives UK their record-breaking winter rain-fall records. Meanwhile it force Spain into even more severe droughts - on top of the AGW effect in itself. \nThere is no \"optimal\" way for us to regulate this. \nWhat we know is that the planet does not mind change - as long as it takes a loooong time. \nThis is the problem with AGW.

You posted a link that patently contradicts what you keep telling us - first, that there was no warming for the majority of the last 20 years; and second, that climate predictions have failed miserably. I merely pointed that out. \nAs for IPCC emission scenarios, you haven't factored in the much greater than expected reduction in emissions of halocarbons (which are potent GHGs) thanks to the great success of the Montreal Protocol. Also, your source (NOAA) is at the low end of observed warming trends, at 0.184 C per decade since 1990. Both GISTEMP and Berkeley are higher, at 0.194 C and 0.199 C per decade respectively.\nSo, while no one's claiming that climate models are perfect (particularly those from 30-odd years ago), they're doing pretty well.\nAs I've told you before, satellite data are problematic. They don't measure temperature directly but rather by microwaves that require complex analysis. Multiple major errors have been identified over the years, requiring significant corrections - far greater than the adjustments to surface temperatures that you often complain about. Most damning of all, the two major satellite series analyse essentially the same data, yet come up with very different results.

The definition of what is a coal company and the criteria for divestment will be set over the coming months. \nThe firm has long been vocal about the need to battle climate change, with insurance one of the worst affected industries by hurricanes, wildfires and flooding in recent years.\nThe insurance market decided last month to implement a coal exclusion policy as part of a responsible investment strategy for the central mutual fund that sits behind every insurance policy written by the Lloyd\u2019s market. \nInga Beale, Lloyd\u2019s of London chief executive, said: \u201cThat means that in the areas of our portfolio where we can directly influence investment decisions we will avoid investing in companies that are involved mainly in coal. \n\u201cIs there more the insurance sector could be doing to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy by choosing sustainable or low-carbon stocks?\u201d\nLloyd\u2019s does not underwrite operations directly, but offers a marketplace to almost 90 syndicates of other insurers.\nLloyd\u2019s has been slower to take action than others. Other big UK and European insurance companies, including Aviva, Allianz, Axa, Legal &amp; General, SCOR, Swiss Re and Zurich, have been shifting away from coal and other fossil fuels due to concerns about climate risks. About \u00a315bn has been divested by insurers in the past two years, according to a recent report from Unfriend Coal Network, a global coalition of NGOs and campaigners including 350.org and Greenpeace. It said 15 companies \u2013 almost all in Europe \u2013 have fully or partially cut financial ties by selling holdings in coal companies and refusing to insure their operations.\nFrance\u2019s Axa was one of the first financial firms to reduce investments in coal in May 2015 and is still leading the way. It said last month it was ditching investments and ending insurance for controversial US oil pipelines. After being criticised by campaigners for applying a threshold of 50% of revenues to define coal companies, it lowered the threshold to 30%.\nThe Church of England has gone further, pulling out of investing in companies that make more than 10% of their revenues from thermal coal or oil from tar sands.\nAnalysis by the ClimateWise coalition of the world\u2019s biggest insurers published in December 2016 found that more frequent extreme weather events were driving up uninsured losses and making some assets uninsurable. The report concluded that the \u201cprotection gap\u201d \u2013 the difference between the costs of natural disasters and the amount insured \u2013 had quadrupled to $100bn (\u00a379bn) a year since the 1980s.\nInsurance companies are perhaps also mindful of the danger that they could suffer a huge loss if their investments in fossil fuel companies were rendered worthless by action on climate change, as the Bank of England warned in 2015. However, some banks are still investing in coal plants, according to research from campaign groups.\nBeale told the Guardian that she would be discussing the group\u2019s new investment strategy at the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting in Davos this week.\nClimate change and what investors can do will feature prominently at the meeting of political and business leaders. Beale said: \u201cIt goes beyond climate change.

The answer is of course \"Painful death\". And it has nothing to do with temperature dropping with around 7 degrees per kilometer.

But then a good human being should search the knowledge, instead of spreading own misunderstandings. \nHint (the plant in your living-room is breathing out CO2 during the night . We know because of science). You are also a carbon based life-form - though you work a bit different from plants. \nThe global dry biomass of all humans living now is ca 100 million tons. \nThe biomass of earth-worms (also breathing oxygen) is around 10-20 times larger. \nSee a problem here with your argument - in comparing burning fossil fuel with carbon life? \nHint - your fossil fuels once was breathing air too - carbon fixing life. That got buried. Like forests does today. \nNow we are burning decades of years worth of fossil rain-forest/swamp/bogs carbon capture every year. And we ask the living forests to soak it up every year. \nPlants do fantastic! They soak up about 25% of the extra carbon we introduce by restringing buried carbon every year. The ocean is working on high gear and put another 50% of the Co2 into solution (with it's known side effects)\nMy point is that science over the last 200 years has figured out in principle - from physics and chemistry and life-sciences worked out how this works to a pretty amazing level. Science has also been busy in the side-branch that measure it to an amazing level. So well that science started to model these things half a century ago. \nTrust me - science understood 50 years ago that carbon based life breathing out is not a source of increase in atmospheric CO2 in the carbon cycle. \nI am not really sure where to guide you to understand this better (I have a feeling you do not really search information of why science can know) - but if you are open minded - try https://skepticalscience.com/\nThe give simple information - and always with in depth links for those that doubt - so they can find why claims are made, just a hyperlink away. \nI would not be surprised if they have a well-linked article about why \"breathing\" is not adding CO2 to the atmosphere. \nFinally - here is a prediction made by climate scientists with models 18 years ago - compared to how it happened until 2017 was measured. \nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/DT-4EzkX0AAG6Z9.jpg\nRemember - models are not reality. Seems like science is guessing rather educated and well, would you not say? \nThere is nothing \"leftish\" about physics. Just hard-core physics. I wish you on the right started to dare to understand it. I guess it makes many fear - since it is ruthless when you solve equations wrong. Political ideology is much nicer like this - as social science like \"perspectives\". Maybe that is why so many choose ideology instead of the nature of reality as a topic for study? And start to argue like politicians (or the \"swamp\", as it has been known) - instead of arguing with hard facts and deep understand that takes a decade or two to understand. \nI kind of like people who handle facts. One learn to be humble when sitting in at enough math, chem and physical exams until one is around 30 years old and after that venture into the world of discovering reality under the ideology of being proven wrong (the Principle of Falsifiability).", "recommendation_count": "8", "in_reply_to": "111184401", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "science", "effect": "we know"}]}, {"id": "111186933", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516664417000}, "author": "John Samuel", "author_id": "13496713", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Thanks for a Google search guaranteed to bring out crackpots.\nThe cons outweigh the pros.https://skepticalscience.com/global-warming-positives-negatives-intermediate.htm\nNo scientific body agrees with you.

There are three risks fossil fuel companies likely face.One is a disruption of their market by new technologies. This is not longer a hypothetical, but at the very least partially underway. The second is a major climate event pushing the public mood towards greater urgency of action. A classic \"gray swan\" type event. Something major happens like a Sandy type event or perhaps a very high death toll event in South Asia that triggers a major shift in public perception.The final risk is law suits. If a ruling finds against some company and its lack of action or funding distinctiveness for action it could face a tobacco industry scale storm. \nSo the longer term the investor the less they will want to be exposed to those risks. Of the three the first is likely the biggest. Although the usual suspects will be along with their bombastic \"puny renewables\" etc, it does not take a total take over of the market for power generation or transport to hit fossil fuel firms hard.

Even if you are selling a load of physical mass of product, its not worth anything to investors if its not for a profit and the liklihood of new technologies driving over supply in fossil fuels but cutting market share is real. \nAnd as the cost of exploiting new resources rises, the capacity to raise capital or debt from the market is being reduced by those with deep pockets but a degree of risk aversion not wanting exposure. This will increase the cost of raising new capital meaning less is available to dig coal to warm our ocean atmosphere system. \nHave a think on that and have a good day everyone.", "recommendation_count": "12", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "111124807", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516549905000}, "author": "Erik Frederiksen", "author_id": "15131989", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "From the article: \"Other big UK and European insurance companies, including Aviva, Allianz, Axa, Legal & General, SCOR, Swiss Re and Zurich, have been shifting away from coal and other fossil fuels due to concerns over climate risks.\"\nWhere were they 30-40 years ago when we not only knew the risks but had a chance to stop dangerous impacts?", "recommendation_count": "15", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "concerns over climate risks", "effect": "from the article other big uk and european insurance companies have been shifting away from coal and other fossil fuels"}]}, {"id": "111124521", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516549277000}, "author": "rockyrex", "author_id": "2923581", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Good.\nGeologists say that a three-metre (10-foot) coal seam took between 12,000 and 60,000 years to form.\nAncient trees and other plants lived, died and were fossilised - all those plants took carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.\nSome larger coal seams are, for example, 10 metres thick.\nThey took many tens of thousands of years to form, but some of those seams have been mined and burned in a little over 100 years.\nSo coal was formed as part of the long-term carbon cycle.\nRapidly returning all that carbon to the atmosphere in the form of CO2 destabilises that long-term cycle.\nWhen igneous activity heated up coal seams in the end-Permian event, the extra CO2 produced by the process caused global warming and ocean acidification, and these led to extinctions.\nThere's an interesting paper on that -\n\"Initial pulse of Siberian Traps sills as the trigger of the end-Permian mass extinction\" - Burgess et al, 2017.", "recommendation_count": "33", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "these", "effect": "extinctions"}, {"cause": "these", "effect": "global warming and ocean acidification"}]}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc082a1a2c3613145ed8fc6"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jan/22/switching-to-electric-cars-is-key-to-fixing-americas-critically-insufficient-climate-policies", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "In order to meet its share of the carbon pollution cuts needed to achieve the 2\u00b0C Paris international climate target, America\u2019s policies are rated as \u201ccritically insufficient\u201d by the Climate Action Tracker. The Trump Administration has taken every possible step to undo the Obama Administration\u2019s climate policies, including announcing that America will be the only world country to withdraw from the Paris agreement, and trying to repeal the Clean Power Plan.\nIn 2020, the next American president will have to make up the lost ground and come up with a plan to rapidly accelerate the country\u2019s transition away from fossil fuels. Currently, transportation and power generation each account for about 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions, so those sectors represent the prime targets for pollution cuts. \nBut the power sector is already rapidly decarbonizing because coal can\u2019t compete in the marketplace. In some regions, new wind and solar with battery storage have already become cheaper than continuing to operate existing coal plants, and the International Renewable Energy Agency has concluded that by 2020, \u201call the renewable power generation technologies that are now in commercial use are expected to fall within the fossil fuel-fired cost range.\u201d\nAmerican power sector carbon emissions had exceeded those from transportation from 1979 until 2016. But because coal power plants have rapidly been replaced by natural gas and renewables, US power sector emissions have fallen rapidly since 2007, and are now below 1989 levels. US carbon pollution from transportation, on the other hand, has been on the rise since 2012. It remains higher than in 2000, nearly 20% higher than 1989 levels, and has surpassed power sector emissions.\nThe transportation sector thus represents a prime target for cutting American carbon pollution, with light-duty (passenger) vehicles accounting for 60% of those emissions and medium- and heavy-duty trucks accounting for a further 23%. These emissions can be significantly reduced by transitioning from the internal combustion engine to electric vehicles (EVs).\nComparing carbon pollution between gasoline- and diesel-powered cars to those of electric vehicles can be tricky, because it depends on the source of the electricity generation, which varies from place to place. However, based on the average US power grid mix, the Department of Energy estimates that EV carbon pollution is 60% lower than that of gasoline-powered cars. In a clean energy state like California, it\u2019s 80% lower. And even in a state like Wyoming, which gets 96% of its electricity from coal, EV carbon emissions are still 17% lower than gasoline-powered cars (although they\u2019re 50% higher than hybrids).\nMoreover, EV carbon emissions will only decline as clean energy continues to expand due to its aforementioned rapidly-falling costs and widespread adoption. At some point, the US will inevitably implement climate legislation that includes a price on carbon pollution, which will accelerate clean energy deployment faster yet.\nCost and battery range have been the two barriers to widespread EV adoption. However, both have rapidly improved over the past several years. In 1996, the GM EV1 was the first modern mass-produced EV. It had a range of approximately 100 miles (160 km) per charge at an estimated price of $34,000 ($50,000 in 2016 dollars), which amounts to $500 per mile of range. Tesla produced its first car \u2013 the Roadster \u2013 starting in 2008, with a range of 244 miles (393 km) at a price of around $100,000 ($410 per mile). Nissan first sold its electric Leaf in 2011 for $33,600 with an 84-mile (135 km) range ($400 per mile).\nAll three companies have since dramatically improved their EV prices per mile of range. The 2018 Nissan Leaf sells for $30,000 with a 150-mile (240 km) range ($200 per mile). The Tesla Model 3 will sell for $35,000 with a 220-mile (354 km) range or $44,000 with a 310-mile (500 km) range ($140\u2013160 per mile). The Chevy Bolt sells for $36,620 with a 238-mile (383 km) range ($154 per mile).\nThe price per mile of range has fallen by about 60% in less than a decade, excluding tax credits (which survived the recent tax bill) and additional state incentives that make EVs more affordable to consumers. Crucially, with the introduction of the Chevy Bolt and Tesla Model 3, ranges of reasonably affordable EVs have more than doubled over the past few years. These trends will continue \u2013 carmakers have invested $90 billion in batteries and EVs, and most of the major auto companies plan to roll out numerous new EV and hybrid models over the next few years.\nEVs also have the benefit of lower fuel and maintenance costs. In the US, fueling a 30 mpg sedan costs twice as much as charging a comparable EV, on average. For the average American driver (13,500 miles per year), the switch would amount to about $600 in fuel savings per year. And EVs have fewer fluids to change and moving parts to break; maintenance rarely amounts to more than rotating tires and changing air filters.\nAmerican power generation is already rapidly decarbonizing. To fulfill its responsibility for helping the world stay below the 2\u00b0C temperature guardrail, the transportation sector is America\u2019s next clear big target. It\u2019s an area where the country\u2019s carbon pollution hasn\u2019t improved since the turn of the century, and where rapidly improving technology can make a big difference. All major automakers recognize that the shift from fossil-fueled cars to EV is inevitable, and are investing accordingly.\nA price on carbon pollution would accelerate the transition. US gasoline prices remain low at around $2.50 per gallon, which leads to more Americans buying cars with low fuel efficiency. 97% of US car sales are still purely gasoline-powered. The transition to EVs is proceeding slowly, but it\u2019s coming, and it will be a big part of any future American efforts to meet climate targets.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/electric-cars", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/travel-and-transport", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Dana Nuccitelli: Nearly 60% of US carbon pollution comes from power and transportation, and power is already decarbonizing fast", "date_published": {"$date": 1516618848000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518629436000}, "authors": ["Dana Nuccitelli"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "Electric", "hybrid and low-emission cars", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Travel and transport", "Coal", "Energy", "Fossil fuels", "Tesla", "Technology", "Nissan", "Paris climate agreement", "COP 21: UN climate change conference | Paris", "Donald Trump"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jan/22/switching-to-electric-cars-is-key-to-fixing-americas-critically-insufficient-climate-policies", "og:description": "Dana Nuccitelli: Nearly 60% of US carbon pollution comes from power and transportation, and power is already decarbonizing fast", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34f604eab163531c4af229b3f6bca7fcd93c49ce/0_40_3967_2381/master/3967.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=fd064fd7445046773a0a76c6e8369c33", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Switching to electric cars is key to fixing America's 'critically insufficient' climate policies | Dana Nuccitelli"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34f604eab163531c4af229b3f6bca7fcd93c49ce/0_40_3967_2381/master/3967.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=458d06abca739d0f9f946e92be05968a", "width": "3967", "height": "2381", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34f604eab163531c4af229b3f6bca7fcd93c49ce/0_40_3967_2381/master/3967.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a413de7b1ca49a3c61d24d1e21e52acc", "description": "A Tesla car recharges at a charging station at Cochran Commons shopping center in Charlotte, N.C.\nPhotograph: Chuck Burton/AP"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b179a00050b51e77cb4657a54522c9bce3b1380/0_0_1409_957/master/1409.png?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7477f5ffa8a78480664edc6a6016eb68", "width": "1409", "height": "957", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b179a00050b51e77cb4657a54522c9bce3b1380/0_0_1409_957/master/1409.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f3185ced66f0f93da840a6dba40b8095", "description": "US Energy Information Administration data on carbon pollution from the transportation and power sectors since 1973 (2017 estimated from the first 9 months of data) Illustration: Dana Nuccitelli"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a4b64a6cf111706a1d58363031cabe1d434f573/0_0_628_607/master/628.png?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd5a543eb70844265107bfdde8a3d429", "width": "628", "height": "607", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a4b64a6cf111706a1d58363031cabe1d434f573/0_0_628_607/master/628.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f894569c96d8b02d00562188370e2fe9", "description": "Emissions for different types of passenger vehicles based on electricity sources in California (top) and the US national average (bottom) Illustration: US Department of Energy Alternative Fuels Data Center"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/804cfa11df89e297abf62a1e6a08a245116b3974/0_0_1408_959/master/1408.png?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d95de15e40778ea88a1b42a29c7cfc39", "width": "1408", "height": "959", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/804cfa11df89e297abf62a1e6a08a245116b3974/0_0_1408_959/master/1408.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=53a134d3e2eaa4f693e4da5b84561360", "description": "Sales price per mile of range for key EVs introduced by GM, Tesla, and Nissan.

WTF? In the words of Hansen, 2C will make the world ungovernable. \nNoting changes thus far to the cryosphere, coral reefs, the dramatic increase in extreme heat and increase in monetary cost of natural disasters, it's absurd to think we can almost double warming the current warming of 1.1C and remain within a supposed \"guardrail\". 2C is BS.\nAccording to Mann, if one factors in aerosols, 2C corresponds to 405 ppm CO2. And what is the current value of global mean CO2? Yep! 405 ppm. LMAO @ the Guardian's 2C BS.\nAnd then there's the uncertainties associated with that guardrail - WAIS collapse is already underway, will permafrost melt rapidly increase? How will the heat distribution of the oceans play out? The emissions scenario of RCP2.6 is the only scenario that aims to keep warming below 2C, yet it carries a 40% uncertainty that warming will exceed 2C and 15% that it exceeds 3C. \nBut where are people's dysfunctional heads at? I comment about a safe climate at the end of a climate change associated article and the reply is Huh? FFS. Mass ignorance.\nAnyhow, here have some quotes from a published paper:\"In the 1960s summertime extremes of more than three standard deviations warmer than climatology were practically absent, covering less than 1% of the Earth\u2019s land surface.\"\n\"By 2020, the global land area experiencing temperatures of 3-sigma or more will have doubled (covering \u223c10%) and by 2040 quadrupled (covering \u223c20%). Over the same period, more-extreme events will emerge: 5-sigma events, which are now essentially absent, will cover a small but significant fraction (\u223c3%) of the global land surface by 2040. These near-term projections are practically independent of emission scenario.\"\n\"Under the low emission scenario (RCP2.6), the number of extremes stabilizes at 2040-levels. This implies that in the tropics, including South America, western Africa and the Maritime continent, 3-sigma heat effectively becomes the new norm (about 50% of summer months, see figure 3) and 5-sigma heat will be common (about 20% of summer months). In the extra-tropics, 3-sigma extremes will also increase, occurring for example in western Europe in roughly 20% of summer months, but 5-sigma events will still be essentially absent. In the southern hemisphere, the increase in monthly heat extremes is essentially independent on the season.\"\nFcuk 2C and all those who sail in her.", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "111251909", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "111270985", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516821299000}, "author": "John Samuel", "author_id": "13496713", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nthis child has just categorically shit on the the floor for you to clean up \nBQEND\nHappy to fix your ignorance for you.

Why, for example,in response to the fact that the proportion of US wealth owned by the top 0.1 earners has increased by 80% in recent years, would you reply with a little story about a man's wealth increasing by 1%? Why have you decided to ignore the remaining 79%?Moreover, you simply continue to miss the point by ignoring facts in favour of sweet narratives. According to Credit Suiss (a multinational bank, not a \"class warrior), the US, althought the worlds biggest economy, has the poorest (not relative to the rich, but in absolute terms) middle class in the advanced Capitalist world. US wealth is in the form of the holdings of the tiny few- take those out, and the bottom 90% have lower incomes that almost any developed nation. They continue to buy heavily because of phenomenal (and in the long-term, unsustainable) levels of household debt.Some more facts ( I know you don't like facts, preferring the ideological certainties of stories and rude labels, but here you go): Since the mid seventies, US productivity has risen by 133%. Hourly compensation for those jobs has risen by 19%. The proportion of the US 'cake' owned by the top 0.1% has risen seven-fold since the late '70's neocon revolution stared in Reagan's office. Middle class incomes (not proportion, but income) has remained roughly the same. Most of the wealth of the top few are in the form of stocks, land and mutual funds, all of which were greatly helped by the anti-regulation 'neo-con' economic plan. So currently, the retirement funds of the top 100 CEO's is roughly the same in value as the retirement funds of just under HALF of the US population.Enough facts. The US middle classes might not realise they are poorer (and less socially mobile) than most other western nations, but they DO know their incomes are stagnant, at best. This is partly why Trump's rhetoric has hit a nerve. This economic system, so praised by you, is fuelling massive resentment, and your best explanation is that the dumb middle-classes are being hoodwinked by \"class are Progressives\" whispering lies into their ears. In short, for most Americans since the mid-seventies, THE CAKE SLICE ITSELF IS SMALLER. even if you ignore the exponential growth in the wealth of the top, the average American has a much smaller slice of cake than the average European. You think they should shut up and be happy that they aren't being asked to drive a less polluting car- which you seem to think is MUCH more important to them then the fact that their money has been stolen from them by the neo-liberal elite fro the last thirty years. You think anyone who questions this wealth-grab from the middle-classes is a rabid \"progressive\" trouble-maker; which means that not only Trump supporters, but Conservative think-tanks and the wealthy at Davos conference this week (who are discussing the long-term economic unsustainability of US, and global, exponentially-increasing wealth disparity) are conducting a \"class war\".As I said before, Bernie, unless you're in the top 1%, you've been sold a lemon. And neither empty rhetoric about nasty \"progressives\" nor cute stories about small businesses employing 20 people (as if that were even remotely relevant to CEO's with billion dollar share options) is fooling anyone- even if you do think talking about the evils of small cars is going to distract people from the facts.", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "111233400", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "phenomenal", "effect": "to buy heavily"}]}, {"id": "111246382", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516791051000}, "author": "Wolframite", "author_id": "16262897", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "According to Gordon Brown, it's too late, and our last opportunity was 9 years ago.", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "111246161", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "111246306", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516790978000}, "author": "Walsunda", "author_id": "12483673", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\"Alarmists have been deserted by long term trend data and are left desperately scrambling for ad-hoc weather, events, pathetic.\"\nI don't know who these alarmists are?

Amid public outcry the government said it would extend funding for one of the program\u2019s projects; a one-of-a-kind research lab located some 1,100 km from the North Pole. \nWhile the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory now has funding until the fall of 2019, the six remaining projects are bracing for their funding to dry up in March. \nThe loss of these projects will be felt globally, says the letter. Canada\u2019s scientists are uniquely positioned to research the Arctic, arguably the world\u2019s most critical region when it comes to quantifying how and why the climate is changing, said signatory Gloria Manney, a senior research scientist at the Northwest Research Associates in the US. \u201cContinuous, stable funding support for Canadian atmospheric and climate science is thus crucial to advancing understanding of our planet.\u201d\nAs the Trump administration seeks to devalue climate science, Canada\u2019s commitment to climate research is needed now more than ever, said signatory Benjamin D Santer, a senior climate researcher at the US Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. \u201cThe world is looking to Canada for political leadership that the United States is currently unable to provide,\u201d he said.\nWhile Trudeau government\u2019s stated support for climate science and the Paris climate agreement has been encouraging, \u201csuch support cannot be limited to fine-sounding words\u201d, he said. \u201cIt must be backed by a real commitment to preserve and sustain the unique climate measurement, climate monitoring, and climate modeling capabilities that Canada possesses.\u201d\nIn response to the letter, Canada\u2019s minister of science pointed to the additional C$70m her government had set aside for climate research in the last budget, adding to the C$37m provided annually by federal research granting councils. \u201cWe are doing more to combat climate change than any Canadian federal government in history,\u201d Kirsty Duncan said in a statement. \u201cOur government will continue to support and invest in the actions necessary to address climate change.\u201d \nWeaver welcomed these efforts, but he said they should be paired with long term funding for research. \u201cIf Canada isn\u2019t contributing this key piece of the puzzle, no one else can,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe Trudeau government is taking concrete actions on climate and science in a variety of ways, but it\u2019s missing a critical piece,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what this is all about \u2013 ensuring that this gap is filled in some way or another.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "In a letter to Justin Trudeau,

"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "For fans disappointed that the next series of Game of Thrones won\u2019t be on our screens until 2019, here\u2019s some food for thought: an attack on Westeros would be most likely to come from the south in winter and north in summer, according to a climate model of the world of Game of Thrones.\nFurthermore, the model also sheds light on many mysteries surrounding the climate of the lands of Westeros and Essos \u2013 including the likely hibernation zones of White Walkers and the similarities between The Wall and Lapland.\nYou might well wonder why I and other climate science colleagues from Cardiff and Southampton universities have recently spent some of our spare time creating climate models of a fictional world.\nAfter all, is it helpful to know, as the model suggests, that due to the nature of the winds between Westeros and Essos, an attack on Westeros (whether by dragons, ships or both), would probably come via the south (from Dorne or Storm\u2019s End) in winter, but more northerly (Vale of Arryn, or direct to King\u2019s Landing), in summer?\nAnd what of the revelation from the model that that the Iron Fleet\u2019s naval prowess can be explained by very strong winds in the region of the Iron Islands? Or the knowledge that the temperatures predicted by the model indicate that in summer, the only places north of The Wall that are below freezing are the high-altitude regions of the Frostfangs, perhaps indicating the likely summer hibernation zones of White Walkers? \nApart from the fact that we found it fascinating to flesh out this fictional world with our model, it\u2019s also a nice way to illustrate how climate models work and to highlight some fascinating climate science going on in the real world. For example, the SWEET project is currently using novel techniques to reconstruct the climate of super-warm states of Earth\u2019s past \u2013 which in turn will help to test state-of- the-art climate models under conditions of high atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations similar to those expected by the end of this century.\nIn our Game of Thrones model, by comparing the climate of places in the real world with those predicted by the model for the world of Game of Thrones, it could be seen that The Wall, where the land of Westeros is guarded from the White Walkers, has a climate in winter similar to that of Lapland. In contrast Casterly Rock, the stronghold of the scheming Lannisters, has a climate similar to that of Houston, Texas, and Changsha in China.\nBut how did we create the model in the first place? When carrying out this \u201cwork\u201d, which is written up in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of King\u2019s Landing and the Twitter account of @ClimateSamwell, the first step was to modify a \u201cnormal\u201d climate model so that the land and ocean was laid out as in the maps provided by George RR Martin in the Game of Thrones books.\n \nThe model was then modified to have the characteristic \u201cextended seasons\u201d, which the books and TV series describe as lasting several years. In the real world, the tilt of the spinning axis of the planet is at a fixed angle throughout the year, resulting in our characteristic four seasons. One way that seasons can be made to last longer is to allow this tilt of the spinning axis to change throughout the year, so that the Earth \u201ctumbles\u201d on its axis \u2013 a bit like a spinning top. If the Earth tumbles exactly once in a single year, then the spin axis always points towards (or away) from the sun, and the winter (or summer) is then permanent.\nInterestingly, a very similar tumble \u2013 but occurring on much longer timescales of tens of thousands of years \u2013 causes major changes to the climate of our own planet. For example, 6,000 years ago it resulted in plants in the middle of what is today\u2019s Sahara desert, and contributed to the ice age cycle that caused much of the UK to be covered in thick ice 20,000 years ago.\nWe also modelled the global warming that would occur if concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were to be doubled, perhaps due to increases in CO2 and methane emissions from dragons and the excessive use of wildfire. The model estimates a global warming of 2.1C for a doubling of CO2 in the world of Game of Thrones. \nThe work illustrates that because climate models are based on fundamental scientific processes \u2013 many of which have been known since the days of Isaac Newton \u2013 they are able not only to simulate the climate of the modern Earth, but can also be easily adapted to simulate any planet past, present, future, or imagined, as long as the underlying continental positions and greenhouse gas concentrations are known. \nFurthermore \u2013 and this is what I do in my \u201cday job\u201d \u2013 for some super-warm time periods in Earth\u2019s past, there is geological data available that indicates what the climate actually was like, so we are able to test the climate models under high carbon dioxide conditions, similar to those we might expect by the end of this century if we continue emitting greenhouse gases at the current rate. \nSuch testing of climate models under super-warm greenhouse conditions is crucial if we are to have confidence in their predictions of the future \u2013 either for Earth or Westeros. \nMore tweets and the full range of climate gifs and media, can be found on Twitter @ClimateSamwell ", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones", "https://www.theguardian.com/books/george-rr-martin", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "We modelled the climate for George RR Martin\u2019s series for fun, but there\u2019s a serious side to predicting weather for a fictional world", "date_published": {"$date": 1516694403000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627272000}, "authors": ["Dan Lunt"], "article_section": "Science", "article_tags": ["Geography", "Climate change", "Science", "Climate change", "Game of Thrones", "Culture", "George RR Martin", "Books", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2018/jan/23/why-the-climate-of-game-of-thrones-is-about-more-than-the-arrival-of-winter", "og:description": "We modelled the climate for George RR Martin\u2019s series for fun, but there\u2019s a serious side to predicting weather for a fictional world", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5a2c8c9fdb50f84d5dff09bee52668fee73acda/0_153_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=f94aa06bad7da42b1619e069703f9fb2", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Why the climate of Game of Thrones is about more than the arrival of winter"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5a2c8c9fdb50f84d5dff09bee52668fee73acda/0_153_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5a713e923f9a49f087672af8998a6806", "width": "4500", "height": "2700", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5a2c8c9fdb50f84d5dff09bee52668fee73acda/0_153_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c0cdc47ca3d8cb6fdccbd64d419a0f35", "description": "Have climate modellers managed to pinpoint the summer hibernation zone of the Night King and his White Walkers?\nPhotograph: Helen Sloan/2017 Home Box Office, Inc.

The UK is also part of the European main-land - has a small isolated ice-sheet in the north - in addition to the two main ice-sheets located in Europe and in Scandinavia - etc etc etc. \nSo the fun fact one does with all these data is that one can for example go and change one of these things/leave other things out - and see what makes the biggest impact on the dynamics. Fair to say - that big thick thing in North America is high enough to push the jet-stream, for example. So what one can do is to study if it is the change in topography that is more important - or if it is the change in albedo that is most important - for example. \nGoing even further back - it is interesting that the big ice-cycles over the last 2.5 million years (earlier called \"quarternary\" coincide with the creation of a land-bridge between the North and South America. In the process shutting down water exchange between the Pacific and Atlantic just north of Equator. Something that is quite important - because it disrupt the north-south pole-to pole ocean circulation (the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Hence models are excellent in analysing what happens when one gradually (over millions of year) shawl the ocean where Latin America is at present. \nGoing even further back - it is know that Antarctica started to grow substantially associated with the opening of the Drake Passage between South America and the Antarctic continent. So one obviously want to look at the dynamics associated with the ocean can start to run circum-Antarctic - compared to what happened when it could not do this. \nNow - to model this one also have to reconfigure the continents (North Atlantic was still opening at the time - it was a huge shallow ocean-connection between the North Atlantic and the Indian Ocean (not \"Mediterranean\" but the final stages of the Tethys ocean closing) while India was loading up to crash into Asia and start to lift up the Tibetan plateau to its current 4-5 km above sea-level - and fold up the Himalayan mountains to reach 8 km altitude. \nThis is no different than to shape continents as outlined by a fantasy book for fun - to see how the physics would work on such a hypothetical configuration (and assuming that the physics in GoT is not massively influenced by magic). \nWe have to acknowledge that the maps of GoT are not global though. It is a bit like making a climate model from a 13th century map - not knowing about America, such that the Pacific Ocean stretched from China - all the way to Europe. If we wish to be nerdy. \nI find this as a lovely example of how models are used to make sense of geological/paleoclimatic findings in a dynamical context (it is really difficult to reconstruct the dynamics from paleo-climatology - instead one have static patterns that one can backtrack to a dynamical context - and that is tested with models - to shed light on the total constellation of stuff. One can even use the models to start looking for evidence at some location - because models say that \"in this situation it should be very wet/dry/warm/cold/windy (etc) in this region\" - so geologists/palaeontologists/paleaoclimatologists etc can be guided to look for such parameters in the region from the time in question. \nIf one find something else - there is something lacking in the understanding.

Already, this market is worth about $50bn globally, but experts said on Tuesday this sum could double within the next three to four years.\nIn a report to be presented on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Business and Sustainable Development Commission found that private sector investors could take advantage of blended finance to gain access to rapidly growing markets in the developing world.\nThe commission has set up a taskforce specifically to consider blended finance and how to encourage growth in the sector. In its report, the taskforce found that there was great fragmentation across the market and called for public and private investors to pool their resources to create more giant funds, worth more than \u00a31bn each, to take over from the smaller funds, of about $100m in size, which currently dominate the blended finance landscape.\nThere would still be a place for smaller funds, the taskforce said, but the creation of very large finance vehicles would facilitate bigger projects than are currently possible.\nLord Malloch-Brown, the former UK diplomat who chairs the commission, said: \u201cAction is needed end-to-end across the whole investment system to scale up the use of blended finance, if we are serious about closing the funding gap for the sustainable development goals.\u201d\nHe said gaining more private capital would be essential to achieving the sustainable development goals, especially regarding infrastructure in emerging economies.\nThe commission found that the market for blended finance had already doubled in size in the last five years, and that countries in the developing world wishing to take advantage of the funds available should prioritise investment in infrastructure that would increase resilience to climate change and provide environmentally sound economic development.\nThe group estimated that about $6tn a year would be needed to meet the sustainable development goals fully, and that a large proportion of this could be met by blended finance, if the market for the latter is spurred on by governments and companies.\nJeremy Oppenheim, founder of Systemiq, a financial institution focusing on sustainable development, and programme director at the Business and Sustainable Development Commission, said private sector banks and other financial institutions could benefit by pooling their resources with organisations from the public sector, such as development banks.\n\u201cThere is a window of opportunity for institutional investors to increase their exposure to emerging markets infrastructure by taking advantage of the risk mitigation offered by blended finance,\u201d said Oppenheim. \u201cMomentum is growing \u2013 it is possible that the blended finance market could double again in the next three to four years.\u201d\nThe paper produced by the taskforce, entitled Better Finance, Better World, is now open to consultation, which will be completed by the middle of March. After that, a report taking the responses to the consultation into account will be produced at the April meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.\nThe Business and Sustainable Development Commission was set up to further the sustainable development goals, and is funded by public sector organisations including the UN and World Bank, philanthropic bodies such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and private sector companies including Unilever.\nThe sustainable development goals were adopted in 2015 by the UN, and include goals on ending poverty, protecting the planet and its resources, and ensure the long-term prosperity of humanity.

Just one more. There\u2019s also the International Journal of Environmental Sciences which \u201cexpecpt high quality research articles\u201d that are free from plagiarism, but maybe not typos. \nThese journals, and hundreds more like them, are mostly based in the Indian subcontinent or China and are part of a ballooning online industry offering to give academics a place to publish their work in return for a fee and minimal, if any, quality control.\nSome have been identified as \u201cpredatory\u201d because of the way they target academics, often through spam emails, without properly disclosing fees or claiming to provide a peer review service that would give their research the scrutiny needed. \nJournals that are \u201copen access\u201d make their money by charging academics or institutions a fee for peer reviewing and checking submitted academic manuscripts, and then publishing them. There are many reputable publishers working this way.\nBut this murky world has a predator of its own \u2013 climate science deniers looking to take advantage of the questionable quality controls in return for getting their work published in what the publishers claim are \u201cpeer-reviewed journals\u201d but that, in reality, are not.\nOne climate science denier has targeted at least six journals for his research claiming that sea levels around Fiji and other Pacific islands are not rising. \n[None of the research] would have passed the reviewing process for more reputable journals\nThe author of the research, Dr Nils-Axel M\u00f6rner, has acknowledged that the work was paid for by the CO2 Coalition, a climate science denial group that has links to the US president Donald Trump\u2019s administration (coalition member Kathleen Hartnett-White is Trump\u2019s pick to head the White House Council on Environmental Quality and a director, Prof Will Happer, has been touted as a potential chief science adviser to the president). \nAccording to Prof Kurt Lambeck, a geophysicist and sea level expert at the Australian National University, none of the research \u201cwould have passed the reviewing process for more reputable journals\u201d.\nOne journal targeted by M\u00f6rner was the Bangalore-based International Journal of Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences which describes its mission thus: \u201cWe encourage authors, who always have shown more interest to publish his work in the prestigious journals, and avail them the freely to the scientific community.\u201d\nAnother of the publishers used by M\u00f6rner, known as Juniper Publishers, was one of those to be caught in a hoax in 2017 when it accepted a \u201cDr Doll\u201d on to its editorial board. Dr Doll was a fake veterinary surgeon created by Curtin University\u2019s Prof Mike Daube with a profile based on his dog, a Staffordshire terrier.\nDaube told the Huffington Post he had orchestrated the hoax \u201cto expose shams of this kind, which prey on the gullible, especially young or naive academics and those from developing countries\u201d.\nThe US government\u2019s Federal Trade Commission has brought deception charges against one of the world\u2019s biggest \u201copen access\u201d publishers, Omics International. The FTC has accused the Hyderabad-based Omics Group of what amounts to deceptive marketing practices among the more than 700 \u201copen access\u201d journals it publishes and the 3,000 \u201cconferences\u201d it organises.\nAmong the accusations, the FTC alleges that Omics fails to carry out genuine peer review, uses the names of academics without their consent and uses other academics names to promote conferences when those academics have not agreed to appear. Omics has denied all charges. \nOmics also took on a climate science denier to be the editor-in-chief of its journal Environment Pollution and Climate Change, which published a handful of odd papers arguing that climate change wasn\u2019t being caused by humans.\nProf Steve Sherwood, director of the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre, described one of the papers as \u201claughable\u201d.\nDr Arthur Viterito, a retired college geography professor, is also a policy adviser to the notorious Heartland Institute \u2013 famed for its billboard campaign comparing people who accepted human-caused global warming to a serial killer. To be fair, it did issue an important qualifier that, \u201cof course, not all global warming alarmists are murderers or tyrants\u201d.\nViterito told me via email earlier this month that he had \u201cagreed to assume the role as editor-in-chief for one year and my year was up\u201d and that he would now go on to concentrating on his research. \nOmics and its associated companies also organise hundreds of meetings and conferences each year. \nM\u00f6rner managed to organise one meeting, through Omics, in Rome in October 2017, and then load the program with fellow climate science deniers.\nOne email sent to several Australian climate scientists by Omics company ConferenceSeries LLC was designed to entice them to attend the Rome conference. Here is the how that irresistible word salad read: \nClimate Change 2017 is specifically premeditated with a unifying axiom providing pulpit to widen the imminent scientific creations. The main theme of the conference is \u2018Today\u2019s Progress and Tomorrow\u2019s Climate Challenges\u2019 which covers a broad array of vitally key sessions.\nWhile all the serious Australia climate scientists seemed bemused by this \u201cunifying axiom\u201d the meeting did go ahead and, according to the estimates of two people who attended, there were between 80 and 100 people in the room at the start (somewhere short of the \u201cmore than 500\u201d that Omics had said in its marketing that it expected).\nI was appalled by the first speaker, who was indeed a climate denier, much to my surprise\nIn an interview posted on YouTube, M\u00f6rner said the conference had been a great success and expressed his delight at being able to expose junior academics to the views of deniers. \u201cEverybody left happy,\u201d he said.\nProf Joseph Tomain, a law professor from the University of Cincinatti, didn\u2019t leave happy. He left shortly after the first tea break.\nTomain was the second speaker at the meeting but accepted he should have checked the credentials of the organisers more carefully before agreeing to travel.\n\u201cI was appalled by the first speaker, who was indeed a climate denier, much to my surprise,\u201d Tomain told me via email. \u201cAt the break, I spoke with other attendees who were clearly in the same camp. Quite honestly, it was not my cup of tea and after that break I decided to enjoy Rome rather than stay stuck at a Holiday Inn on its outskirts.\u201d\nDr John Hunter, a sea level expert at the University of Tasmania, told me there was a \u201csystemic problem\u201d in academia where younger scientists were being pushed to publish more papers which had \u201clowered the standards of submitted papers\u201d.\n\u201cThere has been an explosion of online journals, and also the ability to publish hardcopy journals far cheaper than previously. As well as producing good journals, this has led to a proliferation of \u2018predatory\u2019 and \u2018vanity\u2019 journals with poor reviewing standards.\u201d \nBut the effort to target these journals is also a neat way to sidestep the legitimate and valid criticism levelled at deniers that many have little to no history of publishing research in peer-reviewed journals.\nNow, anyone can publish anything in a journal with a name that sounds official but in fact offers none of the checks and balances of legitimate journals.\nThat\u2019s how a paper with the title Get Me Off Your Fucking Mailing List can be accepted for publication in the International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology, or the Urology &amp; Nephrology Open Access Journal published by MedCrave (another publisher targeted by M\u00f6rner) can be easily hoaxed with a paper about a non-existent condition based on a 1991 episode of Seinfeld and written by Dr Martin van Nostrand (let\u2019s Google that for them).\nThat\u2019s also how papers that dismiss the well-established science linking between fossil fuel burning to dangerous climate change can get published in an \u201cinternational\u201d and \u201cpeer-reviewed\u201d journal.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change-scepticism", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Deniers have found a platform in emerging publications that publish without rigorous review", "date_published": {"$date": 1516754332000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627428000}, "authors": ["Graham Readfearn"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Environment", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Science", "Climate change scepticism"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2018/jan/24/murky-world-of-science-journals-a-new-frontier-for-climate-deniers", "og:description": "Deniers have found a platform in emerging publications that publish without rigorous review", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32c6754e5067aabd1474ab6ab66a4f063d54956e/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=d15da32aed47d3495435366fbd824b2a", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Murky world of 'science' journals a new frontier for climate deniers | Graham Readfearn"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32c6754e5067aabd1474ab6ab66a4f063d54956e/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9f8507db37f14353b8d6ac227f4cb6bb", "width": "5184", "height": "3110", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32c6754e5067aabd1474ab6ab66a4f063d54956e/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0e55a1ff06ca367edb5ff01a969e70d9", "description": "\u2018These journals, and hundreds more like them \u2026 are part of a ballooning online industry offering to give academics a place to publish their work in return for a fee and minimal, if any, quality control.\u2019\nPhotograph: Alamy"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556127457462}, "comments": [{"id": "111368107", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1517012996000}, "author": "Cameron Telford", "author_id": "12067569", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "I mean it's your life.

Do you understand that?\nI was going to reproduce your paragraph about expensive instruments that are supposed to measure temperatures of the troposphere but got overcome by your bombast.\nSuffice to say that the troposphere is the lowest region of the atmosphere, extending from the Earth's surface to a height of 6-10 km, and we have been making accurate measurements of the lowest layer of the troposphere, the region we live in, for more than 40 years. Also it is worth mentioning that an instrument no matter how expensive is only good if it measures what is important and an instrument a long way above the troposphere measuring the atmosphere at the tops of the worlds highest mountains may have not be that useful. If the accuracy and cost of the instruments being used to gather data is you yardstick of the value of what they measure, it's worth noting that some of the instruments used in measuring palaeo-temperatures don't come cheap nor lack for accuracy. The problems, like those off the ground for tropospheric measurements arise in the ground from other factors. The 800,000 year Vostok dome data set cannot have anything to do with ancient tree rungs given the Antarctic Plateau climate of the last 20 million years, nor fossil foraminifera given its altitude.

You seem convinced an increase in atmospheric carbon is bad. I'd like to explore that with you.\nLet's set aside the unsupported allegation carbon released by humans causes an undesirable increase in average tropospheric temperature. We'll put that in the back pocket for a moment.\nAre you aware that CO&#8322; is required to sustain life on Earth? The critical level of that trace gas in our atmosphere is right around 180ppm (Parts Per Million). Below that value, even the most hardy plants die, having a ripple effect that kills all life. Only 30 years ago, the value of atmospheric CO&#8322; was at 280ppm, a mere 100ppm above certain planetary death.\nHad CO&#8322; moved in the opposite direction from what it has, falling 100ppm rather than rising by that amount, all life on Earth would have perished. The planetary atmosphere had been starved of CO&#8322; by the natural sequestration of that gas in fossil petrochemicals. There are complex reasons this happened, not least being the absence of lignum consuming microorganisms. But that's literally ancient history. The point is we almost died.\nCO&#8322; is a beneficial gas, in fact all life on Earth depends on it. Plants evolved in an atmosphere consisting of between 2000 and 4000 ppm CO&#8322;. Even today, commercial greenhouses maintain a CO&#8322; level at about 2000 ppm. CO&#8322; reduces the amount of water needed by plants and increases production. Images of Earth's deserts taken from orbit show the \"greening\" of our planet over the past 40 years, and rising levels of atmospheric CO&#8322; are implicated in that effect.\nIt's very important to understand the real science, and it's in your personal best interests to do so.", "recommendation_count": "2", "in_reply_to": "111323763", "causal_relations": [{"cause": null, "effect": "an undesirable increase in average tropospheric temperature"}]}, {"id": "111328671", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1516954789000}, "author": "John Samuel", "author_id": "13496713", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Huber and Knutti (2011) quantified that human attribution as being 74% and 122% due to humans (with a best estimate of around 100% human attribution).

The insolation peak caused enough warming to produce a meltwater peak which shut down the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation cutting the cooling of the Southern Ocean and leading top the oxidation of ocean oozes producing a 40% increase in atmospheric CO2 from 200 to 280 ppm and global greenhouse warming over the next 10,000 years causing the glacial period ice sheets to melt and retreat to more or less their current positions.\nFrom 9,000 ybp to 5,000 ybp the combined effect of the 280 ppm CO2 and the shoulder of the NHHLSI peak kept global climate temperatures slightly above that 2013 global climate temperature.

Prove it please and be sure to cite your sources.\"\nLawrence, the absence of data is all you'll get. Do you understand the scientific method? Allow me to explain it.\nA hypothesis is advanced, for example \"Carbon Dioxide released by humans causes tropospheric temperature to increase\". For the hypothesis to be scientific, it must be falsifiable. For each hypothesis there's also a null hypothesis, for example \"Carbon Dioxide released by humans has no measurable effect on tropospheric temperature\". With me so far?\nThe person(s) advancing the hypothesis then provide experimental evidence demonstrating their hypothesis has predictive power; that it in fact predicts the effect expected. They then present their experimental methodology and their results to the scientific community. If the community believes the results warrant duplicating the experiment for the purpose of validating the methods and results, they do so. They also publish their results, positive or negative. Over the course of time, if a sufficient number of independent observers reproduce the results, something we call a scientific consensus is formed. This isn't an opinion poll, it's a preponderance of evidence in support of the hypothesis.\nNo such evidence exists. No experiments have been presented. The absence of supporting evidence isn't the subject of learned publication.\nWe may however observe, as we have, that over the course of the past 20 years, during a time when over 30% of all carbon ever released by humans has been released, there's been no significant increase in tropospheric temperature.\nYou may be tempted to cite the recent excursion of tropospheric temperature over the past 3 years, directly attributable to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, or PDO. The PDO is a very well known and documented example of natural climate variation, it isn't caused by human activity. It would be disingenuous in the extreme to claim otherwise.\nThe lask of supporting evidence itself has no citation, however there are observations. If you'd like to follow this particular line of investigation I can refer you to the work of Dr. Roy Spencer of the University of Alabama at Huntsville, who is UAH's principal investigator of Climate Studies and also curator of the UAH satellite data that's been collected over the past 40 years (since 1978 I believe). Those data show no excursions of tropospheric temperature outside of known natural variation during the period I mention. None at all.\nI sincerely encourage you to investigate the subject more completely, and with an open mind. You seem extremely defensive.

If have data \"on hand\" which shows that atmospheric CO2 concentration has no measurable effect on climate you need to make that data available by publishing it in a peer reviewed paper in a proper scientific journal. \nThe vast majority of climate scientists know significant global warming and consequent climate change has occurred largely as a result of humans extracting and burning fossil fuels. They support the AGW (anthropogenic global warming) theory that explains the global warming of the last 150 years. A 40% increase in atmospheric CO2 from 19,000 to 9,000 years ago ended the last glacial period by causing global greenhouse warming and there is no valid reason why the 40% increase in atmospheric CO2 that has occurred in last 150 years will not also cause global greenhouse warming.\nTo stop the current global warming we need to reduce our CO2 emissions. This requires actions on the part of the politicians in our governments. When my daughter was Minister for Climate Change she carried out those actions as have the governments she has since been a member of. An activist is someone who attempts to influence politics. My daughter consulted scientists who understood global warming and the need to treat its cause by reducing net CO2 emissions. One was an old colleague of mine who by being a member of a government advisory board was a political activist as well as a scientists. So activists and scientists are not mutually exclusive categories. Scientists are activists in the field of how to treat the current global warming as they're the people who understand the science of global warming. So you are wrong in saying scientists aren't activists.\nPoliticians in ministerial positions have portfolios informed by a range of areas of academic and applied expertise. A minister for climate change needs to consult both scientists and economists in addressing the cause of the current global warming. The scientists they consult are being scientific activists and economists they consult are economic activists. People in democratic countries have every right to be activists. A quick glance at the publications linked to above shows that are largely those of scientists reflecting that the article that precedes this discussion board is about science publication and its imitators.\nYou say the \"majority\" of scientists \"aren't alarmists\" which means a minority are, which contradicts your blanket statement that \"scientists aren't exaggerating the dangers\" because if they're exaggerating the dangers they are by definition alarmists.

Everyone is very nervous and exited - because everyone knows that only around 5% of grant-applications will be funded. \nIf successful - as we can assume here - one also get all the budget cuts - because nobody will ever get the money that is needed. \n2 months later - let us call this start of year two - the project is formalised - with administration numbers and all the stuff that is needed - one on can, if lucky, advertise a PhD position. \nAt year 2.5 - one hopefully have the PhD position(s) filled - and they go straight into courses - taking exams, learning the labs and equipment, getting themselves a place to live - and all what comes with it. In the mean time - the core group work hard at getting logistics, permits, \"slots\" needed for the data-gathering/field-work/instrumentation etc. \nStart of year 3 - The field-work, data-harvesting, allocated time on supercomputers (whatever is defined and needed) goes into action. These brute force data gathering/computer time can last from weeks to months). \nYear 3.3.

Nearly half \u2013 46% \u2013 of the midwinter blooms were non-native.\n\u201cIf you believe the textbooks, only about 10% of the species we found in flower should be in flower,\u201d said Dr Kevin Walker, BSBI\u2019s Head of Science. \u201cIt could be climate change but it could also be because people didn\u2019t used to go and look for flowers in midwinter.\u201d\nAccording to Walker, urban areas tend to have more non-native flowering species than rural areas, with cities and towns providing more sheltered places with warm microclimates where plants that have escaped from gardens can thrive.\nPerhaps reassuring for lovers of a traditionally bleak winter, the 2018 tally was significantly lower than the 611 flowers recorded during the exceptionally mild winter of 2016.\nAnd there was no sign that the floral riches herald an early spring: only 14% of the species recorded were springtime specialists such as primrose and lesser celandine.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not finding plants flowering earlier, we\u2019re finding things are flowering later or just straggling on because the milder early winter is not killing them off with frosts,\u201d said Walker. \nMore than 1,000 people \u2013 a record number \u2013 participated in the plant hunt from Caithness to Guernsey, with pictures shared on social media, including BSBI\u2019s increasingly popular \u201cwildflower hour\u201d on Twitter on Sunday evenings. \nThe most floral place in Britain and Ireland during this bleak midwinter was Phillack in Cornwall, which boasted 114 different species in flower.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/plants", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change"], "description": "UK survey finds 532 types \u2013 far more than older textbooks suggest should be out", "date_published": {"$date": 1516820829000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627428000}, "authors": ["Patrick Barkham"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Wild flowers", "Plants", "Climate change", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/24/hundreds-of-wildflower-species-found-blooming-in-midwinter", "og:description": "UK survey finds 532 types \u2013 far more than older textbooks suggest should be out", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a42ec13b08e12d335fe272b985ce9ca48c279379/0_171_5121_3073/master/5121.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=c0378827c8720e65c1222deb35ef7caa", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Hundreds of wildflower species found blooming in midwinter"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a42ec13b08e12d335fe272b985ce9ca48c279379/0_171_5121_3073/master/5121.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1f19427c1df368a7b79e82dae52f52c6", "width": "5121", "height": "3073", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a42ec13b08e12d335fe272b985ce9ca48c279379/0_171_5121_3073/master/5121.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd43ba3b01af93e39f053a1b5843e05f", "description": "The daisy, Bellis perennis, was the most-spotted flower during the BSBI\u2019s plant hunt.\nPhotograph: Alamy Stock Photo"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc082b2a2c3613145ed8fcc"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/24/scotland-railway-lines-flooding-landslides-weather-winds-storm-georgina", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "The Edinburgh to Glasgow railway line and five others in Scotland have been affected by landslides and flooding, leading to delays and cancellations.\nLandslides took place on Wednesday along two commuter lines, including the main route between Glasgow Queen Street and Edinburgh, plus Glasgow Central to Carlisle and the Newcastle line via Dumfries.\nThe latest landslip led to the closure of the heavily used Edinburgh to Glasgow line near Winchburgh in West Lothian, forcing ScotRail to lay on replacement buses.\nThe incidents followed the closure of the West Highland line north of Fort William, after a train to Mallaig became stuck in a heavy landslide on Monday.\nTrains from Glasgow Central to Carlisle and Newcastle via Dumfries were delayed on Wednesday morning after a landslide affected services and the A76 near Kirkconnel, south-east of Kilmarnock. \nFlooding near Edinburgh earlier in the day had already delayed trains to and from Glasgow Queen Street, as well as services from Edinburgh to Dunblane and Stirling, while flooding and debris affected signals for trains near Livingston North, affecting services to Helensburgh and Glasgow Central.\nThe problems led to delays during the morning commute.

It has also made three successful tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles, the third of which, in November, appeared to be capable of reaching New York or Washington.\nAt the same time, Trump has engaged in a highly personalised exchange of insults with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. He has threatened \u201cfire and fury\u201d against the nation, and vowed to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d if Pyongyang continued to threaten the US American strategic bombers have flown north of the 38th parallel that divides the peninsula, along the North Korean coast.\nThe bulletin\u2019s scientists repeatedly singled out the Trump administration as a major factor behind the increased risks to the planet, pointing out the president\u2019s volatility as expressed in his tweets and statements; the inconsistency of the administration\u2019s foreign policy; and its apparent disdain for science, reflected in its high-level appointments, which have included climate change deniers.\n\u201cOur allies and adversaries alike are being forced [into a] thicket of conflicting policy statements, from a US administration weakened in its roster of foreign policy professionals and unable to develop, coordinate and clearly communicate a coherent foreign \u2013 much less nuclear \u2013 policy,\u201d said Robert Rosner, the chair of the bulletin\u2019s science and security board. \u201cThis inconsistency constitutes a major challenge for deterrence, alliance management and global stability.\u201d\nSharon Squassoni, a professor at George Washington University\u2019s institute for international science and technology policy also pointed to Russia\u2019s role in heightening tensions. Last year, for instance, it fielded ground-launched cruise missiles, violating the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty.\n\u201cRussia has engaged in provocative and illegal behaviours thought to be part of cold war history,\u201d Squassoni said. \nSome experts argue that the comparison with the height of the cold war was an exaggeration. \n\u201cDuring the height of the cold war there was a nontrivial risk of global nuclear annihilation,\u201d Vipin Narang, a North Korea and nuclear expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote in a tweet. \u201cToday, the risk of single use may be higher but it\u2019s unlikely to threaten global destruction.\u201d\nThe bulletin scientists said that climate change also weighed heavily in their deliberations. After flattening out for some years, global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise and the levels of the polar ice caps are at new lows. \n\u201cHere in the US, the incoming President Trump promptly appointed a cadre of avowed climate denialists and quickly started reversing existing climate measures,\u201d said Sivan Kartha, a senior scientist at the Stockholm Environmental Institute. \nTrump was also criticised for downgrading the science in his administration. Lawrence Krauss, the chair of the bulletin\u2019s board of sponsors, said that 2017 marked that the first time since the position was created more than a half-century ago that there was no presidential science adviser. \n\u201cThe White House office of science and technology policy is essentially not staffed,\u201d Krauss said. \u201cThe official mechanisms to tie public policy to reality are currently absent.\u201d ", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "In the face of nuclear weapons and climate change, scientists moved the clock forward, putting much of the blame on the Trump administration", "date_published": {"$date": 1516899276000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1530823608000}, "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "article_section": "World news", "article_tags": ["Nuclear weapons", "US news", "World news", "Donald Trump", "Environment", "Trump administration", "North Korea", "Climate change"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/25/doomsday-clock-ticked-forward-trump-nuclear-weapons-climate-change", "og:description": "In the face of nuclear weapons and climate change, scientists moved the clock forward, putting much of the blame on the Trump administration", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fb8ebbbfc0cb1bf5591e78eda83ee8a47d4c911/0_277_4154_2492/master/4154.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=34adc81cc5dc93b3126b7db2e293e733", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "'Doomsday Clock' ticked forward 30 seconds to 2 minutes to midnight"}, "headline": "0"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc082b5a2c3613145ed8fce"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/25/american-museum-of-natural-history-rebekah-mercer", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "The American Museum of Natural History is under pressure to sever its ties to Rebekah Mercer, one of Donald Trump\u2019s top donors who has used her family\u2019s fortune to fund groups that seek to undermine scientists\u2019 work on climate change.\nMore than 200 scientists have put their names to a letter that urges the museum to \u201cend ties to anti-science propagandists and funders of climate science misinformation\u201d and axe Mercer from its board of trustees, a position she has held since 2013.\nA separate missive also calling for Mercer\u2019s dismissal has been circulated among the museum\u2019s own curators amid growing concern that the New York institution risks having its mission subverted by Mercer.\nThe Mercer family is headed by billionaire rightwing benefactor Bob Mercer, a computer scientist and hedge fund CEO. In 2015, The Washington Post named Mercer one of the 10\u00a0most influential\u00a0billionaires in politics, and by conservative estimates he has\u00a0donated\u00a0more than $35m to political campaigns over the last 14 years.\nMercer also invested at least $10min the 'alt-right' news website Breitbart.com in 2011, anointing his relationship with the then executive chairman, Steve Bannon, the self-described \u201cnationalist\u201d who was a pivotal figure in Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign and briefly a strategist in the Trump White House.\nRebekah Mercer, Bob\u2019s daughter, mostly serves as the public face of his political donor activities. Bob himself is notoriously reclusive and has few public statements to his name.\nIn the bestselling book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, author Michael Wolff describes the Mercers as \u201ctak[ing] over\u201d the Trump campaign in August 2016 and \u201cinstalling\u201d Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway, now counsellor to the president, atop a floundering operation. \u201cTrump wouldn\u2019t be President if not for Bob,\u201d a former Mercer employee\u00a0told\u00a0The New Yorker.\nIn the wake of controversy over Bannon and rightwing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, Bob\u00a0distributed\u00a0his ownership stake in Breitbart to his daughters, including Rebekah, citing \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d.\nJamiles Lartey\nFreshly obtained donation records, shared with the Guardian, show that the Mercer Family Foundation, overseen by Rebekah and her billionaire hedge fund father, Robert, funneled more than $2m to organisations that actively deny or obfuscate mainstream climate science during the election year.\nThe donations include $800,000 to the Heartland Institute, a conservative group famous for its regular conferences for those who dismiss the scientific consensus that human activity is changing the climate, and half a million dollars to the Heritage Foundation, a free market group that promotes fossil fuel extraction and claims that spells of cold weather demonstrate that the planet is not warming. \nIn 2016, the Mercers funded two other groups for the first time \u2013 giving $125,000 to the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and $150,000 to the CO2 Coalition. Both groups seek to sow doubt over the consequences of climate change. The CO2 Coalition\u2019s chairman is William Happer, a Princeton University physicist who has been touted as a potential science adviser to Trump.\nThe Mercers were a crucial backroom force behind the political rise of Trump. Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, last year said: \u201cThe Mercers laid the groundwork for the Trump revolution.\u201d Brietbart News, the rightwing outlet previously run by Bannon, has also received large donations from the Mercer foundation.\n\u201cSince Trump\u2019s election, the Mercer family has been flushed out of the shadows and revealed to be major supporters of the climate denial machine,\u201d said Kert Davies, founder of a climate-focused transparency group who analysed the donations\u2019 declarations. \u201cTheir support for climate deniers appears to be growing over time.\u201d\nThe Mercer foundation\u2019s 2016 donations also include $200,000 directed to the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, a group founded by Arthur Robinson, a biochemist who helped set up a widely discredited petition of purported experts denying that global warming is harmful. \nThe signatories had no vetting, however, prompting green groups to add singer Geri Halliwell and the entire cast of M*A*S*H to the list. More recently, Robinson has been storing thousands of samples of human urine in the belief that he will find a way to extend lifespans. Rebekah Mercer has reportedly suggested to Trump that Robinson be the president\u2019s chief science adviser. \nIn their letter, concerned scientists and curators warned the American Museum of Natural History that while it is a \u201ctreasured and influential institution\u201d, it could suffer a \u201closs of public trust\u201d through its association with Mercer. As well as being a trustee, Mercer has donated more than $4m to the museum since 2012, records show.\n\u201cRebekah Mercer is one of the greatest funders of the bad faith attacks on climate science and climate scientists,\u201d said Michael Mann, a Pennsylvania State University climate scientist and one of the letter\u2019s signatories.\n\u201cIt is an abomination for her to be sitting on the board of trustees of any science-themed institution let alone one of the greatest natural history museums in the world.\u201d\n Katherine Hayhoe, another prominent climate scientist who signed the letter, said it is imperative that museums \u201cconvey \u2026 information accurately, without either explicit or implicit pressure to downplay or even alter the facts\u201d.\nMuseums and galleries have come under increasing scrutiny as they attempt to balance the need for funding with concerns over climate change. In 2015, the Science Museum in London said it would not continue a controversial sponsorship deal with Shell, although BP continues to back several of the city\u2019s major cultural institutions, such as the British Museum, National Portrait Gallery and the Royal Opera House.\nThis month, the American Museum of Natural History was criticised for an exhibit in its dinosaur wing that said warmer periods, such as the current one, are caused by variations in the Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun and that there is \u201cno reason to believe another ice age won\u2019t come\u201d. The wing is funded by David Koch, a high-profile funder of climate change denying groups, although the museum said Koch had no influence over the content, which was merely outdated.\n\u201cThis country is having a crisis of trust, museums are the last bastions of trust and we have to be very careful of preserving that,\u201d said Jon Foley, executive director of the California Academy of Sciences, which doesn\u2019t accept money from fossil fuels. \n\u201cThe American [Museum of Natural History] is one of the best museums in the world and it\u2019s sad that we are talking about this rather than their great work.\n\u201cIt\u2019s troubling if donors are supporting museums on one hand and funding anti-science on the other. Public science institutions need to pick people aligned to their mission, not just for their wealth. We are in a hypercharged atmosphere at the moment, science is under attack. This is an issue museums will have to navigate.\u201d\nFoley, not a signatory to the scientists\u2019 letter, said he gets calls \u201call the time\u201d from donors about exhibits based on issues such as climate change or evolution. \u201cThe job is to listen and relay that the exhibits are based on the best available science,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never let donors or trustees micromanage the content of exhibits.

That information can only come from the oceans, because almost all heat is stored there. If you want to understand global warming, you need to first understand ocean warming.\nThis isn\u2019t to say other measurements are not also important. For instance, measurements of the air temperature just above the Earth are really important. We live in this air; it affects us directly. A great commentary on 2017 air temperatures is provided by my colleague Dana Nuccitelli. Another measurement that is important is sea level rise; so too is ocean acidification. We could go on and on identifying the markers of climate change. But in terms of understanding how fast the Earth is warming, the key is the oceans. \nThis important ocean information was just released today by a world-class team of researchers from China. The researchers (Lijing Cheng and Jiang Zhu) found that the upper 2000 meters (more than 6000 feet) of ocean waters were far warmer in 2017 than the previous hottest year. We measure heat energy in Joules. It turns out that 2017 was a record-breaking year, 1.51 \u00d7 1022 Joules hotter than any other year. For comparison, the annual electrical generation in China is 600 times smaller than the heat increase in the ocean.\nThe authors provide a long history of ocean heat, going back to the late 1950s. By then there were enough ocean temperature sensors to get an accurate assessment of the oceans\u2019 warmth. Their results are shown in the figure below. This graph shows ocean heat as an \u201canomaly,\u201d which means a change from their baseline of 1981\u20132010. Columns in blue are cooler than the 1981-2010 period, while columns in red are warmer than that period. The best way to interpret this graph is to notice the steady rise in ocean heat over this long time period.\nWhat is interesting is that from year to year (or over the span of a few years), the heat in the oceans may increase or decrease. This is because there are natural fluctuations that can transfer extra energy to or from the waters. One such natural event is the well-known El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a cycle in the Pacific Ocean. During an El Ni\u00f1o, the Pacific Ocean tends to have very warm waters at the surface, which causes heat loss to the atmosphere (so the ocean cools and the atmosphere warms). Conversely, during a La Ni\u00f1a, the reverse process occurs. \nThere are other fluctuations and natural occurrences like volcanic eruptions and other changes in ocean currents. But it just means we don\u2019t want to take any one year as proof of global warming. The fact that 2017 was the oceans\u2019 hottest year doesn\u2019t prove humans are warming the planet. But, the long term upward trend that extends back many decades does prove global warming. The graph above is the most important image to show someone who denies the reality of a changing climate. \nIt\u2019s interesting to look at the top five years on record in terms of ocean heat; they are listed below.\nNote that these are the five hottest years ever recorded. Truly astonishing.\nThe authors went a bit further and investigated how the heat was input into the oceans by region. They found that in 2017, a lot of heat was deposited in the Atlantic and Southern Oceans. The authors also calculated that all this heat resulted in approximately 2 mm rise in sea level (as water warms, it expands and so that ocean levels rise). \nFurther consequences of this heating include declining oxygen levels in the oceans, bleaching of coral reefs, and melting of both sea ice and ice shelves (the latter of which which will also raise sea levels). We are observing these effects. Arctic ice is undergoing a long-term decline, and it\u2019s possible the Arctic will become ice-free. Massive coral bleaching events have been recorded, particularly in the waters off of Australia. The point is, the effects of global warming aren\u2019t just academic; they are real.\nThe consequences of this year-after-year-after-year warming have real impacts on humans. Fortunately, we know why the oceans are warming (because of human greenhouse gases), and we can do something about it. We can take action to reduce the heating of our planet by using energy more wisely and increasing the use of clean and renewable energy (like wind and solar power).", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oceans", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog"], "share_count": "0", "description": "John Abraham: The second-hottest year recorded at Earth\u2019s surface was the hottest in its oceans", "date_published": {"$date": 1516981389000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627270000}, "authors": ["John Abraham"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Oceans", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "Climate change", "Science"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jan/26/in-2017-the-oceans-were-by-far-the-hottest-ever-recorded", "og:description": "John Abraham: The second-hottest year recorded at Earth\u2019s surface was the hottest in its oceans", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f731b64c76a7eef42bc58410d8d9fdf6f42eeaef/0_97_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=c030aaac52753ce9a8e879acc96843b8", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "In 2017, the oceans were by far the hottest ever recorded | John Abraham"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "0", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f731b64c76a7eef42bc58410d8d9fdf6f42eeaef/0_97_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=44fec95e979dc7b90734acfe1b571c9d", "width": "4163", "height": "2498", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f731b64c76a7eef42bc58410d8d9fdf6f42eeaef/0_97_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4dce73b9ec79f457cc5e7eb133427419", "description": "A flare from an ocean-based oil rig burning LNG as part of its exploration activities.\nPhotograph: Dazman/Getty Images/iStockphoto"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d5165c25ea0f76c1840a73632380c5ae1320bc2/0_0_553_297/master/553.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=878edeed4ed4c33fd19dda6f5494569d", "width": "553", "height": "297", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d5165c25ea0f76c1840a73632380c5ae1320bc2/0_0_553_297/master/553.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=158c7e205996a3f0c178957e2e53e8af", "description": "Ocean heat content change since 1958.

This simple analogy explains climate lag. The mass of the oceans is around 500 times that of the atmosphere. The time that it takes to warm up is measured in decades. Because of the difficulty in quantifying the rate at which the warm upper layers of the ocean mix with the cooler deeper waters, there is significant variation in estimates of climate lag. A paper by James Hansen and others [iii] estimates the time required for 60% of global warming to take place in response to increased emissions to be in the range of 25 to 50 years.

This radiation is at much longer wavelengths than that of the solar radiation (greater than 10 micros, in the infrared range), because the ocean surface is far cooler that the sun's surface. The infrared radiation emitted from the ocean is quickly absorbed and re-emitted by water vapor and carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases residing in the lower atmosphere. Much of the radiation from the atmospheric gases, also in the infrared range, is transmitted back to the ocean, reducing the net long wave radiation heat loss of the ocean. The warmer the ocean the warmer and more humid is the air, increasing its greenhouse abilities. Thus it is very difficult for the ocean to transmit heat by long wave radiation into the atmosphere; the greenhouse gases just kick it back, notably water vapor whose concentration is proportional to the air temperature.

Your position is that it is man made. I am not convinced it is, for several reasons.\"\nThe debate about climate change and the cause of the recent global warming is over. It happen in peer reviewed papers published in proper scientific journals and like any debate in science came down to the evidence which showed that that almost all of the climate warming of the last 150 years was the result of net CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. As humans extracted and burnt that known amount of fossil fuel we know humans made the warming or as you say the warming was \"man made\". So you've missed the debate. You're too late. It's over.\nWhat you are talking about is the source of the CO2 that has caused the recent global warming. So what you are talking about is global warming and hence climate change. Saying what you're talking about or \"debating\" is not climate change, shows that you are confused as to what you're talking about.\nI doubt if Glacier has a \"position\" on the human causation of the current greenhouse warming but he would be familiar with evidence of the source of that atmospheric CO2 increase and the absence of any other factors that could have caused that warming. In other words he doesn't deny the existence of the evidence and what that evidence means in the light of our scientific knowledge.\nI have spoken in the post above about one instance of gravity denial and other more persistent forms of science denial. Climate science denial is not the only variety of science denial. People are not called science deniers because they disagree, disagreement is intrinsic to science but the ultimate arbiter of these scientific debates is the evidence collected by scientists. Science deniers don't accept that evidence for spurious reasons and in so doing deny the evidential basis of that scientific knowledge.\nEmails aren't data. They're correspondence. The correspondence associated with various projects through my working life are in a filing cabinet under my high set house. They are not data. All the data from that work has been lodged with my colleagues at various institutions or published in reports. The East Anglia University researchers were not found to have been cherry picking data or involved any form of scientific fraud.\nSo far your reasons for not accepting the ample evidence of the source of the current global greenhouse warming revolve around the use of the term denier to describe people who do deny the science and some beat up about stolen emails that went nowhere. Saying it due to CH4 from cows makes no sense in the light of a 40% increase in atmospheric CO2.\nThe reasons, you state for not being 100% convinced by the evidence, have nothing to do with the evidence. Scientific knowledge and scientific debates are respectively based on and decided by the evidence. Why aren't you considering the evidence? Are you denying the evidence and the science for spurious reasons?\nThe cure for obesity caused by ingesting too much food is to reduce the intake of food. The cure for global warming caused by emitting too much net CO2 is to reduce the emissions of net CO2. Throwing salt into clouds will lead to the salt absorbing the water from the clouds and will simply make the rain a bit saltier.\nA large number of the world's richest people, particularly those who inherited their wealth are opposed to government regulation.

US coal power production has dropped by 44% (866 terawatt-hours [TWh]). It\u2019s been replaced by natural gas (up 45%, or 400 TWh), renewables (up 260%, or 200 TWh), and increased efficiency (the US uses 9%, or 371 TWh less electricity than a decade ago).\nIn other words, of the 866 TWh of lost coal power production, 46% was picked up by natural gas, 43% by increased efficiency, and 23% by renewables. \nWhile the shift away from coal is a positive development in slowing global warming by cutting carbon pollution, as Joe Romm has detailed for Climate Progress, research indicates that shifting to natural gas squanders most of those gains. For example, a 2014 study published in Environmental Research Letters found that when natural gas production is abundant, it crowds out both coal and renewables, resulting in little if any climate benefit. Part of the problem is significant methane leakage from natural gas drilling.\n...abundant gas consistently results in both less coal and renewable energy use [\u2026] the quantity of methane leaked may ultimately determine whether the overall effect is to slightly reduce or actually increase cumulative emissions [\u2026] only climate policies bring about a significant reduction in future emissions from US electricity generation \u2026 We conclude that increased natural gas use for electricity will not substantially reduce US GHG emissions, and by delaying deployment of renewable energy technologies, may actually exacerbate the climate change problem in the long term.\nSimilarly, another 2014 study found that based on the latest estimates of methane leakage rates from natural gas drilling, replacing coal with natural gas provides little in the way of climate benefits. Though it\u2019s been touted as a \u2018bridge fuel\u2019 to span the gap between coal and renewables, this research suggests natural gas isn\u2019t significantly better than coal in terms of global warming effects, and thus may not be suitable for that purpose. The \u2018bridge\u2019 doesn\u2019t appear to achieve its goal of steadily cutting our greenhouse gas emissions.\nCalifornia has been a national leader in clean energy. The state generates very little of its electricity from coal, but natural gas does supply more than a third of the state\u2019s power. A quarter is generated by renewable sources like wind, solar, and geothermal plants, and another 10% comes from hydroelectric dams, on average. In 2017, renewables\u2019 share increased by about 10%, displacing natural gas in the process.\nIn fact, California has an excess of natural gas power generation capabilities. Some natural gas plants are still essential for ensuring local grid reliability, but in many cases, clean energy resources like a combination of solar and storage can meet reliability needs.\nIn one recent example, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) ordered Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) to procure energy storage (batteries) or \u201cpreferred resources\u201d (renewables or increased efficiency and conservation) to meet a local reliability need in northern California. The order stemmed from an issue with a \u201cpeaker\u201d natural gas plant (so-called because they switch on to meet high, peak electricity demand) operated in northern California. The operator (Calpine) was concerned that the plant was no longer economical, because it\u2019s too infrequently used due largely to an abundance of renewable power. The contract they could receive for providing generation capacity to ensure grid reliability would not be high enough to cover costs to maintain the plant. \nInstead of bidding their plant into the program overseen by the CPUC to ensure local reliability, Calpine went directly to the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) and requested a \u201creliability must-run resource\u201d contract, which is a much higher payment than they would have received through the CPUC program. CPUC decided instead to require PG&amp;E to fill the local reliability need with cleaner alternatives. The costs of renewable energy and battery storage have fallen so fast that the clean alternatives might now be cheaper than gas. \nIn another example, a proposed natural gas peaker plant in Oxnard, California was rejected when it was shown that the CAISO was using outdated battery storage costs from 2014. Given how quickly those prices have fallen, they could now potentially be competitive with natural gas peaker costs.\nThe redundancy and potential replacement of natural gas with cleaner alternatives extends far beyond these examples. Most electrical service providers in California are now required to develop integrated resource plans. These are electric grid planning documents that outline how the utilities will meet a number of California\u2019s goals, including a 40% reduction in carbon pollution below 1990 levels and 50% electricity production from renewable sources by 2030. Meeting these goals will require replacing non-critical natural gas plants with renewable power.\nAnd California is already installing battery storage systems at record pace. Tesla, AES Energy Storage, and Greensmith Energy Partners have all installed large battery storage facilities in California within the past year. Within 4 years, batteries are projected to be as cheap as natural gas \u201cpeakers,\u201d and consistently cheaper with 10 years. \nIt\u2019s important to bear in mind that power plants built today can continue to operate for decades to come. The decisions we make for today\u2019s grid are long-lasting. That\u2019s why there are similar pushes from groups in Michigan, Oregon, Connecticut, North Carolina, and South Carolina for utilities to scrap plans for new natural gas plants and instead consider cleaner and potentially cheaper renewable alternatives. Renewables also don\u2019t face the uncertainty associated with fluctuating natural gas prices.\nOf course, were there a national price on carbon pollution, renewables and battery storage would win in the marketplace even sooner. As it stands, natural gas prices don\u2019t reflect the costs that we incur from the climate change caused by their greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, as Union of Concerned Scientists senior energy analyst Laura Wisland put it, \nFortunately, rapidly falling costs are already making renewables and battery storage cost-competitive with natural gas, and cheaper than coal. If we\u2019re going to succeed in avoiding the most dangerous climate change consequences, that transition away from all fossil fuels and towards clean energy can\u2019t happen soon enough.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/solarpower", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy-storage", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/windpower", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Dana Nuccitelli: To avoid dangerous climate change, we can\u2019t rely on natural gas replacing coal", "date_published": {"$date": 1517223646000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518629784000}, "authors": ["Dana Nuccitelli"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Renewable energy", "Solar power", "Energy storage", "Energy", "Environment", "Wind power", "Coal", "Fossil fuels", "Gas", "Tesla", "Carbon tax", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Carbon footprints", "Paris climate agreement", "COP 21: UN climate change conference | Paris", "Technology"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jan/29/natural-gas-killed-coal-now-renewables-and-batteries-are-taking-over", "og:description": "Dana Nuccitelli: To avoid dangerous climate change, we can\u2019t rely on natural gas replacing coal", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b208b48d1c271c652817f9896edd89daab4fe63e/0_21_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=8d1161848b53b4e608611b075be7be38", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Natural gas killed coal \u2013 now renewables and batteries are taking over | Dana Nuccitelli"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "N", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b208b48d1c271c652817f9896edd89daab4fe63e/0_21_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1232690fcad7a19719f893f64e725414", "width": "4000", "height": "2400", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b208b48d1c271c652817f9896edd89daab4fe63e/0_21_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=266cdc8d2b2db98d2287e63e46806297", "description": "Tesla Inc.

So locking in 40 years of new gas, as endorsed by even the EU Commissioner Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, is foolish in the extreme - we know that gas has to be replaced and certainly for electricity; the factory closures and layoffs should go far enough in explaining the situation.", "recommendation_count": "3", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "111590397", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1517430977000}, "author": "James Holland", "author_id": "18387395", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\"So maybe a little less self-congratulation.\"\"Dripping with misanthropic spite.\"No, not really.

Therefore, it highlights that any policy incentivising the new build of gas power plants must reflect that such generation plant  will only be able to be used at low capacity factors, or be retrofit-ready for carbon capture and storage (CCS). An understanding of this policy outlook is crucial for prospective investors. \nSecondly, the report finds that without CCS, the scope for gas use in 2050 is little more than 10% of the 2010 level.

Therefore, it highlights that any policy incentivising the new build of gas power plants must reflect that such generation plant will only be able to be used at low capacity factors, or be retrofit-ready for carbon capture and storage (CCS). An understanding of this policy outlook is crucial for prospective investors. \nSecondly, the report finds that without CCS, the scope for gas use in 2050 is little more than 10% of the 2010 level. Therefore, continued gas use will rely strongly on the commercialisation of CCS. The analysis finds that if CCS is available, gas will effectively be used in very different ways to that seen in the current system.

A multi-layered process of expert assessment takes place every six or seven years where a set of carefully worded statements is approved by representatives of 120 of the world\u2019s governments, specifying what we know about the defining challenge of the 21st century: climate change.\nIt is an incredible, perhaps unprecedented undertaking \u2013 but until recently, it has been woefully underserved on the crucial issue of communicating its findings beyond specialist scientific and policy circles. And partly as a result of this, the organisation has historically been saddled with a reputation for being dry, bureaucratic and secretive. \nBut things are changing \u2013 which is good news for the climate. The IPCC has now recognised that it should take the same approach to communications as it does to science: go with the evidence base.\nIn a handbook commissioned by the IPCC (Working Group 1, Technical Support Unit) and released on Tuesday, my colleagues and I at Climate Outreach provide social science-based guidance for IPCC scientists to use in their communication and public engagement.\nThis is the first time advice like this has been produced for the world\u2019s most prestigious climate science organisation, and it represents a timely and welcome shift. The IPCC\u2019s next report will set out in greater clarity than ever before if \u2013 and how \u2013 we can avoid a rise of more than 1.5C in global temperatures above pre-industrial levels. \nCommunicating effectively around this crucial publication is essential, and our handbook sets out six well-established principles to achieve this, including the importance of ensuring the powerful human stories buried deep in the IPCC assessments are not swamped by the \u201cbig numbers\u201d that define the science-policy discourse.\nAlthough they are the go-to metrics for scientists and politicians, global temperature targets or atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are unlikely to be understood or seen as personally relevant by a majority of the public. Starting with the everyday things that climate change is now profoundly influencing \u2013 tourism, health, important places \u2013 is a better approach, providing a solid grounding in shared values and local interests.\nThere\u2019s also a big focus in the handbook on showing the \u201chuman face behind the science\u201d. By and large, scientists are highly trusted because of their independence, specialist expertise, and credibility. But trust is also about speaking authentically, as a relatable individual, with personal experiences and perspectives (not just a compelling grasp of the data). Who are the IPCC scientists? What are their stories? What is involved in an IPCC process at a human level?\nAnother exciting development is that the social science of human behaviour is now increasingly making its way into the IPCC assessments themselves, addressing a long-standing blind spot in the long list of topics included in the IPCC\u2019s remit. \nThe more social sciences can be integrated into assessments of the causes and consequences of climate change, the better \u2013 because one of the biggest uncertainties in any climate model is human behaviour. To properly understand how the climate is changing, and how likely we are to keep its most dangerous effects in check, we need to understand it as a social and cultural challenge as much as a scientific one.\nThere will no doubt be a small group of hardliners who object to the very idea of scientists being more effective communicators, or including social science research in the assessment reports. But their argument that scientists should refrain from speaking about the societal implications of their vital research is an outmoded and increasingly discredited position.\nThe science of climate change communication is a much-needed addition to the IPCC\u2019s canon \u2013 and an essential next step in the evolution of this unique organisation.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Adam Corner: The IPCC is taking guidance on how to communicate its crucial findings beyond speciality scientific and policy circles", "date_published": {"$date": 1517310018000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1553088066000}, "authors": ["Adam Corner"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Science", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/30/communicating-the-science-is-a-much-needed-step-for-un-climate-panel", "og:description": "Adam Corner: The IPCC is taking guidance on how to communicate its crucial findings beyond speciality scientific and policy circles", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34d625d6ae28a32461a356610177657ba8b9ed08/0_48_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=31b4fe38a96d8f502d116b5f9655aa91", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Communicating the science is the next step in the evolution of the UN climate panel | Adam Corner"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0a9b3c1767f60ca5294c43623c74599348bef6f/0_199_4138_2483/master/4138.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e84eb683226899be8e032d16b85d17f8", "width": "4138", "height": "2483", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0a9b3c1767f60ca5294c43623c74599348bef6f/0_199_4138_2483/master/4138.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c9e6c61d27efec980111007523240f34", "description": "\u2018The IPCC has now recognised that it should take the same approach to communications as it does to their science: go with the evidence base.\u2019\nPhotograph: Hector Guerrero/AFP/Getty Images"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556127517182}, "comments": [{"id": "111659100", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1517568028000}, "author": "glacier", "author_id": "4706143", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "This is of course true (the steam-engine) - but fluid movement in a free gas (atmoshpere), as in not contained in a chamber have evolved.

Expanding the nuclear fleet should provide baseload, and smart demand management will help.

And if you consider coal's role in premature deaths in the UK (between \u00a32.5bn and \u00a37bn ) you can see that your ideas about costing are way too simplistic.\nDespite disagreeing with you on some of the details of your comments, I don't think that your broader point is entirely wrong.

Now it's too difficult.\u201dNo, I quoted _your own source_ back at you that shows that the next phase will be a lot more difficult than the last. The IPCC have built the negative economic impacts of decarbonisation into their models \u2013 apologies, I don\u2019t have time to dig it all out but from memory there is mention in Table 1.1 here: https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/spm/sres-en.pdf \u201cThe EV revolution is going to hit the car market even harder and faster than BNEF predicted a year ago. EVs are on track to accelerate to 54% of new car sales by 2040. Wow, by 2040 there just over half of new cars will be EVs. At that rate the entire UK fleet will be replaced in, oh, 40 years. So, how does that invalidate my point that replacing the entire fleet is going to take ages and be really hard?\u201cWhy does decarbonising the electricity generation system mean a) brownouts b) completely reorganising \"things\" ? (Could you possibly have been less specific ?)\u201dIts complex, but basically Zero carbon sources for base load take a long time to come online, as at the moment we only really have nuclear and pumped storage. The others (PV, wind etc) show significant variation. We have interconnectors, but then you\u2019re just pretending you\u2019re zero carbon when you\u2019ve pushed the CO2 emissions elsewhere. It can be done without brownouts at peak useage, but that will take time to build and CO2 emissions will remain higher during that period. Or you can decarbonise quicker before the base load capacity is in place and accept brownouts at peak times.

How silly of me to think that my job benefits me\u201dIt does, but the money to pay your wages has to come from somewhere. It\u2019s very basic economics that at a macro level jobs are a cost and if you\u2019re arguing that they are not then I\u2019d start with reading some Keynes and maybe Marx (if you\u2019re a masochist, his translated prose is awful).\n\u201cDid you ever hear of innovation and invention ? Obviously not\u201d\nOh dear. Sarcasm. My feelings are hurt.

This is what the IPCC says (and unlike you, I provide a link, so you can see for yourself [hollow laugh]).Climate is generally defined as average weather, and as such, climate change and weather are intertwined. Observations can show that there have been changes in weather, and it is the statistics of changes in weather over time that identify climate change. While weather and climate are closely related, there are important differences. A common confusion between weather and climate arises when scientists are asked how they can predict climate 50 years from now when they cannot predict the weather a few weeks from now. The chaotic nature of weather makes it unpredictable beyond a few days. Projecting changes in climate (i.e., long-term average weather) due to changes in atmospheric composition or other factors is a very different and much more manageable issue. As an analogy, while it is impossible to predict the age at which any particular man will die, we can say with high confidence that the average age of death for men in industrialised countries is about 75. Another common confusion of these issues is thinking that a cold winter or a cooling spot on the globe is evidence against global warming. There are always extremes of hot and cold, although their frequency and intensity change as climate changes.

Boundary layer physics has developed immensely. Over the last 50 years one have steadily developed physics to the level that one can simulate the radiative and dynamical energy exchange of the entire planet with fundamental physics. \nSimilarly - climate science has been a fantastic spawning ground for chemistry. Organic and inorganic chemistry are now seen under one regime - often called bio-geochemistry. \nAs such - climate science is not where one primarily discover new universal laws. It is not like climate science retroactively push the fundamental laws of energy conservation, for example. \nThis is important to stress - because deniers like to claim that climate science is somehow separated - as if it has it's own core physics. Since a lot is driven by people with their PhD in physics or pure/applied mathematics, that argument falls of it's owned silliness. \nFact is that climate science is probably the most integrated science on the planet. Solar physics, radiative physics and heat-transfer, astrophysics, fluid dynamics, latent and sensible heat transfer, boundary layer and turbulence, inorganic and organic chemistry, botany, biology, nutrient systems, ecosystem analyses, physics of particle mixing and their redox and other reactive potentials (affecting stuff like ozone) - and how that is directed by environmental conditions, all the geo-sciences - including understanding of marine flocculation , sedimentology, volcanology, phase-transition physics of \"simple things\" like water - albedo effects, statistics both for trends, spatial patterns, co-variability, auto-correlation effects, mathematical signal processing and what not. \nAdd to this the effect of erosion and weathering - and extreme expansion of numerical modelling, not only of the Earth System - but also on the sub-systems. (There are now models that \"pick up\" simulated water-molecules in the ocean and track them in the models, while continuously calculating the delta 18O fractionation based on the simulated environmental changes along the journey - and on top of this one can even simulate the Deuterium excess values. \n(Fun fact - one of the first laboratory experiments for studying d18O in rain was structured by setting out empty beer-bottles outside the Niels Bohr institute in Copenhagen - allowing the development of isotopes to be used in ice-core analysis - by the scientists who work with climate change by the science of counting isotopes). \nThis means we also have to include the physicists who are expert on stable and radioactive isotopes to the group. \nOn top of this we must include our friends looking at it from space. In other words those who work on theoretical excitation of oxygen atoms in the atmosphere and those that build the instruments that can measure it to the precision needed. We have the IR groups, those that work on gravity anomalies and figure out how to look through clouds and now can actually define the cloud-base. We also must include those who study and build and interpret interferometric synthetic aperture radar systems to measure speed of ice-flow - or their friends who measure the altitude of the ocean and ice from space. \nThen we have to include the field-people. Those sitting in jungles or on the tundra looking at different gas and micro-particle exchange paths - those who climb the observation towers on Antarctica, Greenland and the Arctic who sample the strength and variability of inversion layers and those who drive aircraft into the eyes of hurricanes. \nThis list is far from finished. \nAll this evidence is what makes up the science of climate change. And when one integrate all this evidence - all with core unbreakable limitations - one must solve it in ways that are consistent with the laws given by the Universe as single and combined dynamics. \nIt takes a pretty comprehensive understanding to describe all this \"noise\" and \"feedbacks\" and crazy amount of tiny details under one over-arching principle. \nThe theory is continuously scrutinised by every natural scientific subject there is.

[there is] a smaller circle of people who need rapid charging. The idea you need rapid chargers everywhere, all over the UK, is simply a fallacy... You then have a much much smaller circle of people who need super-rapid charging [350KW],\u201d he said.\nHowever, National Grid, which runs the UK\u2019s electricity transmission network, said that it was in talks with BP, Shell, Ford, BMW, Tesla and other companies about building infrastructure for super rapid chargers at motorway service stations.\nGraeme Cooper, the project director of electric vehicles, said that the company had mapped traffic, population and roads and identified 50 sites to ensure most people are in reach of such chargers.\n\u201cFifty strategic locations means to an extent that 96% of UK drivers would be able to drive in any direction from any location in the UK and be in 50 miles of an ultra rapid small charger \u2026 To an extent we can probably allay range anxiety,\u201d he said. \nThe grid infrastructure for such a plan would cost \u00a30.5-1bn, or around 60p a driver per year if all motorists shouldered the cost, Cooper said. He was dismissive of \u201cdoom-mongers\u201d who suggest the UK energy system cannot cope with the cars.\nNissan, whose new longer range Leaf electric car arrives on UK roads in coming months, said on Tuesday that it would fit 1,000 charging points for a trial to test how plug-in cars\u2019 batteries can help power grids, by returning electricity at times of need.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/business/bp", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/energy-industry", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ethical-living", "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/motoring", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Further indication that oil firms are planning for growth of battery-powered vehicle market", "date_published": {"$date": 1517324877000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1518627425000}, "authors": ["Adam Vaughan"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Electric", "hybrid and low-emission cars", "BP", "Business", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Energy industry", "Environment", "Ethical and green living", "Motoring", "Oil", "Oil and gas companies", "Technology", "Travel and transport"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/30/bp-charging-points-electric-cars-uk-petrol-stations", "og:description": "Further indication that oil firms are planning for growth of battery-powered vehicle market", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e0b0a3cb6d795eceae26a9bb57395a47730b537/0_369_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=d6a88a38391183eafe56279b33e572d4", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "BP to install charging points for electric cars at UK petrol stations"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e0b0a3cb6d795eceae26a9bb57395a47730b537/0_369_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3bd7f2d102498a089bbfc52e34f54419", "width": "3500", "height": "2101", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e0b0a3cb6d795eceae26a9bb57395a47730b537/0_369_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=793760ca5fda83427f3f4973c544ac1e", "description": "A man recharges his Nissan Leaf electric car in Norway.\nPhotograph: Reuters"}}]}]

Erik Solheim said governments needed to intensify concrete actions including limiting greenhouse gas emissions, plastic pollution and impacts from agriculture.\nIn a statement issued in advance of Sunday\u2019s announcement, the prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said the new funding was an investment in the health of the reef and the tourism jobs dependent on it.\n\u201cLike reefs all over the world, the Great Barrier Reef is under pressure,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cA big challenge demands a big investment \u2013 and this investment gives our reef the best chance.\u201d\nTurnbull said the reef restoration science associated with the funding would be shared internationally and with Pacific neighbours.\n\u201cAs a highly respected philanthropic organisation, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation has a strong fundraising track record, and will seek corporate contributions to further enhance this work,\u201d the prime minister said.\nThe funding package includes $201m for improving water quality with changed farming practices such as reduced fertiliser use, $100m for reef restoration science, $58m to combat the crown-of-thorns starfish, $45m for community engagement, including drawing on Indigenous traditional knowledge for sea country management, and $40m for monitoring reef health.\nThe study on coral mass mortality, published in Nature and led by Terry Hughes, the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies \u2013 published in April \u2013 examined the link between the level of heat exposure, subsequent coral bleaching and ultimately coral death.\nIt found that 29% of the 3,863 reefs that make up the Great Barrier Reef lost two-thirds or more of their corals. It said \u201cinitially, at the peak of temperature extremes in March 2016, many millions of corals died quickly in the northern third of the Great Barrier Reef over a period of only two to three weeks\u201d.\n\u201cThese widespread losses were not due to the attrition of corals that slowly starved because they failed to regain their symbionts. Rather, temperature-sensitive species of corals began to die almost immediately in locations that were exposed to heat stress.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oceans", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coral", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The money will help try to save the reef from crown-of-thorns starfish and reduce pollution, Malcolm Turnbull to announce", "date_published": {"$date": 1524947129000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1527266117000}, "authors": ["Katharine Murphy"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Great Barrier Reef", "Environment", "Australia news", "Australian politics", "Climate change", "Coalition", "Oceans", "Coral", "Queensland", "Marine life"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/29/budget-earmarks-500m-to-mitigate-great-barrier-reef-climate-change", "og:description": "The money will help try to save the reef from crown-of-thorns starfish and reduce pollution, Malcolm Turnbull to announce", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9904ffc17e870a869d95cdcec6953d5f27f69bb/0_230_3464_2079/master/3464.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=bd727aaee9e562571bf1078f1c3f3599", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Budget earmarks $500m to mitigate Great Barrier Reef climate change"}, "headline": "0", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9904ffc17e870a869d95cdcec6953d5f27f69bb/0_230_3464_2079/master/3464.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=86f402f02fb8ca295f0010f61343daeb", "width": "3464", "height": "2079", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9904ffc17e870a869d95cdcec6953d5f27f69bb/0_230_3464_2079/master/3464.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4cbd8ce7a3095dc17c7aa553deeecf36", "description": "Labor and the Coalition are battling for marginal seats in Queensland where voters are concerned about the reef.\nPhotograph: Richard Fitzpatrick"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc0803aa2c3613145ed8f19"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/19/e-vehicles-electric-cars-uk-sales-rise-norway-china", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Sales of electric cars in the UK have risen 11% on last year, putting the country in the premier league of those ditching petrol and diesel engines, though it is still miles behind Norway and China.\nAn analysis of the latest global sales of electric vehicles found that nearly half the vehicles registered in Norway in the first three months of 2018 were electric (48%), compared to just over a third (35%) during the same period in 2017. The vehicles are run almost exclusively off the nation\u2019s hydropower resource, underlining Norway\u2019s claim as the world leader.\nChina\u2019s raw numbers were the most impressive, even if the total market share of e-vehicles was only 2% of new registrations.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, 142,445 electric vehicles \u2013 private cars, lorries, trucks and buses \u2013 were sold in China, a 154% increase on the previous year.\nStefan Bratzel of the Centre of Automotive Management (CAM), which compiled the data, said: \u201cChina and Norway are exceptional in e-mobility. The lead market remains China, where substantial industrial policy motives are driving battery-electric vehicle technology forward.\n\u201cIn Norway, where now almost half of new vehicle registrations are e-vehicles, it becomes clear how quickly a change in drive technologies can take place.

Should testing prove successful, the project, called Ice911, has the grand vision of slathering around 19,000 sq miles of sea ice \u2013 equivalent to the size of Costa Rica \u2013 with trillions of sand grains in order to stem the loss of ice cover and prevent runaway climate change.\nEver wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?\nThis series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.\nReaders can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com\n\u201cThe ice in the Arctic isn\u2019t going to come back by itself,\u201d said Leslie Field, founder of Ice911. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have much time left.\u201d\nField, a Silicon Valley engineer and researcher who worked for Chevron and HP, said she was inspired to intervene in the Arctic after seeing Al Gore\u2019s climate change parable An Inconvenient Truth in 2006. \n\u201cIt hit me like a train,\u201d she said. \u201cThe importance of the Arctic just leapt out to me.\n\u201cI looked at it and thought: \u2018What if this is a materials problem?\u2019 You go through the list of things that aren\u2019t adding pollution or foods to the environment and it\u2019s a fairly short list. I\u2019ve been through a few options and this one has legs.\u201d\nFor the past decade, Field has been testing out various materials that might provide a protective barrier to the winnowing sea ice, conducting tests in barrels of water in laboratories, on lakes in California and Canada, on a pond in Minnesota. \nTesting is now set to take place in the tundra of the Alaskan Arctic, near a research station where scientists generally observe changes in sea ice, rather than attempt to halt or reverse them. Scientists flock to Utqia\u0121vik to survey seabirds or gather data from boreholes in the tundra \u2013 there are about 80 beds in austere cabins at the Barrow Arctic Research Center and all will be full this summer.\n\u201cLeslie is kind of a one-off,\u201d said Nagruk Harcharek, a senior official at the Ukpea\u0121vik I\u00f1upiat Corporation, which operates the research centre. \u201cI think her dream is to go pretty big time. Whether that\u2019s realistic and is going to save the world, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nField is attempting to resurrect the reflectivity lost by the Arctic as sea ice has receded due to a warming atmosphere and ocean. Sea ice is being lost at a rate not seen in at least 1,500 years, with Nasa calculating it is disappearing by about 13% a decade. \nIn March, the National Snow and Ice Data Center reported that the Arctic had reached a seasonal maximum of 5.59m sq miles \u2013 the second-lowest peak extent in the 39-year satellite record. Scientists forecast that Arctic sea ice could completely vanish in summertime by the 2040s. \nAs sea ice is lost, it locks the Arctic into a downward spiral. Less stark white reflective surface, or albedo, means more dark ocean, which absorbs sunlight rather than repels it, thus speeding up the warming process and spurring further melting. Older multi-year ice, 10ft thick in places, accounted for just 1% of the winter ice pack last year, meaning the sea ice that remains is now largely composed of newer, thinner and less reflective ice.\nField claims that her solution could save what\u2019s left. Tiny balls of silica, measuring less than the breadth of a human hair, should reflect 90% of the sun\u2019s heat. This \u201cemergency first aid\u201d is framed as a chance for the world to be afforded more time to slash greenhouse gas emissions. \nThe cost and logistics are daunting, however. It\u2019s unclear how the sand grains will be distributed, although Field prefers the idea of ship-based deployment rather than using aircraft. \nField isn\u2019t targeting the whole Arctic region \u2013 instead focusing on areas such as Fram Strait, between Greenland and the Norwegian island of Svalbard \u2013 but the cost to festoon 19,000 sq miles of ice in silica would still be around $750m, not including labour.\nThe continual funding for such an effort will have to come from private donors, or the UN, or perhaps the World Bank. That, too, isn\u2019t certain as yet, despite a \u201clarge-scale launch\u201d of ice covering earmarked for 2020.\nThe world may have warmed by around 1C (1.8F) over the past century but the Arctic far outstrips this global average and is warming at around twice the rate of the rest of the world.\nIn places, the rate of warming has been astonishing. Novembers in the Alaskan town of Utqia\u0121vik, formerly Barrow, are now 5.5C warmer than they were in 1979. This past winter, the warmest on record in the Arctic, saw some locations exceed 20C hotter than normal.\nThe Arctic is dominated by sea ice, unlike the Antarctic which is essentially a huge land-based ice sheet. As the ocean and atmosphere warm, sea ice is shrinking in extent, at around 13% a decade since 1979, according to Nasa. The bright white surface of ice, known as albedo, is giving way to the dark ocean, meaning that sunlight is being absorbed rather than reflected, amplifying the warming effect.\nThese \u201crapid and dramatic changes\u201d are introducing a \u201cnew normal\u201d to the Arctic, according to US government scientists in a report card last year. Storms are eroding away ice-free coastlines, summer wildfires are becoming fiercer and certain species, such as polar bears, are increasingly struggling to find food. This is all providing a major challenge to communities in the Arctic, but a boon to the shipping industry, which can navigate the area more easily. This task will get even simpler once the Arctic is ice free in summertimes, forecast as soon as 2040s.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not chump change, but compared to other options it\u2019s cost effective,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of trying to prevent the horrific list of things, such as sea level rise, storms and so on, that will come from climate change. Things that will cost us trillions, not billions.\u201d\nIce911 isn\u2019t the only direct environmental intervention, known as geoengineering, plotted for the Arctic. \nA team of scientists at Arizona State University want to add an extra metre of sea ice to the Arctic\u2019s current thickness by spending $500bn on a network of 10m wind-powered pumps that would be used to push seawater on to the surface of the ice where it would freeze.\n\u201cOur only strategy at present seems to be to tell people to stop burning fossil fuels,\u201d lead physicist Steven Desch said last year. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea but it is going to need a lot more than that to stop the Arctic\u2019s sea ice from disappearing.\u201d\nIn the Paris climate accords, world governments agreed to a 2C warming limit. Most plausible forecasts concede this won\u2019t be possible with emissions reductions and renewable energy ramp-ups alone. Some sort of technology that captures carbon or removes it directly from the atmosphere will be needed. \nNo such viable technology exists at any sort of scale, but a number of geoengineering projects of various hues (Field calls her option \u201csoft\u201d or \u201ceco\u201d geoengineering) have in recent years jostled to forge a breakthrough. \nThere is the plan to use 16tn miniature robots to deflect the sun\u2019s heat away from Earth; or the project to pump aerosols into clouds in order to \u201cbrighten\u201d them and bolster their reflective power. Another scheme, devised by the scientist who developed Australia\u2019s polymer bank notes, is trialling a thin \u201csun shield\u201d to be placed over parts of the Great Barrier Reef, which has recently suffered from severe coral bleaching. \nA separate project, led by the Harvard physicist David Keith, plans to head to Tuscon, Arizona, this year to launch the \u201cStratoCruiser\u201d \u2013 a high-altitude balloon equipped with sensors that will spray a mist of molecules such as sulfur dioxide or calcium carbonate into the atmosphere to deflect sunlight and spur cloud formation. Harvard\u2019s solar geoengineering program has received funding from Bill Gates, among other sources.\nThese and other similar projects have faced criticism over potential unintended pollution, as well as the even more hazardous prospect of handing countries a reason to slow down their emissions cuts in favour of a geoengineering panacea that may never arrive.\nJ\u00e1nos P\u00e1sztor, a former UN assistant secretary general for climate change, recently called for a pause in solar geoengineering so that unforeseen risks could be properly explored. \nIn a speech to Arizona State University, P\u00e1sztor singled out Keith\u2019s experiment. \u201cSome time within the next year, we may see the world\u2019s first outdoor experiment on stratospheric aerosol injection take place here in the skies above Arizona, yet for the most part governments are not aware of, nor addressing, the profound governance issues this poses,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe urgently need an open, inclusive discussion on how the world will research and govern solar geoengineering. Otherwise we could be in danger of events overtaking society\u2019s capacity to respond prudently and effectively.\u201d\nSome scientists are also wary about interventions to restore Arctic sea ice, broadly following the same precautionary principle that tweaking the composition of an ecosystem can have far-reaching ramifications, such as unleashing the cane toad in Australia or allowing feral hogs to run rampant in Texas. \n\u201cI think there are good intentions to solve this difficult problem,\u201d said Cecilia Bitz, an Arctic sea ice expert at the University of Washington. \u201cI don\u2019t fault people looking for geoengineering solutions but I believe it will be cheaper and more effective to reduce our emissions.\u201d\nBitz said she was \u201cnot very optimistic\u201d about Ice911\u2019s plan as it creates \u201cvery small particulates that are very dangerous for ecosystems\u201d, despite Field\u2019s assurances that the silica will be harmless to wildlife. The silica material will average 60 micrometers, which is \u201cwell out of the range of danger\u201d caused by particulates that are typically smaller, at 10 micrometers or less, according to Roman Decca, who works on strategy and engineering at Ice911.\n\u201cYou could put a big sheet on top of the ice instead, I suppose, but that could trap seals,\u201d said Bitz. \u201cThe idea of spraying seawater on top of the ice is interesting and potentially effective, but it\u2019s very costly. All of these solutions would be very expensive.

The second video, On Top of the World, was as sickly sweet as the first and has racked up 19m views on YouTube since it was released in December 2017.\nWhy pick Santa Marta? As Shell itself explained, it is \u201cone of Rio\u2019s most headline-grabbing favelas\u201d and it\u2019s where they chose to help a winner of one of their entrepreneur awards put up some solar panels. \nIf you watch the pop videos, or hang around Shell\u2019s YouTube channel, or see much of their marketing material, or visit their very flashy tumblr site, you\u2019ll see very little of what Shell spends most of its time and money actually doing \u2013 drilling for lots and lots of oil and gas. \nHow sceptical should the millions of millennials in Shell\u2019s marketing blitz \u2013 the Jennifer Hudsons and Pixie Lotts and their millions of Twitter and Instagram followers, for example \u2013 be of Shell\u2019s contribution to the climate challenge? \nSo happy I got to be a part of On Top Of The World with @Shell and 4 talented artists. Together we can #makethefuture! Have you see the full video yet? https://t.co/fEPjVdZbCT #Sponsored pic.twitter.com/DYtOzciSGC\nIn its annual reports and brochures for investors, Shell\u2019s forewords and introduction will always note the challenge of bringing down greenhouse gas emissions and how the future energy mix will need to change. Shell says it supports the global Paris climate agreement.\nBut Shell\u2019s central role in this challenge is what? Give the world more oil and gas. The marketing efforts of Shell are not new, and neither is the cynicism towards them.\nIn 2009, the Guardian\u2019s George Monbiot took the company to task for its advertisements and marketing messaging that had already fallen foul of advertising regulators in the UK. \nIn his 2012 book Greenwash (which I was paid to help fact-check), author Guy Pearse said \u201cthe award for most prolific oil industry greenwasher goes to Royal Dutch Shell\u201d for years of campaigns just like #makethefuture. \n\n\nShell chairman Chad Holliday even went as far as evoking the spirit of Mahatma Gandhi in the company\u2019s approach to the climate issue. \u201cAs Mahatma Gandhi is often quoted as saying, \u2018The future depends on what you do today\u2019,\u201d wrote Holliday before outlining a new target the company had set to cut its own emissions by half by 2050.\nThis target includes the emissions from burning all the extra oil and gas they are enthusiastically pulling out of the ground and beneath the sea bed in locations across the world.\nShell says it was producing 3.7m barrels of oil every day in 2017 which, using the US EPA\u2019s calculations as a guide, generates about 47 Mt of CO2e every month. \nSo what is Shell\u2019s actual contribution to the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels and releasing methane that is helping drive dangerous climate change?\nI checked their annual sustainability reports going back to 2011 \u2013 around the time when Shell was planning its mercilessly mocked \u201cLet\u2019s Go\u201d marketing campaign. \nShell\u2019s direct emissions \u2013 those it has targeted for cuts \u2013 have hovered in the mid-70Mt mark since 2011. \nIn total, if you think it\u2019s fair to include in its footprint the extra energy Shell buys to get its products to market, and then the burning of all their oil and gas by consumers, Shell\u2019s contribution in 2017 was 664 Mt CO2e (for context, looking at figures gathered by the World Resources Institute, there are only 11 countries in the world with a footprint bigger than that). In 2011, Shell\u2019s footprint was 570Mt.\nShell has been making much of its \u201cNew Energies\u201d venture that look at hydrogen power, wind, biofuels and carbon capture and storage.\nNew Energies is part of the company\u2019s \u201cIntegrated Gas\u201d business \u2013 the same part of the company that explores for gas, extracts it, processes it and then gets it to customers. \nShell doesn\u2019t report separately the capital spending or revenue for \u201cNew Energies\u201d but has said publicly it plans to invest between $1bn and $2bn a year on the division. \nWhat does that look like, in the context of capital spending across the rest of the company? In 2017, Shell made a $15.8bn profit and its annual report shows that they made capital investments of $23bn. \nShell is in the process of divesting its interests to cut debt \u2013 a divestment the company says will be $5bn a year for the rest of the decade.\nIn Shell\u2019s latest annual report, Holliday wrote that \u201coil and gas will remain central to our business for many years\u201d and how more investment was needed to develop oil and gas reserves. \nIn 2017 in Canada, Shell divested out of probably the most polluting of all fossil fuel enterprises \u2013 getting oil out of tar sands in Alberta.\nBut why did they do that? Was this a pique of conscience over the legacy those activities will leave on the environment and the climate? No. \nAccording to Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden, the divestment was \u201cprioritising businesses where we have global scale and a competitive advantage such as Integrated Gas and deep water.\u201d\nHolliday says \u201cthe greatest contribution Shell can make to providing more and cleaner energy is to deliver more natural gas\u201d and that, as communities \u201cseek cleaner alternatives to coal\u201d gas will be more important than ever. \nBut as some analysts note, investing in new gas infrastructure risks locking in decades more of dependency on fossil fuels that is incompatible with the Paris goal to keep temperatures \u201cwell below 2C\u201d.\nShell is currently lined up with other fossil fuel giants in a court case in the United States \u2013 accused by some Californian cities of being responsible for knowingly warming the climate and pushing up sea levels.\nA recent trove of Shell documents unearthed by Dutch journalist Jelmer Mommers shows the company has been aware of the potential impact of the burning of its products since at least 1988. \nLooking at the documents, it looks like Shell\u2019s interpretation of the science around climate change and impacts of its products has drifted \u2013 both internally and what the energy giant was prepared to say about it in public.\nBut back to #makeithappen and Shell\u2019s other \u201cchallenge\u201d \u2013 its need to keep young people on side. \nIn advertising and marketing industry publication Campaign, Shell\u2019s \u201chead of integrated brand communications\u201d, Malena Cutuli, spelled it out. \n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that Shell\u2019s own macro challenge is particularly tough, so amidst deep cynicism and complexity, we needed to develop a disruptive approach to engage young people in our new energies mission,\u201d she said. \nFeatured in the pop videos and tumblr sites is an initiative to give people in developing countries more clean-burning cookstoves to avoid them dying from breathing in polluted indoor air. This is a huge issue and one that the World Health Organization says kills more than four million people a year.\nWhat is Shell\u2019s actual contribution to clean cookstoves in developing countries that gives them the licence to brag about it in slick advertisements?\nAccording to the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves directory, Shell\u2019s contribution to their work has been $12m in donations and time spent with the initiative. That\u2019s not a small amount, but for a company the size of Shell it is about 0.07% of its 2017 profits.\nShell also took a food truck around New York and made young people jump on pads that converted their energy to electricity in return for, presumably, some food.\n\u201cWhat better way to get people engaged in the global energy challenge than by tapping into a universal passion \u2013 food,\u201d said Cutuli.\nActually, I can think of another way. Several actually. \nOne might be to avoid being the gullible millennial who takes directions on the future of energy from one of the world\u2019s biggest fossil fuel companies. \nAnother might be to \u201cget engaged in the global energy challenge\u201d by understanding that for all Shell\u2019s earnestness about combatting climate change, its carbon footprint is bigger than most countries.\nLet\u2019s #makethefuture.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/royaldutchshell", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/oilandgascompanies", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/oil", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/energy-industry", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Shell is lining up superstars to sing in videos about solar panels, hydrogen cars, clean cooking stoves and lights powered by a bag of rocks and gravity", "date_published": {"$date": 1524634108000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1524694681000}, "authors": ["Graham Readfearn"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Environment", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Science", "Royal Dutch Shell", "Oil and gas companies", "Oil", "Energy industry"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2018/apr/25/hey-millennials-dont-fall-for-shells-pop-star-pr", "og:description": "Shell is lining up superstars to sing in videos about solar panels, hydrogen cars, clean cooking stoves and lights powered by a bag of rocks and gravity", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/def2ac9f4d3ffe529c2f4bcb1b2bf668d164f72c/103_168_1888_1133/master/1888.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=8001837ffad9c675c0e56396139e7ed9", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Hey millennials, don\u2019t fall for Shell\u2019s pop star PR | Graham Readfearn"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/def2ac9f4d3ffe529c2f4bcb1b2bf668d164f72c/103_168_1888_1133/master/1888.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=19a352a4fa416e855de4f68dd80e88ce", "width": "1888", "height": "1133", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/def2ac9f4d3ffe529c2f4bcb1b2bf668d164f72c/103_168_1888_1133/master/1888.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c4b36b736c1f8b6ef6803e1afc132490", "description": "Spot the oil and gas rig?

But add equal capacity of wind to the mix, and the need for storage drops to 6 hours, because the wind blows at night. Add interconnectors between geographically separated regions where wind speeds are uncorrelated and storage needs drop even more. The CSIRO has done a study on this using actual data for demand and weather:\nBQSTART\nCSIRO Energy chief economist Paul Graham says that additional storage is not needed for up to 40 to 50 per cent wind and solar penetration. That\u2019s because the grid can rely on existing back-up ( built to meet peaks in demand and for when coal and gas \u201cbaseload\u201d generators trip or need to be repaired). \nBeyond those levels, storage needs to be part of the equation. But again, not as much as many would think. But as the back-up generators gradually exit the grid, they can be replaced by various storage types, until storage then becomes the principal form of back-up and grid security on the grid.The CSIRO modelling showed that at very high levels of wind and solar, a maximum of half a day\u2019s average demand was needed for storage. In some areas of the grid, only around three hours might be needed.\nThis is an important point, because some renewable critics say that about a week\u2019s worth of storage is needed, and multiples of wind and solar capacity required for back up. These would be the same people that argue that climate science is a hoax, but it is a view that has more traction than it should.\nBQEND\n4 hours of storage would add just US$18/MWh to the cost of wind plus solar.

The way the tax system and revenues work plus the sheer level of influence the energy system has on economies around the world makes the task of drawing up a clear path towards a zero carbon future difficult. Pledges to cut pollution in cities and ban IC engines in many areas will certainly help, but a lot more thought needs to be applied before anyone can start feeling in any way confident that we are going to reach a level of emissions reduction consistant with a stable global climate, in order to avoid some of the more dramatic changes we are likely to witness if we fail to recognise what awaits us.\nPart of the problem is a lack of easily understood technology options that need to be made apparent as costs come down. One of those technologies - in fact a very important one - is hydrogen. Transport, heating, industry and on-demand power all require a relatively straightforward 'drop-in' alternative to fossil oil and gas. We can use hydrogen in different ways for all these use cases, and this message needs to be elaborated upon and driven home to politicians. \nIt would help if companies like Shell had more ambition - but again politicians need to be made aware of cost-effective alternatives to all the various fossil fuel dependencies that exist - so that effective policy measures can be implemented. Massive fossil fuel funding in many institutions does not make the task of simplifying this escape route any easier, nor does the lack of consensus regarding precisely what these alternatives are, and how best to foster their development within the economy. \nMuch more thought needs to be put towards these issues, as we can see that without answers being available in the minds of some politicians - despite the necessity to arrive at any answer at all - we are witnessing the types of irrational and faulty decision making that occurs in their absence. \nThe reality is that with a solid understanding of the mechanics of the situation; one technology - hydrogen - can have a profound effect on all of the areas many people are independently trying to finding workable fixes for. And with a zero-carbon energy system the opportunity for lasting, meaningful and stable growth presents itself.

Pruitt is fighting to save his job having become engulfed in a raft of ethical controversies.\nGore said of Pruitt: \u201cI don\u2019t know why he\u2019s still in office, though I kind of do know.\u201d\nHe went on to accuse big business of leaning on Donald Trump to preserve Pruitt\u2019s job. \u201cThe big grifters depend on the little grifter, and the big grifters have contacted the head grifter and said \u2018Keep him in there\u2019,\u201d Gore said.\nThe climate change advocate was speaking at a two-day summit organized by the Equal Justice Initiative, a civil rights legal group in Montgomery. Under its director Bryan Stevenson, EJI has created a new museum and memorial that commemorates the victims of racial violence in the US and looks at the roots in slavery and segregation of the modern epidemic of mass incarceration.\nGore called on his audience to remain hopeful that something could still be done to combat climate change in the US and beyond. He pointed out that the first occasion in which the US could legally withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change would be 4 November 2020 \u2013 a day after the 2020 US presidential election.\n\u201cIf there is a new president, there is a 30-day notice period to rejoin the agreement,\u201d he said.\nGore added that maybe it wouldn\u2019t be that long before Trump left office. \u201cWe\u2019re only a little over a year into this experiment and in science and medicine some experiments are terminated early for ethical reasons.\u201d\nIn his assessment, Trump had proved to be less capable of inflicting damage on the environment than he had feared, Gore said. \u201cIn the rush to do what the big polluters wanted him to do as quickly as possible they have made a lot of mistakes and the courts are striking down some of their actions. We have a lot of resilience built into the American system. They are doing damage for sure, but I believe much of it can be overturned.\u201d\nGore finished with an impassioned call for reforms to protect the US democratic system from the caustic influence of rich individuals and corporations. \u201cOut democracy was hacked long before Vladimir Putin hacked it, by big money and big lobbying.

Even Syria, torn by a seven-year civil war, has signed the pact.\nBloomberg, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at about $50bn, was speaking on Earth Day, to CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. He did not commit to provide funds beyond 2018 and said he hoped that by next year Trump would have changed his mind.\n\u201cAmerica made a commitment and as an American, if the government\u2019s not going to do it, we all have responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m able to do it. So, yes, I\u2019m going to send them a cheque for the monies that America had promised to the organization as though they got it from the federal government.\u201d\nTrump, he said, should be able to \u201clisten to others and change his mind. A person that doesn\u2019t change their mind isn\u2019t very smart. And he\u2019s been known to change his mind.\n\u201cHe should change his mind and say look there really is a problem here. America is part of the problem. America is a big part of the solution and we should go in and help the world stop a potential disaster.\u201d\nAsked if he thought the non-binding nature of the Paris deal was a problem, in terms of other countries not sticking to its aims for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the effect of climate change, Bloomberg said: \u201cLook, it\u2019s dangerous to keep doing what we\u2019re doing.\n\u201cIf everybody would do the right thing, yes, it would be better. But if some people or some countries do the right thing we all benefit from that.\n\u201cAll I know is that America, I believe, will meet its commitment by 2025 to reduce greenhouse gases by an agreed amount, and if we do it hopefully other countries will do it as well.\u201d\nAsked if he was \u201cfilling a leadership gap\u201d, the media baron \u2013 who was a Republican mayor and considered a 2016 presidential run as an independent \u2013 said: \u201cWell, I think that this is what the American public when you poll them say they want to do.\u201d \nThe odds on him running for the White House in future, he said, were \u201cnot very high\u201d.\nThe Trump administration has also rolled back Obama-era environmental regulations at home. Bloomberg said the man in charge of much of that roll-back, Scott Pruitt, Trump\u2019s scandal-ridden Environmental Protection Agency chief, had \u201cwalked away 100%\u201d from doing his job, which \u201cis to protect the environment\u201d.\nBloomberg said Pruitt, who has expressed doubt about accepted climate science, was \u201csaying the environment doesn\u2019t need protection\u201d and saying instead he would \u201ctry to protect jobs\u201d. \n\u201cThat\u2019s not his job,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cHis policies are not good for the world. That to debunk science and walk away from it is just ridiculous. Even if you don\u2019t believe it. If there\u2019s a possibility that it\u2019s right, you have to take prophylactic actions to prevent a disaster.\u201d\nFiring Pruitt would be up to Trump, Bloomberg said, adding: \u201cIf he could get Scott Pruitt to change his policies, then he can keep him.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michaelbloomberg", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usdomesticpolicy", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Former New York City mayor says he will \u2018send them a cheque that America had promised to the organization as though they got it from the federal government", "date_published": {"$date": 1524425001000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1530823527000}, "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Paris climate agreement", "Climate change", "Environment", "US news", "Michael Bloomberg", "Donald Trump", "World news", "US politics", "Trump administration", "US domestic policy", "US foreign policy"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/22/michael-bloomberg-paris-climate-pact", "og:description": "Former New York City mayor says he will \u2018send them a cheque that America had promised to the organization as though they got it from the federal government", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46b00b3542b588b66865fdda85e8cc54597844a0/0_20_5087_3052/master/5087.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=09e1cddc64af95affecdffce559fad15", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Michael Bloomberg pledges $4.5m to cover US Paris climate commitment"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46b00b3542b588b66865fdda85e8cc54597844a0/0_20_5087_3052/master/5087.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1a787b9d12bef635f5e713152755310e", "width": "5087", "height": "3052", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46b00b3542b588b66865fdda85e8cc54597844a0/0_20_5087_3052/master/5087.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5267205c8ad173750cd9c820c7780c2c", "description": "The former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.\nPhotograph: Shawn Thew/EPA"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc08048a2c3613145ed8f21"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/25/foreign-office-climate-staff-cut-by-25-under-boris-johnson", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "The number of full-time officials dedicated to climate change in the Foreign Office has dropped by almost 25% in the two years since Boris Johnson became foreign secretary, according to data released under freedom of information (FoI) rules.\nJohnson has also failed to mention climate change in any official speech since he took the office, in marked contrast to his two predecessors.\nThe cutback in climate change diplomacy has come despite the prime minister, Theresa May, asserting that the UK leads the world on climate action. The UK has been praised for its past climate diplomacy, which helped pave the way to the landmark Paris agreement.\n\u201cIt is extremely disappointing,\u201d said Prof Sir David King, who was the foreign secretary\u2019s special envoy for climate change from September 2013 until March 2017.\n\u201cYes, we have the Paris agreement, but everybody knows the difference between what the agreement says \u2013 if possible no more than 1.5C rise \u2013 and what countries have promised is enormous,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a very big amount of work to be done. Other countries have had an enormous amount of respect for what Britain has delivered. If you then cut back the British effort then of course there is a real danger that the focus drifts away.\u201d\nJohnson gave an assurance that King\u2019s work would continue under his replacement. But FoI documents show that the number of officials working full time on climate change fell from 72 to 55 between early 2016 and 2018, despite the issue being a \u201cnetwork-wide priority\u201d across the UK\u2019s diplomatic corps.\nA spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said climate change is one of the Foreign Secretary\u2019s key priorities.\n\u201cClimate diplomacy could not be more important,\u201d said Barry Gardiner, shadow minister for international climate change. \u201cThis is the year countries are supposed to ratchet up their Paris commitments, but so far the government has failed to step up and increase their aspirations. Sadly this government\u2019s rhetoric versus reality is skewed.\u201d\nIn January, May said: \u201cWe are supporting the world\u2019s poorest as they face up to the effects of rising sea waters and the extreme weather events associated with climate change. We will continue to lead the world in delivering on our commitments to the planet.\u201d\nIn April, climate change minister Claire Perry said: \u201cThe UK is leading the world in tackling climate change while growing our national income, ensuring we are best placed to help other countries reduce harmful carbon emissions.\u201d\nHowever, Johnson has yet to mention climate change in an official speech. His predecessors as foreign secretary made strong speeches on global warming, with Philip Hammond saying at a 2015 event in Washington DC: \u201cUnchecked climate change, even under the most likely scenario, could have catastrophic consequences \u2026 Our history shows us that when the US and the UK take a lead, we can persuade the world to follow. And we must take that lead.\u201d\nIn 2011, William Hague said: \u201cClimate change is perhaps the 21st-century\u2019s biggest foreign policy challenge. You cannot have food, water, or energy security without climate security.\u201d\nJohnson has given speeches about ending the illegal ivory trade that drives the poaching of elephants and has ordered a ban on avoidable single-use plastics from the Foreign Office\u2019s UK operations by the end of 2018. \nIn a newspaper column in 2015, the hottest December ever recorded, Johnson cited climate change sceptic Piers Corbyn as saying \u201cthe whole global warming theory is unsound, to say the least\u201d. \nA spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: \u201cThe UK was instrumental in securing the Paris agreement on climate change.

That is much earlier than previously thought.\nExperts say the findings underline the looming climate change driven migration crisis that is predicted to see hundreds of millions of people forced from their homes in the coming years.\nMore than half a million people around the world live on atoll islands, often extraordinary and beautiful structures based on coral reefs. Their closeness to sea level makes them particularly vulnerable to climate change. \nThe increase in urgency comes because, according to the authors of the report, previous studies had been based only on predicted sea-level rises. Today\u2019s study also examined the impact of wave driven flooding on the availability of fresh water.\nSaltwater flooding, leading to the contamination of water sources, will see most atolls become uninhabitable sometime between 2030 and 2060, said Curt Storlazzi, USGS geologist and lead author of the new report. \u201cThe tipping point when potable groundwater on the majority of atoll islands will be unavailable is projected to be reached no later than the middle of the 21st century.\u201d\nThe primary source of freshwater for populated atoll islands is rain that soaks into the ground and remains there as a layer of fresh groundwater that floats on top of denser saltwater, according to the study. But as atoll islands are regularly swamped by salt water this freshwater will be contaminated making \u201chuman habitation difficult in most locations beginning between the 2030s to 2060s, requiring the relocation of island inhabitants or significant financial investments in new infrastructure.\u201d\n\u201cThe overwash events generally result in salty ocean water seeping into the ground and contaminating the freshwater aquifer. Rainfall later in the year is not enough to flush out the saltwater and refresh the island\u2019s water supply before the next year\u2019s storms arrive repeating the overwash event,\u201d explained Stephen Gingerich, USGS hydrologist and co-author of the new report.\nThe authors say although the study was focussed on Roi-Namur Island on Kwajalein atoll in the Marshall Islands, the results will apply to people living in atolls around the world \u2013 including the Caroline Islands, Cook Islands, Gilbert Islands, Line Islands, Society Islands, Spratly Islands, Maldives, Seychelles, and north-western Hawaiian Islands.\nBut the fate of people living on atolls will be just one part of the much wider climate migration crisis, said Dina Ionesco, head of migration, environment and climate change at the International Organisation for Migration. \u201cMillions of people are going to be at risk from extreme heat, extreme water shortages and flooding as well as sea level rises... we are talking about something that is going to play a huge role in the years ahead in terms of forcing people to leave their homes.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/migration", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/migration", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/cook-islands", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/seychelles", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/maldives", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Low-lying atolls around the world will be overtaken by sea-level rises within a few decades, according to a new study", "date_published": {"$date": 1524679203000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1524679239000}, "authors": ["Matthew Taylor"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Sea level", "Environment", "Climate change", "Migration and development", "Migration", "Cook Islands", "Seychelles", "Maldives", "Hawaii", "Global development", "Oceans", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/25/climate-change-to-drive-migration-from-island-homes-sooner-than-thought", "og:description": "Low-lying atolls around the world will be overtaken by sea-level rises within a few decades, according to a new study", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c33a3c25e7675390ceb049cf3a5954f390a4b512/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=62bfba2191bee023881cb0f964a8ee71", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Climate change to drive migration from island homes sooner than thought"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c33a3c25e7675390ceb049cf3a5954f390a4b512/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fc5e97df7eb54c6c62d60f8bf83f6dd2", "width": "5000", "height": "3000", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c33a3c25e7675390ceb049cf3a5954f390a4b512/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=02c16da50d034981d7ee95c2546cbb98", "description": "The people of Kiribati are under pressure to relocate due to sea-level rise.

The science consequently dictates that, for a 50% chance of staying below 2\u00b0C, around 1,000 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (or 300 billion tonnes of carbon) can be emitted between now and 2050, and close to zero thereafter. We\u2019re currently emitting 36 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. However, the potential greenhouse gas emissions contained in known, extractable fossil fuel reserves are around three times higher than this carbon budget, meaning that 66% must be kept in the ground.\nThe debate du jour thus centers on which emissions reduction pathway is most optimal for staying below 2\u00b0C. The calculus of many policymakers, economists, fossil fuel companies, and indeed scientists, is that the most economical way to stay below 2\u00b0C is to delay most emissions reductions for decades to come, and then to play catch up by relying heavily on as-yet technically and economically unviable negative-emissions technologies. However, a crucial number has been neglected in this mainstream calculation: 6.1 million.\nEach year, 6.1 million lives are lost prematurely due to air pollution. Though most acutely and visibly hampering megacities of the developing world, air pollution is a growing public health emergency that affects almost all of us in our daily lives, whether or not we are aware of it. The Health Effects Institute estimates that only 5% of the global population are lucky enough to live in areas with air pollution levels below safe guidelines. Though recent studies suggest there may in fact be no risk-free level of air pollution.\nWhy is this number relevant to climate policy? Because one common culprit is responsible for the majority of both climate change and air pollution: fuel combustion. Burning coal, oil, natural gas, and biomass \u2013 for everyday uses ranging from electricity, heating, cooking, to transportation \u2013 releases hundreds of gases and particles, some of which disrupt the climate system or are harmful to human health, or both. Climate change could also worsen air quality in the future.\nDecades of research have revealed that air pollution is associated with a wide range of diseases and disorders, including asthma, cancer, heart disease, stroke, and premature birth. There is also emerging evidence that pollution from coal combustion and motor vehicles can cause development delays, reduced IQ, and autism in children. The societal and economic costs of air pollution are multifold. There are costs to the affected individuals, to their families and to society in terms of direct medical costs, costs to healthcare systems, productivity losses, and lower economic growth (not to mention costs resulting from damages to ecosystems).\nYet almost none of these costs stemming from our fossil fuel reliance are included in the majority of cost-benefit analyses of climate mitigation strategies. A recent study estimates that the health co-benefits from air pollution reductions would outweigh the mitigation costs of staying below 2\u00b0C by 140\u2013250% globally. Historical evidence paints a similar picture. The EPA estimates that the U.S. Clean Air Amendments cost $65bn to implement, but will have yielded a benefit of almost $2tn by 2020 in avoided health costs.\nMany public health expert groups have underscored the enormous opportunity for leaders worldwide to design policies and initiatives that will simultaneously tackle climate change and air pollution. Examples include replacing the most carbon-intensive and polluting sources such as coal and heavy-duty diesel with lower-emission or renewable alternatives, ending fossil fuel subsidies, redesigning urban spaces to make it easier and safer to commute by foot, bicycle, and public transportation, and transitioning to a more circular and sustainable economy. While the climatic mitigation effects of such measures are long-term and dispersed globally, the health benefits are immediate and local. \nFor too long, the enormous toll of disease and deaths from fossil fuel pollution has been neglected in climate change policies and underappreciated by the public. But public health data makes it clear that not all 2\u00b0C scenarios are created equal. The lives and well-being of hundreds of millions of us \u2013 especially our children \u2013 could be at stake. We would be remiss to ignore it.\nDr. Ploy Achakulwisut is a Postdoctoral Scientist at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health.

Logically the best way to handle emissions is to cut as fast and as quickly as feasibly possible at the level of a war effort[1], because this will buy us more time to sort out the difficult final 20% of emissions.\nConsider a 'normal' household. Very roughly 1/3 emissions are on electricity; 1/3 on heating and 1/3 on cars. Maybe that's slightly out. So, by switching to renewable electricity and maybe being able to shift 50% of the heating to electricty and by switching to a fully electric car we can cut out: 1/3+1/6+1/3 of our domestic emissions = 5/6, just 17% to go.\nThe thing is, that's an easy 83%. Here I've ignored externalities (goods and services we buy use and sell that cost emissions); so maybe I should have split the figures into 25% externalities, and 25% each for all the rest. This leaves us with 3/8ths of our emissions remaining, or 38% to go.

This energy balance has been widely used to infer equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) from observations of 20th-century warming. Such estimates yield lower values than other methods, and these have been influential in pushing down the consensus ECS range in recent assessments. Here we test the method using a 100-member ensemble of the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM1.1) simulations of the period 1850\u20132005 with known forcing. We calculate ECS in each ensemble member using energy balance, yielding values ranging from 2.1 to 3.9\u202fK. The spread in the ensemble is related to the central assumption in the energy budget framework: that global average surface temperature anomalies are indicative of anomalies in outgoing energy (either of terrestrial origin or reflected solar energy). We find that this assumption is not well supported over the historical temperature record in the model ensemble or more recent satellite observations. We find that framing energy balance in terms of 500\u202fhPa tropical temperature better describes the planet's energy balance. \nBQENDAh a nice little paper from the famous Andrew Dessler.\nObservation derivations of ECS have a significant series of assumptions in terms of the way the energy balance responds to changes.\nThere are serious challenges using this to derive a hard number for future climate sensitivity.

That is widely regarded as being in line with the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change, which require governments to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration to hold warming to less than 1.5C, regarded as the limit of safety for small islands, which risk being swamped by rising sea levels.\nThough her words were rather vague, the commitment was widely interpreted as laying the groundwork for a major change to the UK\u2019s long-term climate policy. Currently, ministers are pledged to cutting emissions by 80% by 2050. To reduce them to net zero by the same date, with only three decades to go, is a big step up.\nDustin Benton, policy director at Green Alliance, a thinktank, said the government would have to bring forward new measures as a matter of urgency. \u201cThe government has made real progress on some issues, such as diesel cars and offshore wind, but there are glaring holes in areas such as energy efficiency and onshore renewables,\u201d he said. \u201cThe UK can achieve net zero emissions, but to do so the government will need to fill these gaps and develop a new set of policies.\u201d\nBenton highlighted waste, housing and transport as key areas in which new policies could cut emissions fast, and said progress on these could give the government the confidence to continue with the policies needed.\nRenewable energy is likely to be one of the chief beneficiaries. The industry has had a turbulent time in the last few years, with the removal or slashing of key subsidies and clear messages from ministers under the last government that onshore wind turbines were unwelcome.\nHowever, thanks largely to the growth in renewables, the UK\u2019s electricity network was able to run without coal for two days this week, a landmark achievement.\nEmma Pinchbeck, executive director of trade body Renewable UK, said: \u201cIt is in the UK\u2019s best interests for ministers to be ambitious on climate change action. The science shows we need to stay within 2C for the good of all nations, including the UK and Commonwealth countries. Meanwhile, rapid technology developments suggest that successful future economies will be those powered by low-carbon energy.\u201d\nNoting that wind power is now the cheapest new form of power in the UK, she presented a vision of the UK\u2019s low-carbon future in which society broadly would benefit, because it would mean \u201crenewable energy, better quality homes, cleaner and more efficient transport systems and smart technologies\u201d. She said: \u201cWhat\u2019s best for the planet can also turn out to be best for the economy and for people.\u201d\nHowever bright the low-carbon future, hard choices will have to be made. Greenpeace\u2019s executive director John Sauven spelled it out: no new runway at Heathrow. \u201cThe data show that the challenges posed by emissions from transport \u2013 land, sea and air \u2013 and our reliance on gas for heating will have to be confronted as a matter of urgency. The government must accept that no new runway at Heathrow will fit inside our carbon budget.\u201d\nLess comfortably for many environmental campaigners, the government is also likely to have to consider new nuclear reactors. The plans for the UK\u2019s first new atomic power plant in a generation, at Hinkley Point, have already run into controversy. The price paid to France\u2019s partly state-owned EDF has been decried as far too high, and construction has proceeded slowly. \nOn energy efficiency, too, the government will need a new approach. The flagship \u201cgreen deal\u201d policy aimed at encouraging householders to take on loans to insulate their properties proved a failure, and nothing new has been proposed to take its place. Ministers have shown little sign of wishing to grapple with the problem. Another technology that might have helped towards zero-emissions targets, carbon capture and storage, was scrapped under George Osborne and would be costly to revive.\nOn a separate front, however, there have been important positive signals. As well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the UK could meet its carbon targets by increasing the absorption of carbon dioxide. Plans to grow new forests have been enthusiastically endorsed by Michael Gove, the environment secretary. This could provide a \u201ccarbon sink\u201d to reduce the UK\u2019s contributions to global warming. Likewise, better management of the soil by farmers could increase its carbon storage capacity, and Gove has made clear he sees this as a priority. \nIf all these developments are not enough, ministers may also seek refuge in an often overlooked part of climate change policy. Since the Kyoto protocol of 1997, systems of trading carbon have been mooted and approved as ways of generating investment flows from the rich to the poor world. The idea is that rich countries that find it costly to cut their emissions can instead offset them by funding emissions reduction projects, such as wind farms or solar panels, in poorer nations. This is controversial, as many green campaigners insist that emissions cuts must be made at home, but it may be an option ministers wish to keep open.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/heathrow-third-runway", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/travel-and-transport", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/windpower", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/analysis"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The government has pledged to review its long-term climate targets.

George W. Bush\u2019s former EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman delivered the scathing explanation:\nIf his actions continue in the same direction, during Pruitt\u2019s term at the EPA the environment will be threatened instead of protected, and human health endangered instead of preserved, all with no long-term benefit to the economy.\nAs a perfect example of those actions, the Daily Caller recently reported that at a gathering at the fossil fuel-funded Heritage Institute, Pruitt announced that the EPA and federal government will soon end two important science-based practices in evaluating the costs and benefits of regulations.\nWhen the EPA regulates pollutants, the practice often yields what are called \u201cco-benefits.\u201d For example, limiting allowable mercury pollution can force dirty coal power plants to install pollution-control equipment or shut down. Since coal plants produce other pollutants like soot, the regulations not only reduce mercury levels, but also particulate matter in the air. The latter isn\u2019t an intended consequence of the regulations, but creating cleaner air and healthier Americans are unintended \u201cco-benefits\u201d of limiting another pollutant.\nIn doing cost-benefit analyses, the EPA accounts for all direct benefits and indirect co-benefits of its regulations. Certain industry groups and conservative pundits don\u2019t like that approach, because they care more about polluter profits than they do about clean air and healthy Americans. However, during the George W. Bush administration in 2003, the Office of Management and Budget issued a guidance saying that it\u2019s important to consider co-benefits:\nYour analysis should look beyond the direct benefits and direct costs of your rulemaking and consider any important ancillary benefits and countervailing risks. An ancillary benefit is a favorable impact of the rule that is typically unrelated or secondary to the statutory purpose of the rulemaking (e.g., reduced refinery emissions due to more stringent fuel economy standards for light trucks)\u2026\nPruitt wants to disregard this Bush-era guidance and instead consider only the costs and benefits of regulating the \u201ctargeted pollutant\u201d (mercury, in our example). They want to ignore the lives saved by also incidentally reducing particulate matter pollution. To be blunt, this makes no sense, unless your goal is to protect polluters at the expense of public and environmental health.\nAs a backup argument, industry groups argue that the EPA overestimates these co-benefits because particulate matter (specifically, PM2.5) isn\u2019t harmful to human health below a certain threshold value. Not coincidentally, Pruitt\u2019s EPA hired a scientist who has argued that American air is \u201ca little too clean for optimum health.\u201d However, EPA looked at the associated science and issued a memo in 2012 concluding,\nStudies demonstrate an association between premature mortality and fine particle pollution at the lowest levels measured in the relevant studies, levels that are significantly below the [National Ambient Air Quality Standards] for fine particles. These studies have not observed a level at which premature mortality effects do not occur. The best scientific evidence, confirmed by independent, Congressionally-mandated expert panels, is that there is no threshold level of fine particle pollution below which health risk reductions are not achieved by reduced exposure.\nThe bottom line is that when considering all effects, the benefits of EPA pollutant regulations often far outweigh their costs. However, the American public sees the benefits in the form of cleaner air and water, better health, and avoided premature deaths, while industries bear the costs of complying with the regulations by reducing their pollution. Hence industry groups and their allies in the Pruitt EPA are trying to cook the books to favor profits over public health. It\u2019s worth reflecting on the disparity between the president\u2019s claims that EPA\u2019s goal is to achieve \u201crecord clean Air &amp; Water\u201d and its apparent actual goal of maximizing polluter industry profits.\nWhile Security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor, Scott Pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at EPA. Record clean Air &amp; Water while saving USA Billions of Dollars. Rent was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job!\nAt the Heritage Institute gathering, Pruitt also promised that the Trump administration will stop using the \u2018social cost of carbon\u2019 \u2013 an estimate of how much carbon pollution costs society via added climate damages \u2013 in crafting regulations. The Obama administration first started using the social cost of carbon in cost-benefit analyses of various government regulations. For example, when the Department of Energy considers stricter energy efficiency standards for appliances, it will account for the benefits of slowing climate change by reducing electricity consumption. Industry groups challenged that policy in court, but the Obama administration won.\nUnder Trump and Pruitt, the EPA has started engaging in bogus accounting to deflate the estimated social cost of carbon, and now Pruitt has promised they\u2019ll stop using it altogether. It\u2019s simply another way for the EPA to put industry profits above public health benefits.\nPruitt hasn\u2019t yet made good on these promises to the polluting industries, but if he does, environmental groups are confident they can beat him in court. David Doniger, senior strategic director of the National Resource Defense Council\u2019s climate &amp; clean energy program told me:\nIf Pruitt finalizes the Clean Power Plan repeal or any other rule by revising consideration of co-benefits in this way, or dropping them entirely, you can be 100% sure that we and others will sue, probably in D.C. Circuit challenges to his actions. We are confident the courts will hold this reversal of practice arbitrary and capricious. The only sound way to assess the benefits of a rule, and to weigh them against costs when that is allowed, is to assess all the benefits that can be reasonably expected to come from the action. \nIt\u2019s worth remembering that \u201cThe mission of EPA is to protect human health and the environment.\u201d The mission of the Pruitt EPA seems to be maximizing polluting industry profits at the expense of human health and the environment. \nIt\u2019s also important not to let Pruitt\u2019s rank corruption and scandals distract from the damage he\u2019s doing to EPA\u2019s mission. As Christine Todd Whitman noted, the whole world is worse for Trump having nominated and the Senate GOP having confirmed Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA into a new era of maximizing industry profits and pollution at the expense of public and environmental health.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/epa", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/pollution", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-tax", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump", "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/health"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Dana Nuccitelli: Pruitt is one of TIME\u2019s 100 most influential people for his efforts to maximize polluters\u2019 profits", "date_published": {"$date": 1524477608000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1524712866000}, "authors": ["Dana Nuccitelli"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "US Environmental Protection Agency", "Pollution", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "Carbon tax", "Donald Trump", "Health policy", "Politics", "Republicans", "Health"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/23/pruitt-promised-polluters-epa-will-value-their-profits-over-american-lives", "og:description": "Dana Nuccitelli: Pruitt is one of TIME\u2019s 100 most influential people for his efforts to maximize polluters\u2019 profits", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6126803a963bcbd15f38aa20bf9c788242aa869e/0_66_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=4150fe7b403f50c488e6f5b061fab19e", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Pruitt promised polluters EPA will value their profits over American lives | Dana Nuccitelli"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6126803a963bcbd15f38aa20bf9c788242aa869e/0_66_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ceb30e337b39fa694801fae592b2ab11", "width": "3444", "height": "2067", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6126803a963bcbd15f38aa20bf9c788242aa869e/0_66_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=430f1983c9f4ef10ebede8e350a16d8c", "description": "President Trump listens to EPA Administrator Pruitt after announcing decision to withdraw from Paris Climate Agreement in the White House Rose Garden in Washington.\nPhotograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556126847565}, "comments": [{"id": "115160552", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1524808336000}, "author": "Alan Ritchie", "author_id": "16481469", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "The dying remnants of Humanity at the end of this Century can enjoy throwing darts at this pig ignorant arsehole's portrait.", "recommendation_count": "1", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "115124579", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1524684911000}, "author": "John Samuel", "author_id": "13496713", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Smug for no reason.", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "115117319", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "115123902", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1524683014000}, "author": "Beakers", "author_id": "1631647", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\"and yourself\" my clients include nuclear and renewable developers thanks.

People design airplanes on computers, build them and they fly, models are very useful.\nIf anyone is by any remote chance interested in what the people who actually study this are saying, here is the world's largest general scientific association, The American Association for the Advancement of Science:\nBQSTART\nThe range of uncertainty for the warming along the current emissions path is wide enough to encompass massively disruptive consequences to societies and ecosystems: as global temperatures rise, there is a real risk, however small, that one or more critical parts of the Earth\u2019s climate system will experience abrupt, unpredictable and potentially irreversible changes. \nDisturbingly, scientists do not know how much warming is required to trigger such changes to the climate system.\nBQEND\nhttp://whatweknow.aaas.org/get-the-facts/\nIf you look at things like the rate of loss of sea ice, shrinking glaciers and ice sheets, melting permafrost and changes to the northern polar jet stream and deep ocean circulation, it could be argued we are seeing the beginning of such changes now.\nLooking at just the latter, it takes about a thousand years to turn the ocean over, to get the surface waters to the bottom and the bottom water to the surface. Warmer surface waters are less dense than in the deep ocean so it takes a lot of energy to turn the ocean over. \nAs the surface warms faster now than the depths it gets harder to turn the ocean over, so we get a more stratified ocean. (1)\nAccording to the Scripps Oceanographic Institute professor emeritus Jeremy Jackson, Scripps\u2019 ships have regularly measured a slowing of nutrient upwelling from the deep ocean, nutrients which are needed for great fisheries like the anchoveta and sardine.\nBecause the oxygen-rich surface waters are slowing their journey to the depths which turns the ocean into a desert.\nThis is just a small fraction of the interesting changes the science says may be in store on our current track. \n1.

Initially envisioned as a temporary installation, the flame remained so popular with visitors that it has continued to burn ever since.\nBut the federal government has announced that it is now exploring a number of options to reduce the environmental impact of the flame, one of which includes swapping the fire with LED lights. \nA spokesperson with Public Services and Procurement Canada, the government agency tasked with overseeing the project, confirmed it is \u201cexploring options for alternative sustainable approaches to fuel the centennial flame\u201d.\nFederal government offices have come under pressure to reduce or eliminate carbon dioxide emissions resulting from daily operations as part of the government\u2019s climate strategy.\nThe flame is fueled by natural gas ferried across the country from western Canada, a region of the country where environmental groups and indigenous activists are currently protesting against pipeline expansions and carbon emissions from tar sands.\nIn September 2017, the government attempted to decrease the emissions of the flame by striking a \u201cnet zero\u201d deal with Bullfrog Power, which provides gas to the flame. The energy company offsets the emissions from the flame by pumping biogas \u2013 a cleaner alternative \u2013 into its existing pipeline infrastructure in order reducing emission in a separate location. Bullfrog Power declined to comment on the extent of emissions offset by the deal which currently costs the government US$15,000 a year\nThe proposed change would not be the first time the monument \u2013 a circular fountain with plaques commemorating the dates each province and territory became part of Canada \u2013 has undergone a significant makeover. \nLast year, the government spent $650,000 to add an additionally territory, Nunavut, to the monument. The flame has been extinguished on a number of occasions, often the result of poor weather. In 2002, the prime minister of the day, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, ordered the flame extinguished and covered to avoid damage during the G8 protests in Ottawa.\nBut if the plan to scrap the flame proceeds, the move would largely be symbolic: Canada emitted 722 megatonnes of carbon dioxide in 2015, making it one of the highest per capita carbon emitting nations in the world, largely a result of its resource-intensive economy, size and climate. \n\u2022 This article was corrected on 26 April 2018.

There are no means of reversing the process which is melting the polar ice caps. And very few appear to be prepared to say so.\u201d\nHillman, an 86-year-old social scientist and senior fellow emeritus of the Policy Studies Institute, does say so. His bleak forecast of the consequence of runaway climate change, he says without fanfare, is his \u201clast will and testament\u201d. His last intervention in public life. \u201cI\u2019m not going to write anymore because there\u2019s nothing more that can be said,\u201d he says when I first hear him speak to a stunned audience at the University of East Anglia late last year.\nFrom Malthus to the Millennium Bug, apocalyptic thinking has a poor track record. But when it issues from Hillman, it may be worth paying attention. Over nearly 60 years, his research has used factual data to challenge policymakers\u2019 conventional wisdom. In 1972, he criticised out-of-town shopping centres more than 20 years before the government changed planning rules to stop their spread. In 1980, he recommended halting the closure of branch line railways \u2013 only now are some closed lines reopening. In 1984, he proposed energy ratings for houses \u2013 finally adopted as government policy in 2007. And, more than 40 years ago, he presciently challenged society\u2019s pursuit of economic growth.\nWhen we meet at his converted coach house in London, his classic Dawes racer still parked hopefully in the hallway (a stroke and a triple heart bypass mean he is \u2013 currently \u2013 forbidden from cycling), Hillman is anxious we are not side-tracked by his best-known research, which challenged the supremacy of the car.\n\u201cWith doom ahead, making a case for cycling as the primary mode of transport is almost irrelevant,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop burning fossil fuels. So many aspects of life depend on fossil fuels, except for music and love and education and happiness. These things, which hardly use fossil fuels, are what we must focus on.\u201d\nWhile the focus of Hillman\u2019s thinking for the last quarter-century has been on climate change, he is best known for his work on road safety. He spotted the damaging impact of the car on the freedoms and safety of those without one \u2013 most significantly, children \u2013 decades ago. Some of his policy prescriptions have become commonplace \u2013 such as 20mph speed limits \u2013 but we\u2019ve failed to curb the car\u2019s crushing of children\u2019s liberty. In 1971, 80% of British seven- and eight-year-old children went to school on their own; today it\u2019s virtually unthinkable that a seven-year-old would walk to school without an adult. As Hillman has pointed out, we\u2019ve removed children from danger rather than removing danger from children \u2013 and filled roads with polluting cars on school runs. He calculated that escorting children took 900m adult hours in 1990, costing the economy \u00a320bn each year. It will be even more expensive today.\nOur society\u2019s failure to comprehend the true cost of cars has informed Hillman\u2019s view on the difficulty of combatting climate change. But he insists that I must not present his thinking on climate change as \u201can opinion\u201d. The data is clear; the climate is warming exponentially. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that the world on its current course will warm by 3C by 2100. Recent revised climate modelling suggested a best estimate of 2.8C but scientists struggle to predict the full impact of the feedbacks from future events such as methane being released by the melting of the permafrost.\nHillman is amazed that our thinking rarely stretches beyond 2100. \u201cThis is what I find so extraordinary when scientists warn that the temperature could rise to 5C or 8C. What, and stop there? What legacies are we leaving for future generations? In the early 21st century, we did as good as nothing in response to climate change. Our children and grandchildren are going to be extraordinarily critical.\u201d\nGlobal emissions were static in 2016 but the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was confirmed as beyond 400 parts per million, the highest level for at least three million years (when sea levels were up to 20m higher than now). Concentrations can only drop if we emit no carbon dioxide whatsoever, says Hillman. \u201cEven if the world went zero-carbon today that would not save us because we\u2019ve gone past the point of no return.\u201d\nAlthough Hillman has not flown for more than 20 years as part of a personal commitment to reducing carbon emissions, he is now scornful of individual action which he describes as \u201cas good as futile\u201d. By the same logic, says Hillman, national action is also irrelevant \u201cbecause Britain\u2019s contribution is minute. Even if the government were to go to zero carbon it would make almost no difference.\u201d\nInstead, says Hillman, the world\u2019s population must globally move to zero emissions across agriculture, air travel, shipping, heating homes \u2013 every aspect of our economy \u2013 and reduce our human population too. Can it be done without a collapse of civilisation? \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d says Hillman. \u201cCan you see everyone in a democracy volunteering to give up flying? Can you see the majority of the population becoming vegan? Can you see the majority agreeing to restrict the size of their families?\u201d\nHillman doubts that human ingenuity can find a fix and says there is no evidence that greenhouse gases can be safely buried. But if we adapt to a future with less \u2013 focusing on Hillman\u2019s love and music \u2013 it might be good for us. \u201cAnd who is \u2018we\u2019?\u201d asks Hillman with a typically impish smile. \u201cWealthy people will be better able to adapt but the world\u2019s population will head to regions of the planet such as northern Europe which will be temporarily spared the extreme effects of climate change. How are these regions going to respond? We see it now. Migrants will be prevented from arriving. We will let them drown.\u201d\nA small band of artists and writers, such as Paul Kingsnorth\u2019s Dark Mountain project, have embraced the idea that \u201ccivilisation\u201d will soon end in environmental catastrophe but only a few scientists \u2013 usually working beyond the patronage of funding bodies, and nearing the end of their own lives \u2013 have suggested as much. Is Hillman\u2019s view a consequence of old age, and ill health? \u201cI was saying these sorts of things 30 years ago when I was hale and hearty,\u201d he says.\nHillman accuses all kinds of leaders \u2013 from religious leaders to scientists to politicians \u2013 of failing to honestly discuss what we must do to move to zero-carbon emissions. \u201cI don\u2019t think they can because society isn\u2019t organised to enable them to do so. Political parties\u2019 focus is on jobs and GDP, depending on the burning of fossil fuels.\u201d\nWithout hope, goes the truism, we will give up. And yet optimism about the future is wishful thinking, says Hillman. He believes that accepting that our civilisation is doomed could make humanity rather like an individual who recognises he is terminally ill. Such people rarely go on a disastrous binge; instead, they do all they can to prolong their lives.\nCan civilisation prolong its life until the end of this century? \u201cIt depends on what we are prepared to do.\u201d He fears it will be a long time before we take proportionate action to stop climatic calamity. \u201cStanding in the way is capitalism. Can you imagine the global airline industry being dismantled when hundreds of new runways are being built right now all over the world? It\u2019s almost as if we\u2019re deliberately attempting to defy nature. We\u2019re doing the reverse of what we should be doing, with everybody\u2019s silent acquiescence, and nobody\u2019s batting an eyelid.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/interview"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The 86-year-old social scientist says accepting the impending end of most life on Earth might be the very thing needed to help us prolong it", "date_published": {"$date": 1524715207000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1553274277000}, "authors": ["Patrick Barkham"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Environment", "Science"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/26/were-doomed-mayer-hillman-on-the-climate-reality-no-one-else-will-dare-mention", "og:description": "The 86-year-old social scientist says accepting the impending end of most life on Earth might be the very thing needed to help us prolong it", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb66172113f02d1c79c46a1cbbd2e35c87db5256/7_601_1640_984/master/1640.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=f3206ae72426fceb3e960ebb677122e3", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "'We're doomed': Mayer Hillman on the climate reality no one else will dare mention"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1b18036078ee896acc0bf12bc2b4e1a0dddf0f1/10_20_1635_1440/master/1635.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=98b0f6cb1045e2778c5fc0342992f1a0", "width": "1635", "height": "1440", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1b18036078ee896acc0bf12bc2b4e1a0dddf0f1/10_20_1635_1440/master/1635.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=aff49a65fd3280a56713c0a626eef656", "description": "Dr Mayer Hillman with his bike outside his home in London.\nPhotograph: John Alex Maguire / Rex Features"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7069f766c026db06db7c44b9426e0feaf28adf1e/0_29_3011_1807/master/3011.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=49b97634e21fa9a66be04f89f6008064", "width": "3011", "height": "1807", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7069f766c026db06db7c44b9426e0feaf28adf1e/0_29_3011_1807/master/3011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6d4a257883edac9dbab8041c3959036e", "description": "Hillman believes society has failed to challenge the supremacy of the car.

There is a chill in the air, quickly warmed by a buzzing atmosphere more like a music festival than an ethical food fair, as BBC Radio 1Xtra and House of Camden DJs play records, cocktails are poured and entrepreneurs sell zines and street wear alongside the vegan sushi, patisserie and \u201cfilthy vegan junk food\u201d.\nDavidson had been running weekend markets at the venue when she noticed a sharp increase in the number of vegan food businesses and vegan menus on offer. So last September, with her colleagues, she decided to put on a one-off vegan night market, with music, drinks and food. \u201cOn the day there were queues around the corner,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were not prepared for it at all! There was so much interest that by Christmas we decided to make it a monthly thing. It\u2019s all happened very quickly.\u201d Inspired by its success, and the traders she was working with, Davidson switched from vegetarian to a vegan diet in January.\n\u201cWe\u2019re riding on that wave of veganism getting into the mainstream,\u201d Davidson says. \u201cPeople are curious about it and they\u2019re finding out that vegan food is not just a boring salad, it\u2019s experimental, and the food traders are amazing \u2013 people can have a drink, listen to music and hang out. First and foremost, we want to offer a positive platform, whether you\u2019ve never had a fried jackfruit before or you\u2019re a longstanding vegan.\u201d Many of the traders are new to it as well, with a couple of them having launched their businesses at Vegan Nights. \u201cIt is a community and everyone supports each other\u2019s businesses. It\u2019s great to be a part of it.\u201d\nRise in the number of vegans in Britain from 2006-2016; 542,000 people said they were vegans in 2016.\nVeganuary 2018 participants, of which 60% were under 35, up from 3,300 on its 2014 launch.\nIncrease in vegan products launched in the UK between 2012 and 2016.\nThe year the term vegan was coined by woodwork teacher Donald Watson. Rejected \u00a0words include \u2018dairyban\u2019, \u2018vitan\u2019 and \u2018benevore\u2019.\nPercentage of under-35s who have tried a vegan diet.\n\nVeganism might have recently acquired a hipster cache at buzzy London events such as Vegan Nights and the weekly Hackney Downs market established by influential blogger Sean O\u2019Callaghan, AKA \u201cthe Fat Gay Vegan\u201d, but its surging popularity is a national phenomenon, with plant-based food festivals and businesses booming from Bristol to Inverness.\nThe high street is adapting with incredible speed. Big chains such as Marks &amp; Spencer and Pret a Manger have introduced vegan ranges, Wagamama has a new vegan menu, Pizza Hut recently joined Pizza Express and Zizzi in offering vegan pizzas, while last year Guinness went vegan and stopped using fish bladders in its brewing process, after two and a half centuries. Scrolling through Twitter\u2019s popular #veganhour (an hour of online recipes and ideas running 7-8pm every Tuesday, and trending at number seven nationally when I looked), alongside less surprising corporate interventions from Holland &amp; Barrett and Heavenly Organics is a tweet from Toby Carvery, trumpeting its vegan cherry and chocolate torte. Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco have introduced extended new ranges of vegan products, while the latter recently appointed American chef Derek Sarno to the impressive job title of director of plant-based innovation.\nIf this is the year of mainstream veganism, as every trend forecaster and market analyst seems to agree, then there is not one single cause, but a perfect plant-based storm of factors. People cite one or more of three key motives for going vegan \u2013 animal welfare, environmental concerns and personal health \u2013 and it is being accompanied by an endless array of new business startups, cookbooks, YouTube channels, trendy events and polemical documentaries. The traditional food industry is desperately trying to catch up with the flourishing grassroots demand. \u201cWhat do you mean, weak, limp and weedy? In 2017, the vegan category is robust, energetic, and flush with crowdfunding cash,\u201d ran an article headlined \u201cVegan Nation\u201d in industry bible the Grocer in November, pointing to new plant-based burger company Vurger, which hit its \u00a3150,000 investment target in little more than 24 hours.\nThe rapid explosion of the annual Veganuary campaign, in which curious omnivores and vegetarians sign up to try out veganism for a month and are then plied with recipes and other advice, shows how fast veganism is growing. (The choice of January is significant, given the resonances of fresh starts, good intentions and post-Christmas diets.) Veganuary was launched in 2014, with 3,300 people signing up; by 2016, there were 23,000 participants, then 59,500 in 2017, and a staggering 168,000 this year \u2013 and these are just the numbers that signed up officially online. Notably, 84% of this year\u2019s registered participants were female, while 60% were aged under 35. Showbiz magazines and websites are full of lists of fully vegan celebrities \u2013 Ellie Goulding, Natalie Portman, Ariana Grande, Woody Harrelson, JME, Ellen DeGeneres, Liam Hemsworth; we could go on \u2013 all of them making Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z look a bit wet, having tried a vegan diet for just 22 days.\nA weekend outing to Blackpool in 2018 offers much of what it always did: seagulls, slot machines, big-screen sport, family meal deals, \u201ctraditional fish and chips\u201d, pirate rides, poncho vendors, palm-readers and pound shops. But there are other, newer diversions, too. On a grey Saturday morning in low season, at St Thomas\u2019 church, north of the city centre, the Blackpool Vegan and Green festival is humming with people. Something of the church\u2019s evangelical spirit is alive here, too.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a non-vegan world,\u201d says volunteer Elizabeth King, delivering her \u201c10 steps to going vegan\u201d talk in a back-room. \u201cBut things are changing rapidly \u2013 and if you\u2019re trying to go vegan, you\u2019re a pioneer.\u201d She talks about shopping challenges and getting around social stigma, meal-planning and vitamin supplements, how to make holidays and dining out easier, how to check labels and online resources \u2013 and the group of new vegans and could-be-vegans asks keen questions and shares local tips. \u201cPeople have an assumption you live off lettuce, don\u2019t they? But that\u2019s changing.\u201d\nWith almond milk and vegan ranges now available in supermarkets, it\u2019s a testament to soaring public curiosity that people are being drawn to once specialist events in such numbers. \u201cIt\u2019s jam-packed isn\u2019t it!\u201d says Michelle Makita, with a laugh, from the Little Blue Hen vegan soap stall. Over the course of the day, hundreds of people stream in; visitors from across Blackpool, the north-west, even Spain. There is an African superfoods stand, a Glaswegian jerk pie company, Turkish g\u00f6zleme flatbreads, cakes, curries, wraps, sushi, vegan candles, vegan pet food, shlocky T-shirts and accessories (\u201cZombies eat flesh, go vegan\u201d). Darting around in a high-vis jacket, organiser Roddy Hanson squeezes past the prams, teenagers, bearded veterans in earth-tone baja tops, normies and newbies.\nGrabbing some air and calm when the lunch rush has finally subsided (at about 4pm), Hanson is a mine of information about vegan history and culture and has seen a tightly bound, activism-driven outsider community become an accepted phenomenon in a matter of a few years. \u201cWhen I went vegan in the 1980s, it was primarily two groups: hippies and punks. Some people who come to our events think it\u2019s going to be wall-to-wall people with pink hair and piercings, but the whole culture has changed \u2013 it\u2019s a very broad cross\u2011section.\u201d\nHe has been vegan for 30 years, a veteran of animal rights activism, but this convivial, family-day-out approach to winning converts is more his speed. \u201cI\u2019ve never been the sort of person who wants to stand outside fur shops and get into arguments with people. It\u2019s more positive this way and you can choose to engage with it if you want, rather than be confrontational. I\u2019ve been involved in anti-circus demos where fights have broken out with some of the protesters and the circus staff; that kind of thing was a lot bigger in the 80s. Now it\u2019s based around vegan groups and fairs, which didn\u2019t really exist then.\u201d\nLast summer, Paul White opened Faringo\u2019s, the first vegan restaurant in Blackpool. Only a year ago, he was an omnivore, running a hotel with an Italian steakhouse attached in which he was also head chef. One weekend, they had a vegan guest staying, which prompted \u201clots of lengthy conversations\u201d about veganism and he decided to try running a small vegan menu alongside the existing one. \u201cWithin two weeks, we had more people eating vegan food than anything else,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWhat surprised us was people were coming from all over Blackpool. There were hidden vegans in Blackpool who were struggling in silence! That was June last year and at that point we decided to turn the restaurant 100% vegan and it just exploded on Facebook. I went vegan as well, as head chef, and I feel better for it. We have such a wide range of people coming in: we\u2019ll have a table of six people who are protesters from an anti-fracking demonstration [Preston New Road fracking site is just three miles away], sat next to a table of two people who are multimillionaires, sat next to international rugby players.\u201d\nWhereas before, veganism may have been viewed like you were giving up something, now it\u2019s been reframed as what you gain\nThere\u2019s been a knock-on effect to their success, he says, with numerous other restaurants in the city beginning to offer vegan options on their menus \u2013 and White is preparing to open the first vegan food shop in Blackpool, too. One of the main drivers, he says, is the critical mass of information available online, both motivating people to change in the first place and making it easier than ever to do so. \u201cWhen people see documentaries like Cowspiracy, one is enough. The fact social media is as big as it is now, it spreads things so much faster. I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s mushrooming right now. And it is mushrooming.\u201d\nIn May 2016, the Vegan Society commissioned Ipsos Mori to poll 10,000 people on their dietary habits and found that Britain\u2019s vegan population had increased from 150,000 to 542,000 in the space of a decade (alongside a vegetarian population of 1.14 million). Of those, 63% were female and, significantly for veganism\u2019s future growth, almost half were in the 15-34 age category. What is astonishing is that the pace of change in the two years since the survey was carried out has been seemingly exponential \u2013 it seems plausible to speculate the number may have doubled again in that time.\nTim Barford, manager of Europe\u2019s largest vegan events company, VegfestUK, has been vegan for three decades and points to the deeper roots of this recent explosion of interest. \u201cThere is a big plant-based shift culturally,\u201d he says, \u201ca systemic change in the way that we\u2019re approaching food and the way that we feed ourselves. Remember that successive governments over 15 years have been ploughing money into persuading people to eat more fruit and vegetables, with the five-a-day campaign. Then you\u2019ve got a real cultural change among millennials, which is very much built around justice and the way we look at animals.\u201d\nHe also points to a new non-violent breed of millennial activist, such as James Aspey, who took a year\u2019s vow of silence to raise awareness of animal rights issues. \u201cThirty years ago, it was more balaclavas and intimidation, almost verging on terrorist activities. This new breed are not playing up to that stereotype \u2013 they recognise the danger of it. There\u2019s a real understanding and compassion among today\u2019s activists. I\u2019m a bit older and that wasn\u2019t there in the radical 70s and 80s, with the punk rock, \u2018fuck you\u2019 kind of attitude \u2013 it\u2019s now more reflective and therefore more effective.\u201d\nThat less aggressive approach is winning a lot of new converts, but for veterans such as Barford it\u2019s still an evangelical movement with an irreducible political message. \u201cOur challenge with VegFest is to combine the feelgood factor, the fun and sociable atmosphere, with quite a strong moral and ethical standpoint. We want to attract people in without putting them off, but then once we\u2019ve got them in, we don\u2019t want them to walk away thinking this is just a health fad, just food and shopping and entertainment.\u201d\nHe thinks the rise of Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 a vegetarian of almost 50 years, who has recently spoken about his admiration for his vegan friends \u2013 has helped fuel \u201ca definite appetite for justice. Justice is no longer a dirty word, people can have a conversation about justice for the 70bn animals killed for food, without being shot down and screamed at as a radical extremist \u2013 and I think Corbyn has helped a bit, with the way he\u2019s won over a bit of the middle ground.\u201d\nOne influential factor that comes up regularly when talking to new vegan converts is a series of polemical online documentaries, or \u201cadvocacy films\u201d, many of them on streaming services such as Netflix, documenting the damage animal agriculture does to the environment, or meat-eating does to human health, or exposing gory scenes in slaughterhouses and factory farms. In Blackpool, Michelle Makita tells me the 2005 film Earthlings, with its harrowing, hidden-camera footage of animal suffering, was the epiphany that led her to switch to veganism. \u201cI think I cried for about three days \u2013 I was hysterical,\u201d she says. The thriving sub-genre\u2019s titles tell their story in microcosm: Vegucated, Planeat, Forks Over Knives, Live and Let Live, Peaceable Kingdom. A common trope among recent converts is that the revelations about the brutality of the meat, dairy and egg industries were hidden from view, until these documentaries exposed them.\nThe genre\u2019s influential break-out hit was the 2014 documentary Cowspiracy, which looks at the environmental impact of animal agriculture, its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation and excessive water use. It is a film about climate crisis in the first place, which argues that meat and dairy farming is the hidden evil responsible for a dying planet. Made by Californian documentary-makers Keegan Kuhn and Kip Andersen, amiable frontman Andersen tells the story of how Al Gore\u2019s film An Inconvenient Truth changed his life as a young man (\u201cIt scared the emojis out of me\u201d) and committed him to an environmentally conscious lifestyle. With Kuhn, he has now no doubt changed the lives of countless others by persuading them that turning off the taps, cycling everywhere and home composting is not enough: that worldwide conversion to veganism is the only possible way to save the planet.\nCowspiracy\u2019s marketing strapline claims it is \u201cthe film environmental organisations don\u2019t want you to see\u201d. The alleged conspiracy of the title is that environmental groups such as Greenpeace, Sierra Club and the Rainforest Action Network are focusing all their efforts on fossil fuels and renewable energy, while ignoring the real threat from livestock farming. The evasiveness of their spokespeople on camera is often embarrassing, although perhaps the reason these NGOs wouldn\u2019t want people building their politics around the film is its fast-and-loose use of highly questionable statistics. The original version of the film claimed 51% of global greenhouse gases were produced by animal agriculture, based on a single, non-peer-reviewed academic paper \u2013 the scientific consensus is closer to 15%. \u201cDon\u2019t use the 51% figure. Please. You\u2019re making us all look bad,\u201d vegan author Danny Chivers wrote in the New Internationalist. \u201cIf you want more people to understand that animal agriculture is a significant part of the climate change picture, bear in mind that there are lots of good reasons why many people are focusing on the fossil fuel industry and it\u2019s not an either/or issue.\u201d\nFor the version that premiered on Netflix in 2015, Andersen and Kuhn changed the figure and Leonardo DiCaprio came onboard as executive producer. Since then, they have made an equally hard-hitting follow-up, What the Health, which looked at the effect of meat and dairy on human diseases. While their films have been controversial (registered dietician and vegan Virginia Messina called What the Health \u201cjunk science\u201d), their impact as polemicists is undeniable in a world where different strategies of evangelism are always being debated. Cowspiracy\u2019s original crowdfunding pitch speaks volumes about its appeal: \u201cTogether, we aren\u2019t just creating a movie, we are creating a movement.\u201d\nOf course, the vegan movement already existed, but Cowspiracy\u2019s success reflects a new emphasis on animal agriculture, in particular cattle farming, in the context of the deepening climate crisis. Critical in this refocusing from animal welfare as the primary motive for veganism was a 2006 report produced by the UN, Livestock\u2019s Long Shadow, which described the livestock sector as one of the most significant contributors to environmental degradation, both globally and locally. A follow-up UN report in 2010 warned that rising meat and dairy consumption, and a global population predicted to be 9.1 billion by 2050, meant a shift towards veganism was vital to save the world from climate catastrophe and food shortages. Overall, agriculture accounts for 70% of global freshwater consumption, 38% of total land use and 19% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions; within this, the footprint of meat and dairy production is heavily disproportionate.\nOxford academic Dr Marco Springmann has attempted to model what a vegan planet would look like, especially as climate change, food shortages and population growth intensify. He projected that were the world to adopt a vegan diet by 2050, the global economy would benefit to the tune of $1.1tn savings in healthcare costs and environmental savings of $0.5tn and a cut in greenhouse gas emissions by two-thirds. It\u2019s quite hard to argue with numbers that speculative \u2013 especially when one is not a fellow of the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future Of Food \u2013 but what is certain is that the makers of Cowspiracy were right in their general argument, if not some of the key specifics.\n\u201cOur motivation was that animal agriculture was so under-discussed,\u201d says Kuhn. \u201cWe really felt promoting a plant-based lifestyle had to be at the forefront of the environmental movement and environmental veganism had to be a movement in itself, versus animal rights or health.\u201d\nThe speed of change they have witnessed since then has been exhilarating \u2013 even in just four years. \u201cInformation can pass so freely and easily now,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cIt was only a matter of time before the truth about animal agriculture was revealed. It\u2019s not in your face like racism or sexism \u2013 it\u2019s deeply ingrained in our culture, and financially ingrained, but now that it\u2019s revealed, people just don\u2019t want to be a part of that horrific industry. It\u2019s like a weight off their shoulders; getting clean of the lies and the destruction.\n\u201cPeople feel empowered, it doesn\u2019t feel like a sacrifice. That\u2019s a huge shift. Whereas before, veganism may have been viewed like you were giving up something, now it\u2019s been reframed as what you gain: you gain health, you gain a greater sense of living in bounds with your values, you gain all the environmental benefits.\u201d\nOne can become vegan in stages \u2013 there are no rules and you are only answerable to your own conscience\nKuhn says that consumer pressure from below will create a domino effect. \u201cThese corporations are just going to follow the dollar, and follow consumer demand, which hopefully will force them to switch to sustainable, plant-based agriculture.\u201d The next step, he says, is to push governments to abandon tax breaks and subsidies to animal farmers. They are keeping the advocacy-via-documentary ball rolling. Currently in production are Seaspiracy, which focuses on the oceans and \u201cthe myth of sustainable fishing\u201d, and Running for Good, a sports documentary following British marathon runner Fiona Oakes, \u201cto break the stereotypes that veganism holds you back from any kind of athletics\u201d.\nRapidly growing consumer awareness and changing eating habits have combined with a dawning realisation about the extent of the sustainability crisis to send shockwaves through the food production industries. With broad agreement that the future of animal agriculture has to change, the big money investors are moving quickly. Richard Branson announced last year that he was investing in a startup called Memphis Meats, which is developing lab-grown meat from animal cells as an alternative to animal agriculture, sometimes called \u201cclean meat\u201d. \u201cIn 30 years or so, I believe we will be shocked [that] we killed animals en masse for food,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTyson Foods, one of the biggest meat businesses in the world, has recently invested, joining the likes of Bill Gates and Cargill, the second-largest beef producer in the world. It\u2019s no surprise that the meat and dairy substitutes industry is predicted to be worth $40bn by 2020.\u201d\nThe executive vice president at Tyson, Justin Whitmore, made a telling comment in explaining the company\u2019s diversification in the face of a looming crisis of sustainability. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be disrupted,\u201d he said in February. \u201cWe want to be part of the disruption.\u201d While clean meat is not vegan, by definition, it is a parallel response to the same problem \u2013 and is accompanied by the soaring popularity of alternative vegan proteins such as tempeh, amaranth, seitan and nutritional yeast.\nEven within the hard-headed world of big capital, there are serious manoeuvres afoot to push food production away from meat and dairy. In 2016, a group called Fairr (Farm Animal Investment Risk &amp; Return) co-ordinated a group of 40 large institutional investment funds, including Swedish state pension funds, worth $1.25tn (almost \u00a3900bn) publicly to urge major food producers and retailers such as Kraft Heinz, Nestl\u00e9, Unilever, Tesco and Walmart to develop alternative, plant-based sources.\n\u201cThere\u2019s growing investor support,\u201d says Rosie Wardle, who worked on the project for Fairr. \u201cAcross the board now, market research firms, food analysts, industry commentators, they\u2019re all talking about alternative proteins and flexitarian diets \u2013 they\u2019re the key food trends for this year. The risks around intensive livestock production are becoming harder to ignore and people recognise that is going to impact business as usual.\u201d\nFairr\u2019s latest report, Plant-Based Profits, points to the rise of flexitarian diets among young adults who may not be full-time vegans. Fairr\u2019s head of research, Aarti Ramachandran, sees the industry moving only in one direction. \u201cCompanies are investing in a lot of research and development because they know that today\u2019s millennials are tomorrow\u2019s consumers and they\u2019re going to be setting the stage in terms of future growth prospects. That\u2019s a key point that our investors are interested in: this is a market that\u2019s not going to go away. Plant-based diets aren\u2019t a trend or a fad; we see this very much being the basis of consumer growth.\u201d\nThe business world seems to agree. In the last few months, you can scarcely move on Forbes.com for articles with headlines such as \u201cHere\u2019s Why You Should Turn Your Business Vegan In 2018\u201d. With this kind of money swirling around, and a combination of hipster entrepreneurs, hedge funds and major supermarket chains defining veganism in 2018, it\u2019s easy to see why some vegans feel that the movement\u2019s traditional association with anti-capitalism is a position rapidly disappearing in a fog of marketing hype. Popular, youth-orientated vegan cookery startups such as Bosh.TV, which scored 1m followers on Facebook within a year of launching, as well as a Bosh! book deal, define the new spirit of veganism as a lifestyle, rather than the cornerstone of a political worldview. \u201cJust three years ago, we weren\u2019t even vegan ourselves,\u201d wrote cheerful founders Henry Firth and Ian Theasby, recalling late-night kebabs on the way home from the pub. \u201cBack then, the \u2018V\u2019 word had a touch of anger associated with it; it was loaded with political and ethical connotations.\u201d\nThe promotion of a flexitarian approach of reducing the use of animal products, without cutting them out altogether, has raised hackles among some activists. In 2014, the Vegan Society rebranded with a \u201clove vegan\u201d campaign to mark its 70th anniversary, which proposed \u201ca few small changes\u201d if full veganism seemed a step too far. This prompted a backlash among some animal rights activists and claims that the organisation was more interested in being a marketing body for vegan businesses than an ethically driven campaign group. \u201cIs veganism no more than a capitalist lifestyle choice?\u201d ran a rhetorical question on the Red Black Green blog. \u201cVeganism was for a long time associated with the counter-culture and seen as difficult,\u201d wrote Vegan Society CEO, Jasmijn de Boo, in 2013. She spoke of softening the movement\u2019s image: \u201cOne can become vegan in stages \u2013 there are no rules and you are only answerable to your own conscience.\u201d\nVeganism\u2019s mainstream rise has certainly benefited from this conscious rebranding: for better or worse, it is much cooler than it used to be. \u201cIt\u2019s a lifestyle, a community, a culture, an ever-expanding club where the only price of entry is being mindful and making a positive change,\u201d goes the motto of the Young Vegans pie and mash shop in north London. Social media has spread the word with incredible speed, via Twitter hashtags, thriving \u201cwellness\u201d and cookery YouTube vloggers and Instagram influencers. It\u2019s not just the obvious clean-eating celebrities and channels that have taken up the subject: even Unilad, a site not exactly known as a bastion of compassion and political sensitivity, commissioned a powerful 20-minute documentary, Meat the End, about \u201cthe horror and abuse\u201d of animal agriculture.\nWith a seemingly growing number of young people trying out vegan diets for personal health reasons (39% of the generally young, generally female Veganuary participants cited this as their motive), and its association with often controversial social media influencers, concerns have been raised that veganism provides a socially acceptable cover for disordered eating. \u201cAre you depriving yourself or finding plant-based alternatives? This is where a lot of my problems lay,\u201d wrote Lila Flint Roberts in an open letter on the Not Plant-Based blog. \u201cI was just another individual who turned veganism into an eating disorder.\u201d\nBritish Dietetic Association spokeswoman and registered dietician Linia Patel is more than familiar with the problem. \u201cWe do see this. It\u2019s very easy for people who have problems with disordered eating to take on veganism as a mask for something deeper that\u2019s going on, because it\u2019s cutting out huge food groups and for them it\u2019s a way to control their diet that\u2019s socially acceptable.\n\u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s so faddy, and there are Instagram influencers who are becoming vegan, and maybe it works for them, in their specific scenarios. The key point is always individualisation and research \u2013 to know why you\u2019re doing it and how to do it properly, rather than just jumping on a trend. People can run the risk of being deficient in b12, even protein and iron.\u201d She is keen to point out though that, done correctly, going vegan can be very good for health.\nWith a potential post-Brexit trade deal with the US threatening to flood the British market with farming practices currently prohibited in the UK by EU regulations \u2013 chlorinated chicken, beef with growth hormones and bacon with banned additives \u2013 the appeal of a plant-based diet could get another substantial spike in the near future. With or without such a trigger, a major shift in the way British people think about the food they eat and how it is produced is underway \u2013 driven by an increasingly networked, savvy millennial generation who realise that the certainties of the world they are growing up in are deteriorating fast. Veganism is no longer niche or difficult and, as industrial agriculture bends to adapt to consumer demand and its own crisis of sustainability, it is only going to get more accessible \u2013 and more popular.\nKishani Widyaratna, 32: \u2018\u2018My veganism fits in with the rest of my politics, which are very left-leaning\u2019Works in publishing and runs the Tinie Tempeh vegan Instagram account\nI\u2019ve been vegan 10 years. In 2008, Jamie Oliver made a TV show, Jamie\u2019s Fowl Dinners, going behind the scenes of egg and chicken farming, and he showed male chicks that are useless for the egg industry being suffocated in a Perspex, oxygen-deprived box, live on television. It sounds like Black Mirror but it happened. I\u2019d been vegetarian since I was 13 and seeing that pushed me to look into how dairy and eggs are farmed on an industrial scale; it went from there. It\u2019s an extension of the basis of my vegetarianism: I didn\u2019t want to kill anything to live.\nI\u2019ve always loved food and cooked from a broad range of cuisines. My heritage is Sri Lankan and food and eating are important elements of that. Starting my Tinie Tempeh Instagram, I wanted to do something that would encourage me to cook, but also I wanted to create something fun and positive. So hopefully you can look at my feed and see the variety in what I eat as an enthusiastic home cook with a big appetite. I wanted to help show how easy it has become [to be vegan]. The transparency of social media means it\u2019s not so much of a leap of imagination for people any more.\nA significant part of vegan Instagram has these unhealthy trappings of being super body-conscious and clean eating-focused: there are a lot of thin, lean, white bodies and, frustratingly, you don\u2019t have as high a visibility for the vegans who are people of colour or queer or fat or eating whatever they want. But things are slowly changing, with the vegan junk food movement for example and I\u2019m glad to add to the visible women of colour in that space.\nI\u2019m also inspired by people such as Ruby Tandoh and Bethany Rutter and their desire to liberate our personal relationships to food and the body, so I wanted to showcase vegan food that was about enjoyment without shame. I\u2019ve also made a group of vegan friends through Instagram and I\u2019ve learned so much about places to eat, things that I can cook; it\u2019s educational, too.\nMy veganism fits in with the rest of my politics, which are very left-leaning, informed by an intersectional feminist approach and also I\u2019m a person of colour moving through the world. So while I am passionate about animal welfare and the environment, there are other struggles that are equally important to me and each feeds into the other.\nJamie Kidd, 35: \u2018Glasgow is a great place to be vegan. There\u2019s a real community\u2019Founder, Cool Jerk Vegan Pies, Glasgow\nI run a vegan scotch pie business. I always had a passion for food and being from Dundee, which is pie country in Scotland, I felt inspired and thought no one else was doing it. I started two and a half years ago and the response was great; we couldn\u2019t keep up with demand to begin with. The biggest seller here is the \u201cmacaro-nae cheese pie\u201d \u2013 because macaroni pies are a bit of a Scottish delicacy. I travel all around Scotland and north England, sometimes as far as Brighton and London to do vegan festivals. The haggis and mash always seems to do really well when I go down to England, maybe because haggis is seen as slightly exotic. I\u2019m really into Glasgow\u2019s music scene and I\u2019m lucky that I\u2019ve got to sell pies to some of my musical heroes, such as Stuart Braithwaite from Mogwai, a couple of guys from Belle and Sebastian; Field Music seem to be particular fans.\nI\u2019ve been vegan for five years and I was vegetarian for five years before that. I didn\u2019t really see the difference between being vegetarian and being a meat-eater, because you\u2019re still contributing towards animal suffering. I found it relatively easy to switch because I live in Glasgow, which is a great place to be vegan. There are a couple of long-term established vegan restaurants here and in the last few years at least half-a-dozen new vegan places have opened \u2013 I think in total we\u2019ve got about 12 now. A new one just opened last week.\nThe venues have been really supportive of vegan market stalls and startups such as mine. There\u2019s a bar-restaurant venue called the Flying Duck that has a monthly vegan market and it\u2019s free for the stallholders, which is great. There\u2019s a real sense of community \u2013 we all help each other out and share ideas. We don\u2019t see each other as being rival businesses; the ultimate aim is to grow the vegan movement.\nSamantha Reidy, 27: \u2018I pretty much went vegan overnight after binge-watching Netflix documentaries\u2019Artist, Cleveleys, Lancashire\nI\u2019ve been vegan for two years. Prior to that I wasn\u2019t even vegetarian but I spent one weekend binge-watching all the documentaries on Netflix \u2013 Cowspiracy, Forks Over Knives and Earthlings \u2013 and I pretty much went vegan overnight. I was really shocked by them and I thought: I can\u2019t eat meat any more, I can\u2019t eat dairy any more.\nI found the transition really easy. There are a lot of foods that are accidentally vegan and there are so many alternatives now it doesn\u2019t have to be expensive. Even in quite a small town we have a massive \u201cFree From\u201d section in the supermarkets.\nI watched a lot of vegan vloggers as well. I think YouTube\u2019s becoming bigger than TV and a lot of people my age watch that instead. It seems more genuine because it\u2019s not edited by corporations; it\u2019s done by somebody in their bedroom with a camera and you can relate to that person better.\nI joined the Vegan Society as soon as I went vegan. I really like their magazine and they have loads of information. Then they asked me if I would like to be a representative for them. As an artist, I make some vegan stickers and badges \u2013 it seems like a good way to express your beliefs. I also own a lot of vegan tote bags and I always use them when I go shopping; it\u2019s a bit of subtle campaigning. Veganism is a community and it\u2019s growing. Hopefully one day it won\u2019t be a community, it will be everyone.\nDan Strettle, 66: \u2018There is a domino effect within families \u2013 parents are listening to their children\u2019Owner, Alternative Stores, Newcastle upon Tyne\nI was in sixth-form at school, and I was anti-vivisection, and this lad in my class says: \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe in experimenting on live animals, why do you eat them?\u201d So I thought about it, woke up the next morning and said: \u201cI\u2019m going vegetarian.\u201d But my concept of vegetarian was veganism; I didn\u2019t realise there was a halfway stage. I was fully vegan by 1969 \u2013 next February it will be 50 years. I\u2019ve never felt better.\nWhen I changed, they said: \u201cOh, it\u2019s a fad, give him six weeks, we don\u2019t even know any vegetarians, let alone vegans \u2013 he\u2019s one of these hippies, I mean look at his hair.\u201d For school lunches I took in something called Nutmeat. It comes in a tin \u2013 it\u2019s nuts and flour, combined to make what looks like luncheon meat, and you slide it out of the tin, cut it into slices. You had to go to a health food shop and there was one called Milburns in Newcastle; we used to go there every week.\nThere\u2019s a bunch of vegan places in Newcastle now; we\u2019re catching up with Berlin \u2013 that\u2019s the leader. Vegans have never had it so easy! I run a vegan shop. We have a little bit of opposition from the supermarkets now, but we\u2019re all right because people go in the supermarkets, see there\u2019s one flavour of vegan cheese and then they come to my shop and see there\u2019s 12 flavours. We don\u2019t mind the supermarkets \u2013 they\u2019re like a gateway drug: we\u2019ve got the variety that the vegans and vegetarians want. They come to us for perfume, soap powder, toothpaste, all the groceries and the whole foods. Our bestseller is probably Sosmix. We sold 4 tonnes this year \u2013 that\u2019s the same stuff I was eating in the 1970s!\nWe must be getting half-a-dozen new people a week coming in and saying: \u201cSomeone in my family has gone vegan and I don\u2019t know what to feed them; can you help?\u201d Or: \u201cMy son went vegan three months ago and we\u2019ve all joined him now.\u201d There is a domino effect within families and parents are listening to their children. There was a lad who came in who was 10 \u2013 he had made his own decision to be vegan; he was so determined, and his parents were so supportive.

A miniscule investment would be immensely valuable as a PR sop, as the article itself demonstrates. But Tyson Foods is one of the most flagrant in creating unethical, slave-like conditions for their contractors, and nightmare conditions of the animals raised under their aegis. To see a company whose business model is so indiscriminate in the pursuit of profit as a harbinger of good should make vegans worry, not celebrate. Where is the journalism here?\nAfter all, the anxious debate about \"Is veganism no more than a capitalist lifestyle choice?\" seems to be answered by the article itself. It can be a wonderful decision for individuals; but as a more universal way of consuming, it's currently in the low-hanging fruit phase. There's no reasonable way that veganism can be seen to be in an \"exponential\" growth phase, particularly when veganism is not rigorously studied, and is known to be, for many, precisely a fad. Is a \"convert\" contributing to growth required to merely try it, or stick with it? And for how long? Where is the journalism in the Guardian?\nIn the global context, where expanding economies in Asia are massively increasing meat consumption in their diets, veganism as a panacea for global environmental harm is a lovely fantasy. But just as the article restricts itself to the prosperous, choice-enabled west, and a rather urban, exclusive, leisure and lifestyle focused sector at that where social media influencers can be cited as important, \u2026and where such choices might reasonably be, in many cases, seen as mere virtue-signalling\u2026well, I did not take much hope from the article. And not just because the supports it provides for its preposterous headline fall apart so easily, but also because real causes aren't supported by this kind of flimsy reporting.\nWhat I'd like to see are stories about people in China, or the rest of the Asian economies facing massive growth who are dealing with the issue. But that story would be hard to tell. And it would, perhaps, point out the deckchairs on the Titanic aspect of the individualistic veganism described. Yes, social media, as the article remarks more than once, makes it possible for ideas to spread and catch on, and that, as the election of Trump and the activities of Cambridge Analytica show, can be used in any way, including and perhaps especially in the interests of destructive incumbent behaviours that may become more extreme. Building veganism on social media evangelism is a double edged sword. \nAlso not addressed: what is the actual benefit to the earth and the individual in going reduced meat, vs vegetarian, vs vegan? I would speculate that it's the first term that holds the hope. Veganism is a modest improvement over vegetarianism which is a modest improvement over reduced meat consumption, but both with a greatly reduced chance of long term sustainability by the individual. If reduced meat can deliver 80% of the benefits within the less than 20% total global impact possible, but is twice as likely to succeed longterm, then that should be the focus. \nThe rest is vanity.", "recommendation_count": "50", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "114244701", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1522587353000}, "author": "Skipmeskip", "author_id": "12739257", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "I can remember becoming vegetarian as an 11 year old in the 70s, and being told I'd die (no kidding).

The sun\u2019s growing confidence brings hope, but the blizzards are back again, shutting out the light, clogging the floor of Strid Wood with snow, smothering the first leaves of dog\u2019s mercury and ramsons. Around this date in previous years I have heard drumming snipe on the moors or found breeding frogs in the ponds around here, but there will be few such mood-lifting discoveries today.\nSpring cold snaps are not unusual, but this one results from this winter\u2019s dramatic destabilisation of the polar vortex, the wall of wind that encircles the Arctic. As we have been strafed by snow, the temperature in parts of the sunless polar region has been as much as 35C above average, prompting fresh consternation among climate change experts. \nYet the effect on the ground here is not without its charm; in the Valley of Desolation, snow has draped itself over the tangled boughs of oak and dusted the brackets of a mazegill fungus so they look a bit like iced buns. It is a dissonant overlay of realities; the snow revives innocence, but the jarring background note is impossible to ignore. \nThis secretive nick in the side of Wharfedale is misleadingly titled; it has a pair of exquisite, exuberant waterfalls and some lovely pockets of broadleaved woodland. But it can attest to the profound mutability of weather and climate. In recent times, it has been the site for an interesting reflection on Wharfedale\u2019s past: the plantations leading up the valley, designed by the Bolton Abbey estate\u2019s head forester, Roy Lingard, emulate the regeneration of the area after the last ice age, from post-glacial tundra to temperate woodland. And its Tolkien-esque name comes from an 1826 storm that was powerful enough to flatten many of its trees, leaving behind scenes of such destruction that the bleak moniker stuck. \nAll of which is a reminder that climate needs no help to change, or to wreak havoc, but we are giving it a shove; what this place may look like even in another 100 years is anyone\u2019s guess. \n", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/snow", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/winter", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/yorkshire", "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/ruralaffairs", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Valley of Desolation, Wharfedale, Yorkshire Dales: The snow revives innocence, but it\u2019s from this winter\u2019s dramatic destabilisation of the polar vortex and a reminder of climate change", "date_published": {"$date": 1522643400000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1522754778000}, "authors": ["Carey Davies"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Spring", "Snow", "Winter", "Environment", "Climate change", "Yorkshire", "UK news", "Rural affairs"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/02/country-diary-a-dissonant-overlay-of-realities", "og:description": "Valley of Desolation, Wharfedale, Yorkshire Dales: The snow revives innocence, but it\u2019s from this winter\u2019s dramatic destabilisation of the polar vortex and a reminder of climate change", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0ed69649fd1963fc53e15189501dd25e3b8a6fd/0_394_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=bfb683b10ec8ded48df6b478ef49ee1c", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Country diary: a dissonant overlay of realities"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "r", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0ed69649fd1963fc53e15189501dd25e3b8a6fd/0_394_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=47a78636495c8f3701b8e97bf598571a", "width": "4608", "height": "2765", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0ed69649fd1963fc53e15189501dd25e3b8a6fd/0_394_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ac270bfcefd8d85527e0cc7c004e2ca", "description": "A pond and surrounding plantings representing the \u2018Atlantic period\u2019 (5,500-2,500 years ago) in the Valley of Desolation.\nPhotograph: Carey Davies"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e492930b46553d33009ccb0abec54a61da1df7f/0_0_4608_3456/master/4608.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=506f547d67acbe57fa1e3db1ac96485c", "width": "4608", "height": "3456", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e492930b46553d33009ccb0abec54a61da1df7f/0_0_4608_3456/master/4608.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e152a1cf08561e46632d2c73724f9e81", "description": "Torrents above Posforth Force in the Valley of Desolation.

Behaving as if it is degrades democratic process and our personal political sovereignty. \nA zero-sum game is a contest for control of finite resources. Whatever one gains, another must lose. When two or more candidates compete for a single public office, only one can win, so many people view politics as bloodsport, applying \u201cwinner takes all\u201d thinking to everything political. But elected officials are not conquerors; they are sworn servants to all their constituents. \nThe beating heart of a free society is the guarantee of personal political sovereignty, safeguarded by transparent institutions, checks and balances, and a free press.\nPolitical sovereignty is informational sovereignty. Disinformation disempowers. Distortion of our informational environment has slowed humanity\u2019s overall effort to eliminate corruption and transcend harmful practices, like those that destabilize Earth\u2019s climate. \nWhat corrosive hyper-partisanship misses is that human intelligence, creative collaboration, and adherence to basic principles of fairness, make more good possible and so result in real value added \u2014 throughout the system, for the benefit of everyone. \nSuccess requires dealing ably with complexity. \nNeurons in the human brain organize themselves into vast 7-dimensional sandcastle structures \u2014 flashes of consciousness that emerge and disappear in millionths of a second. Brains are organic synaptic networks. More connections mean more possibilities \u2013 more \u201cgoing on.\u201d Bigger, more complex constellations of neural-attentive cohesion are effectively a bigger landscape for thoughtful attention, recall and imagination \u2014 an expanded, diversified space for figuring out what needs figuring.\nZero-sum thinking strips intelligence from our politics. Generative thinking recognizes that complex constructive interactions make us smarter, more capable, freer, and more secure. \nAt the human scale, we naturally demand trustworthy generative value-building be an organic part of our experience. If we are informationally sovereign, we can scale up smart decision-making to correct hidden market failures and expand routine access to increased value for everyone.\nTo distort and disrupt climate and energy decision-making, carbon polluters spent hundreds of millions of dollars over several decades. Their aim was to degrade the sovereignty of voters, consumers, rivals in the innovation space, the free press, and even nation states.\nSuch corrosive behaviors have undermined the competitiveness of polluting industries, making outdated methods appear longer lived than they stand a real chance of being, even as they build up unprecedented, nonlinear carbon liability. Market forces will eventually stop rewarding ever more costly carbon-intensive practices that put irreplaceable natural life-supports at risk. \n\u2022 In 2017, the United States spent as much in disaster relief \u2014 for floods, wildfires, drought, and storms \u2014 as the total comparable spending from 1980 to 2010.\n\u2022 We now have scalable clean power-generating technologies, cost-effective industrial-scale and in-home battery storage, and rapidly expanding clean finance. \n\u2022 In many places, wind and solar are now cheaper than coal, and distributed energy production systems are supported by decentralized information networks. \n\u2022 Entrepreneurs are learning to empower communities to share surplus clean energy amongst themselves, overruling the market dominance of fuel-burning power plants. \nThe practice of depending on society (and natural systems) to absorb unaffordable costs of doing business generates massive structural debt \u2014 investment risk and secondary liability built into the structure of the economy. Soon, markets may have access to high-precision calculations of such costs, in near real time. There is no reason for such risky business models, or corrupt institutions, to continue to undermine humanity\u2019s ability to solve big problems. \n\u2022 We are now witnessing the rise of high-efficiency climate-smart finance to drive new investment and innovation in many sectors. \n\u2022 The mainstreaming of green bonds and application of smart carbon pricing policies will make the whole economy more efficient at building value for people, institutions, and enterprise. \n\u2022 High-resolution Earth systems science and new data technologies will soon allow us to acquire actionable resilience intelligence at both the planetary and human scales.\nThe work of making a better, freer, more livable world is in our hands. We owe it to each other, and to those who will come after us, to go beyond zero-sum thinking, out-maneuver corrosive political actors, and build new value wherever human ingenuity allows. \nJoseph Robertson is Global Strategy Director for Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby, Founder and President of the Geoversiv Foundation, and lead strategist in the Resilience Intel initiative.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change-scepticism", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-tax", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Joseph Robertson: There are win-win solutions to this problem.", "date_published": {"$date": 1522663208000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1531523631000}, "authors": ["Joseph Robertson"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Climate change scepticism", "Environment", "Carbon tax", "Greenhouse gas emissions"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/02/on-climate-change-zero-sum-thinking-doesnt-work", "og:description": "Joseph Robertson: There are win-win solutions to this problem.", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3314afa69043d21a11f92c5dcd0a0da9fef4a5de/0_218_2900_1739/master/2900.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=8864325548dba8431f8ebe3dd75122d4", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "On climate change, zero-sum thinking doesn't work | Joseph Robertson"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "O", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3314afa69043d21a11f92c5dcd0a0da9fef4a5de/0_218_2900_1739/master/2900.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=09d6b0a9c3b20a3db49cede28565f243", "width": "2900", "height": "1739", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3314afa69043d21a11f92c5dcd0a0da9fef4a5de/0_218_2900_1739/master/2900.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9e38188c8e2ce202c75be5c27abd81e8", "description": "Both intangible human capital and life-sustaining natural capital are required to achieve the multi-faceted interactive value-building of macro-critically resilient financial and political institutions.\nPhotograph: Joseph Robertson"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0251876ac4b52d5fe41aad7e0c1b594e70a68048/0_0_4056_2281/master/4056.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f98a58f0ecb28799d0de122ea564653f", "width": "4056", "height": "2281", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0251876ac4b52d5fe41aad7e0c1b594e70a68048/0_0_4056_2281/master/4056.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3182bb959477486acffe103ec4106bb4", "description": "Snapshot of the \u2018Peace Synapse\u2019 relational synaptic graph of climate, peace and security knowledge relationships, spanning the period 2009-2016.

Climate change and the conceptual penisNowhere are the consequences of hypermasculine machismo braggadocio isomorphic identification with the conceptual penis more problematic than concerning the issue of climate change. Climate change is driven by nothing more than it is by certain damaging themes in hypermasculinity that can be best understood via the dominant rapacious approach to climate ecology identifiable with the conceptual penis. Our planet is rapidly approaching the much-warned-about 2\u00b0C climate change threshold,and due to patriarchal power dynamics that maintain present capitalist structures, especially with regard to the fossil fuel industry, the connection between hypermasculine dominance of scientific, political, and economic discourses and the irreparable damage to our ecosystem is made clear.Destructive, unsustainable hegemonically male approaches to pressing environmental policy and action are the predictable results of a raping of nature by a male-dominated mindset. This mindset is best captured by recognizing the role of the conceptual penis holds over masculine psychology.When it is applied to our natural environment, especially virgin environments that can be cheaply despoiled for their material resources and left dilapidated and diminished when our patriarchal approaches to economic gain have stolen their inherent worth, the extrapolation of the rape culture inherent in the conceptual penis becomes clear. At best, climate change is genuinely an example ofhyper-patriarchal society metaphorically manspreading into the global ecosystem.The deep reason for this problematic trend is explained, in its essence, by McElwaine (1999), where he writes, \u201cPickett suggests that we have to choose between capitalist rationalism and cultural subcapitalist theory\u201d (Pickett, 1993). Contemporary capitalist theory, a.k.a. neocapitalist theory, derivesits claim on rationalism directly from the hypermasculine focus in science and society that can best be accounted for by identification with the conceptual penis. Paxton and Scameron (2006) seem to agree, noting that, \u201cneocapitalist materialist theory holds that reality comes from the collective unconscious, but only if the premise of dialectic objectivism is invalid; if that is not the case, sexualityhas significance.\u201d Toxic hypermasculinity derives its significance directly from the conceptual penis and applies itself to supporting neocapitalist materialism, which is a fundamental driver of climate change, especially in the rampant use of carbon-emitting fossil fuel technologies and careless domination of virgin natural environments. We need not delve deeply into criticisms of dialectic objectivism,or their relationships with masculine tropes like the conceptual penis to make effective criticism of (exclusionary) dialectic objectivism. All perspectives matter.One practical recommendation that follows from this analysis is that climate change research would be better served by a change in how we engage in the discourses of politics and science, avoiding the hypermasculine penis-centric take whenever possible (Kaijser & Kronsell, 2013).\"\nThe whole issue is further detailed here.https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/conceptual-penis-social-contruct-sokal-style-hoax-on-gender-studies/", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "114332697", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "patriarchal power dynamics that maintain present capitalist structures", "effect": "the connection between hypermasculine dominance of scientific discourses is made clear"}]}, {"id": "114332697", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1522830252000}, "author": "ComfortablyPlumb", "author_id": "14842422", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nBoth intangible human capital and life-sustaining natural capital are required to achieve the multi-faceted interactive value-building of macro-critically resilient financial and political institutions.\nBQENDCan't argue with that....", "recommendation_count": "2", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "114331831", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1522828538000}, "author": "gitsumomma", "author_id": "16270886", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Despite all the gobbledygook in this article he is absolutely right that environmentalists and industrialists could and should now be on the same side.\nThe economic penalties of sticking with our outdated model ( basically anything goes in the name of short term profit and screw what happens tomorrow)...\n are becoming so apparent and soon will hit us in the face like a sledgehammer.\nOn top of this there is so much obvious economic potential in developing and rolling out the new technologies that there is going to become a point when this becomes the new normal model and those who insist on sticking to the old ways will be subject to society's constraint and ostracism.\nThe real question though is will this happen soon enough?", "recommendation_count": "1", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "114327334", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1522804833000}, "author": "SunRoad", "author_id": "18399512", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\n\" Oh no, not again Sunroad.No-one here is fooled by your half-baked pseudo-mystical word salad adverts- maybe try somewhere else.

In other words, using this earlier baseline results in an additional 0.28\u00b0C rise. When using an even earlier baseline, i.e. 1750 or preindustrial, it could be 1.53\u00b0C warmer, as discussed in an earlier post. In other words, merely changing the baseline to preindustrial, as agreed to at the Paris Agreement, can show that we're already above the 1.5\u00b0C guardrail that the Paris Agreement had pledged we should not cross.There's more! As a recent publication points out, most methods that calculate the global temperature use sea surface temperatures. However, doesn't it make more sense to calculate the temperature of the air just above the sea surface? Measuring air temperature at the surface is done in the case of temperatures over land, where one doesn't measure the temperature of the soil or rocks when telling people how warm it is. Since air surface temperatures are slightly higher than sea surface temperatures, the result of looking at air surface temperatures across the globe would be a temperature that is approximately 0.1\u00b0C warmer. Furthermore, many areas in the Arctic may not have been adequately reflected in the global temperature, e.g. because insufficient data were available. Since the Arctic has been warming much faster than the rest of the world, inclusion of those areas would add another 0.1\u00b0C to the rise. Adding this to the above 1.53\u00b0C rise makes that it's already 1.73\u00b0C (or 3.11\u00b0F) warmer than preindustrial.\"\nhttp://arctic-news.blogspot.co.uk/", "recommendation_count": "2", "in_reply_to": "114284797", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "114296707", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1522740132000}, "author": "JimDandelion", "author_id": "12720428", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Felix, you and I disagree on many things.

These targets refer to allowable temperature increases over pre-industrial temperatures. If humans take action to hit a 1.5\u00b0C target, it means we are committed to keeping the human-caused global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C. Similarly for a 2\u00b0C target.\nThe lower the target, the smaller the climate change. The smaller the climate change, the better. But is it worth the effort to set lower targets? I mean, if 2\u00b0C is good enough, why take the trouble to keep temperatures within 1.5\u00b0C? \nFortunately, a new paper just out in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A asks this question. Specifically, they ask \u201cHow much larger are the impacts at 2\u00b0C compared to 1.5\u00b0C?\u201d A follow-on question asked by the authors relates to what conditions occur at a particular level of warming, such as 2\u00b0C. This is a really important question because policymakers need to know what it will take to adapt to a 1.5\u00b0C world or a 2\u00b0C world.\nThe authors focus on the impact of climate change on food security, and in particular, how changes to extreme weather will impact food production. The weather issues that are central to this study are drought and precipitation. We know that in a warming world, the weather will get wetter. This is because warm air is more able to hold water (air can be more humid). As a consequence, when rains fall, they come in heavier bursts. We are already seeing this in the US, for example, where the most extreme rainfalls are increasing across the country.\nBut, at the same time, evaporation happens quicker and areas can dry out faster. So, when the rains stop, drought can set in quicker and more severely. \nSo, there are competing issues and an obvious question is, which will win out? Will the world become drier or wetter? The answer to this question depends on where you live. It is likely that areas that are currently wet will become wetter. Areas that are currently dry will become drier. This is just a general rule of thumb, there are variations to this rule. But it is a pretty good generalization.\nThis behavior is vexing for farmers because it makes planning for the future complicated. But this study at least shines some light on the subject and helps us prepare. To complete the study, the authors considered an Earth that has 1.5\u00b0C warming and another Earth with 2\u00b0C warming. The authors then identified specific measures for extreme weather. Among the measures are the annual maximum temperature, the percentage of days with extreme daily temperatures, the number of consecutive dry days, and the maximum rainfall in a 5-day period. \nMeasures of heavy rainfall and drought were combined with societal factors to form a Hunger and Climate Vulnerability Index. The index incorporates how exposed a country is to climate hazards, how sensitive a country\u2019s agriculture is to climate hazards, and how able a country is to adapt. With these metrics and indices calculated for 122 countries in the developing and under-developed parts of the globe, the authors show that some areas will be more impacted than others. \nIncreased wetness will affect Asia more than other regions. Among their predictions is that the water flowrate in the Ganges river may increase by 100%. However, increases to drought could hit Africa and South America hardest. An example outcome is that the Amazon river flow may decrease by 25%. They also found that for most of the planet, a 2\u00b0C world is worse than a 1.5\u00b0C world. This is to be expected, but now there is a way to quantify the impact of incremental increases in temperature on societal impact.\nWhen the authors continued their look at various regions, that found that temperature changes are amplified in some locations. For instance, with a 2\u00b0C warmer world, the land areas mostly warm by more than 2\u00b0C. In some regions, like North America, China, northern Asia, northern South America, and Europe, the daily high temperature increases could be double that of the globe on average.\nIn the figure below, the Hunger and Climate Variability Index is shown for a 2\u00b0C warmer world. The image is scaled according to how vulnerable they are to food insecurity. Countries with a larger value are more vulnerable than countries with a smaller number. Any country with a vulnerability greater than 1 is more vulnerable than any country today.\nAs lead author Richard Betts explained,\nFood insecurity is affected by many factors, not just climate. Poverty, access to irrigation and transport networks are all crucial. But increased flooding or drought can impact food production and distribution, making food systems less secure.\nI\u2019ll offer a couple of words of caution. The study really focused on drought and rainfall only. There are other societal impacts that are not included, like sea level rise or ocean acidification. With drought and precipitation, at least the climate behaves somewhat proportionally to the warming. But with something like sea level rise, things are far less certain. There, tipping points may exist that once we cross them, there is no going back. For instance, is there a tipping point for ice sheet loss from Greenland or Antarctica? A certain temperature threshold that once passed cannot be reversed? \nThe other word of caution is that this study is purposely limited to extreme weather, fresh water, and agriculture. There are many other impacts of climate change on society that are not captured in this research. \nBut that aside, this is an important study that helps us identify the winners and losers in a warming world and helps policymakers decide whether we should take action now to try to limit temperature increases to 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C.

Global surface temperature in 2017 was the second highest in the period of instrumental measurements in the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) analysis. Relative to average temperature for 1880-1920, which we take as an appropriate estimate of \u201cpre-industrial\u201d temperature, 2017 was +1.17\u00b0C (~2.1\u00b0F) warmer than in the 1880-1920 base period. \nThe high 2017 temperature, unlike the record 2016 temperature, was obtained without any boost from tropical El Ni\u00f1o warming.\nWe take 1880-1920 as baseline, i.e., as the zero-point for temperature anomalies, because it is the earliest period with substantial global coverage of instrumental measurements and because it also has a global mean temperature that should approximate \u201cpreindustrial\u201d temperature.\nWe estimate current underlying temperature, excluding short-term variability via linear fit to the post- 1970 temperature.

Leaving the European Union could be the single most environmentally damaging act taken by government in the past half-century.\nAlmost all of the UK\u2019s environmental policy derives from our membership of the EU. Across the full range of issues \u2013 air and water pollution, habitats and species protection, waste management and recycling, energy efficiency, carbon emissions and energy policy \u2013 it is EU regulation that has raised standards.\nMost current EU environmental law will remain in place \u2013 initially. But, unless specifically prevented by a future EU-UK trade agreement, a future government could weaken it. Recognising this danger, the secretary of state for the environment, Michael Gove, has promised a consultation on a new, independent body to enforce environmental law. But it is not clear if this will have the powers of the European commission and the European court of justice.\nEnvironmental NGOs have started campaigning for new legislation. But the opportunity may be greater than they had recognised. Until recently, regulation has mainly worked by requiring businesses or products \u2013 farms, factories, buildings, cars \u2013 to cut waste and pollution. But the overall impact on the environment has not been controlled. Reductions have been outweighed by the counter-effect of economic growth and new products and processes.\nThe exception has been in the field of climate change. It is not just individual products and companies that are required to cut greenhouse gas emissions: whole countries are. Under EU law, and the UK\u2019s own 2008 Climate Change Act, environmental limits have been imposed on our entire economy. The act requires the government to limit the total carbon emissions of the UK to levels set in law.\nThe Climate Change Act has been extremely successful. But climate change is not the only environmental threat\nThe revolutionary nature of this approach has not been widely understood. The Climate Change Act effectively places the UK economy under a sustainability constraint. Every five years, the government of the day is required to adopt a legally binding \u201ccarbon budget\u201d setting limits on the total greenhouse gas emissions of the UK economy in a five-year period. Such budgets must be set for 15 years ahead, to give businesses and investors time to plan, and they must lie on a trajectory towards the long-term goal of an 80% reduction in UK emissions by 2050 (defined relative to 1990 levels).\nThe Climate Change Act has been extremely successful. But climate change is not the only environmental threat. Last month, the intergovernmental panel on biodiversity warned that human destruction of nature is rapidly eroding the world\u2019s capacity to provide food, water and security to more than 3 billion people. The UK may be only 40 years away from the near-eradication of soil fertility. Our air pollution is estimated to shorten 40,000 lives a year.\nA sustainable economy act should now be the new model. At its core would be a legal requirement on the government to set environmental limits, and to produce economy-wide plans to achieve them. Over time these limits should include air pollution, soil degradation, resource depletion, plastics pollution and biodiversity loss. All together they would bring the economy within a sustainability constraint.\nFor each major environmental impact, the act would establish a long-term goal and require the government to set shorter-term targets and plans. So, for example, the 25-year goal of eliminating non-recyclable plastics would be implemented through a series of five-year plans to cut plastic waste by a specific number of tonnes. A long-term goal of restoring biodiversity to, say, a 1980 benchmark would be implemented through successive five-year targets for individual declining species.\nThe goals and targets would be based on the advice of an expert and independent sustainable economy commission, modelled on the climate change committee, which would in turn report to parliament.\nIt has now been 30 years since Margaret Thatcher warned that \u201cno generation has a freehold on this Earth. All we have is a life tenancy \u2013 with a full repairing lease.\u201d It is finally time to recognise the fundamental truth that environmental degradation arises from within our economy. Only by constraining it to live within the planet\u2019s limits, in law, can we ensure a sustainable future.\n\u2022 This article was amended on 6 April 2018 because a change made during the editing process led an earlier version to suggest that a sustainable economy act already exists.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum", "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/waste", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/air-pollution", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/biodiversity", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Michael Gove has promised an independent watchdog but not what is required \u2013 legally enforceable targets, says Michael Jacobs, director of the IPPR Commission on Economic Justice", "date_published": {"$date": 1522760340000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1523198388000}, "authors": ["Michael Jacobs"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "Brexit", "Politics", "Michael Gove", "Waste", "Air pollution", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Biodiversity", "Energy efficiency", "European Union", "Endangered habitats", "UK news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/03/brexit-harm-environment-michael-gove", "og:description": "Michael Gove has promised an independent watchdog but not what is required \u2013 legally enforceable targets, says Michael Jacobs, director of the IPPR Commission on Economic Justice", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d036e9a4ff17de09cab3b73916ac23c33917d3c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=552c2d06d7511ff0236ea47b42c31784", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Only revolutionary new laws can stop Brexit harming the environment | Michael Jacobs"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d036e9a4ff17de09cab3b73916ac23c33917d3c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7e68cc1f75455dd5de8f37453a33c1a1", "width": "4000", "height": "2400", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d036e9a4ff17de09cab3b73916ac23c33917d3c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=385f515d5e09ad1ffe28113159d1dbee", "description": "Michael Gove receives a Greenpeace petition last week calling for a deposit return scheme to tackle plastic pollution.\nPhotograph: Will Rose/Greenpeace"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556127956210}, "comments": [{"id": "114414395", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1522997981000}, "author": "Carlito1966", "author_id": "16077227", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Erm....frack off", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "114302340", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "114410395", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1522975059000}, "author": "MexicanGod", "author_id": "18337105", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nlack of educational opportunities during these early years\nBQEND\nBut that isn't the case, is it? there aren't a lack of educational opportunities.

Really, honestly, hand on heart, do you actually not believe that there were many (if any at all) that did not know. It\u2019s not as if it wasn\u2019t shouted at them (figuratively) every day by multiple sources prior to the vote.As for your claiming to have addressed the 250 figure, yes a mild and discrete admission toward the end of your posting (not that it matters, since everyone the facts). Your comment \u201cI\u2019ll clarify that what you would mean to say were you informed, is that brexit was driven primarily by ignorance, manipulation, prejudice and confusion.\u201d In fact most clearly demonstrates the attitude to Bexit voters from a large percentage of Remainers. Arrogance. More usually followed by insults of course, and certainly not usually by any attempt at engaging in debate, though I congratulate you on at least engaging intelligently rather than with the usual abuse (though of course, I disagree with you!).And to your comment \u201cWhat was it for you? Wages been driven down by immigration? Overburdened services? Housing crisis? Country overpopulated? Which lie did you swallow?\u201d, as usual you are guessing wrongly. I am one of the fortunate ones working in an industry that has not been adversely affected by mass immigration (at least not as far as I am aware \u2013 I work in technology so I am more likely to be affected by globalization/offshoring than mass immigration), I am fortunate enough to own my own house and if anything will \u201cdownsize\u201d at my next move. I have not needed social services and have been fortunate enough to enjoy excellent health \u2013 so the NHS crisis has not (yet?) affected me. However, I have seen those around me affected by the onslaught of mass immigration and excessive population rise. What you call \u201clies\u201d is in fact everyday experience for them. Undeniable, and backed by the facts and figures. I live in the south east, not so far from London, so I guess the main effect I have noticed from the population explosion is the crowding of roads in my area; a natural consequence of the mass immigration and the mass exodus of people outward from London. An irritation to me, and one that is relatively easily solved for me by moving out further from cities. Would that the more serious problems experienced by those around me were so easily solved.You say \u201cThe approximate cost of a tv license per citizen.\u201d. Oh dear. I\u2019ve done that one to death elsewhere, but to summarise \u2013 The calculation spreads the amount across every person, yet every person does not work (children, and unemployed), plus not everyone pays the same tax (many pay none, and many more already pay less than their cost to the system). Consequently, that money is not extracted from people evenly. You know this, yet you choose to deceive in your comparison. An you have the cheek to complain endlessly about the 350/250 matter. Unbelievable. One final point on the matter, The cost of a tv license to you might be mere pocket money, but (since you are averaging it across all the population) to those on low incomes it is not so insignificant. In fact, using your idea, it would have to be multiplied by four or five for a family with two or three children. Quite onerous an amount for many.As for \u201cAnd you think that\u2019s a bad deal. Well, I think that\u2019s pure ignorance. I couldn\u2019t care less if ignorant people hate something they don\u2019t understand. They\u2019ll get it soon enough when the lies they\u2019ve swallowed fail to materialise.\u201d. Well, a little rude, but he-ho. Quite expected and as I said, not as abusive as others. Anyway, let\u2019s have the opportunity to see whether Brexit works out fine financially for most. If it turns out not so good, then we could have another referendum in say 20 years time, and rejoin if that is what people want.

It has given Shell eight weeks to shift to a cleaner tack, after which it says it is prepared to invoke international obligations, human rights treaties and laws on hazardous negligence. \nHeading the group\u2019s legal team is Roger Cox, who led and won a landmark climate case in 2015 that insisted the Dutch government should set more ambitious emissions targets.\n\u201cThis is the first case we know of in the world that seeks preventive action from a company over climate change,\u201d Cox told the Guardian. \u201cWe are not asking for damages. We want Shell to steer away from its current course and to get in line with the Paris agreement.\u201d\nShell is one of the world\u2019s 10 biggest carbon emitters. In its annual report last year, the company publicly declared support for the Paris climate deal. It has also outlined \u201cdecarbonisation pathways\u201d to move away from dependency on fossil fuels, but environmentalists are frustrated at the glacial pace of change and the weak investment in renewables and carbon capture technology.\nFriends of the Earth says the company should be held to account for the approximately 2% of the historical emissions of carbon dioxide and methane it has added to the atmosphere between 1854 and 2010. It has previously taken the company to court for the damage it caused around oil fields in Nigeria.\n\u201cCurrently Shell and companies like it are acting like big tobacco in decades past by failing to take responsibility for the harm that they cause,\u201d said Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland. \u201cShell must now move on from its history of Earth-damaging fossil fuel extraction and play a major part in the transition to a sustainable future, to keep temperature rises to near 1.5C.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Shell said the company strongly supported the Paris agreement, \u201cbut we believe climate change is a complex societal challenge that should be addressed through sound government policy and cultural change to drive low-carbon choices for businesses and consumers, not by the courts.\u201d \nGiven the vast discrepancy in financial resources, any legal battle between Friends of the Earth and Shell would be a challenge of David and Goliath proportions.\nBut Dutch courts have produced surprises. Arguably the biggest victory for climate litigators anywhere in the world was the 2015 ruling that the Dutch government\u2019s plans to cut emissions by just 14-17% compared to 1990 levels by 2020 were unlawful, given the scale of the threat posed by climate change. The court in The Hague ordered the government to raise targets to at least 25% within five years, although the government is appealing against the decision.\nIf the Friends of the Earth case goes ahead, Cox said it will depend on the legal duty of everyone in the Netherlands to prevent harm to others when it is reasonably preventable. The duty of public care was easier to prove against the government. It will be tougher against a private company, but Cox said the plaintiffs will emphasises that Shell has specific responsibilities because it has contributed to greatly to the problem of climate change.\n Courts in other countries are increasingly a climate change battleground. \nAccording to  the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia law school in New York, there are now more than 1,000 cases in the world. Most are claims for damages in the US.\n In January, New York city announced plans to sue five fossil fuel firms \u2013 BP, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Shell \u2013 for their contribution to climate change, which has caused flooding and erosion in the city. Local governments in California and elsewhere have launched legal actions, alongside private citizens. Last month, a group of 21 young plaintiffs overcame a major hurdle when a judge rejected moves to dismiss their lawsuit, which argues the US government\u2019s failure to curb CO2 emissions violated their generation\u2019s constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property.\nIn the most prominent UK case to date, a high court heard the first climate challenge last month against the British government, brought by 12 citizens through a legal group called Plan B which has the support of the government\u2019s former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir David King.\nNasa scientist-turned activist James Hansen has called for a wave of litigation alongside political mobilisation because, he says, judges are less likely than politicians to be in the pocket of oil, coal and gas companies.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/royaldutchshell", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/friends-of-the-earth", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/oil", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Friends of the Earth demands the oil firm move away from fossil fuels to comply with Paris deal", "date_published": {"$date": 1522842069000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1522842069000}, "authors": ["Jonathan Watts"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Paris climate agreement", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "Royal Dutch Shell", "Friends of the Earth", "World news", "Business", "Fossil fuels", "Oil", "Oil and gas companies", "Energy", "Energy industry", "Netherlands", "Europe"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/04/friends-of-the-earth-threatens-to-sue-shell-over-climate-change-contributions", "og:description": "Friends of the Earth demands the oil firm move away from fossil fuels to comply with Paris deal", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6c8791cb5d8c104b4c9f8bee31cbd730a33ac34/0_268_4974_2986/master/4974.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=7085867a964c992f4155139a2e6e17fe", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Shell threatened with legal action over climate change contributions"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6c8791cb5d8c104b4c9f8bee31cbd730a33ac34/0_268_4974_2986/master/4974.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0945a1fc85bba94fb942ae47413f82c3", "width": "4974", "height": "2986", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6c8791cb5d8c104b4c9f8bee31cbd730a33ac34/0_268_4974_2986/master/4974.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e416bc840c7e12b68eceee3f3c4be057", "description": "The Royal Dutch Shell stand at Gastech, the world\u2019s biggest expo for the gas industry, in Chiba, Japan.\nPhotograph: Toru Hanai/Reuters"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc084a9a2c3613145ed905d"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2018/apr/05/you-dont-have-to-be-a-climate-science-denier-to-join-the-monash-coal-forum-but-it-helps", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "There seems to be three rules for membership of the Coalition\u2019s new backbench Monash Forum that wants taxpayer subsidies for new coal fired power stations.\nFirstly, you have to really love the life-giving and not-really-all-that-deadly rock from the late Permian and Carboniferous which, if they made it into a snack bar, you would totally want to eat it and then rub the bits left sticking to the wrapper all over your naked form.\nSecond, you need to harbour a deep dislike for renewable energy, which you find untrustworthy and suspicious because its feedstock is as illusive as catching sunbeams and harnessing atmospheric pressure differences.\nThirdly, you need to have enough respect for a great Australian war hero and nation builder \u2013 Sir John Monash \u2013 that you\u2019d appropriate his name and legacy for your own little coal gang.\nOh no wait, there are four rules. Because, most importantly, to qualify for coal star membership of the Monash Forum, you need to be a climate science denier \u2013 a proper one that goes to climate denial meetings on the other side of the world and gives speeches and stuff.\nLike Nationals MP George Christensen, for example, who seems to have been a chief architect of the Monash Forum. \nIn 2014, Christensen flew to Las Vegas to speak at a meeting of the Heartland Institute \u2013 a so-called \u201cthink tank\u201d that\u2019s part of the organised machinery of climate science denial.\nChristensen\u2019s speech was titled \u201cClimate Change: Where the Horror and Comedy Genres Collide\u201d which, it might occur to some, could have been a prescient commentary on the Monash Forum.\nTwo years earlier, Heartland had corporate backers and their cash heading for the exit after one of the most ill-judged billboard campaigns in history. \u201cI still believe in Global Warming. Do You?\u201d asked the billboard, next to a mugshot of terrorist and serial killer Ted \u201cUnabomber\u201d Kaczynski.\nWhen US president Donald Trump announced his country\u2019s withdrawal from the United Nations Paris climate agreement, Heartland\u2019s president was on the invite list for the Rose Garden announcement.\nChristensen\u2019s new Monash recruit, former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce, is another to have warmly embraced the vast body of evidence linking fossil fuel burning to climate change.\nThen there\u2019s former prime minister Tony Abbott, who, like Christensen, has long rejected the conclusions of all the world\u2019s major scientific institutions on the risks of burning the Monash Forum\u2019s favourite food. \nLast year, Abbott flew to London to deliver the annual lecture of the Global Warming Policy Foundation. How the coal executives must have laughed at Abbott\u2019s ham-fisted comparisons of emissions cuts to goat sacrifices \u201cto appease the volcano gods\u201d (he actually said that). \nLiberal MP Craig Kelly is another frontbencher in the Monash Forum. Kelly is chair of the backbench energy committee. \nIn 2015, Kelly tried to \u201cbalance\u201d a parliamentary briefing delivered by respected climate scientists by inviting some climate science deniers from Melbourne\u2019s Institute of Public Affairs \u2013 a group that, if it\u2019s possible, loves coal more than he does. \nThe forum\u2019s manifesto, if you\u2019ve had the misfortune to read it, has all the creepy qualities of the old bloke selling cigarettes to school kids down the back of the oval.\nhave you read the retrograde #MonashManifesto? text reproduced here.i'm offering 12-to-1 odds (payable in wine) that there won't be a new coal fired power station operating in australia before 2030 (or ever).#auspol pic.twitter.com/CeV6AdruP2\nAfter pushing the myth of \u201ccheap power\u201d with no mention of the fuel\u2019s actual social and environmental costs, the forum says, \u201call Australian governments must overcome their current coal-phobia and ensure that coal-fired power stations continue to be built.\u201d \nAs maybe I\u2019ve just illustrated, it\u2019s easy to be flippant and dismissive about the role and impact of climate science denial on Australia\u2019s climate policy.\nYet the undermining of mountains of scientific evidence over the course of more than two decades has poisoned and politicised an issue that was urgent two decades ago.\nWhen analysts ask why Australia\u2019s energy policy is in crisis, there\u2019s a tendency to forget the illogical political animosity towards renewables that stemmed from climate science denial. \nThe thinktanks that want to tell you that the science is flawed are the same ones still pushing coal, still lobbying against clean energy and still trying to sell that mythical clean coal.\nThere\u2019s an argument too that it\u2019s only really possible to get all warm and fuzzy about coal if you hide yourself from the true impacts that burning it is having now, and will have in the future, and that goes for the the majority of the Coalition that aren\u2019t members of the Monash group.\nIf you want to understand why Australia got itself into an \u201cenergy policy crisis\u201d with spiralling retail electricity prices, then the Monash Forum gives you a handy list of characters and some warmed-up coal industry talking points.\nOnce they\u2019ve stopped selling us subsidised coal, they no doubt have a great line in second hand typewriters that you could use to knock out your next fax.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tony-abbott", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change-scepticism", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The Coalition\u2019s backbench group of coal fans have a history of attacking climate science", "date_published": {"$date": 1522864828000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1522886901000}, "authors": ["Graham Readfearn"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Environment", "Coal", "Tony Abbott", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Climate change scepticism", "Australia news", "Energy", "Fossil fuels", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2018/apr/05/you-dont-have-to-be-a-climate-science-denier-to-join-the-monash-coal-forum-but-it-helps", "og:description": "The Coalition\u2019s backbench group of coal fans have a history of attacking climate science", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4476cdaa512ea726ec017f1ed3467d8cd7fe3719/0_158_3530_2118/master/3530.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=2fb36519291c437b5b7466363d79af27", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "You don't have to be a climate science denier to join the Monash coal forum, but it helps | Graham Readfearn"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4476cdaa512ea726ec017f1ed3467d8cd7fe3719/0_158_3530_2118/master/3530.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eea43cd3746e65ff19327ebae667c591", "width": "3530", "height": "2118", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4476cdaa512ea726ec017f1ed3467d8cd7fe3719/0_158_3530_2118/master/3530.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=81b0716ff883a2de1be797182e4778d3", "description": "Barnaby Joyce talks to George Christensen on the backbench in the House of Representatives in Parliament House.\nPhotograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556127957983}, "comments": [{"id": "114459412", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1523109046000}, "author": "Walsunda", "author_id": "12483673", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\"In the case of hazelwood, it was owned by SEC Vic They sold a capital asset for an amount greater than the cost of constructing and holding the asset.

That's not true for intermittent renewables. Solar is particularly bad at night, though why seems to be a mystery to quite a few people commenting here.\n* For example if I want to buy 100MWhr next Tuesday at 1am through to 3am, I could get a supply contract for an electricity company using coal/gas or hydro.I couldn't get it from solar and wind would be pretty dicey.\n* Yeah, Australia is just chock full of off river spare water near large rises in land suitable for a raised reservoir. Their plan is to build hundreds of small scale closed-loop hydro dams. That can't possibly be expensive! And they even want to use old mining sites, because contaminated water systems never happen from old mining sites.\n* They then assume that 25% of houses will have 5kW of Solar installed.That's a pretty heroic assumption given the requirement for exposed north facing roofs and around 35m2 for the panels. They then assume a similar size installed in commercial premises, except that the total area of commercial premises is significantly smaller than Australia's total housing stock - but who cares - just hand wave that one away.\n* You heard it here first! Labor will be increasing income taxes for everyone, because they don't want to be \"profligate\". Taxes raised everywhere! Your incomes taxes will rise, fuel excise will rise, superannuation savings will be taxed. Vote Labor for more taxes! Yay!\nBQEND\nBQSTART\n* Just grab $50, bung a solar panel on the roof and you're done! Buy 2 and you could do all of Australia, perhaps even onselling the technology to China. Seriously, what are you on about, do you hate the planet?\n* Your \"eyewitness\" said he was nodding off and his article states that Abbott said that the \"argument was crap\".So your \"quote\" is resolved as inaccurate.Whats your plan for the next 10 years? Blackouts and hope?\n* Why do you think that lying about what I have said is in any way constructive, is it because deep down you realise that what you are proposing is actually unworkable, but your politics means you have to attack this group regardless, or are you genuinely this lacking in knowledge that you don't understand how an intermittent energy source operates?\n* The correct quote is in fact \"the politics around climate change is crap\".Wherein Mr Abbott then described how anyone that in any way points out contradictions, conflict, issues etc. around climate science is branded an Earth hater and hence no sensible discussion can take place.\n* As evidence of his very correct reading of the politics of climate change I propose you look at my posts on this thread and the responses they have generated. Mr Abbott was 100% correct in his assessment.\n* The Direct Action Plan seems to be an actual response to climate change by attempting to reduce CO2 emissions, so this is hardly direct evidence of reducing the development of renewables. Just because you choose to do something else to reduce emissions doesn't mean you are acting against the other.\n* Wind farms are ugly, which is why every house and building doesn't have a large wind turbine on it.\n* The reliance on a widespread distribution and production network makes renewables more susceptible to storm damage and loss of network capacity. Coal generators can be closer to their user base.\nBQEND\nBQSTART\n* Unfortunately if all of Australia were to follow the SA approach, there's noone around to pump 15GW of electricity on our grid when things don't quite work out for intermittent sources.\n* You seem to be projecting here, the people promoting the use of systems that actually don't solve the existing problems are those promoting intermittent renewables and hand-waving issues around storage or reliability or relying on future research saving their bacon.\n* Neither does mathematics, and none of the proposals claimed by people here work at the scale necessary to actually solve any of our power needs.In addition worthless ad hominem like all you can post is neither science or in anyway constructive but it seems to entertain the majority that post on these forums.\nBQEND\nYou sir, are an obvious mouthpiece for your LNP/IPA masters.

It involves using a balloon to test the controversial proposition that aerosols released at a height of 20km in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere can alter the reflective properties of cloud cover.\nNow a dozen scholars, from countries including Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Ethiopia, India, Jamaica and Thailand, have joined the debate, arguing in the journal Nature that poor countries should take a lead in the field since they have most to gain or lose from the technology.\n The cooling effect has long been known in phenomena such as \u201cship tracks\u201d \u2013 narrow artificial clouds of pollution, created by emissions from ships, that contain more and smaller water droplets than typical clouds, making them brighter and more reflective of sunlight.\n \u201cSolar geoengineering \u2013 injecting aerosol particles into the stratosphere to reflect away a little inbound sunlight \u2013 is being discussed as a way to cool the planet, fast,\u201d the scientists write in Nature.\n \u201cSolar geoengineering is outlandish and unsettling. It invokes technologies that are redolent of science fiction \u2013 jets lacing the stratosphere with sunlight-blocking particles, and fleets of ships spraying seawater into low-lying clouds to make them whiter and brighter to reflect sunlight. \n \u201cYet, if such approaches could be realised technically and politically, they could slow, stop or even reverse the rise in global temperatures within one or two years. \n \u201cThe technique is controversial, and rightly so,\u201d they add. \u201cIt is too early to know what its effects would be: it could be very helpful or very harmful. Developing countries have most to gain or lose. In our view, they must maintain their climate leadership and play a central part in research and discussions around solar geoengineering.\u201d\n In an interview with Reuters, Dr Atiq Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies and the article\u2019s lead author, amplified his arguments.\n \u201cClearly [solar radiation management geoengineering] could be dangerous, but we need to know whether, for countries like Bangladesh, it would be more or less risky than passing the 1.5C warming goal. This matters greatly to people from developing countries and our voices need to be heard.\n\u201cThe overall idea [of solar geoengineering] is pretty crazy, but it is gradually taking root in the world of research,\u201d said Rahman.\nThe solar geoengineering studies may be helped by a new $400,000 (\u00a3284,100) research project, the solar radiation management governance initiative (SRMGI), which is issuing a first call for scientists to apply for finance this week. \nThe initiative is financed by the Open Philanthropy Project, a foundation backed by Dustin Moskovitz, a co-founder of Facebook, and his wife, Cari Tuna. \nThe fund could help scientists in developing nations study the regional impacts of solar geoengineering, for instance on droughts, floods or monsoons, said Andy Parker, a co-author and project director of the SRMGI. \nRahman said the academics were not taking sides about whether geoengineering would work. \nAnd not everyone is convinced by the prospect of the technology.\nIn a leaked draft of a report about global warming due for publication in October, a UN panel of climate experts express scepticism about solar geoengineering, suggesting it may be \u201ceconomically, socially and institutionally infeasible\u201d.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/sustainable-development", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/geoengineering", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Scholars from developing countries call for greater say in solar geoengineering research, arguing poor nations have most at stake", "date_published": {"$date": 1522908041000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1544792897000}, "authors": ["Peter Beaumont"], "article_section": "Global development", "article_tags": ["Environmental sustainability", "Global development", "Sustainable development", "Environment", "Geoengineering", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Science"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/apr/05/scientists-suggest-giant-sunshade-in-sky-could-solve-global-warming", "og:description": "Scholars from developing countries call for greater say in solar geoengineering research, arguing poor nations have most at stake", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eda730004e619523939d7db12c96a680c2f485f/232_513_5538_3323/master/5538.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=5a6fc811b690c51a8dafb5cef0c4f3bf", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Scientists suggest a giant sunshade in the sky could solve global warming"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eda730004e619523939d7db12c96a680c2f485f/232_513_5538_3323/master/5538.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ce04b8c6b85e2c4a293b8710af8f5832", "width": "5538", "height": "3323", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eda730004e619523939d7db12c96a680c2f485f/232_513_5538_3323/master/5538.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=93a4e7049538f71fc9f55eef521c967d", "description": "Solar geoengineering has been floated as an \u2018outlandish and unsettling\u2019 answer to climate change.\nPhotograph: ISS/Nasa"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc084caa2c3613145ed905f"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/05/iea-accused-of-undermining-global-shift-from-fossil-fuels", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "The global shift from fossil fuels to renewables is being undermined by the very organisation that ought to be leading the charge, according to a scathing new critique of the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nGovernments across the world rely on IEA projections to set energy policies, but the agency\u2019s figures \u2013 which are influenced by the oil industry \u2013 are pushing them off track to reach the targets of the Paris climate agreement, says the report.\nThe study, released on Thursday by research and advocacy NGO Oil Change International, claims the agency\u2019s investment projections remain massively skewed towards oil and gas, effectively encouraging governments to overshoot emissions targets and worsen climate damage.\nIn its annual World Energy Outlook, the IEA provides a series of possible scenarios, each of which is dependent on the decisions taken by governments. Oil Change International says all of them would break the Paris targets to keep global temperature rises to well below 2C, or ideally 1.5C, by the end of the century.\nUnder the most prominent and widely used of the IEA\u2019s pathways \u2013 the \u201cnew policy scenario\u201d \u2013 the world\u2019s carbon budget for 1.5C would be exhausted by 2022, and for 2C by 2034, the report calculates. Even its most ambitious outlook \u2013 the \u201csustainable development scenario\u201d \u2013 would bust the 2C budget by 2040, even though it assumes the deployment of as yet untried to extract carbon emissions from the atmosphere, it says.\n\u201cThe IEA provides an energy roadmap that is supposed to lead us to safety, but in fact it takes us over the cliff,\u201d says Greg Muttitt, research director at Oil Change International. \u201cAny government or financial institution that uses these scenarios as a basis for investments in oil and gas is getting seriously bad information. It\u2019s shocking how far off the Paris agreement they are.\u201d\nIn a statement to the Guardian, the IEA said any suggestion its sustainable development scenario was unaligned with the Paris goals was incorrect because it envisaged a peaking of emissions before 2020, followed by a sharp decline. It said its new policies scenario was intended only as a reference that showed current and announced policies are \u201cfar from enough to avoid severe impacts of climate change\u201d and will very quickly use up the global carbon budget. \nThe IEA noted it has also outlined a \u201cfaster transition scenario\u201d that illustrates how the Paris goals can be met using existing technologies. This will be updated in April.\nThe Paris-based IEA was established in 1974 in the wake of an oil crisis with the goal of ensuring \u201creliable, affordable and clean energy\u201d for its 30 members \u2013 states in the rich-nations club of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nMore recently, it has tried to widen its focus to renewables and to encourage participation by emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil, which are now associate members.\nOil Change International says, however, this key organisation remains closely wedded to the fossil fuel industry, pointing out that two of the authors of the most recent World Energy Outlook were on secondment \u2013 and receiving salaries \u2013 from Shell. It says the IEA also continues to put the interests of wealthy nations first because its forecast for 2040 suggests India would cut emissions by 46% while the European Union would trim by only 40% \u2013 in an apparent contradiction of the climate negotiation principle that rich nations should bear the bulk of the responsibility because they have contributed most of carbon dioxide now in the atmosphere.\nMuttitt said the IEA needed to catch up with changing priorities and to follow the example set by the World Bank, which in December announced it would cease upstream investment in oil and gas by 2019 in response to the threat posed by climate change.\nA spokesperson for the IEA said it was not beholden to any industry, that the two dozen authors \u2013 and several hundred reviewers \u2013 of the World Energy Outlook came from a wide range of fields and that the agency\u2019s work benefits from input from governments, NGOs and a wide range of industries, including renewable companies. It also noted the most recent ministerial meeting backed a modernisation strategy to turn the IEA into a \u201cglobal clean energy hub\u201d.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oil", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gas", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/energy-industry", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Highly critical study warns energy projections used by the organisation tasked with leading the charge towards renewables are so skewed towards oil and gas that it may break climate targets set in the Paris agreement", "date_published": {"$date": 1522921398000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1522925606000}, "authors": ["Jonathan Watts"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Fossil fuels", "Energy", "Renewable energy", "Oil", "Gas", "Energy industry", "Paris climate agreement", "Business", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Environment", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/05/iea-accused-of-undermining-global-shift-from-fossil-fuels", "og:description": "Highly critical study warns energy projections used by the organisation tasked with leading the charge towards renewables are so skewed towards oil and gas that it may break climate targets set in the Paris agreement", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb5f5a37611f077544f9dbfc9bb57bcedd7108f6/0_0_5103_3061/master/5103.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=f7344fbfcd6e0b4f5293b21105eb1869", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "IEA accused of undermining global shift from fossil fuels"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb5f5a37611f077544f9dbfc9bb57bcedd7108f6/0_0_5103_3061/master/5103.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fa570bc182d5f9cd11dfe1351f3f095a", "width": "5103", "height": "3061", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb5f5a37611f077544f9dbfc9bb57bcedd7108f6/0_0_5103_3061/master/5103.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d74bad0dd3fb7ff342a5612575b8d87f", "description": "Gas fires at an oil refinery glows in Saudi Arabia.

While 85\u201390% of Democrats are worried about global warming, realize humans are causing it, and are aware that most scientists agree on this, independents and Republicans are a different story. Only 35% of Republicans and 62% of independents realize humans are causing global warming (down from 40% and 70% last year, respectively), a similar number are worried about it, and only 42% of Republicans and 65% of independents are aware of the scientific consensus \u2013 also significantly down from last year\u2019s Gallup poll.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s polarizing stance on climate change is probably the main contributor to this decline in conservative acceptance of climate change realities. A recent study found evidence that \u201cAmericans may have formed their attitudes [on climate change] by using party elite cues\u201d delivered via the media. In particular, the study found that Fox News \u201cis consistently more partisan than other [news] outlets\u201d and has incorporated politicians into the majority of its climate segments.\nNevertheless, public awareness about climate change realities has improved over the long-term. For example, about two-thirds of Americans now realize that most scientists agree global warming is occurring, up from less than half in 1997.\nThere\u2019s also a strong correlation between awareness of the expert consensus, that humans are causing global warming, and concern about the issue. This suggests that when people are aware that experts agree, they accept the consensus and realize we need to address the problem. This is consistent with research finding that the expert consensus is a \u2018gateway belief\u2019 leading to public support for climate action.\nJohn Cook and Stephan Lewandowsky, who previously published The Debunking Handbook, teamed up with Sander van der Linden and Edward Maibach to write The Consensus Handbook. It\u2019s a concise and definitive summary of everything related to the expert climate consensus, including how we know 90\u2013100% of climate scientists agree on human-caused global warming, efforts to manufacture doubt about the consensus, its role as a gateway belief, its neutralizing effect on political ideology, and how to inoculate people against misinformation.\nThose last points are particularly important in light of the Gallup survey data. There\u2019s an intense battle over public opinion on climate change, with cues from political elites having a polarizing effect that\u2019s largely offset when people become aware of the expert consensus. \nThus, there\u2019s been a concerted campaign to misinform people about the consensus. That was a key issue that major oil companies accepted in a recent court case, while their fossil fuel-funded supporters denied the consensus in briefs submitted to the court. Meanwhile, the Trump EPA is distributing misleading statements about scientific uncertainty on climate change, helping create this tribal identity that \u2018Team Conservative\u2019 denies the realities and dangers associated with human-caused global warming.\nHowever, as the Consensus Handbook discusses, research has shown that inoculating people against misinformation can largely offset its influence.\nThe bad news is that misinformation can totally offset the influence of facts on topics like the expert consensus on human-caused global warming. The good news is that people don\u2019t like being fooled, so when they\u2019re additionally informed about the tactics used to trick them with misinformation, they\u2019re more likely to accept the facts. \nThe challenge is that politicians on Fox News and other media outlets are able to reach a wide audience with their polarizing messages about climate change. Reaching a similarly sized audience not only with facts but also inoculation against the misinformation is a daunting task. However, as John Cook notes,\nPeople always ask me \u201chow do you convince conservatives\u201d or \u201chow do you convince Trump voters\u201d and I answer, \u201cthe question isn\u2019t how to convince conservatives, it\u2019s who should we be targeting - our audience is the large, undecided majority\u201d\nOne key point from the Gallup polling data is that consistently over the past 20 years, less than 10% of Americans have believed that most scientists don\u2019t think global warming is happening. The vast majority of Americans are either aware or unaware of the expert consensus, but few have it backwards. Data from Yale and George Mason universities tells a similar story \u2013 only about 10% of Americans think less than 50% of climate scientists agree on global warming. While Americans badly underestimate the expert consensus \u2013 just 13% are aware there\u2019s over 90% expert agreement, and the average American thinks the consensus is just 67% \u2013 despite growing polarization, few believe that most scientists reject global warming.\nMost Americans are simply unaware about and thus underestimate the expert climate consensus.

Similar phenological mismatches have been observed in other ecological relationships, such as great tit chicks no longer hatching soon enough to coincide with peak supplies of their crucial caterpillar food. They could potentially imperil the reproductive success of many species, including the pollination of plants and crops.\nStudying 356 years of central England temperature records, as well as specimens of early spider orchids and Andrena nigroaenea from herbariums and museums from Victorian times, researchers from the University of Sussex, the University of East Anglia, Kew and the University of Kent were able to calculate when warm spring conditions caused the female bees to emerge earlier than the orchid.\nTheir study, published in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, found that the orchid\u2019s trick was always a delicate balancing act \u2013 even between 1659 and 1710, the peak flying date for the female bee preceded the orchid\u2019s peak flowering in 40% of the years \u2013 but it has become even more inefficient.\nMean spring temperature increased from 7.68C to 8.64C over the 356-year study period, and between 1961 and 2014 the female bee\u2019s emergence preceded the orchid\u2019s peak flowering in 80% of the years.\nThe researchers found the female bee beat the orchid flower in 26 of the 28 years to 2014. Although one pollinated early spider orchid can produce 10,000 tiny seeds, failure to flower before the female bee emerges makes pollination almost impossible, and each orchid is very short-lived.\nMichael Hutchings, lead author and emeritus professor of ecology at the University of Sussex, first noticed the changes in flowering times during 32 years studying the rare orchids on the South Downs. The orchid\u2019s range in Britain has drastically shrunk and Hutchings warned that it could become extinct in this country, with climate change also damaging populations of other less specialist plants and animals.\n\u201cFor years I\u2019ve been speaking at conferences and writing papers saying if we get the habitat management right everything is going to be fine but then the climate warming actually stops the plant producing the seeds,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEcologists have been saying for a long time that if phenologies are changed by changing climate this might disrupt important interactions in communities of species. This study provides the strongest evidence we have that something nasty is happening. There are probably lots of other undocumented cases where similar detrimental effects on species are occurring.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bees", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/insects", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/animals", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/endangeredspecies", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Researchers find that warmer temperatures are upsetting the seasonal relationship between the early spider orchid and pollinating bees", "date_published": {"$date": 1522928262000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1522962009000}, "authors": ["Patrick Barkham"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Plants", "Climate change", "Bees", "Insects", "Animals", "Wildlife", "Environment", "UK news", "Endangered species", "Animal behaviour", "Biology", "Science", "Conservation"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/05/climate-change-threatens-rare-british-orchid-that-tricks-bees-into-mating", "og:description": "Researchers find that warmer temperatures are upsetting the seasonal relationship between the early spider orchid and pollinating bees", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/859cd850fe1210bd6387bc169aff91ea057ac7e9/0_13_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=8dbdb5db5577c3b8e79faffaea86548e", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Climate change threatens rare British orchid that tricks bees into mating"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/859cd850fe1210bd6387bc169aff91ea057ac7e9/0_13_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ae15e9d5ba9c075dec3b68cb2eb5a9b9", "width": "3500", "height": "2100", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/859cd850fe1210bd6387bc169aff91ea057ac7e9/0_13_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=135c6e813d6aac3048486346463b6029", "description": "The early spider orchid (Ophrys sphegodes) tricks male bees into attempting intercourse, ensuring the plant\u2019s pollination.\nPhotograph: Hector Ruiz/Alamy Stock Photo"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba2a6b98a95a9f27c613a047cd4dcb546c115f61/0_337_5061_3037/master/5061.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2765f33ca6254346ffcb4dba0060f5a6", "width": "5061", "height": "3037", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba2a6b98a95a9f27c613a047cd4dcb546c115f61/0_337_5061_3037/master/5061.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b8e47e9ac3e7ac0ac1781f9c2d185406", "description": "A female\nAndrena nigroaenea emerging from her nest burrow.

The difference that matters between them is that the ice of the Arctic floats: if it melted nothing much would happen to aggregate sea levels. The ice of Antarctica, like that of Greenland, rests on land. If it all were to melt, as it has done in the far distant past, sea levels could rise by as much as 60 metres. That is most unlikely to happen. What is possible, though, is that the smaller portion of the continent, west Antarctica, which is divided from the\u00a0rest by a mountain range, could lose much of its ice. Even that would be catastrophic. A significant retreat in west Antarctica, as seems to be already under way, could\u00a0raise sea levels by between one and three metres by the end of this century. Children now alive will see that happen across their lifetimes. That is what is meant\u00a0by the urgency of global warming.\nThis week saw the publication of fresh research showing that the glaciers of west Antarctica are retreating faster than they were at the end of the last ice age, when water levels also rose significantly. The ice sheet is not one homogeneous mass, but a collection of glaciers all moving slowly but inexorably towards the sea. Their retreat is happening underwater, and invisibly, as the ocean erodes the foot of the glacier, known as the \u201cground line\u201d, where its contact with the sea floor ends. Beyond that point, long tongues of ice stick out into the ocean, providing the coastline that we can see and map. But the capacity of the ice sheet to lock up water depends on the position of the ground line. As that retreats, invisibly, the sea level rises and the whole of the ice sheet grows less stable, something which makes further sea rise still more likely.\nPrevious surveys have concentrated on a few of the glaciers that are an obvious danger but the research released this week analysed satellite data covering the whole of the coastline of west Antarctica to reach its worrying conclusions. The problem is worsened by the shape of the seabed on which the glaciers now rest. It does not slope towards the deep ocean, but inwards, forming a bowl of which the far side is the mountain range that divides the continent. That means that the process of erosion will\u00a0be working downhill as it moves inwards, with faster and less predictable results.\nThe present danger was discovered by measuring the thickness of the ice sheet from space and deducing from this the shape of the glacier beneath. This is much easier than knowing what to do. The contrast between the exquisite technological sophistication employed in the diagnosis of the problem and the lack of international coordination or political sophistication when it comes to solving it,\u00a0illustrates the crisis of technological civilisation. As a species we have shown enough cleverness to disrupt the world\u2019s climate, but may not have enough\u00a0to remedy the damage that we\u2019ve done. Things are of course made very much worse by the presence in the White House of an aggressively ignorant and anti-science administration.\nPredicting the future of these changes isn\u2019t an exact science, which is one of the things which makes them so frightening, but neither is it entirely guesswork. Ignorance about the size of the threatened rise in sea levels is no excuse for inaction. We know it\u2019s coming. We know it will be disruptive. We don\u2019t know if it will be catastrophic. But the possibility must spur us into drastic action on fossil fuels.

The pond has been greatly affected by human activity. Everything from forest fires in the 19th century, to wood-cutting operations, the use of pesticides in the 1960s and increasing tourism have affected the water quality, according to the paper. Over half of the phosphorus in the lake in the summer \u201cmay now be attributable to urine released by swimmers\u201d, while a footpath to Thoreau\u2019s cabin \u201ccaused large amounts of soil to wash into the lake\u201d.\n\u201cIn the century and a half since Thoreau and his transcendentalist colleagues wrote of humanity as somehow separate from nature, we\u2019ve become a force of nature in our own right, powerful enough to change the chemistry and temperature of the atmosphere and the ecology of lakes and ponds worldwide,\u201d Curt Stager, a natural sciences professor at Paul Smith\u2019s college, New York, and one of the authors of the paper told CNET.\nStager and his fellow researchers analysed sediment from the pond to determine how the growth of algae has changed. Their research revealed that the major changes in the lake\u2019s algae happened in the 20th century. The closure of a nearby landfill site, the stabilisation of the shoreline and the upgrading of septic facilities have mitigated the effects of humans on the lake since 2000, but the researchers warn that the pond has not returned to the state described by Thoreau.\nWriting in the mid-19th century, Thoreau referred to the \u201ccrystalline purity\u201d of the pond, to its \u201cremarkable transparency\u201d and its \u201cpure and well-like character\u201d. \u201cSuccessive nations perchance have drank at, admired and fathomed it, and passed away, and still its water is green and pellucid as ever,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPerhaps on that spring morning when Adam and Eve were driven out of Eden Walden Pond was already in existence, and even then breaking up in a gentle spring rain accompanied with mist and a southerly wind, and covered with myriads of ducks and geese, which had not heard of the fall, when still such pure lakes sufficed them \u2026 It is a gem of the first water which Concord wears in her coronet.\u201d\nThe researchers warn that the lake would likely be further affected by climate change. \u201cThe sediment darkening and high percentages of [algae] in the recent sediments of Walden Pond \u2026 indicate not only that the lake ecosystem is now quite different from that described by Thoreau but also that it may be primed for more severe reductions in water clarity in a warming future.\u201d\nIncreasing temperatures in coming decades, for instance, could also increase recreational use of the lake in summer, add researchers, who suggest that a nearby swimming pool would \u201crelieve pressure on the lake\u201d.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not careful, this beautiful, iconic lake \u2026 could easily become more like a murky, green stew of algae,\u201d Stager told CNET.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/massachusetts", "https://www.theguardian.com/books/scienceandnature", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/water", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Immortalised for its beauty by Henry David Thoreau, the Massachusetts pond is under threat from increased human activity and climate change according to a new study", "date_published": {"$date": 1523017071000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1523017090000}, "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "article_section": "Books", "article_tags": ["Henry David Thoreau", "Books", "Culture", "Environment", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Science", "Massachusetts", "US news", "Science and nature books", "Water"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/06/pee-and-pesticides-henry-david-thoreau-walden-pond-in-trouble-warn-scientists", "og:description": "Immortalised for its beauty by Henry David Thoreau, the Massachusetts pond is under threat from increased human activity and climate change according to a new study", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b8916e64840ac372ef5aaa10146a61895b3cb12/0_344_5117_3071/master/5117.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=a94d6e65de10c822fb2a83e243c5c687", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Pee and pesticides: Thoreau's Walden Pond in trouble, warn scientists"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b8916e64840ac372ef5aaa10146a61895b3cb12/0_344_5117_3071/master/5117.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ba30c1f851bcdc78178cf55184796eae", "width": "5117", "height": "3071", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b8916e64840ac372ef5aaa10146a61895b3cb12/0_344_5117_3071/master/5117.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7c335b0eacf857a8c30a05940c36a903", "description": "\u2018A gem of the first water which Concord wears in her coronet\u2019 ...

Sometimes it seems a bit easy to focus on such a famous spot, but it is famous and therefore draws attention and of course the reason that it became famous makes it a relevant spot to explore environmental changes. \nNear where I grew up, on a drive we often took, was an island of beautiful forest set aside as state wayside. I remember this spot throughout my life and I was happy to introduce my son to this small, special spot that was largely unknown beyond the local area (very much unlike Walden Pond).\nBy the last time I visited the Douglas-firs were large second-growth trees and the big leaf maples formed a lush sub-canopy. Pacific dogwoods added unique flavor, as did the northern most California black oak I have ever found, and the cedars, in moist spots, added their swooping and drooping textural beauty to this lush green oasis surrounded by level farm field and defined by the road on the south. \nI could not put a price on how much this seemingly insignificant corner of land meant to me, and I know to others, and yet there was certainly a price that could be applied to the trees. I unfortunately do not mean in terms of soil health and retention, water quality and availability and also not in terms of carbon being held out of the atmosphere in lovely wood and soft, rich, warm smelling humus, and I don't mean in terms of providing crucial elements for diverse and complex living systems and lively communities. This is a global economy and the prices for timber, and fiber in general, is high.\nThe state parks system is hugely underfunded due to the \"tax revolts\" of the well healed.  Some years back there was a partial logging cut, but it was not too intense in the trees taken and the broader environmental impact. \nNow I have just come to find out that the land, or at least the timber, was sold to a logging company and the entire forest was cut. The pictures I saw were of a landscape I did recognize. I know in my logical mind that this is the same geographical spot that I visited so many times, but it is in no way the same place.

Now, with average temperatures rising, experts believe it could prosper here once again.\nTwo studies in northern France, which has a similar climate to southern England, have found that it would be easy to provide for the black-veined white\u2019s needs by creating flowery field margins and allowing the growth of young scrub such as hawthorn and blackthorn.\nFabrizia Ratto, from the University of Southampton, who conducted one of the studies for the charity Butterfly Conservation, said: \u201cOur study found that the butterfly has a strong preference for small isolated bushes of blackthorn and hawthorn as egg-laying sites with abundant nectar sources such as red clover nearby.\n\u201cThese habitat conditions can be recreated relatively easily in the UK through the implementation of agri-environmental measures such as nectar flower mixes in crop margins and by allowing some scrub regeneration beside adjacent hedgerows.\u201d\nThe results of the studies are revealed at Butterfly Conservation\u2019s international symposium in Southampton this weekend.\nIt is believed that Churchill became fascinated by the spectacular butterflies he encountered while serving as an officer in India. Unfortunately for him, his ambitious attempts to bring back the black-veined white were partly scuppered by his gardener, who accidentally hacked the nests of the young caterpillars from the hawthorn bushes where they had carefully been placed and burned them.\nChurchill had no better luck with his attempts to bring the swallowtail back to Kent. Despite enlisting the services of the leading butterfly breeder of the day, L Hugh Newman, he could not persuade it to breed in the wild, and was again not helped by gardeners who burned the fennel which the caterpillars fed upon.\nChurchill might have had more success today. While the British subspecies of the swallowtail is confined to the Broads of Norfolk and Suffolk, in recent summers climate warming has encouraged the continental subspecies of the swallowtail to cross the Channel, and several individual butterflies have bred successfully on carrot and fennel plants in gardens and allotments in Sussex.\nMaverick attempts such as Churchill\u2019s to reintroduce rare or extinct butterflies are frowned upon by conservation groups because they risk disrupting the scientific monitoring of species or introducing pathogens, but there is an increasing number of officially approved schemes to bring back scarce species. This summer the chequered skipper, which became extinct in England in 1977, is being returned to the forest of Rockingham in Northamptonshire via specimens from Belgium.\nOf the possibility of bringing back the black-veined white, Prof Tom Brereton of Butterfly Conservation, who supervised the research, said: \u201cWe have so few butterflies in the UK, the return of one of Europe\u2019s most spectacular species would be a major boost for everyone who loves butterflies. Creating habitat conditions for this butterfly would benefit pollinating insects and other valuable species, many of which are threatened by the impacts of climate change.\u201d\nWhile average temperatures look good for the black-veined white, experts say more research may be needed to determine whether the butterfly could survive the increasing frequency of extreme weather events that is a feature of our changing climate.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/insects", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/animals", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife", "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/winston-churchill", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Former PM unsuccessfully tried to reintroduce black-veined white in 1940s, but conditions may now allow species to prosper", "date_published": {"$date": 1523079052000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1523079052000}, "authors": ["Patrick Barkham"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Butterflies", "Environment", "Insects", "Animals", "Wildlife", "World news", "Winston Churchill", "UK news", "Climate change"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/07/warming-climate-could-see-butterfly-loved-by-churchill-return-to-uk", "og:description": "Former PM unsuccessfully tried to reintroduce black-veined white in 1940s, but conditions may now allow species to prosper", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79da5ca29169b655b538a25086e271327d93dec7/0_101_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=4e0a273ca670c180dbadbd7e71870df9", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Warming climate could see butterfly loved by Churchill return to UK"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79da5ca29169b655b538a25086e271327d93dec7/0_101_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=667cfcd53d04b711aed9e651d8152df3", "width": "4288", "height": "2573", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79da5ca29169b655b538a25086e271327d93dec7/0_101_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=679221411566c80820828b3ca21502b3", "description": "Black-veined white butterfly (Aporia crataegi) feeding on nectar from flower in meadow.\nPhotograph: Clement Philippe/Alamy"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c396d7fb4b470fa43dc0ad3161b8f52e77472cb/0_47_2048_1230/master/2048.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3a77b859b6c799971cf073dd482507ba", "width": "2048", "height": "1230", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c396d7fb4b470fa43dc0ad3161b8f52e77472cb/0_47_2048_1230/master/2048.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=639c3ab241375d55aa2c871b9005d175", "description": "The black-veined white could thrive in Britain\u2019s modern climate, say experts.

While manufacturers have for years been seeking ways to reduce this or capture the carbon produced, and to make cement production more energy efficient, the results have failed to keep pace with the need to cut carbon emissions.\nThe Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), which tracks greenhouse gas emissions from leading industries, found in a report published on Monday that Indian companies were performing best on reducing their carbon footprint, partly because they benefit from newer and more efficient manufacturing plants.\nIn Europe, emissions from cement production were supposed to be reduced under the EU\u2019s emissions trading scheme, which has operated since 2005, under which heavy industries are awarded allowances for the carbon they produce, and if they need to emit more must buy spare permits from cleaner companies. But the price of permits repeatedly collapsed owing to over-allocation of allowances and the scheme does not operate to reduce emissions as much as intended.\nCement production, according to the CDP, accounts for 6% of global carbon emissions, making it the second biggest source of carbon emissions from global industry, after steel. Its wider effects are even more problematic, as the built environment accounts for more than a third of the world\u2019s carbon emissions. The report found that leading cement companies would need to double their efforts to reduce emissions, in order to meet the Paris climate goals.\nPaul Simpson, chief executive of CDP, said companies must seek new technologies to overcome the problem: \u201cCement is a heavy and largely invisible emitter, yet taken for granted as a necessary building block of basic civilisation. Cement companies need to invest and innovate in order to avoid impending risks to their operations and the wider world. There is a solution \u2013 cement companies just need to invest properly in finding it.\u201d\nHe said companies would come under pressure from investors, customers and government regulations, and that delaying changes to their practices would cost companies more in the long term.\nThe report, entitled Building Pressure, analysed 13 of the world\u2019s biggest publicly listed cement companies, representing 16% of global cement production and with a a total market capitalisation of $150bn.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/business/construction", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Report warns carbon footprint of heavy emitter cement companies must be reduced sharply in order to meet Paris climate goals", "date_published": {"$date": 1523262694000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1523262745000}, "authors": ["Fiona Harvey"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Construction industry", "Business", "Climate change", "Environment", "World news", "UK news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/09/cement-industry-urged-to-reduce-invisible-global-emissions", "og:description": "Report warns carbon footprint of heavy emitter cement companies must be reduced sharply in order to meet Paris climate goals", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/184d9935602b8ccf84158711ae180f97c1871e2b/0_109_5160_3096/master/5160.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=10069cf99a124b1701635050f5532d88", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Cement industry urged to reduce 'invisible' global emissions"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/184d9935602b8ccf84158711ae180f97c1871e2b/0_109_5160_3096/master/5160.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b675d21c60db867a71424fab0c657a65", "width": "5160", "height": "3096", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/184d9935602b8ccf84158711ae180f97c1871e2b/0_109_5160_3096/master/5160.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2d28a64d7525833874f75533b43831ad", "description": "\u2018Cement is a heavy and largely invisible emitter, yet taken for granted as a necessary building block of basic civilisation.\u2019\nPhotograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc084dfa2c3613145ed9067"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/09/weatherwatch-overheating-cities-take-steps-to-cool-down", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "With summer still apparently a long way off, it seems premature to be worrying about heatwaves but they are becoming as great a threat to life as winter cold. Predictions are that, in summer, most European cities could become as much as 10C hotter by the end of this century, testing the old and very young who both have trouble regulating body temperature.\nCities across the world that are already too hot in the summer are taking a variety of measures from insisting new buildings have gardens on their roofs, painting existing roofs white, colouring roads light grey and planting trees in streets and open spaces. \nThe good news is that all these measures work, reducing land surface temperatures by 2C to 3C in the areas where they are applied. Another rather surprising finding is that solar panels, although black, also reduce the heat island effect by absorbing the sunlight (and turning it into electricity). \nEven in rural areas, the type of crops chosen by farmers has an influence \u2013 barley reflects 23% of sunlight back into space and sugar beet 26%.

Irresponsible and highly misleading to give the impression that there is a meaningful debate about the science. https://t.co/HtqJf9sBFW\nThe Today programme featured five interviews on climate change prompted by the release of the film An Inconvenient Sequel, the former US vice-president Al Gore\u2019s follow-up to 2006\u2019s An Inconvenient Truth. Each interview was conducted by the presenter Justin Webb.\nLawson, a former chancellor of the exchequer in Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government, made claims including that \u201call the experts say there hasn\u2019t been\u201d an increase in extreme weather events. He said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \u201cconcedes\u201d this, and that, according to official figures, \u201cduring this past 10 years \u2026 average world temperature has slightly declined\u201d. \nOfcom received two complaints that the interview broke the UK broadcasting rule 5.1, which states that \u201cnews, in whatever form, must be reported with due accuracy and presented with due impartiality\u201d.\n\u201cNeither statement was correct, or sufficiently challenged during the interview or subsequently during the programme,\u201d said the Ofcom ruling.\nThe BBC said it had publicly acknowledged that \u201csome of Lord Lawson\u2019s statements went beyond the intended scope of the interview and he was allowed to make inaccurate assertions which should have been challenged\u201d.\nOfcom was not impressed that a previous appearance on the Today programme in 2014 by Lawson, who founded the Global Warming Policy Foundation, resulted in an internal BBC investigation and ruling that found the same failure to properly challenge his views.\n\u201cWe found that statements made about the science of climate change were not challenged sufficiently during this interview, which meant the programme was not duly accurate,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Ofcom. \u201cWe\u2019ve told the BBC we are concerned that this was the second incident of this nature, and on the same programme.\u201d\nThe BBC attempted to minimise the fallout of Webb\u2019s failure to address the inaccurate comments at the time, by airing a follow-up item the next morning that \u201cexamined some of the more contentious claims made by Gore and Lord Lawson\u201d.\nThe BBC also published a news story online that \u201chighlighted criticisms of the interview with Lord Lawson and identified the inaccuracy of certain aspects of his contribution\u201d.\nOfcom said these actions saved the BBC from a second breach of the broadcasting rules. Rule 5.2 states that \u201csignificant mistakes in news should normally be acknowledged and corrected on air quickly \u2026 corrections should be appropriately scheduled\u201d. \nThe BBC also included contributions from several complainants and a statement from the Today programme in Radio 4\u2019s Feedback slot 10 days after the original interview.\nThe BBC decided against pitting Lawson against a scientist who could have challenged his views during the interview. The corporation said this was deliberate, because it had done so in 2014 and the tactic had backfired, legitimising Lawson \u201cby giving listeners the impression of parity between their views\u201d.\nThe decision not to have an expert on hand to challenge Lawson meant listeners were \u201cnot given the full facts\u201d about his stance on climate change, and meant Webb should have been prepared to step in and correct him, Ofcom said.\n\u201cThe editorial team could have reasonably anticipated there was a risk that Lord Lawson might raise these arguments,\u201d said Ofcom. \u201cThe BBC should have planned for that eventuality and the presenter should have been prepared to provide challenge and context to Lord Lawson\u2019s views as appropriate. \n\u201cThe BBC\u2019s failure to do this led to significant inaccuracies being broadcast.

EPA also threatened to revoke California\u2019s ability under the Clean Air Act to impose its own greenhouse gas standards. If they do so, California\u2019s attorney general will sue the EPA.\nThe Trump Administration\u2019s assault on clean car standards risks our ability to protect our children\u2019s health, tackle climate change, and save hardworking Americans money. We\u2019re ready to file suit if needed to protect these critical standards: https://t.co/AqwDR9Js18 https://t.co/qBalA25Z2l\nThis lawsuit would be tied up in court for years, and in the meantime California\u2019s more stringent standards would remain in place. Those standards have been adopted by 12 other states, which along with California account for one-third of new car sales in America. Weaker federal fuel efficiency standards wouldn\u2019t much help the US auto industry if they don\u2019t apply to one-third of domestic sales.\nThe Obama administration set the stricter fuel efficiency standards after the federal government was forced to bail out the auto industry. Struck by the 2008 global recession and a spike in fuel prices, US auto manufacturers, whose fleets were less fuel efficient than foreign competitors, were in dire financial straits. The auto industry thus accepted the federal bailout and didn\u2019t fight the higher fuel efficiency standards \u2013 until Donald Trump came into office. California also agreed to the new federal standards in 2008, and now wants to use its Clean Air Act authorization to keep them.\nThe auto industry has argued that low gasoline prices are the problem, but that\u2019s not a problem they want to solve. In fact, US automakers are in the process of repeating the same mistakes that led to the industry collapse a decade ago: \n\"GM will end production of the Chevrolet Sonic subcompact car... part of a broader push by Detroit auto executives to abandon low-margin cars in favor of sport-utility vehicles.\" https://t.co/rB4gL3baqi\nOther than Russia, no developed country has gasoline prices nearly as cheap as America\u2019s. Australia\u2019s are closest at 35% more expensive than American gasoline. Canada\u2019s are 46% more expensive, and European petrol is about twice the American price.\nAutomakers are complaining that they can\u2019t meet the stricter fuel efficiency standards because those low fuel prices are causing more Americans to buy gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs. The problem isn\u2019t technological \u2013 every major auto company offers a range of hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and/or fully electric vehicles, but these account for just 3% of new car sales in America today.\nIt\u2019s also important to note that American fuel prices are artificially low because they don\u2019t reflect the associated costs of climate change damages. This is known as the \u2018social cost of carbon\u2019 \u2013 the costs taxpayers incur to pay for the added damages from climate-intensified hurricanes, floods, droughts, heatwaves, and so on. Economists call these costs \u2018externalities\u2019 because they\u2019re not reflected in the market price of fossil fuels. Putting a price on this sort of pollution is \u2018Econ 101\u2019, and 95% of economists support either a carbon pollution price or standards like these fuel efficiency rules.\nThe solution could not be clearer, but it\u2019s not a solution most Americans want to hear \u2013 gasoline prices should be higher.\nAutomakers admit that consumer demand for gas guzzlers is the problem. Conservatives claim to be worried about the ballooning national debt (despite having passed a trillion-dollar tax cut). Environmentalists and scientists want to cut carbon pollution. Donald Trump claims to be worried about America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. The stricter standards would save $1.7 trillion on fuel by 2025; buying inefficient cars would cost Americans money.\nImplementing a carbon pollution tax could solve all of these problems. \nIn short, it\u2019s the sort of policy that everyone looking out for America\u2019s long-term best interests should support. Unfortunately, the key power players in this story don\u2019t.\nAutomakers don\u2019t lobby for a carbon tax because their most profitable models are inefficient trucks and SUVs. As an industry group spokesman told the LA Times,\nManufacturers need to sell vehicles that customers need and want today to fund the technological shifts and electrification and automation expected in the future\nThat\u2019s a charitable way of saying that automakers want to maximize their near-term profits by continuing to sell lots of gas guzzlers. So, they instead hired a group to submit a climate denial report to the EPA and asked Administrator Scott Pruitt to negotiate a weaker, compromise standard with California. The New York Times reports that talks are quietly ongoing behind the scenes, but thus far Pruitt\u2019s comments have not been encouraging.\n In fact, the EPA Notice repealing the standard didn\u2019t even mention climate change or public health \u2013 the primary factors underpinning these fuel efficiency standards. Instead, Pruitt simply scrapped the federal standard and threatened to go nuclear by revoking California\u2019s ability to set its own standards, and California responded by threatening to take EPA to court. The automakers are not pleased.\nHonda exec rips Trump EPA plan to lower emission standards: \"We didn't ask for that\" https://t.co/gTdWh5QXMw pic.twitter.com/ZNDuSmcQ1j\nBut it\u2019s their own fault for relying on an EPA administrator who they know is a fossil fuel industry puppet and an ideologue, rather than advocating for a win-win carbon tax that would have hurt their short-term profits but given the industry long-term certainty and stability. Instead, they\u2019ll likely have to deal with the uncertainty of an ongoing court case and requirements to meet two different standards. As California Air Resources Board Chairman Mary Nichols said last year,\nI want to turn to the industry representatives who are here and say, \u2018what were you thinking when you threw yourselves on the mercy of the Trump administration to solve your problems?\u2019\nIn public statements, auto and oil companies support a carbon tax. General Motors, ExxonMobil, Shell, Total, and BP are even founding members of the Climate Leadership Council \u2013 a group led by Republican Party elder statesmen but also supported by Stephen Hawking, Steven Chu, and The Nature Conservancy, whose goal is to implement a revenue-neutral carbon tax. However, when similar legislation is actually introduced in Congress, the auto and oil industries refuse to throw their support behind it, and Republican lawmakers inevitably kill it.\nIn this case, the auto industry tried to bypass the problem while maintaining the short-term profits associated by selling polluting gas guzzlers. Instead they got burned \u2013 they\u2019ll still have to meet California\u2019s stricter standards despite the relatively low demand for economic vehicles due to artificially cheap fuel prices. And we\u2019ll continue to wait for enough Republican lawmakers to get on board with a win-win carbon tax.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/epa", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/electric-cars", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-tax", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ethical-living", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/travel-and-transport", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Dana Nuccitelli: Artificially low fuel prices are the root of the problem", "date_published": {"$date": 1523354425000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1523354484000}, "authors": ["Dana Nuccitelli"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "US Environmental Protection Agency", "Environment", "Electric", "hybrid and low-emission cars", "Carbon tax", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Ethical and green living", "Travel and transport", "General Motors", "Royal Dutch Shell", "ExxonMobil", "BP", "Republicans", "Donald Trump", "Petrol prices", "Automotive industry"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/10/epas-war-with-california-proves-america-needs-a-carbon-tax", "og:description": "Dana Nuccitelli: Artificially low fuel prices are the root of the problem", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca965057c094c23e1f6ce0817dd51030bf05146d/0_91_4231_2538/master/4231.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=375bf4a88a89dd7176e5f26ec4c4e32c", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "EPA\u2019s war with California proves America needs a carbon tax | Dana Nuccitelli"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca965057c094c23e1f6ce0817dd51030bf05146d/0_91_4231_2538/master/4231.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f014cdf6c5a1e0f25d1587bf834beeb6", "width": "4231", "height": "2538", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca965057c094c23e1f6ce0817dd51030bf05146d/0_91_4231_2538/master/4231.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=13e6092fdb02efedcf23dc04cba7da79", "description": "Several Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles at the General Motors Orion Assembly plant in Orion Township, Mich.

The (largely inadvertent?) escalation of energy prices there apparently made it appear sensible to build far more wind capacity than can be made reliable with existing infrastructure. Now a series of ridiculously expensive purchases of fashionable name-brand Tesla batteries is likely to follow, throwing further good money after bad. Even investment in geothermal energy (thanks Tim Flanders) would have been a far better approach.\nThe lifecycle costs of the cheapest lithium arrays now rivals that of lead acid, but still costs more than the average cost of generating electricity, even in South Australia. So this latest clever initiative is going to more than double electricity costs when correctly attributed (or when the cost is passed directly to consumers rather than say in the form of changing road rules in order to close the hole in the state budget by ripping off motorists - for example, how are you finding your new rules about roundabouts, folks?). At least for whatever proportion of the electricity supply that is made reliable by battery backup.\nThe east of the state shares with Victoria the great advantage of significant near-surface geothermal potential, as Tim Flanders has pointed out on a number of occasions. Like hydro, this has the capacity to be sufficiently flexible to complement the vagaries of the wind. Alternatively, geothermal could have been used as a primary energy supply with wind providing a more realistic 15-20% of the total electricity supply mix in the state.\nA sensible plan is a far more successful plan than simply making energy blindly more expensive, if your agenda is to decarbonise the electricity supply.\nMaking energy more expensive is damaging to economic growth and technological development.

While long-term falls in butterfly populations have been caused by habitat loss, scientists attribute the dramatic recent decline to climate change, pesticides such as neonicotinoids and nitrogen pollution.\nWhile it was hoped that a brighter spring in 2017 would see butterfly populations bounce back after the virtually butterfly-less late summer of 2016, many of Britain\u2019s 59 native species, both rare and common, suffered further falls. Grizzled skipper numbers have more than halved since the 1970s while the grayling\u2019s population has shrunk by 63% in the last decade. The large white \u2013 once so common it was a pest \u2013 fell by 19% in 2017.\nThere was some good news, with two species enjoying long-term increases once again experiencing good summers: the red admiral was up by 78% compared to 2016 and the comma rose by 91%. A warm spring and targeted conservation management for a rare butterfly, the pearl-bordered fritillary, also reaped dividends, with a 57% increase on 2016.\n\u201cButterflies are at a low ebb, and going from one bad year to another, not helped by the weather which is all over the place,\u201d said Prof Tom Brereton, head of monitoring at Butterfly Conservation. \u201cA lot of climate change research has focused on average increases in temperature, which should be beneficial to many butterflies but the variable and extreme weather that comes with climate change is having a negative effect and disrupting butterflies.\u201d\nIncreased nitrogen deposition \u2013 via agricultural fertilisers but also pollution from motor vehicles \u2013 is highly likely to be causing the disappearance of butterflies such as the grayling and grizzled skipper, according to Brereton.\nThe caterpillars of such species feed on plants which are easily swamped by more vigorous grasses, which thrive in high-nitrogen conditions.\n\u201cThe conservation management has not really changed on sites such as nature reserves but the vegetation has subtly changed \u2013 it\u2019s grassed over, or become taller and shadier,\u201d said Brereton. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that insects like the grayling, wall brown and grizzled skipper are struggling.\u201d\nBrereton led research which last year uncovered surprisingly high declines of butterflies in urban areas, where vehicle pollution has caused nitrogen levels to soar.\n\u201cThere does seem to be a correlation between butterflies that have a low nitrogen status and their declines in areas of high nitrogen deposition,\u201d said Brereton. \u201cThere is some evidence of this from the Netherlands but more research is needed.\u201d\nButterflies have been scientifically recorded since 1976 by thousands of volunteers for the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, a partnership between Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.\n1.2008\n2.1981\n3.2012\n4.2016\n5.2007\n6.1977\n7.2017\n8.2001\n9.2002\n10.1988", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/insects", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/animals", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/pesticides", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/farming", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Annual monitoring shows many native species suffered further falls, and two declining species had their worst seasons on record", "date_published": {"$date": 1523424600000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1523424600000}, "authors": ["Patrick Barkham"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Butterflies", "Insects", "Environment", "Animals", "Wildlife", "UK news", "Pesticides", "Climate change", "Farming"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/11/british-butterflies-suffered-seventh-worst-year-on-record-in-2017", "og:description": "Annual monitoring shows many native species suffered further falls, and two declining species had their worst seasons on record", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9b1b328fbe98f09544ebd0743b90f8b599b34b9/0_193_3740_2245/master/3740.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=e52582af1be2e1650a0abb6911fb5049", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "British butterflies suffered seventh worst year on record in 2017"}, "headline": "0", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9b1b328fbe98f09544ebd0743b90f8b599b34b9/0_193_3740_2245/master/3740.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dff8b41776a97fd2ad839072c2ddb7fb", "width": "3740", "height": "2245", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9b1b328fbe98f09544ebd0743b90f8b599b34b9/0_193_3740_2245/master/3740.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8003376358f961358a6330db14eb653d", "description": "Fewer grizzled skippers took to the skies than in any year since the scientific monitoring of butterflies began more than 40 years ago.\nPhotograph: Mick Rock/Alamy Stock Photo"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e01fab93e72c4477110c1d46e7491049e7b30ed3/519_762_4241_2545/master/4241.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e4416568a80f64b867dd3db787cfaad", "width": "4241", "height": "2545", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e01fab93e72c4477110c1d46e7491049e7b30ed3/519_762_4241_2545/master/4241.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6afeb3eaffa4acb57fc3df8f8801ac90", "description": "A grayling adult on sea holly, Norfolk.

The findings, based on multiple lines of scientific evidence, throw into question previous predictions that a catastrophic collapse of the Gulf Stream would take centuries to occur.\nSuch a collapse would see western Europe suffer far more extreme winters, sea levels rise fast on the eastern seaboard of the US and would disrupt vital tropical rains. The new research shows the current is now 15% weaker than around 400AD, an exceptionally large deviation, and that human-caused global warming is responsible for at least a significant part of the weakening.\nThe current, known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), carries warm water northwards towards the north pole. There it cools, becomes denser and sinks, and then flows back southwards. But global warming hampers the cooling of the water, while melting ice in the Arctic, particularly from Greenland, floods the area with less dense freshwater, weakening the Amoc current.\nScientists know that Amoc has slowed since 2004, when instruments were deployed at sea to measure it. But now two new studies have provided comprehensive ocean-based evidence that the weakening is unprecedented in at least 1,600 years, which is as far back as the new research stretches.\n\u201cAmoc is a really important part of the Earth\u2019s climate system and it has played an important part in abrupt climate change in the past,\u201d said Dr David Thornalley, from University College London who led one of the new studies. He said current climate models do not replicate the observed slowdown, suggesting that Amoc is less stable that thought.\nDuring the last ice age, some big changes in Amoc led to winter temperatures changing by 5-10C in as short a time as one to three years, with major consequences for the weather over the land masses bordering the Atlantic. \u201cThe [current] climate models don\u2019t predict [an Amoc shutdown] is going to happen in the future \u2013 the problem is how certain are we it is not going to happen? It is one of these tipping points that is relatively low probability, but high impact.\u201d\nThe study by Thornalley and colleagues, published in Nature, used cores of sediments from a key site off Cape Hatteras in North Carolina to examine Amoc over the last 1600 years. Larger grains of sediment reflect faster Amoc currents and vice versa.\nThey also used the shells of tiny marine creatures from sites across the Atlantic to measure a characteristic pattern of temperatures that indicate the strength of Amoc. When it weakens, a large area of ocean around Iceland cools, as less warm water is brought north, and the waters off the east coast of the US get warmer. \nThe second study, also published in Nature, also used the characteristic pattern of temperatures, but assessed this using thermometer data collected over the last 120 years or so.\nBoth studies found that Amoc today is about 15% weaker than 1,600 years ago, but there were also differences in their conclusions. The first study found significant Amoc weakening after the end of the little ice age in about 1850, the result of natural climate variability, with further weakening caused later by global warming. \nThe second study suggests most of the weakening came later, and can be squarely blamed on the burning of fossil fuels. Further research is now being undertaken to understand the reasons for the differences. \nHowever, it is already clear that human-caused climate change will continue to slow Amoc, with potentially severe consequences. \u201cIf we do not rapidly stop global warming, we must expect a further long-term slowdown of the Atlantic overturning,\u201d said Alexander Robinson, at the University of Madrid, and one of the team that conducted the second study. He warned: \u201cWe are only beginning to understand the consequences of this unprecedented process \u2013 but they might be disruptive.\u201d\nA 2004 disaster movie, The Day After Tomorrow, envisaged a rapid shutdown of Amoc and a devastating freeze. The basics of the science were portrayed correctly, said Thornalley: \u201cObviously it was exaggerated \u2013 the changes happened in a few days or weeks and were much more extreme. But it is true that in the past this weakening of Amoc happened very rapidly and caused big changes.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oceans", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/meteorology", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Warm current that has historically caused dramatic changes in climate is experiencing an unprecedented slowdown and may be less stable than thought - with potentially severe consequences", "date_published": {"$date": 1523466007000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1523486367000}, "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Oceans", "Environment", "Meteorology", "Science", "Fossil fuels", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/11/critical-gulf-stream-current-weakest-for-1600-years-research-finds", "og:description": "Warm current that has historically caused dramatic changes in climate is experiencing an unprecedented slowdown and may be less stable than thought - with potentially severe consequences", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/282662c08af2c852e4ab5ea7bf417577bdeea357/50_0_2795_1677/master/2795.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=13d890fffbc0c7db31eaa43c635eab5d", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Gulf Stream current at its weakest in 1,600 years, studies show"}, "headline": "0", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/282662c08af2c852e4ab5ea7bf417577bdeea357/50_0_2795_1677/master/2795.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e919e18e09eabbafad2a55f0d4cd028d", "width": "2795", "height": "1677", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/282662c08af2c852e4ab5ea7bf417577bdeea357/50_0_2795_1677/master/2795.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2f133a0181e52ceb38c560500b0eddf8", "description": "Scene from The Day After Tomorrow showing the Statue of Liberty covered in ice.

That information will then enable governments to force action, EDF hopes. Building and launching the satellite will cost tens of millions of dollars, but EDF says it has already raised most of the money.\nMethane is a potent greenhouse gas, 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in the short term, and is responsible for about a fifth of human-caused climate change. The oil and gas industry is to blame for about a third of anthropogenic methane emissions, from fracking and other exploration sites, and from leaky pipelines.\n\u201cCutting methane emissions from the global oil and gas industry is the single fastest thing we can do to help put the brakes on climate change right now,\u201d said Fred Krupp, EDF president. Only 3% of oil and gas companies currently report quantitative methane emissions, according to EDF. \u201cBy providing reliable, fully transparent data on a worldwide scale, MethaneSAT will help transform a serious climate threat into a crucial opportunity,\u201d he said.\nPlugging methane leaks is widely seen as a fast, cheap way to tackle climate change. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates half of the gas leaks could be stopped at zero cost, because the cost of doing so is offset by the value of the extra gas captured and then sold. But currently public information about the leaks is scarce and near-absent in regions where scrutiny is unwelcome. \n\u201cOur analysis has consistently emphasised that an effective response to the problem of methane emissions requires good data,\u201d said Fatih Birol, IEA executive director. \u201cThis announcement is a major step forward.\u201d\n\u201cTo help companies and countries cut these emissions faster, we need better data that will enable quick, cost effective action,\u201d said Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment. \u201cThe MethaneSAT project will help fill this gap, and make us that much smarter as we tackle this threat.\u201d\nEDF has hiredTom Ingersoll, an aerospace veteran and entrepreneur. \u201cAdvances in space technology have put satellite projects within reach of any organisation with the focus and the will,\u201d he said. EDF has also partnered with Harvard University and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory to plan the mission.\nPeter Platzer, chief executive of Spire Global, a satellite company that is not involved with the MethaneSAT project, told the New York Times: \u201cI think this is entirely feasible.\u201d\nSome existing government-run satellites do measure methane, but not at high enough resolution to identify specific sites clearly. MethaneSAT is intended to provide a new level of precision and to regularly monitor about 50 major oil and gas regions, accounting for more than 80% of global production. Cattle and other livestock are also big methane emitters as they digest their fodder and EDF says the new satellite will be able to measure emissions from feedlots.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gas", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/oilandgascompanies", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oil", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/energy-industry", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Multimillion dollar project will scan and make public methane leaks from oil and gas plants that are a major contributor to global warming", "date_published": {"$date": 1523546108000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1523546171000}, "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Gas", "Oil and gas companies", "Oil", "Business", "Energy", "Energy industry", "Environment", "Fossil fuels", "Satellites", "Science", "Space", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/12/new-satellite-to-spot-planet-warming-industrial-methane-leaks", "og:description": "Multimillion dollar project will scan and make public methane leaks from oil and gas plants that are a major contributor to global warming", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f09d95ce3941af66bf1c55a5b15a294bcb3ef3b/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=97761a5202f83e8e6554d4aef8bc05c3", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "New satellite to spot planet-warming industrial methane leaks"}, "headline": "N", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f09d95ce3941af66bf1c55a5b15a294bcb3ef3b/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a398e50f2c9d47dde7c1d50b19d9e76d", "width": "1800", "height": "1080", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f09d95ce3941af66bf1c55a5b15a294bcb3ef3b/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5228a0e5a4b7fa9985063457fb3f50d7", "description": "MethaneSAT will be built and launched by the Environmental Defense Fund and will operate as an \u2018eye in the sky\u2019 that will spot industrial methane leaks around the world.\nPhotograph: EDF"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc084eda2c3613145ed906e"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/13/mike-pompeo-disaster-climate-change-democrats", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "\u201cIgnorant, dangerous, and absolutely unbelievable.\u201d This is how Mike Pompeo, then the nominee for CIA director, described the idea that climate change threatens our nation\u2019s security in his 2017 Senate confirmation hearings. It\u2019s also how our generation and many to come will remember any senator who votes to confirm Pompeo as our next secretary of state.\nDonald Trump\u2019s decision to nominate Pompeo to replace the former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson signals loud and clear that he wants fossil fuel barons to continue running our government and state department. Infamous as the \u201ccongressman from Koch\u201d, Pompeo is the top all-time recipient of Koch Industries campaign contributions; he accepted nearly $1.5m from the fossil fuel companies between 2009 and 2017. \nIn exchange for these payments, he used his tenure in the House of Representatives to stymie progress on climate action, curry favors for big oil and gas, and regularly spread misinformation and lies about climate science to help pad the Koch brothers\u2019 pocketbooks. \nThere\u2019s no doubt that Pompeo, widely recognized as a militant climate denier and \u201cyes man\u201d to the president, will pick up where Tillerson left off in gutting the department\u2019s climate diplomacy programs and opening the fragile Arctic to drilling for oil and gas that humanity can\u2019t afford to burn.\nAnd though it seems unthinkable that any secretary of state could be worse for the planet than the former CEO of Exxon, Pompeo is even more extreme than Tillerson in his climate denialism and his opposition to the Paris climate agreement (from which Tillerson urged Trump not to withdraw). \nWhat\u2019s more, as warming global temperatures spawn extreme weather events, fuel mass migration, exacerbate humanitarian crises and undercut global stability, Pompeo\u2019s anti-Muslim and anti-woman stances, war-hawkishness, and abysmal record on human rights will further endanger billions of people who are hit first and hardest by climate impacts.\nWith only a few years left to avert catastrophic warming, every single vote to confirm Mr Pompeo is a vote to protect profits of big oil billionaires and destroy the lives and livelihoods of millions around the world. Yet, 66 senators voted to approve Pompeo for his current position as CIA director, including 15 Senate Democrats, the party whose members are most worried about climate change. This includes the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, centrists Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp, and supposed climate champion Sheldon Whitehouse. \nWhile Democratic lawmakers hit Pompeo hard on a range of foreign policy and human rights questions in Thursday\u2019s confirmation hearing, climate change was hardly mentioned, and so far, only a handful of senators have come out publicly against Pompeo\u2019s pending nomination.\nIf every Senate Democrat votes against Pompeo, we could stop him from helping Trump continue to put the interests of big oil executives over those of everyday Americans. We need a grassroots groundswell to make this happen.\nOver 20,000 young people and citizens across our country have written letters to six of these Democratic senators, which we, along with Climate Hawks Vote, delivered last week to their Capitol Hill offices. Bowing to grassroots pressure, Senators Tina Smith and Brian Schatz vowed to vote against Pompeo\u2019s confirmation at a Wednesday rally alongside Senator Bernie Sanders and activists from MoveOn, Win Without War, J Street, Indivisible, Sunrise and many other ally organizations. \nAhead of Pompeo\u2019s confirmation vote, young Sunrise leaders across the country are stepping up the pressure on their senators, imploring them to stand by their values and with our generation.\nOur efforts will continue long after Pompeo\u2019s nomination battle. To politicians claiming to care about our generation \u2013 blocking the Koch Brothers\u2019 most loyal lapdog is a bare minimum. Right now, we\u2019re building an army of young people to end the corrupting influence of fossil fuel executives on our politics, and elect leaders who stand up for the health and wellbeing of all people. \nIn schools, houses of worship, small towns, and big cities across the country, young people are mobilizing by the thousands to make climate action an urgent priority and unseat politicians who accept donations from fossil fuel executives.\nFrom big oil to the NRA, young people in this country are tired of the failed politics that have sold out our futures for short-term profits. An overwhelming 80% of millennials support moving to mostly clean and renewable energy by 2030, and we know that we can make the jump while creating millions of good jobs and a brighter tomorrow for all Americans in the process.

The greenhouse gas qualities of carbon dioxide have been known for over a century. In 1861, John Tyndal published laboratory results identifyin\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adg carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas that absorbed heat rays (longwave radiation)\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad.

The alert follows the revelation this week that the system is at its weakest ever recorded.\nPast collapses of the giant network have seen some of the most extreme impacts in climate history, with western Europe particularly vulnerable to a descent into freezing winters. A significantly weakened system is also likely to cause more severe storms in Europe, faster sea level rise on the east coast of the US and increasing drought in the Sahel in Africa. \nThe new research worries scientists because of the huge impact global warming has already had on the currents and the unpredictability of a future \u201ctipping point\u201d. \nThe currents that bring warm Atlantic water northwards towards the pole, where they cool, sink and return southwards, is the most significant control on northern hemisphere climate outside the atmosphere. But the system, formally called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), has weakened by 15% since 1950, thanks to melting Greenland ice and ocean warming making sea water less dense and more buoyant.\nThis represents a massive slowdown \u2013 equivalent to halting all the world\u2019s rivers three times over, or stopping the greatest river, the Amazon, 15 times. Such weakening has not been seen in at least the last 1,600 years, which is as far back as researchers have analysed so far. Furthermore, the new analyses show the weakening is accelerating.\n\u201cFrom the study of past climate, we know changes in the Amoc have been some of the most abrupt and impactful events in the history of climate,\u201d said Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and one of the world\u2019s leading oceanographers, who led some of the new research. During the last Ice Age, winter temperatures changed by up to 10C within three years in some places.\n\u201cWe are dealing with a system that in some aspects is highly non-linear, so fiddling with it is very dangerous, because you may well trigger some surprises,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish I knew where this critical tipping point is, but that is unfortunately just what we don\u2019t know. We should avoid disrupting the Amoc at all costs. It is one more reason why we should stop global warming as soon as possible.\u201d\nOceanographer Peter Spooner, at University College London, shares the concern: \u201cThe extent of the changes we have discovered comes as a surprise to many, including myself, and points to significant changes in the future.\u201d\nA collapse in the Amoc would mean far less heat reaching western Europe and plunge the region into very severe winters, the kind of scenario depicted in an extreme fashion in the movie The Day After Tomorrow. A widespread collapse of deep-sea ecosystems has also been seen in the past. \nBut as the Amoc weakens, it might actually increase summer heatwaves. That is because it takes time for the cooling of the northern waters to also cause cooling over the adjacent lands. However, the cooler waters affect the atmosphere in a way that helps warm air to flood into Europe from the south, a situation already seen in 2015.\nOther new research this week showed that Greenland\u2019s massive ice cap is melting at the fastest rate for at least 450 years. This influx will continue to weaken the Amoc into the future until human-caused climate change is halted, but scientists do not not know how fast the weakening will be or when it reaches the point of collapse.\n\u201cMany people have tried to check that with computer models,\u201d said Rahmstorf. \u201cBut they differ a lot because it depends on a very subtle balance of density \u2013 that is temperature and salinity distribution in the ocean. We are not able to model this with any confidence right now.\u201d\n\u201cWe are hoping to somehow make some headway, but I have been in this area for more than 20 years now and we still don\u2019t understand why the models differ so much in the sensitivity of the Amoc,\u201d he said. \nHowever, Rahmstorf said the international climate deal agreed in 2015 offers some hope if its ambition is increased and achieved: \u201cIf we can keep the temperature rise to well below 2C as agreed in the Paris agreement, I think we run a small risk of crossing this collapse tipping point.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/greenland", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "How close the world is to a catastrophic collapse of the giant ocean currents is unknown, making halting global warming more critical than ever, scientists say", "date_published": {"$date": 1523627381000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1523653216000}, "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Oceans", "Climate change", "Environment", "World news", "Greenland", "Europe", "Africa", "US news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/13/avoid-at-all-costs-gulf-streams-record-weakening-prompts-warnings-global-warming", "og:description": "How close the world is to a catastrophic collapse of the giant ocean currents is unknown, making halting global warming more critical than ever, scientists say", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc372588f1cd66a19e066695a232a0b2fa0fe78e/0_167_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=17ebc0ee67e455f29f59ba1da013c275", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Avoid Gulf stream disruption at all costs, scientists warn"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc372588f1cd66a19e066695a232a0b2fa0fe78e/0_167_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0e7290761b0ed4cbd158a77ecbfb16e2", "width": "2500", "height": "1500", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc372588f1cd66a19e066695a232a0b2fa0fe78e/0_167_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=80e0632f1d4513dbc7ebd47d2beb7014", "description": "Other research this week showed that Greenland\u2019s massive ice cap is melting at the fastest rate for at least 450 years.\nPhotograph: Nick Cobbing/Greenpeace"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc084f8a2c3613145ed9071"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/13/carbon-dioxide-from-ships-at-sea-to-be-regulated-for-first-time", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Carbon dioxide from ships at sea will be regulated for the first time following a historic agreement reached after two weeks of detailed talks in London.\nShipping companies will halve their greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 under the plan, brokered by the International Maritime Organization and binding across its 170 member states.\nThe agreement will require a revolution among ships, which are overwhelmingly fuelled by heavy oils at present. In future, they will have to not only be more energy-efficient, but also make use of cleaner energy, in the form of batteries supplying electricity, solar and wind electricity generation, and perhaps even a return to sail in some cases, or more controversially to nuclear power, as some warships already use.\nEnvironmental campaigners said the plan was not enough given the urgency of tackling climate change, though they welcomed the deal, which has taken decades of work. Greenhouse gas emissions from shipping and aviation were omitted from the 1997 Kyoto protocol and have been excluded from regulations on carbon ever since, even though shipping is used for 80% of global trade.\nAlthough shipping accounts for only about 2% of global carbon emissions, it has been a cause of particular concern, both because of the increased need for transport under the globalising economy and because many ships use dirty, carbon-rich fuels such as heavy diesel, which would be banned in many countries from onshore transport.\nCampaigners said cuts of at least 70% from shipping emissions by 2050, compared with the 2008 baseline chosen by the IMO, would be needed to meet the aims of the landmark 2015 Paris agreement, under which countries have agreed that temperature rises should be limited to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels.\nJohn Maggs, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition and senior policy adviser at the campaigning group Seas at Risk, said: \u201cWe have an important agreement and this level of ambition will ultimately require a sector-wide shift to new fuels and propulsion technologies. But what happens next is crucial. The IMO must move swiftly to introduce measures that will cut emissions deeply and quickly in the short term \u2013 without these, the goals of the Paris agreement will remain out of reach.\u201d\nSveinung Oftedal, chair of the negotiations at the IMO for the Norwegian government, compared the achievement to the space race, saying: \u201cLike Apollo 11 returning to Earth, we knew we needed to land and we did.\u201d\nCountries holding out against a stronger agreement included Brazil, Panama, Saudi Arabia and the US, according to Bill Hemmings, shipping director at Transport &amp; Environment, an NGO.

This spring, they are not expecting to harvest their open-field crop until the last week of April \u2013 a week later than the official start of the season, St George\u2019s Day, 23 April. Welcome to just one of the consequences of Britain\u2019s disastrously delayed spring.\n\u201cWe have had a very challenging time,\u201d said Guy Smith, vice president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU). \u201cMarch breezed in with the \u2018beast from the east\u2019 and went out with the worst bank holiday on record.\u201d For asparagus-lovers there is at least an upside. \u201cThe combination has to be right for the crowns to push through,\u201d explained Per Hogberg, of grower Wealmoor. \u201cThe air temperature has to be at least 12C, while the soil temperature should be between 8C and 10C. With warmer weather expected, consumers can expect a bumper crop in mid-May,\u201d he said.\nIt is not just asparagus growers praying for a warm, dry spell. The earlier farmers can sow, the more chance their crops have to achieve their potential. \u201cMy father was a farmer and one of his sayings was \u2018a peck of dust in March was worth a king\u2019s ransom\u2019,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf the ground is nice and friable and makes a good seed-bed then it can be potentially quite lucrative for the farmer. Well, that\u2019s gone this year.\u201d\nFarmers griping about the weather goes with the job. But Smith fears something is happening to Britain\u2019s weather that has consequences which stretch far beyond farming.\n\u201cWe farm in north-east Essex, in the driest spot in the British Isles, and so we\u2019re keen observers of the British weather. More often now we seem to be stuck in long periods of wet months and then long periods of dry months, which is more challenging for farmers.\u201d\nAdam Lockwood grows spring onions in the Vale of Evesham in Worcestershire. \u201cAt the minute we\u2019re struggling to get going,\u201d he said. \u201cPotato growers haven\u2019t even started planting yet and drilling dates are well behind where they should be.\n\u201cWe\u2019re lucky in one sense that what we\u2019re doing is all seed. I can buy seed and put it in a shed and it doesn\u2019t matter, but lettuce and brassica growers who have plants raised in a nursery that were ready weeks ago, they\u2019re now having to throw those away.\u201d\nLike Smith, Lockwood thinks that the climate is changing. \u201cWe\u2019re getting more rain in a shorter period rather than evenly distributed across the year \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019m noticing. And you\u2019re getting more intense dry periods. It\u2019s more extreme.\u201d\nLivestock and dairy producers have been particularly hard hit. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very late spring, even for a hill farm where we are,\u201d said Richard Findlay, chair of the NFU\u2019s livestock board, who farms in the North York Moors National Park.\n\u201cInstead of keeping the sheep in a couple of days after they\u2019ve had lambs, we\u2019re keeping them in for two or three weeks. We\u2019re very fortunate in that we have the buildings to do it, but a lot of neighbours who don\u2019t are struggling and have had many more losses.\n\u201cWe have nearly 1,000 sheep and it\u2019s costing us about \u00a31,000 extra a week at the moment to feed and house them to avoid a lot of losses. If we turned them out in poor weather there would be very little grass to eat.\u201d\nFindlay believes that it will be farmers who end up absorbing the extra costs, rather than consumers. But this puts them at the mercy of the markets, and poor prices for their lambs later in the year could see some producers call it a day. \u201cIt\u2019s been the worst and most challenging time that I can remember,\u201d Findlay said. \u201cIt really started last summer, which was very wet and quite cool, and the autumn and winter have generally been very wet. Sheep can stand cold weather and they can stand wet weather but when there is a prolonged period of both, it really pulls them down. We would normally expect to lose 1% of the ewe flock in this winter period and we\u2019ve probably lost 3% to 4%, despite our best efforts.\u201d\nWhat the farmers are experiencing first-hand accords with what scientists are finding. Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at NCAS-Climate, University of Reading, who helps run www.WeatherRescue.org \u2013 a site where volunteers digitise millions of historical weather observations \u2013 says that UK temperatures have risen by around 1.5 degrees in the last 150 years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s basic physics: warmer air can hold more moisture so, as the atmosphere warms, it means, when it does rain heavily, we get more rain than we would otherwise have done from the same storm 100 years ago.\u201d\nIn the short term, farmers like Smith hope that the coming week\u2019s warmer, drier conditions are going to stretch through April. In the longer term, he believes that the first three months of 2018 should sound alarm bells.\n\u201cWe need to remember that it\u2019s reckless to take food production for granted,\u201d he said.\nGrowers say their crops will not be ready until the end of the month, almost three weeks late.\nMany growers have yet to plant.\nSeeds which should have been sown back in February yet to go in.\nStocks have been kept indoors for weeks, meaning higher fodder prices and possible price rises for consumers.\nPlants due to go into the fields have had to be thrown away.\nSpring barley and spring wheat weeks behind sowing schedule.\n\u2022 The name of the North York Moors National Park was corrected on 19 April 2018.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/farming", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/food-science", "https://www.theguardian.com/food/vegetables", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "A combination of the beast from the east and a dismal bank holiday weekend has put the nation\u2019s crops on hold", "date_published": {"$date": 1523733964000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1534234008000}, "authors": ["Jamie Doward"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Farming", "Food science", "Vegetables", "UK news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/14/farmers-crops-livestock-turmoil-beast-from-east-climate-change", "og:description": "A combination of the beast from the east and a dismal bank holiday weekend has put the nation\u2019s crops on hold", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d42e24f5e995eadee98adeb7aa50ec0ce822df33/35_340_6426_3858/master/6426.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=55436390913e7215a5e4f756c3aa25d4", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "British farmers in turmoil as delayed spring plays havoc with growing season"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d42e24f5e995eadee98adeb7aa50ec0ce822df33/35_340_6426_3858/master/6426.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=093803d3a9ee418e282853c15969a1b7", "width": "6426", "height": "3858", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d42e24f5e995eadee98adeb7aa50ec0ce822df33/35_340_6426_3858/master/6426.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8f55f5c837133161865013216b25170f", "description": "Ewes and lambs forage for grass under snow.

One\u00a0of the most pressing challenges facing smaller Commonwealth governments is the impact of climate\u00a0change, and the rising debt\u00a0burden we face as a result.\nThe 2017 hurricane season was one of the most devastating in Caribbean history. In Barbuda and Dominica destruction totalled more than twice annual GDP. The growing severity of hurricanes in the Caribbean is related to climate change, a major global threat primarily caused by countries far richer and larger than our own.\nIn the wake of increasingly frequent and devastating disasters, and in the absence of sufficient grants to support climate mitigation and adaption and sustainable development, small islands have no choice but to resort to taking on more debt. Yet many already have large debts as a result of past disasters and injustices, loss of trade preferences, and exclusion from debt relief schemes, while our small size makes us more vulnerable to economic shocks such as global financial crises.\nAs climate change gets worse, we urgently need a new system for fast and effective debt relief when disasters hit. We should not have to bear these extra costs ourselves through climate risk insurance. We call on larger Commonwealth countries, including the UK, to play a leading role in the creation of such a system. Those who have contributed the most to climate change are the real debtors and it is, therefore, unfair that small island developing states, which are most vulnerable, like those in the Caribbean, be indebted as a result.\nWe look forward to this meeting resulting in a bold decision to address the issues raised above, in\u00a0the best interests of all.Keith Mitchell Prime minister of Grenada Gaston Browne Prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda \n\u2022 Heads of government from the 53 nations of the Commonwealth arrive in London on Monday for their biennial meeting. The official meeting website says that they will \u201cagree how to \u2026 create a better future for all our citizens\u201d. But this commitment rings hollow to the millions of LGBT+ people who live in the 37 Commonwealth countries where homosexuality is illegal. For every one of these countries with an anti-gay law, lives are on the line: a lesbian in Sri Lanka who can\u2019t go to the police when she\u2019s attacked; a gay man in Nigeria behind bars just for being who he is; the activists who organise Pride Uganda denied the right to peaceful freedom of assembly and arrested and beaten by police.\nMany Commonwealth leaders shamelessly scapegoat LGBT+ people for domestic political advantage. They often exploit the false narrative that homosexuality is a \u201cwestern import\u201d and argue that for this reason it must be eradicated. With the UK hosting this year\u2019s meeting, we want to put the record straight. It is not homosexuality that is a western import, but homophobia. Most of the laws used to criminalise and persecute innocent LGBT+ citizens across these Commonwealth countries are British exports. This is colonial-era legislation, often unamended, that has been retained since Commonwealth countries became independent. The UK must accept that these laws are one more damning indictment of Britain\u2019s colonial past. All Out and other Commonwealth organisations have come together to demand action. Through our petition we are calling on the UK to use this week\u2019s meeting in London to acknowledge that most homophobic laws across the Commonwealth came from Britain, and to apologise to the millions of LGBT+ citizens of these countries who still suffer under these laws. An apology will clear the legacy of the past and expose the direct responsibility of today\u2019s Commonwealth leaders for the human rights violations they commit against LGBT+ people in their countries.\nThere is no plan to discuss LGBT+ rights at this week\u2019s meeting. But if the leaders gathering in London and Windsor want the Commonwealth to be recognised as a credible 21st-century global body, they must include an open and frank discussion of anti-LGBT law decriminalisation on their agenda.

It notes that some stakeholders have raised concerns about the quality of international units.\nThe paper says the commonwealth \u201cis continuing to consider whether retailers should be able to use external offsets\u201d.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s position is that if offsets were eligible, it should be in a manner that provides the greatest investment certainty, is technology neutral, helps address small compliance shortfalls and reduces market imbalances.\u201d\nThe government is, however, clear that more ambitious emissions reduction activities undertaken by state and territory governments through their renewable energy schemes will not ultimately boost the federal target. Several jurisdictions have expressed concern about the Neg on the basis of the low-ball 26% cut.\nThe paper says: \u201cWhere states and territories pursued their own renewable energy targets, such as to achieve investment or employment policy objectives, this would not change the target under the guarantee.\u201d\nThe discussion paper also makes it clear the government hasn\u2019t yet resolved how to treat EITE activities.\nThe paper indicates the government is inclined to exempt EITE activities from the emissions requirement under the Neg, as it did under the renewable energy target, but the mechanism for doing it is not yet resolved.\nThe government has been warned by electricity generators that if retailers are able to remove EITE customers\u2019 load from their emissions obligation, then it could unbalance the Neg. The discussion paper says the government will \u201ccarefully consider the issues raised by stakeholders in the design process\u201d.\nThe chair of the Energy Security Board, Kerry Schott, has written to all ministers urging them to come to the table on Friday. \u201cProviding long-term policy confidence and stability is critical to lowering investment risk in the national energy market and bringing down electricity prices,\u201d her letter says.\n Schott says the Neg will encourage investment in a least-cost portfolio of energy technologies and demand response that is both dispatchable and low-emitting.\n She says the policy is technology-neutral and insists it is not a new trading scheme. \n\u201cThe guarantee will use existing mechanisms for the purchase of electricity by market participants,\u201d she says. \u201cElectricity companies already buy electricity from each other to meet their requirements.\u201d\nThe coming week is critical for the fate of the Neg because any single jurisdiction has the power to break the concept. Changes to the national electricity market rules require consensus between the commonwealth and the states.\nWhile the federal energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, is confident he can get his colleagues over the line, Labor governments in the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and Queensland are yet to signal public support.\nFederal Labor is also yet to signal bipartisan support, and is highly unlikely to sign up if it doesn\u2019t have flexibility to increase the ambition of emissions reduction in the scheme.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/energy-industry", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/business-australia", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "description": "Tony Abbott argues offsets are carbon trading but government says it could include them in energy guarantee", "date_published": {"$date": 1523848050000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1523981390000}, "authors": ["Katharine Murphy"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Energy", "Australia news", "Energy", "Australian politics", "Environment", "Paris climate agreement", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Energy industry", "Business (Australia)"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/16/coalition-considers-letting-power-companies-buy-offsets-to-cut-emissions", "og:description": "Tony Abbott argues offsets are carbon trading but government says it could include them in energy guarantee", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfae871cbea9b5f9353c0a7188d0c9706c60c495/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=f276b4c53ef5464748f0d0bb18c6f366", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Coalition considers letting power companies buy offsets to cut emissions"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfae871cbea9b5f9353c0a7188d0c9706c60c495/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ac31de54b733a6ab0d53638c828046aa", "width": "5184", "height": "3110", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfae871cbea9b5f9353c0a7188d0c9706c60c495/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e9e75470741eeb52451a42eb4bc672a", "description": "The emissions reduction target for electricity in the proposed national energy guarantee will be a 25% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030.\nPhotograph: David Crosling/AAP"}}], "comments": [{"id": "114770087", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1523872645000}, "author": "ThisLittleBlackDuck", "author_id": "12893351", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Oh, Dawkins, give me strength!\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/16/turnbull-to-discuss-syria-strikes-with-theresa-may-on-europe-trip", "recommendation_count": "2", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "114770002", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1523872558000}, "author": "RhondaMay", "author_id": "12229833", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "That's spot on ...", "recommendation_count": "4", "in_reply_to": "114767322", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "114769342", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1523871813000}, "author": "OK1950werehome", "author_id": "15142860", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "So as we speak every state and territory has about 5 environmental policy experts and lawyers pouring over a \"vibe\" document.

If they are reduced significantly, this could release pressure on the volcanoes that lie below and lead to eruptions that could further destabilise the ice sheets and enhance sea level rises that are already affecting our oceans.\nNote that current the level of volcanic activity beneath the west Antarctic Ice Sheet is only producing a small amount of heat compared to the much larger amount of heat coming from the now much warmer Southern Ocean where glaciers are grounded at often considerable depth below sea level.

Several studies now point to the fact that on current policies, Australia will reach around 40 per cent renewables by 2040. The NEG seeks to cap this at 36 per cent by locking in an emissions target that is less than business as usual.\n*It is based around the assumption that the electricity industry\u2019s emissions reduction target for 2030 should be 26 per cent. Yet new analysis has shown that emissions will fall by 29 per cent if there are no policy changes. So the NEG seeks to be worse than doing nothing.\n*It will lift prices rather than reduce them. For all the modelling that has been done on theoretically pass through mechanisms, there is one simple observation made by everyone \u2013 all the way from the ACCC, the networks, the small and medium-sized retailers and others: this design could kill competition. And that means higher prices. Full stop.\n*It is too complex. By trying to be something for everyone, particularly to the incumbents, and in trying to pretend that this won\u2019t be some sort of carbon price, the designers have produced a plan of such complexity to be effectively unworkable.\n*The reliability guarantee makes no sense. The ESB haven\u2019t even gotten around to spelling out the meaning of reliability, what technology will count towards it, and what won\u2019t. Nor has it said how this can be managed.\n*It doesn\u2019t actually address the problem. Frydenberg and Turnbull argue that the NEG is essential to delivering reliability.

Nuclear will never happen here, well not until Thorium is made viable or fusion reactors come online {the better option in my opinion}, if that ever happens, and probably by the time that happens, we won't need it.

Exxon is under investigation by state attorneys general, cities are suing oil companies over sea level rise costs, and Our Children\u2019s Trust is suing the federal government for failing to protect their generation from climate change. At the heart of these legal challenges lies the question \u2013 who bears culpability for climate change and liability for its costs and consequences?\nExxon has been a prime target of these investigations and lawsuits since Inside Climate News\u2019 investigative journalism revealed that the company\u2019s internal climate science research warned of the dangers posed by human-caused global warming since the late 1970s.\nRecently, Dutch journalist Jelmer Mommers of De Correspondent unearthed internal documents from Shell that began warning of the dangers associated with human-caused climate change 30 years ago. The company\u2019s 1988 report titled \u201cThe Greenhouse Effect\u201d warned,\nby the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation.\nAnd, particularly relevant to Our Children\u2019s Trust\u2019s lawsuits, Shell\u2019s 1988 report warned of the climate consequences for future generations.\nSimilarly, in a 1991 film called Climate of Concern, Shell warned,\nGlobal warming is not yet certain, but many think that to wait for final proof would be irresponsible. Action now is seen as the only safe insurance.\nThe case against Exxon and Shell is similar to the case against the tobacco companies \u2013 that they engaged in fraud to deceive the American public about the health effects of their products. However, the oil companies modified the tobacco playbook. Rather than directly misinform the public, they funneled money to conservative think tanks who did the dirty work as Merchants of Doubt. By both outsourcing the misinformation campaign and allowing their scientists to publish research in peer-reviewed journals \u2013 where it was available to but largely unseen by the public \u2013 the oil companies tried to buffer themselves against the legal liability that took down the tobacco industry.\nThe case against the fossil fuel industry largely relies on proving that these companies deceived the American public about the threats posed by consuming their products. The case against the federal government appears more straightforward. In their defense against the cities suing over sea level rise damages, the oil industry lawyers essentially argued that the blame lies not on the producers, but rather the consumers of fossil fuels, and that any economic issues should be addressed through policy rather than in the court system.\nBut of course, the American government has failed to implement climate policies over the past two decades. In 1998, the Senate refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. The Bush Administration censored government climate science reports and took no action to address climate change. Thanks to a Republican filibuster threat, a carbon cap and trade bill that had passed the House died in the Senate in 2009. The Obama administration finally took concrete steps to address climate change, for example by drafting the Clean Power Plan and signing the Paris climate accords, but the Trump administration has (at least temporarily) reversed all of those efforts.\nIn short, Our Children\u2019s Trust is correct to allege that the American government has failed to protect the coming generations from the threats and damages of climate change.\nThe oil companies do make a valid point that consumers share the blame for causing climate change. The public has been aware of the climate threat for over a decade \u2013 the subject was popularized in An Inconvenient Truth in 2006. Yet 12 years later, Americans are still buying gas guzzling trucks and SUVs, while hybrid and electric vehicles account for just 3% of new car sales. \nWhile the electrical grid has become cleaner due to the falling costs of wind, solar, and natural gas displacing coal power plants, Americans haven\u2019t done much to demand or spark that sort of change in other energy sectors. That would take climate policy, which most Americans (including Trump voters) support, but their support is shallow. It\u2019s not an issue that decides votes, so policymakers aren\u2019t pressured to take action.\nThe fossil fuel industry certainly bears some responsibility for having funneled tens of millions of dollars to climate-denying think tanks that have worked hard to misinform the American public. Republican Party politicians and conservative media outlets have followed their lead in helping to convey that climate misinformation. A recent study found evidence that \u201cAmericans may have formed their attitudes [on climate change] by using party elite cues\u201d delivered via the media. The history books will not reflect well on today\u2019s American conservatives.\nHowever, when hybrid cars have been mass produced for over 20 years and yet 97% of new cars sold in America are still powered exclusively by inefficient, polluting, 19th Century internal combustion engine technology, Americans as a whole are also failing to do their part to curb climate change. \nThere\u2019s plenty of blame to go around for the mounting climate costs, but so far, taxpayers are footing the whole bill. There may eventually be a court case in which the fossil fuel industry, like the tobacco industry before it, is held responsible for its role in deceiving the American public about the dangers of carbon pollution. And American voters will eventually punish the Republican Party for its decades of climate denial and policy obstruction.

Bumble Bees and Honey Bees are not native to Australia but are important as feral and domesticated species in the pollination of crops and the production of honey. Domesticated honey bee hives are placed in fields, orchards and native forests and woodlands to produce a wide variety of different honeys. I particularly like the eucalypt honeys from Western Australia but recurrent drought and unseasonal rains have made them a rare commodity in the east. The main native pollinators of eucalypts and Melaleucas are flying foxes, honeyeaters and lorikeets.\nThere are native bees which build hives in tree hollows and rock crevices. They have the added advantage of being stingless but don't produce large quantities of honey. Their honey also contains large amounts of pollen which can present allergy concerns but adds to the taste. Their cones are made of resin rather than wax.https://www.aussiebee.com.au/beesinyourarea.html\nOur honey bees are free of many of the hive pests found in other countries such as Vorrea mites. Sentinel hives were installed around the Port of Brisbane after a Vorrea infected hive was found on imported mining equipment.\nI used to work in the salt marsh and mangroves around the Port controlling disease carrying mosquitoes using bacteria. Sometimes that involved advising local politicians. By talking to those who know what they're talking about did those politicians become the elite. I would be bloody stupid if politician didn't seek out the advice of those who know what they're talking about, but in the extreme right wing sections of the Liberal National Party, when it comes to climate change, that's exactly whats happening.\nBut then the Iron Barks are flowering - good honey.\nAll the best in the land of (some of) my great grandparents.", "recommendation_count": "4", "in_reply_to": "115017253", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "115022284", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1524479051000}, "author": "PHE1", "author_id": "2595146", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nAs stated, every single one is false.\nBQEND\nJust give one example not dependent on opnion.\nBQSTART\nA one degree change in global temperature over such a short time is unprecedented.\nBQEND\nI'd like to see you provide proof of that, without relying on studies that confuse data resolution between instramental data and proxy data.\nBQSTART\nScience does not do proof,\nBQEND\nEt ce n'est pas un pipe!

That is not professional scientific scrutiny.\nMy own experience is with one of those many national scientific bodies that claim to suport the CAGW case - of which I have been a fellow for many years. The 'position statement' was put together by a committee. We members were given no opportunity to provide comment or feedback. The statement did little more than support the IPCC position. There was no evidence of scrutiny by representatives of the organisation.\nThe 'catastrophic' component of CAGW is fundamental. As for most CAGW sceptics, I don't doubt climate change or global warming, or that humans make a contribution. Eg. we have created the urban heat island effect, and our removal of forests certainly impacts on local climate. The only way we can stop human influence on climate is to commit mass suicide.

Yes experts give their opinions but courts are not obliged to choose between experts' opinions. Judges will direct juries that in the British courts we do not have trial by expert and that the jurors must reach a decision taking account of all the evidence. Experts' opinions may or may not help them. I have heard contradictory opinions given by eminent medical experts in serious non-criminal cases. I recall a very senior judge saying that if the experts disagreed, he himself was in no position to decide whose opinion was the better.\nAs far as climate change is concerned, I think 'CAGW' is an unhelpful term, meaning the catastrophic bit. It allows people to say 'How big will this catastrophe be?' and then try to use the absence of a clear answer to undermine the case for AGW. I think the IPCC reports, as I gather second hand from apparently knowlegeable posters here and elsewhere, build in considerable uncertainty. Isn't this kind of uncertainty the very essence of solid science? As other posters suggest, 'proven' is not the right word. But no I don't agree with you either about gravity or AGW. They are both certain beyond reasonable doubt, although that term refers to the standard of proof in a criminal trial and seems inappropriate. I refer you to the paradigm concept, as Rocky Rex and others have often set it out here. We are in a period of normal, certain science in which details are being fleshed out, but main processes are not in any doubt at all. I don't agree that climate science has not applied scepticism to itself. Science IS scepticism, and AGW has been subjected to a phenomenal amount of scrutiny. Yes there are posters here who express themselves in florid language. That does not have much to do with sober science however. The consilience, coherence and consensus mean the science is indeed settled as some put it. We are not 'testing' anything by continuing to burn fossil fuel, we are inviting positively dangerous outcomes. The fact we don't know exactly how muuch and exactly when is a different point.

I learned a lot about the English Law process, and that the only witnesses in court entitled to give an opinion in place of just reporting fact, are expert witnesses. It is a very specific role. Quite often, expert witnesses (scientists and others) will give differing opinions. It is then up to the court to judge which is more plausible. This means the court must take on some judgement on scientific matters, however unqualified they may be. \nOn climate change: The reality is there remains a significant amount of uncertainty. The strongest parts of the case are based on opinion rather than scientific deduction. For example, its an opinion (albeit of experts) that 'more than half of global warming over the past 50 years is manmade'. If you doubt my view, I suggest you carefully read the IPCC reports to understand the evidence that supports that statement. However, many CAGW believers are claiming the uncertainties are much smaller than they are. I believe that in court, the scale of these uncertainties will come out. Of course, defenders of CAGW will try hard to avoid discussing the uncertainties.

Many of us drive cars - most of us use them. We pretty much all use electricity.

Our concrete is made from limestone from which CO2 has been removed by heat. Robin Batterham continues to tell me that we have removed huge quantities of CO2 from our soils by a process of supposedly reversible degradation. Since people started shaping their environment, we have removed immense quantities of trees from the land, and turned them mostly into CO2.\nIt is difficult to see how the oil companies, or the coal companies, or the cement producers, can be held responsible for meeting our needs. And it appears extremely dubious that they have been in any way successful in somehow forcing us to not take up new alternatives where these are available.

Each has a different viewpoint or particular emphasis. It's not that you can't write whatever you want under a thread I start or a comment I make. But it's your insistence that I must reply to what you write that makes no sense. And usually what you write is a complete misunderstanding of what I've even written, not that this stops you from imagining what I meant by the words I didn't write but you know I meant. \nLet me give you a recent example: Dana previously wrote a three sentence paragraph in which he premised a couple examples of where deniers weren\u2019t on the same page as the oil company\u2019s lawyers. He then concluded just the opposite implying that the deniers \u201cclearly\u201d ARE on the same page. Clearly? Based on what? His previous two sentences? Dana\u2019s conclusion simply did not follow from his premises. So I asked Dana for clarification. The difference between \u201care on the same page\u201d and \u201care NOT on the same page\u201d is significant. Did Dana inadvertently omit a negative?\nHere\u2019s what Dana wrote: While it\u2019s normal for climate deniers to deny the 97% expert consensus that humans are driving global warming, those submitting briefs on behalf of Big Oil were clearly not on the same page as its lawyer. Perhaps the oil companies should have sent the deniers a memo to stay out of this case. Clearly these groups are accustomed to denying climate science on the oil industry\u2019s behalf.\nHere\u2019s what I wrote: Dana was that a typo? Shouldn't your last sentence, taken in context, instead read: \u201cClearly these groups are NOT accustomed to denying climate science on the oil industry\u2019s behalf.\"\nNow here\u2019s what you wrote: Why would that be a 'typo'? Monckton and Soon, for example, filed on behalf of the defence but were rejected. Surely they were attempting to defend fossil fuel use? Surely lost \"deniers\" are, in part, defending continued fossil fuel use, and therefore, the fossil fuel producers? No?\nYou see James, what you wrote had nothing to do with my question to Dana as to whether he omitted a negative. I\u2019m not saying your point is trivial or that your point holds no merit. It\u2019s just that the rejection of Monckton and Soon\u2019s filing has nothing to do with the linguistic structure of Dana\u2019s paragraph. Their defense of Big Oil has nothing to do with the linguistic structure of Dana\u2019s paragraph. The argument that deniers continue to defend fossil fuel producers has nothing to do with the linguistic structure of Dana\u2019s paragraph.\nI was asking Dana for clarification on how he worded his last sentence. Given its context and given that it just followed two examples where Dana argued that the deniers were NOT on the same page as the lawyers, it did not seem to make sense. But in your reply to me, rather than explain or defend how Dana\u2019s third sentence follows his previous two, you wanted to make the argument that deniers support big oil. Yah? So what? I wasn\u2019t saying that they didn\u2019t. And despite the merits of YOUR point, it had nothing to do with MY point. It wasn\u2019t until several exchanges later that I realized that you were seeing something implied in Dana\u2019s statement that I didn\u2019t see written. And that what you saw implied was something along the lines of: \u201cClearly these groups are accustomed to denying climate science on the oil industry\u2019s behalf, but in court they failed to present it in the way the company lawyers wished it presented.\u201d Well if THAT is what Dana meant to write, then why didn\u2019t he write it? The addition of those 17 implied words at least follow from Dana\u2019s two previous sentences. And if Dana had included them, then my question would never have been raised.\nSo James, absent you\u2019re knowing what dana really meant to write, can you not see what I was asking? Was I failing to make my question clear? Help me out here. If you found a grammatical or linguistic or syntactical error, or even the omission of 17 more implied words, how would you have pointed it out to Dana? Tell me how I should have worded my question to Dana so as not to leave you confused as to what I was asking? What should I have written differently?

That is equal to about 7% of its current operational emissions.\nHowever, it still has no target for its biggest contribution to global warming, which is the burning of its main products, oil and gas, unlike rivals such as Shell.\nTom Burke, the chairman of environmental thinktank E3G and a former BP adviser, said: \u201cWho cares about operational emissions? The problem is they have nothing to say on their product. This is a 20th century response to a 21st century problem.\u201d\nThe former UK government adviser characterised the plan as \u201clightweight PR\u201d and \u201cgreenwash\u201d. He said BP had \u201cwasted 20 years\u201d since the former chief executive John Browne tried to reinvent the firm as Beyond Petroleum in 2000.\nThe criticism was echoed by Carbon Tracker, a thinktank that has analysed the risk of big oil being left with stranded assets by action on climate change, a danger that the Bank of England has also warned of.\n\u201cImprovements in BP\u2019s operational emissions, while welcome, are too small to move the needle to prevent runaway climate change or reduce BP\u2019s exposure to carbon risk,\u201d Luke Sussams, the senior researcher at Carbon Tracker, said.\nBob Dudley, BP\u2019s chief executive since 2010, said the company had ventured into clean energy too early last time.\n\u201cSome of our investments worked out \u2013 others did not. We were early but I don\u2019t think we were wrong because we learned valuable lessons along the way,\u201d he said.\nDue to the $65bn bill the company faced in the aftermath of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, it was only recently that it had been able to afford to move more into greener energy, he said. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s only been the last year or so that financially can we go into it deeper,\u201d he said.\nHe said the company\u2019s low-carbon plan rests on cutting its own emissions, helping customers cut theirs and growing green energy businesses.\nLord Browne, who led BP between 1995 and 2007, said the strategy was a \u201cgreat reset for BP\u201d and because of Deepwater Horizon it was understandable that clean energy had not been a recent focus for the firm. \n\u201cThere\u2019s only so many things you can focus on at once at a company,\u201d he said.\nAs part of its emissions target, BP pledged to hold leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, to today\u2019s levels, even as it targets more \u201cleaky\u201d production, such as shale in the US.\nThe group spends about $500m (\u00a3351m) on biofuels, wind and solar power, about 3% of its annual $15bn-$16bn capital expenditure. Those low-carbon business units have the \u201cpotential to make a real contribution to our future,\u201d according to the strategy.\nThe company hinted that it plans to make further moves into electric vehicle infrastructure, such as rapid charging points.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/business/energy-industry", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/oil", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/commodities", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Environmentalists call strategy \u201820th century response to a 21st century problem\u2019", "date_published": {"$date": 1523884845000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1523981401000}, "authors": ["Adam Vaughan"], "article_section": "Business", "article_tags": ["BP", "Energy industry", "Business", "Energy", "Environment", "Oil", "Commodities", "Renewable energy", "Climate change", "Oil and gas companies", "UK news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/16/lightweight-pr-greenwash-bp-low-carbon-plan-dismissed-environmentalists", "og:description": "Environmentalists call strategy \u201820th century response to a 21st century problem\u2019", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b7fdff7b23fdf54c390c9a637c8fd6644b9e3c9/9_48_4208_2525/master/4208.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=bc5beebe75ccfe5214ba3e5c9646c04c", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "'Lightweight PR and greenwash' \u2013 BP's low-carbon plan dismissed"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b7fdff7b23fdf54c390c9a637c8fd6644b9e3c9/9_48_4208_2525/master/4208.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6129ef71bc9c57379ec75a5dd31454c0", "width": "4208", "height": "2525", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b7fdff7b23fdf54c390c9a637c8fd6644b9e3c9/9_48_4208_2525/master/4208.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ab9f41b3d36a92e414637fb848ab0f46", "description": "BP said it would achieve a saving of 3.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2025.\nPhotograph: Nick Ansell/PA"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc0850da2c3613145ed9077"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/17/to-lead-on-climate-countries-must-commit-to-zero-emissions", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "What does it mean for a nation to be a \u201cclimate leader\u201d in 2018?\nAt the very least, it must mean having a firm plan in place to deliver your nation\u2019s fair share of the Paris agreement. During that stunning fortnight in December 2015, 195 governments freely and willingly committed not only to keep global warming well below 2C, but to aim for the safer level of 1.5C. And they committed to bring net greenhouse gas emissions down to zero.\nI cannot help but feel huge pride that my government was the first in the western world to step up and deliver on the Paris agreement. In June last year, we adopted a target of cutting Sweden\u2019s net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2045, and we set it in law. Within a generation, Sweden will not be contributing to the problem of climate change. Science tells us that if all nations adopt this target, there is a good chance that we will live up to the commitments that we made at the Paris summit, and keep climate change within safe boundaries.\nOur law does not only set an emissions target and a date. Every year the government must present a progress report to parliament, and every four years it must make a new set of policies that deliver ever-greater emission cuts. This way we will ensure that we will make steady progress towards our net-zero target.\nFor these ingredients of our law, we owe the UK a debt of gratitude. Ten years ago, the UK brought in the first law in the world that set a legally binding target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Sweden borrowed heavily from the UK Climate Change Act in drawing up our own, as have other countries such as Denmark and Finland.\nClimate laws deliver something that in a healthy democracy is invaluable for businesses and citizens: certainty. Our companies know that fossil fuels will be virtually eliminated over the next 25 years; coal has already gone, and oil and gas will follow. Certainty helps citizens, companies, investors and the government itself to make better decisions. For example, it is clearly good sense that all new houses are built so as to waste very little energy, so eliminating the need for more expensive retro-fitting in a decade\u2019s time.\nA number of other countries have stepped up since the Paris summit by committing to net zero emissions targets by 2040 or 2050. They include France, Iceland and New Zealand \u2013 but also some developing nations such as Costa Rica and Bhutan. Driven by a progressive alliance including Sweden and the UK, the European Union is heading in the same direction. The EU parliament has already voted for a net zero target, and the commission is updating its energy and climate roadmap in line with the Paris agreement \u2013 a process which will inevitably recommend a net zero target for the EU with a target date no later than 2050.\nMore nations will inevitably follow later this year. In October the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will publish a landmark report which is expected to confirm that the world will need to be at net zero emissions by mid-century in order to deliver on the Paris agreement. Those countries where finance and modern technology are more available will naturally be expected to take the lead in getting there. The IPCC is an intergovernmental body \u2013 so at that point, it will clearly be untenable for any western government that does not have a net zero target with an appropriate date and a means of delivering it to claim to be a \u201cclimate leader\u201d.\nMeeting a net zero target will not be easy for all sectors of the economy. We know how to do it for electricity, heating and road transport; for others such as agriculture and aviation it will be more challenging. Here, we must trust to innovation, the speed of which continues to amaze. And we can accelerate changes in these sectors with specific financial instruments such as the aviation tax that Sweden introduced this month.\nCertainly it is not acceptable for any government or statutory adviser to say that net zero cannot be done. It has to be done \u2013 because as long as we continue emitting carbon dioxide, temperatures will continue to rise. Claiming that net zero is impossible would mean giving up on the imperative of halting climate change; accepting that we will never hold back the tide of rising sea levels, failing food supplies, species extinctions and an acidifying ocean. That is not a world that I can bequeath to my children and grandchildren; nor, I believe, can any responsible leader.\nTen years ago, the UK won the gratitude of many other nations, including my own, by adopting the Climate Change Act. But science and diplomacy move on; and when the IPCC and the Paris agreement are telling us that greenhouse gas emissions need to reach net zero by mid-century, it is incumbent on us all to reflect that in our national programmes. That, at the very least, is what it means in 2018 to be a \u201cclimate leader\u201d.\n\u2022 Isabella L\u00f6vin is deputy prime minister of Sweden, and minister for international development, cooperation and climate", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/sweden", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Isabella L\u00f6vin: The UK\u2019s climate laws forged a path for others to follow.

The government\u2019s statutory advisers would be expected to set out key choices on how this could be achieved. \nUnder the global Paris agreement, countries have committed to curbing temperature rises to \u201cwell below\u201d 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep them to 1.5C, to prevent dangerous climate change. \nSuch a move will require the world to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero in the second half of the century. The UK government pledged in 2016 to enshrine a zero target in law, but has not yet passed any legislation. \nAfter a global scientific review of the impacts of, and action needed to keep to, a 1.5C rise is published this autumn, the UK\u2019s climate advisers will be asked to review the country\u2019s 2050 target, Perry said in a speech on Tuesday. \nAfter the report, she said: \u201cWe will be seeking the advice of the UK\u2019s independent advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, on the implications of the Paris agreement for the UK\u2019s long-term emissions reduction targets.\u201d \nThe committee recently suggested the UK would have to meet the net-zero target by 2045-50 in order to do its bit to ensure global temperature rises do not exceed 1.5C.\nA temperature rise of 1.5C is seen by some countries, such as low lying islands at risk of rising sea levels, as the limit beyond which their very existence is threatened. \nLaurence Tubiana, a key architect of the Paris agreement and chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, said: \u201cFor a safe climate we need all governments to aim for cutting pollution to net zero levels by 2050. \n\u201cThis decision to review Britain\u2019s long-term climate target sends a strong message to the EU and other big economies that London is committed to the Paris agreement, and now it\u2019s time they too considered what more they can do.\u201d \nWays of meeting the net-zero target could include investing in projects to grow trees and restore soils, to take up greater carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as well as more controversial measures such as investing in emissions reduction projects overseas. Even with such methods, the UK is likely to have to bring forward targets on phasing out diesel and petrol engines, and expand renewable energy generation and, potentially, nuclear power.\nMany actions under Conservative-led governments since 2010, however, have dismayed climate campaigners and may have to be reconsidered. These include the failure to insulate the UK\u2019s draughty homes, limits on renewable energy, the scrapping of carbon capture and storage projects and tax breaks for fossil fuels.\nJohn Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said the review was extremely important and could provide a \u201cvaluable lead\u201d for other countries. \n\u201cThe data shows that the challenges posed by emissions from transport \u2013 land, sea and air \u2013 and our reliance on gas for heating will have to be confronted as a matter of urgency. \n\u201cFossil-fuel dependent cars and vans need to be removed from sale by 2030, a step-change in energy efficiency standards in our construction industry should be prioritised, and the government must accept that no new runway at Heathrow will fit inside our carbon budget,\u201d he added. \nThe government\u2019s announcement was welcomed by others at the Commonwealth summit, where climate change has been seen as one of the key issues under discussion. Nearly half of the Commonwealth nations are classed as \u201csmall island developing states\u201d, which are the most vulnerable to climate change.\nFrank Bainimarama, prime minister of Fiji, which currently holds the presidency of the UN\u2019s climate forum, told the meeting: \u201cI am encouraged by Britain\u2019s undertaking to review its climate targets with a view to increasing ambition. The [targets] we all promised to make in the Paris agreement should be setting high standards for the rest of the world to follow.

That has massive repercussions,\u201d said Toby Peters, a professor in power and cold economy, working at the university, who is also part of the Birmingham Energy Institute.\nThe institute will host the first ever conference on \u201cclean cold\u201d on Wednesday, exploring how to tackle the problem and boost the 0.2% of energy R&amp;D budgets spend on cooling.\nSir David King, the former government chief scientific adviser and top climate adviser to the Foreign Office, said cooling was critically important. \u201cIn terms of energy usage, this is a major issue,\u201d he told the Guardian.\nThe biggest energy demand for cooling comes from air conditioning to keep people comfortable, but it is also essential for stopping food from going to waste and protecting medicines.\nWhile air conditioning in UK homes is a rarity today, Peters said it was a question of when, not if, the technology became normal for householders.\n\u201cI think with temperature rises we will see more and more installations of air conditioning units,\u201d he said.\nGlobal sales of cooling equipment are expected to increase from $140bn (\u00a398bn) today to $260bn by 2050.\nThat growth presents not just a challenge but a chance for the UK to develop and export new technology.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just how many air con units will we have but what is the export opportunity,\u201d said Peters.\nThe UK has taken the lead on developing greener and more efficient cooling, as part of a clean energy research initiative by 22 countries announced at the Paris climate summit.\nIf the world\u2019s future appetite for cooling is provided by the current fossil fuel-heavy energy mix, carbon emissions will rise 2.5 gigatonnes by 2050. Global emissions from energy were 35 gigatonnes last year. \nTo meet the growth in cooling without pushing up emissions would take almost all the new solar power expected to be installed by mid-century, Peters calculated.\nHe said: \u201cYes, we need to look at more efficient cooling technologies and greening electricity, but when you see the size of the demand we have to be much more radical in our thinking and start to invest in [tackling] this.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Researchers predict energy use for air conditioners and refrigeration to jump 90% on 2017 levels", "date_published": {"$date": 1523973845000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1523998831000}, "authors": ["Adam Vaughan"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Energy", "UK news", "Environment", "Business", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/17/demand-for-cooling-predicted-to-outstrip-heating-as-earth-warms", "og:description": "Researchers predict energy use for air conditioners and refrigeration to jump 90% on 2017 levels", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a542e0acb1047d432c459206144fcb9f9dffc32a/0_53_3411_2047/master/3411.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=b5ba2195310f154cad965e79980d50e0", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Warming climate to nearly double demand for cooling appliances"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a542e0acb1047d432c459206144fcb9f9dffc32a/0_53_3411_2047/master/3411.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=95e55c2a16303a15713c9989460b2173", "width": "3411", "height": "2047", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a542e0acb1047d432c459206144fcb9f9dffc32a/0_53_3411_2047/master/3411.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=136427e97322eba64581caa67f492037", "description": "The biggest energy demand for cooling comes from air conditioning to keep people comfortable, but it is also essential for stopping food from going to waste and protecting medicines.\nPhotograph: Kin Cheung/AP"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc08511a2c3613145ed907a"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/18/commonwealth-global-climate-change-new-zealanders", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Leaders of Commonwealth nations are meeting in London this week instead of the South Pacific nation of Vanuatu because things did not go according to plan. In 2015, cyclone Pam roared across Vanuatu, knocking out power, crippling water systems and levelling homes, schools and churches.\nIn only 24 hours, the storm dashed the island nation\u2019s hopes of hosting the Commonwealth summit. Three years later, many communities have yet to fully recover, in a place where the impact of a changing climate is on full display.\nVanuatu is one of New Zealand\u2019s Pacific neighbours and friends \u2013 and its experience is an increasingly common one. In February, Tonga was hit by its worst cyclone in decades, cyclone Gita. When I visited the country in March, I spent time with schoolchildren who were learning in tents \u2013 the roof of their school had been blown off and the classroom walls destroyed by the storm.\nSuch extreme weather events are tragedies. They are also provocations. They tell us that climate change is not a theory, or a projection, but something that is already happening. They tell us we must be more ambitious when it comes to tackling this urgent global challenge.\nThe Commonwealth heads of government meeting is a good place to start. Twenty-eight years ago, the same meeting produced the Langkawi declaration on the environment, among the first collective statements to cite greenhouse gas emissions as one of the chief problems facing the world. I am confident that this year\u2019s gathering can be just as decisive by fostering bold commitments to step up climate action.\nAnd while the task ahead is immense, New Zealanders know it can be achieved because we have a proud history of leadership on challenges than can seem too hard to contemplate.\nWe were the first country in which women won the right to vote, we were at the forefront of the anti-nuclear movement, and we were at the table when the United Nations was born. And we are ready to lead on climate change, the defining challenge of our generation.\nThat is why my government has committed to setting an ambitious new target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. In June, we are starting a consultation process on how to enshrine this commitment in law.\nOur plan includes an expert Independent Climate Commission which will develop carbon budgets through to 2050 \u2013 setting a path to carbon neutrality that maintains enough energy to run our economy and country. Along the way, we are committed to helping regions and industries directly affected by the transition move away from fossil fuels, with billions of dollars of investment in local infrastructure and clean energy projects on the horizon.\nNew Zealand plans to achieve 100% renewable electricity generation by 2035\nWe are also active in building international cooperation on climate action.\nNearly half of New Zealand\u2019s emissions come from our world-renowned farming sector. This is why we lead the 49-nation Global Research Alliance that is developing techniques to reduce agricultural emissions without compromising food security. And that is why we are committed to helping other countries achieve more climate-friendly agricultural production, in ways that will increase farmers\u2019 yields and build resilience while reducing emissions.\nAlongside the UK, we belong to coalitions of forward-thinking countries and cities pressing to phase out coal generation, eliminate harmful subsidies that encourage wasteful fossil fuel use, and help our economies transition to carbon neutrality.\nThe international consensus on climate change in Paris in 2015 was a historic achievement. Now we all need to do our part by delivering on what we signed up to.\nThis means setting ambitious and concrete goals, like New Zealand\u2019s plan to achieve 100% renewable electricity generation by 2035. And it means agreeing on the finer details around holding countries accountable for reaching their Paris targets.\nLeadership on climate change cannot be left to the big economies. It demands broad and deep action. New Zealand contributes less than 1% of global emissions. Yet together the world\u2019s small emitters account for about a quarter of global emissions. History calls on us to play our part.\nAt this week\u2019s Commonwealth meeting, I\u2019ll be thinking about Vanuatu\u2019s experience \u2013 and the summit that couldn\u2019t happen. I\u2019ll also be guided by a M\u0101ori saying from my country \u2013 M\u014d t\u0101tou, \u0101, m\u014d k\u0101 uri, \u0101 muri ake nei \u2013 for us and for our children after us.\nThat is what\u2019s at stake when we talk about climate change \u2013 the world we\u2019ll leave for the generations that follow us. They are why we need to act now, with purpose and courage.\n\u2022 Jacinda Ardern is the prime minister of New Zealand", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/commonwealth-of-nations", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/asia-pacific", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/natural-disasters", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The task ahead is immense, but New Zealanders know it can be achieved.

I wouldn't regard myself as left-wing by any means. Nor would I say I am an anti-capitalist. However, rampant capitalism is, to some extent to blame. It may be a necessary 'evil' in order for the planet and its nations to function, but we are producing more and more livestock clearly at a cost to the environment when, for example, alternative diets are available. Moreover we are transporting livestock (dead and alive) and other products further and further, again at a cost to the climate when, in fact, it would be perfectly possible to produce sufficient lower emission foodstuffs to feed our own nations if governments accepted the challenge and encouraged investment in the means to do so. Incentives to 'grow your own' would be a start. You only have to sit and watch the huge container ships coming into ports like Southampton and Felixstowe and the polluting effect of these, to wonder if there is another way. Unfortunately Brexit may well mean an increase in long-distance freight coming into Britain. \nWe also have to get freight off the roads and back on to the railways. Living in Kent I witness the fact daily of huge numbers of HGVs on our motorways, especially from cross-channel trade, while the carriage of freight through the channel tunnel in railfreight wagons is still relatively small. Switzerland actively encourages freight on to railways and most large manufacturing and distribution businesses are built close to, or by, railway lines so that factory to distribution centre traffic is largely rail-based. The Swiss are, by and large, conservative (with a small c), yet they have recognised the need for planning their infrastructure to reduce emissions. Meanwhile in Britain, rail electrification programmes have been scaled back in recent years as too costly and most businesses who used to have rail sidings have long since tarmacked over them. \nIt seems to me that governments have to intervene more and, to some extent, a mixed economy of command and capitalism is necessary. We have to accept perhaps that we will need to contribute by paying higher taxes in order for governments to be able to invest heavily in the technologies and infrastructure needed to reduce emissions.

Researchers hope that such infusions will reverse some of the devastation the salt water has caused as it has killed off animal and plant life.\nClint Willson, the LSU professor who heads the Center for River Studies, said researchers would be able to study \u201cthe flows and the water stages of the water levels in the Mississippi river\u201d. \n\u201cWe can also model or simulate the transport or the movement of the Mississippi river sand down the river, and we can do all that in roughly one hour to replicate one year on the river.\u201d\nSeawater encroachment has not just damaged wetlands \u2013 in many places it has erased them completely.

One prediction (a pretty obvious one) is that a warmer world will have less snow and ice. In particular, areas that have year-round ice and snow will start to melt. \nAlpine glaciers are large bodies of ice that can be formed high in mountains, typically in bowls called cirques. The ice slowly flows downwards, pulled by gravity, and is renewed in their upper regions. A sort of balance can occur where the loss of ice by melting or flowing at the bottom is equal to the gain of snow and ice by precipitation.\nAs the Earth warms, the melt line moves upwards so that the glacier melts faster and faster at the bottom, shortening the glacier and reducing its mass. Ultimately, the melted water flows into streams and rivers and ends up in the oceans, contributing to accelerating sea level rise.\nWhile glaciers are interesting from an intellectual standpoint, they are also important to ecosystems and society. For example, the rate of glacier melt affects downstream water levels, river flowrates, and the water available for human use. So, it would be really important for us to be able to predict what will happen with glaciers in the future and plan for how water availability will change. \nOf the groups that track glaciers, my favorite is the World Glacier Monitoring Service, which publishes a survey of the mass changes from selected glaciers around the world, available here and summarized below. The graph shows changes to the mass of the glaciers that are monitored, measured in millimeters of equivalent water.\nBut this doesn\u2019t tell the whole story because there is very little information about glacier health in the high latitudes (Northern Alaska, Canada, Northern Europe, Northern Russia, etc.). Very few temperature records exist in high elevations in these regions. Furthermore, the temperatures do not extend back very far in time. So, it is challenging for scientists to develop a long-term perspective on glacier health in these areas.\nAnd this is why a new study attracted my attention. A paper was just published by the American Geophysical Union that shared research carried out by Dominic Winski and his colleagues. \nThis team of researchers extracted ice cores from the glaciers on Mt. Hunter, in Alaska. The ice cores held snow and ice from as far back as 400 years. The researchers showed that the amount of water melt currently is 60 times greater than it was prior to 1850. They also found that the summertime temperature changes on Mt. Hunter are almost 2\u00b0C per century (about 3.5\u00b0F). To put this in perspective, the temperatures are rising about twice as fast as global temperatures.\nThe fact that temperatures on these northern mountains is rising faster than the globe as a whole is something predicted by climate models. The reason it warms so fast in these locations is that as the warming starts, snow begins to melt, exposing dark soil, which absorbs more sunlight, leading to more warming. We call this a feedback loop. There are other feedbacks at play, including changes to vertical temperatures in the air, changes to clouds, and changes to atmosphere currents. These areas were predicted to warm particularly fast, and the measurements confirm the predictions.\nThe authors recognized that during the summer, the top layer of snow and ice can melt. The liquid water permeates the ice beneath it and refreezes, creating a more solid ice layer than before. Because the bands of solid ice are formed from melting snow, more bands of solid ice mean that summer temperatures were above freezing when the ice bands formed. Measuring the number and thickness of these bands through time gives information about how warm the summer temperatures are. \nSo basically, the authors used these annual ice-core bands to deduce temperatures as far back as 400 years ago. They found that the frequency of melting events increased by 57-fold from the 1650\u20131850 time period compared with 1980\u20132011. They also measured a 60-fold increase in total melt. These are staggering numbers. I asked the lead author, Dominic Winski to summarize his findings and he told me, \nThis research shows that peaks in the Alaska Range sustain additional summertime warming through links with rising ocean temperatures in the tropics. Not only have we learned that summers are much warmer on Mt. Hunter than they were hundreds of years ago, but our research also demonstrates how connected the climate system is, with changes in certain parts of the world affecting places thousands of miles away.\nIt will be interesting to see if others can replicate these findings in other locations. But the collaboration of the conclusions with other evidence is quite compelling.

No. He is giving us NEW historical information! You see, I referenced the events of Portugal in June of 2017 in which 62 people were burnt alive in their cars attempting to flee forest fires brought on by horrific droughts.

I'm sure the record-setting massive fire in December in my own town is simply a repeat of the same old cycles that have repeated over and over every decade or so for the past 15,000 years.

(Satellite observations that monitor our \"little blue dot\" for the environment typically begins around 1980 though). And according to the White House - the information they bring home is so dangerous to \"way of life\" and \"MAGA\" that they want to scrap this information not only from budget, but for the entire NASA mission-statement as well. And that is before the the WH nominate a guy on record saying \"...air these days is just too clean to promote good health\" for EPA - after they got a guy leading the EPA (and another guy leading the entire nation in the capacity of being POTUS) that agree AGW is a hoax - even though glaciers and temperature and stuff not known for being partial to political agendas say \"wrong\". \nThe reality of AGW is scary. The reality of political agendas and human willingness to lie for perception of gaining power or profit is even more scary. \nI would, based on this, poke my finger into politicians who look into a camera telling us that climate change is the \"huge'liest\" challenge of the 21'st century\" and suggest that the biggest challenge is the political willingness to hide reality for populist ideas of \"winning so bigly that people get tired of winning\" \nGlaciers do seriously disagree - and they do not have an agenda. They simply stop existing without a whiff of regret. So does coral reefs and other stuff we happen to like looking at. The more serious problem is that a lot of stuff we do not particularly like to look at also simply stop existing without an inch of ideological protest. Like bees. Or sea-ice. Or vegetation. Or effing tropical jungles or permafrost areas simply stop \"bothering\" acting like sinks any longer - and start to consider doing the opposite. (These are things that do not think - nor vote). \nGlaciers have been around since long before \"thinking\" was invented by evolution. Heck - glaciers has been around since before vegetation was invented. Heck - ice has been around in the solar system since before Planet Earth was invented. \nThe latter is not so strange. Ice is just the solid form of Hydrogen (the most popular (baryonic) thing in the Universe) combining with the third most popular (baryonic) element in the Universe (Oxygen) - by some pretty non-reactive bindings and forces. \nThese two atoms being inside the top-ten chart of popular atoms of the universe fall in love so strongly that we really have to apply a lot of energy to split them apart when they go molecule on us. And these to atoms \"marry\" in all sorts of ways. It is the foundation of what delta-oxygen isotopes are used for temperature reconstructions from the non-political argument of Greenland or Antarctic ice-sheets work. Hydrogen is happy to marry oxygen 16 (the normal isotopic form school) - but also O18. \nWater is kind of crazy stuff as marriage of two atoms. For example - water is one of few natural molecules that becomes lighter when they go from fluid to solid expression. This is why water allow what we call \"ice\" to float on top of water in fluid form. \nAnd physics also describe why water - as a liquid - also can do that trick of first going \"solid\" - as in rigid - and then - under pressure - start to move by physics that describe how gass or liquids move - aka fluid mechanics. \nAnd the really amazing thing about water is that the laws of the Big Bang can float it on top of it's liquid phase no matter where we are in the universe. \nWhen this fantastic strange thing in the form of what we call \"glaciers\" or \"ice\" start to stop existing in a rather non-emotional way, it does not really go away since the vapour form and sea-level close the budget. Unfortunate since H20 in vapour form is an amazingly strong GHG. \nH20 is wonderful. We can drink it it fluid form. We shower under it. We clean even the worst stain with it. We as living humans are by volume and weight based on a lot of it \nWhen that stuff starts to melt it is unconsciously sending a message. By making sea-level going up or drying half-continents. Heck - it even is a positive feed-back to heat in the atmosphere by being a GHG in gass form itself. \nPay attention to what water does. It is after all one of the strongest marriages of atoms known to humanity. \nAnd everyone knows that water is impartial. It is happy to be in the form of solid and gas form well before we think about how a per-mill of dehydration works on the intelligence of flesh and blood in humans. \nThe stuff we are - is not worried for us at all.

Summertime is the primary cause for hot temperatures, but climate change exacerbates it and increases death rates with heat-waves.

Longer wildfire seasons and conditions more favourable to wildfires are a crisis for affected communities. Melting glaciers are a crises for cities that rely on the for water.

Hughes told Guardian Australia the 2016 marine heatwave had been far more harmful than historical bleaching events, where an estimated 5% to 10% of corals died.\n\u201cWhen corals bleach from a heatwave, they can either survive and regain their colour slowly as the temperature drops, or they can die,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cAveraged across the whole Great Barrier Reef, we lost 30% of the corals in the nine-month period between March and November 2016.\u201d\nThe scientists set out to map the impact of the 2016 marine heatwave on coral along the 2,300km length of the Great Barrier Reef. They established a close link between the coral die-off and areas where heat exposure was most extreme. The northern third of the reef was the most severely affected. \n\u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories every morning\nThe study found that 29% of the 3,863 reefs that make up the Great Barrier Reef lost two-thirds or more of their corals.\nHughes said researchers were also surprised at how quickly some corals died in the extreme marine temperatures.\n\u201cThe conventional thinking is that after bleaching corals died slowly of ... starvation. That\u2019s not what we found. We were surprised that about half of the mortality we measured occurred very quickly.\u201d\nThe study found that \u201cinitially, at the peak of temperature extremes in March 2016, many millions of corals died quickly in the northern third of the Great Barrier Reef over a period of only two to three weeks\u201d.\n\u201cThese widespread losses were not due to the attrition of corals that slowly starved because they failed to regain their symbionts. Rather, temperature-sensitive species of corals began to die almost immediately in locations that were exposed to heat stress.\u201d\nThe research team observed \u201cmarkedly divergent responses to heat stress\u201d. Some corals, such as staghorn and tabular corals, suffered a \u201ccatastrophic die-off\u201d. Others proved more resilient.\nReport co-author Prof Andrew Baird said the coral die-off had caused \u201cradical changes in the mix of coral species on hundreds of individual reefs\u201d.\n\u201cMature and diverse reef communities are being transformed into more degraded systems, with just a few tough species remaining,\u201d he said.The researchers estimate half of the corals in shallow-water habitats in the northern Great Barrier Reef have been lost.\u201cBut, that still leaves a billion or so corals alive, and on average, they are tougher than the ones that died. We need to focus urgently on protecting the glass that\u2019s still half full, by helping these survivors to recover,\u201d Hughes said.\u201cThe Great Barrier Reef is certainly threatened by climate change, but it is not doomed if we deal very quickly with greenhouse gas emissions. Our study shows that coral reefs are already shifting radically in response to unprecedented heatwaves.\u201dThe scientists said their research underscores the need for further risk assessment into the collapse of reef ecosystems, especially if global action on climate change fails to limit warming to a 1.5C to 2C increase on pre-industrial levels.\nThey also warn that a failure to curb climate change, resulting in an increase above 2C, will radically alter tropical reef ecosystems and undermine benefits they provide to hundreds of millions of people.\nHughes said that left the reef in \u201cuncharted territory\u201d, its future dependent on how quickly emissions peak and come down.\nIf the targets in the Paris agreement are met, the reef will survive as \u201ca mixture of heat-tolerant [corals], and the ones that can bounce back\u201d.\n\u201cBiodiversity will likely be less, coral cover will likely be less,\u201d Hughes said.\nIf warming continues apace: \u201cThen it\u2019s game over.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coral", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/marine-life", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/natural-disasters", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oceans", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Report chronicles \u2018mass mortality\u2019, the extent and severity of which has shocked scientists", "date_published": {"$date": 1524074432000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1524123636476}, "authors": ["Ben Smee"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Great Barrier Reef", "Coral", "Environment", "Marine life", "Queensland", "Australia news", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Climate change", "Oceans"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/19/great-barrier-reef-30-of-coral-died-in-catastrophic-2016-heatwave", "og:description": "Report chronicles \u2018mass mortality\u2019, the extent and severity of which has shocked scientists", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c7d3a033e998c9b4a362fcf483e419752f3abb3/0_161_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=1a1ca915f5f08bb33d618764693b8942", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Great Barrier Reef: 30% of coral died in 'catastrophic' 2016 heatwave"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "0", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ea364f08f7f21124d77f4effde8f1c924df2009/0_0_496_719/master/496.png?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c0730f63a7dda8ade6be67bcef6c0511", "width": "496", "height": "719", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ea364f08f7f21124d77f4effde8f1c924df2009/0_0_496_719/master/496.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=721b7a8c6df3e779e16f55ee2d9163f2", "description": "The loss of coral cover along the Great Barrier Reef in 2016.

However 2015-16 was hotter than those equally strong previous El Nino years because global warming had increased the climate and sea surface temperatures. So while very strong El Ninos bump up western Pacific sea surface temperatures for the year, that of 2015-16 was bumping it up from a higher climate temperature. \nThe bleaching event of 2015-16 occurred at the end of the Southern summer in March 2016. While some minor coral bleaching occurred in 1997-98, that of 2016 was the first mass coral bleaching event to be observed on the Great Barrier Reef. Large parts of the northern third of the Reef were bleached with high coral mortality within the following 12 months. \n2016-17 was a weak La Nina year with La Nina Southern Oscillation Indices for the second half of 2016 and just over the border into neutral SOIs for the first half of 2017. Nevertheless, in March of last year another mass coral bleaching event, of similar size to that of the previous year, occurred over the middle third of the Great Barrier Reef. \nThe mass coral bleaching events of 2016 and 2017 have produced more coral damage than was \"normal\" for similar previous very strong El Ninos and similar previous weak La Nina years.\n\"The reef is recovering pretty well at the moment.\"\nThe Reef is recovering slowly as it has been seen to do after damage from other sources (cyclones and starfish grazing). Such recovery has been observed to take up to 20 years.\nGlobal warming is increasing the frequency of extreme El Nino events from once every 20 years on average to once every ten years on average. Given the 20 years needed for recovery and the occurrence now of mass coral bleaching during weak La Nina years, this presents problems for long term recovery before the next bleaching event occurs in that area.

I am doing a public lecture called \"climate change: Heading for extinction and what to do about it\" at King's College in London next Wednesday. It would be good to see you there.

Here is the beginning of the progression:1. the arctic ice totally melts in summer by 2022. This is easy right - just follow the graph to the zero point - give or take say 3-4 years. 2. .5C of warming already locked in from previous emissions - again 100% certain in 10 years give or take a .1C say. 3. .5C from the latent heat effects of the arctic total summer melts - the arctic is ice free 10 years effectively all the year round with 10 years of this date - again this is easy - just follow the graph lines to the zero point. \nokay so we are on 1.2C increase since 1750. add .5C and .5C and says .3C effectively guaranteed from water vapour and extra human emmissions and we are on 2.5C - already locked in. I am just a humble academic researcher do a bit of basic maths. Am I mad or is the whole of the climate industry mad for not being able to do this. I mean this is as basic as working out any projected simple system physical law process. eg gravity. \nSo from that I take the burning of Amazon (1.5C) and methane (.5C) and we over 5C which surely means the global geo-physical system is sliding inevitable to the 23C new equilibrium point of ice free arctic/Antarctic - by which time civilisation will surely have collapsed and humans will have no social and technological affordences to prevent this slide and will go extinction along with other mammals as in the previous mass extinctions. \nI am hoping this \"new standard model\" can then be used to mobilise people to the other no brainer conclusion - that it so much as there is any hope it will require a revolution to create radical structural change in the global economic and political system.

It's a beautiful picture, right? All that white coral. Except it's supposed to be brown. What happens is that the corals are a symbiosis, and they have these little algal cells that live inside them. And the algae give the corals sugar, and the corals give the algae nutrients and protection. \nBut when it gets too hot, the algae can't make the sugar. The corals say, \"You cheated. You didn't pay your rent.\" They kick them out, and then they die. Not all of them die; some of them survive, some more are surviving, but it's really bad news. To try and give you a sense of this, imagine you go camping in July somewhere in Europe or in North America, and you wake up the next morning, and you look around you, and you see that 80 percent of the trees, as far as you can see, have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked. \nAnd you come home, and you discover that 80 percent of all the trees in North America and in Europe have dropped their leaves. And then you read in the paper a few weeks later, \"Oh, by the way, a quarter of those died.\" Well, that's what happened in the Indian Ocean during the 1998 El Nino, an area vastly greater than the size of North America and Europe, when 80 percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died.\nAnd then the really scary thing about all of this -- the overfishing, the pollution and the climate change -- is that each thing doesn't happen in a vacuum. But there are these, what we call, positive feedbacks, the synergies among them that make the whole vastly greater than the sum of the parts. And the great scientific challenge for people like me in thinking about all this, is do we know how to put Humpty Dumpty back together again?\nBQEND\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/jeremy_jackson", "recommendation_count": "3", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "114884374", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1524107863000}, "author": "marko64", "author_id": "13673707", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Well as the last sentence says \"it's game over\"", "recommendation_count": "2", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "114884343", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1524107662000}, "author": "globalgypsy", "author_id": "1843100", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nWhen are we going to start putting these motherfuckers in jail?\nBQEND\nFirst things first.

Until fairly recently, the Arctic ocean regularly froze up hard up against the far north coast of Alaska by October. In 2017, it wasn\u2019t until the final few days of the year that the ice encased the waves.\nThe world may have warmed by around 1C (1.8F) over the past century but the Arctic far outstrips this global average and is warming at around twice the rate of the rest of the world.\nIn places, the rate of warming has been astonishing. Novembers in the Alaskan town of Utqia\u0121vik, formerly Barrow, are now 5.5C warmer than they were in 1979. This past winter, the warmest on record in the Arctic, saw some locations exceed 20C hotter than normal.\nThe Arctic is dominated by sea ice, unlike the Antarctic which is essentially a huge land-based ice sheet. As the ocean and atmosphere warm, sea ice is shrinking in extent, at around 13% a decade since 1979, according to Nasa. The bright white surface of ice, known as albedo, is giving way to the dark ocean, meaning that sunlight is being absorbed rather than reflected, amplifying the warming effect.\nThese \u201crapid and dramatic changes\u201d are introducing a \u201cnew normal\u201d to the Arctic, according to US government scientists in a report card last year. Storms are eroding away ice-free coastlines, summer wildfires are becoming fiercer and certain species, such as polar bears, are increasingly struggling to find food. This is all providing a major challenge to communities in the Arctic, but a boon to the shipping industry, which can navigate the area more easily. This task will get even simpler once the Arctic is ice free in summertimes, forecast as soon as 2040s.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a few warmer days in the past but there was nothing like the past winter,\u201d said Anne Jensen, an anthropologist who has worked in Utqia\u0121vik, the US\u2019s most northerly town, for the past three decades. It was so warm that the snow melted on Jensen\u2019s roof, causing it to leak.\n\u201cThis year\u2019s winter stuck out, insanely. It was crazy. Even the younger people noticed that this is something that hasn\u2019t happened before.\u201d\nA certain stoicism is required to live in the North Slope Borough, an area of sprawling tundra larger than 39 of the 50 US states that takes in Alaska\u2019s northern coast. The native I\u00f1upiat population have carved out a life here in the brutal cold of the Arctic Circle for at least 4,000 years, subsisting on bowhead whales, seals and caribou. \nUtqia\u0121vik, formerly known as Barrow, is the largest of the region\u2019s scattered settlements and remains a flinty and unforgiving frontier town despite the arrival of the internet, buzzy snowmobiles and exotic vegetables (a pineapple costs around $9.50 (\u00a36.70) at the main grocery store).\nBut the past winter, following a string of warm years, points to a pace of change not before experienced by this community. The winter was the warmest on record in the Arctic, with sea ice extent hitting record lows in January and February, ending up at the second-smallest seasonal peak in the 39-year satellite record in March. The smallest was in 2017. The Bering Sea, which separates Alaska and Russia, lost a third of its winter ice in just eight February days. \nOtherworldly temperatures were felt across the region, with the weather station closest to the North Pole spending more than 60 hours above freezing in February, around 25C (45F) warmer than normal, which is equivalent to Washington DC spending a February day at 35C (95F) or Miami baking at 51C (124F). The Arctic was, in spells, warmer than much of Europe.\nUtqia\u0121vik, pronounced oot-ki-ahh-vik or \u201cplace where snowy owls are hunted\u201d, got to -1C, around 22C warmer than normal. In December, the temperature readings from the weather station at Utqia\u0121vik were so freakish that it triggered an automatic shutdown of the system to protect the data from \u201cartificial\u201d figures. It temporarily wiped a year\u2019s worth of numbers.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration called the incident an \u201cironic exclamation point\u201d to the climate change gripping the Arctic, which is warming at twice the rate of the global average. This winter\u2019s extreme warmth was, in part, driven by an unusual number of storms in the Atlantic that brought balmier air to the Arctic. But scientists warned that 2017 and 2018 should not be dismissed as mere outliers. \n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why this sort of warmth won\u2019t continue. Within the lifetime of middle-aged adults, the Arctic has completely changed,\u201d said Rick Thoman, a Noaa climate scientist based in Fairbanks, Alaska. \u201cThe magnitude of change is utterly unprecedented. For a lot of the people who live there, it\u2019s completely shocking.\u201d\nThe changes are potentially existential on the north slope, where sea ice provides a crucial platform for catching and hauling in whales \u2013 a key food source and cultural totem for the I\u00f1upiat. The spring whale hunt, where emerging cracks, or \u201cleads\u201d, in the sea ice funnel whales into the path of waiting hunting crews, requires dependable environmental cycles that have served the I\u00f1upiat for thousands of years. \n\u201cAll the indications are there will be a very early loss of ice this year,\u201d Thoman said. \u201cIn the 1990s they could do whale hunting in Utqia\u0121vik up until May or even June. There\u2019s no real chance of that now \u2013 the ice will probably start breaking up by early May.\n\u201cNative peoples of Alaska are very resilient; they\u2019ve lived here for many millennia for a reason. Some will have to move, hunting will have to change. It can be done but it won\u2019t be easy, it won\u2019t be cheap. There will be a big cost, both financially and culturally.\u201d\nUtqia\u0121vik is wrestling with a number of climate impacts. Its coastline, increasingly shorn of sea ice, is eroding at a concerning rate. The melting of permafrost, long-frozen soils that scientists forecast could end up releasing huge amounts of carbon, is causing some buildings to slump, their walls radiating with cracks.\nBut it\u2019s the potential threat to the whale quota that causes most angst. Slain whales need to be quickly pulled up on to the sea ice and butchered before the cetaceans\u2019 cooling systems halt and they essentially cook from within. Lack of thick, multi-year ice could hinder the haul-out. Caught whales could even fall through the ice if it\u2019s too thin.\n\u201cA couple of years ago the ice was rubble, it was just breaking up,\u201d said Nagruk Harcharek, who has spent many of his 33 years whaling near Utqia\u0121vik. \u201cIt was really late this year and everyone noticed. I\u2019d be lying if I said people aren\u2019t worried.\n\u201cSome families rely upon whales for their food. It\u2019s so central to our culture. The spring hunt is spiritual \u2013 sitting out there on the ice edge is pretty quiet. There\u2019s the unknown. There\u2019s not much going on. You\u2019re watching, waiting.\u201d\nOther heritage is already being lost, with archaeological sites along the coast being washed away at a quickening rate. In September, a major storm crunched into the coast and threatened Birnirk, a village that was inhabited for 1,000 years and is a national historic landmark. \n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very grim,\u201d said Jensen, who has worked to excavate and protect several sites. \u201cMost of the coastal sites will be gone in the next 10 to 15 years if the rate of erosion keeps up.\u201d\nAcross Alaska, dozens of coastal towns are at risk of becoming uninhabitable, with a handful actively seeking to relocate. Melting permafrost is buckling roads into potentially deadly big dipper rollercoasters, as well as threatening to dislodge doses of locked-up mercury. Glaciers near Denali, the tallest mountain in the US, are disappearing faster than at any time in the past 400 years.\nThe Alaskan government recently warned this bewildering rate of change risks the physical and mental health of its citizens, citing a condition called solastalgia, the distress caused by severe disruption to the environment near home. \n\u201cAlaska is on the frontlines of climate change,\u201d Bill Walker, the state\u2019s governor, warned last year. Walker, an independent, has convened a panel to come up with some sort of climate change strategy by September. \nSomehow, it will have to suggest a way forward that doesn\u2019t rattle its economically important oil and gas industry, which has received staunch support from a Trump administration that has started to dismantle help for those pummeled by rising seas and storms.\nFor a reliably Republican state, polling shows unusual numbers of Alaskans are concerned about climate change and, at least sometimes, openly fret over its consequences. \u201cPeople are feeling the impacts of climate change, we hear that on a daily basis,\u201d said Nikoosh Carlo, the governor\u2019s climate adviser. \u201cIt\u2019s a non-partisan issue here. For some communities, the next storm could wipe out critical infrastructure.\u201d\nThe lack of any federal or state plan to deal with the looming climate crisis isn\u2019t causing mass panic in Utqia\u0121vik, at least.\n\u201cWe are capable of adapting to any changes,\u201d said Charlie Hopson, a veteran Utqia\u0121vik whaler. \u201cWe\u2019ve been around for thousands of years and we\u2019re going to keep living. We do our own thing here. The government doesn\u2019t know shit. We don\u2019t need them.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/arctic", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/indigenous-peoples", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Arctic Dispatches, part 1: The past winter was the warmest on record in the Arctic, putting a lifestyle that has endured for millennia at risk: \u2018The magnitude of change is utterly unprecedented\u2019", "date_published": {"$date": 1524290406000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1524429295000}, "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "article_section": "US news", "article_tags": ["Alaska", "Climate change", "Arctic", "US news", "Environment", "Indigenous peoples", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/21/alaska-climate-change-winter-way-of-life", "og:description": "Arctic Dispatches, part 1: The past winter was the warmest on record in the Arctic, putting a lifestyle that has endured for millennia at risk: \u2018The magnitude of change is utterly unprecedented\u2019", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73f1cd7149b0806d6b6cba0aa3b31c548cbcd9b8/0_156_4706_2825/master/4706.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=928c7eaa4a2efc0362bfcefb507a06f2", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "What happened to winter?

An emergency \u201corange alert\u201d, declared last February by the country\u2019s disaster management council after failed rains, has triggered such strict water rationing across the capital city that the taps are turned off every other day and irrigation is banned.\nUnable to afford the private wells, boreholes and extra tanks used by the rich to buffer themselves from the restrictions, Chamanculo\u2019s residents once again find themselves gathering at a single tap. At 9am, a steady stream of mostly women, some with babies strapped to their backs, line up at Pragosa, a Portuguese construction firm, which is providing free water from a private borehole to the community during the emergency for an hour every day. They fill up 25-litre canisters and carefully balance them on their heads, often making repeat trips home and back again.\nHelena Metela, 20, a mother of a three-month-old boy, Ali, says it is a struggle but she has no choice. \u201cThe construction company is a little bit far from my home,\u201d she says. \u201cIt takes time. Maybe an hour.\u201d\nWith no end to the current water shortage in sight, the municipality is considering bringing back community pumps to deal with the dwindling supply.\nUnlike Cape Town, in neighbouring South Africa where the water supply is at breaking point, Maputo has not got to the stage where officials have predicted a \u201cday zero\u201d, when taps are forecast to run dry. But it is clear that without urgent action, Maputo could be the next southern African city to suffer extreme water shortages. Worse still, future projections are for the city to double in size, from 1.7 million people to 3.5million by 2035, sending demand for already scant water resources soaring further.\nSo pressing is the issue that late last month government departments, water utilities, regulators and NGOs gathered in downtown Maputo for a crisis meeting to discuss possible solutions. At the meeting, held jointly by the Mozambique government and WaterAid, official after official warned that the situation was \u201ccritical\u201d.\nNobody present was in any doubt of the role climate change is playing in the water shortages. Meteorologists who talked to the Observer reported shifting rainfall patterns, high temperatures and more extreme weather events in recent years. Predictions are that in Maputo and other coastal cities increased pressure on fresh water supply is set to increase.\nJonathan Farr, a senior policy analyst at Wateraid, said climate change was \u201ceating up the world\u2019s water\u201d, while also making it harder to find a solution. \u201cThings that have worked in the past are no longer enough. Climate change makes everything considerably more serious. Cape Town was something you wouldn\u2019t expect to happen. We are now seeing it potentially in Maputo.\u201d\nAn hour\u2019s drive west from Maputo is the vast Pequenos Libombos dam, which feeds into the Umbeluzi river, the main source of water supply to Greater Maputo. Completed in 1987, the dam has a capacity of 400 million square metres. But in the last two years, the water level has dropped dramatically. Standing on the bridge above the reservoir, Jaime Timba, the dam\u2019s director, points to a series of yellow guages on the dam\u2019s wall, well above the current water level.\n\u201cThe water level is too low for the scale,\u201d Timba said \u201cWe need to build a new one.\u201d It is only the second time in a decade that the water level has been so depleted. The last time was in 2016, when it fell to 13%. Some water restrictions were enacted then, but they were not sufficient. Meanwhile, everyone prayed for more rain.\nIn the last four years the Umbeluzi river basin has recorded below average rainfall for the whole basin, while evaporation rates have risen, according to Wateraid. Swathes of land across the region, from South Africa to Zambia, have been hit by high temperatures and low rainfall. Though rainfall in Mozambique has been reasonably good elsewhere, Swaziland in the south-west, whose rivers feed into the Pequenos Libombos dam, has suffered.\nJacinto Laureiro, the mayor of Boane, a town in Greater Maputo, said: \u201cWe need to change from thinking about the next 10 years or even 20 years, to thinking long term.\u201d\nThe current situation, he said, had developed over time, due to population growth, a lack of investment in infrastructure measures to capture water, and because of climate change.\nAsked if the situation could deteriorate, he said: \u201cOnly God knows.\u201d\nAntonieta Ruben, 53, a widow, was sceptical that she would see improvements any time soon.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have hope,\u201d said Ruben, who has two sons at university in Maputo and sells chickens to support her family. \u201cThis is a normal crisis. They can have promises of getting water but nothing is done.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/water", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/mozambique", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa", "https://www.theguardian.com/weather/mozambique", "https://www.theguardian.com/weather/index/africa", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Taps in capital city of Maputo being turned off every other day as climate change exacerbates southern African drought", "date_published": {"$date": 1524351905000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1524650733000}, "authors": ["Karen McVeigh"], "article_section": "Global development", "article_tags": ["Global development", "Water", "World news", "Mozambique", "Africa", "Mozambique", "Africa", "Climate change", "Environment", "Drought"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/22/mozambique-prays-for-rain-water-shortages-hit-poor-maputo-southern-africa-drought", "og:description": "Taps in capital city of Maputo being turned off every other day as climate change exacerbates southern African drought", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdde7e47f9721ab4126ddbe5b46ca259248282bc/0_0_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=6c13c5b2ac3b6ff54b7dff9382f5fa31", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Mozambique prays for rain as water shortages hit country\u2019s poor"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "o", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdde7e47f9721ab4126ddbe5b46ca259248282bc/0_0_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e3a81d2e69077a2c3bea19493c1bda92", "width": "4032", "height": "2419", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdde7e47f9721ab4126ddbe5b46ca259248282bc/0_0_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=30af3437177e6fc07b271a61bb1dc51b", "description": "Girls carry bottled water in Maputo, where a drought has reversed progress in improving access to water.\nPhotograph: Karen McVeigh"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556126843345}, "comments": [{"id": "115073099", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1524579070000}, "author": "Yetypu", "author_id": "4669086", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Thank you.

That the last interglacial had lasted for only 15,000 years was no guarantee that the current one would be so short.\nGanopolski et al (2016) in their paper \"Critical insolation-CO2 relation for diagnosing past and future glacial inception\" Nature 534, 19-20, says as follows.\n\"we suggest that glacial inception was narrowly missed before the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The missed inception can be accounted for by the combined effect of relatively high late-Holocene CO2 and the low orbital excentricity of the Earth. Additionally our analysis suggests that even in the absence of human perturbations no substantial buildup of icesheets could occur within the next several thousand years and that the current interglacial will probably last for another 50,000 years. However, moderate anthropogenic cumulative CO2 emissions of 1,000 to 1,500 gigatonnes of carbon will postpone the next glacial inception by at least 100,000 years. Our simulations demonstrate that under natural conditions alone the Earth would be expected to remain the present delicately balanced interglacial climate state, steering clear of both large-scale glaciation of the Northern Hemisphere and its complete deglaciation, for an usually long time.\"", "recommendation_count": "7", "in_reply_to": "114999016", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "net anthropogenic co2", "effect": "they were aware of warming by the end of the 20th century"}]}, {"id": "115012372", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1524460518000}, "author": "DesignConstruct", "author_id": "100123615", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "No, it's not part of winning.

When there is more sunlight at high latitudes in summer, ice sheets melt. Shrinking ice sheets make the planet darker, so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer. A warmer ocean releases CO2, just as a warm Coca-Cola does. And more CO2 causes more warming. \nSo CO2, methane, and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge, even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing.\nThe important point is that these same amplifying feedbacks will occur today. The physics does not change. As Earth warms, now because of extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere, ice will melt, and CO2 and methane will be released by warming ocean and melting permafrost. While we can't say exactly how fast these amplifying feedbacks will occur, it is certain they will occur, unless we stop the warming. \nThere is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning. Precise measurements by GRACE, the gravity satellite, reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica are now losing mass, several hundred cubic kilometers per year. And the rate has accelerated since the measurements began nine years ago. Methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost.\"\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/james_hansen_why_i_must_speak_out_about_climate_change/transcript?language=en", "recommendation_count": "2", "in_reply_to": "114982824", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "co2", "effect": "how those changes are now our fault"}, {"cause": "more co2", "effect": "more warming"}, {"cause": "extra co2", "effect": "as earth warms we put in the atmosphere"}]}, {"id": "115011515", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1524454859000}, "author": "Erik Frederiksen", "author_id": "15131989", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "You wrote \"Are you sure about that?

Using graphene meant the researchers were able to roughly halve the amount of materials used to make concrete.\nIts water resistance makes it suitable for construction in areas that are hard to reach for maintenance, while the strength of the composite will make buildings more resilient to future shocks and strains, researchers say. In addition, the technique could be copied in incorporating other nanomaterials into concrete construction in the future, which could pave the way to further innovations in the industry.\nMonica Craciun, professor of nanoscience at the University of Exeter\u2019s engineering department, said: \u201cOur cities face a growing pressure from global challenges on pollution, sustainable urbanisation and resilience to catastrophic natural events. This new composite material is an absolute game-changer in terms of reinforcing traditional concrete to meet these needs.\u201d\nGraphene is a form of carbon first reliably produced at the University of Manchester by researchers in 2004, work which led to two Nobel prizes. It is made up of a single layer of carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice. Its structure gives it important physical qualities, including efficient conductance of heat and electricity and unusual strength.\nConcrete has been used as a building material since the Romans, some of whose concrete structures still stand today. It is the commonest building material, along with steel, but greenhouse gas emissions from concrete and cement-making remain stubbornly high, in part because of the energy used in their creation but also because the chemical processes required involve the break-up of limestone and release of carbon dioxide.\nCement-making accounts for 6% of global carbon emissions, and manufacturers must make sharp reductions if the Paris climate goals are to be met, according to the Carbon Disclosure Project, in a recent study.\nThe University of Exeter research, in a paper entitled Ultrahigh Performance nanoengineered Graphene-Concrete Composites for Multifunctional Applications, is published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, and was funded by the UK\u2019s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.\nThe samples of the composite tested so far all come up to British and European standards, so getting the composite material into use should be possible. Dimitar Dimov, lead author of the study, said: \u201cFinding greener ways to build is a crucial step forward in reducing carbon emissions around the world. This is a crucial step in the right direction to make a more sustainable construction industry.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/business/construction", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Form of carbon incorporated into concrete created stronger, more water-resistant composite material that could reduce emissions", "date_published": {"$date": 1524497103000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1524497172000}, "authors": ["Fiona Harvey"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Construction industry", "Technology", "UK news", "Business", "Climate change", "Environment", "World news", "Science"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/23/graphene-a-game-changer-in-making-building-with-concrete-greener", "og:description": "Form of carbon incorporated into concrete created stronger, more water-resistant composite material that could reduce emissions", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47d1a2dbe83cea5398e8058f9fab3ece94eaef3e/0_199_5000_2998/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=f01b92b64502eb48be3dfb2af1436055", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Graphene 'a game-changer' in making building with concrete greener"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47d1a2dbe83cea5398e8058f9fab3ece94eaef3e/0_199_5000_2998/master/5000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a6228a5c0f290c8eda258e4370808f64", "width": "5000", "height": "2998", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47d1a2dbe83cea5398e8058f9fab3ece94eaef3e/0_199_5000_2998/master/5000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1a38db6d46b7e0bde482d11c26a41096", "description": "Graphene is a form of carbon made of a single layer of atoms in a hexagonal lattice.\nPhotograph: nobeastsofierce / Alamy/Alamy"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc0804fa2c3613145ed8f24"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/25/americas-best-scientists-stood-up-to-the-trump-administration", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Anyone who has read this column over the past five years knows that I tend to be unfettered in my criticism of people who lie and distort climate science to further their political ideologies. At the same time, I believe that the majority of climate sceptics are not willfully wishing to damage this precious Earth that we call home. I believe that there are common areas we can all agree on to take meaningful action to protect the Earth\u2019s environment and build a new energy future; even for people who do not understand climate change or climate science.\nBut with the election of Donald Trump and his ushering in people who are openly hostile to the planet and future generations, my position has been strained (to say the least). We have had more than a year to observe President Trump\u2019s efforts to roll back Obama-era regulations on pollution from coal plants, weaken pollution standards for motor vehicles, become the only country in the world to reject the Paris climate accord, and gut our climate science budget so that we become blind to what is actually happening. \nWe have to believe Trump when he says that he thinks climate science is a hoax and we have to expect he will act according to this belief. Under Trump, the USA has become a pariah nation. It hurts me to say this, because I love the USA and what it stands for. But regarding the environment, we are the worst of the worst.\nSome people will claim I am \u201cunpatriotic\u201d or \u201cunAmerican\u201d to criticize my country. My response is, I am honest. A patriot is someone who loves their country and wants their country to meet the ideals that are the foundation of that nation. Patriotic means you want your country to be better; you want your country to make a positive impact. I believe that turning a blind eye to your country\u2019s faults is a most deeply unpatriotic act. I want my country to excel, I want my country to lead, I want my country to be a shining light on a hill. If my country fails or falters in that endeavor, I will work tirelessly to correct our path. That, in my mind is patriotism.\nPresident Trump has installed radical science deniers in his administration to obstruct climate science research, to stop development in clean and renewable energy (the economic growth engine of the future), and to attack scientists for doing their jobs. Among Trump\u2019s most harmful acts was to appoint Scott Pruitt to head the EPA. Scott Pruitt does not understand even basic climate science, and he doesn\u2019t comprehend that climate change will be bad for human society. \nBut it isn\u2019t just Trump and Pruitt that are a problem. Everyone in the Trump administration seems hell-bent on damaging the planet. Recently, climate change denier Jim Bridenstine was confirmed by Senate Republicans to lead Nasa \u2013 one of the two most important climate science organizations in the country. Trump has brought with him a swamp filled with anti-science staff whose goal is to handicap the US and permanently remove us from any leadership role in the world.\nTo be clear, Trump, Pruitt, the entire administration, and those who support him will inherit a terrible legacy that we will not forget. These people will be known for willfully trying to destroy the planet that we rely on for health and prosperity.\nDespite the attacks from the Trump/Pruitt Administration, some scientists have begun to speak out. This speaking out takes courage. I have the luxury of being unbridled in my work. My livelihood does not depend on federal research grants; I have no boss in Washington DC that can threaten me; Scott Pruitt cannot attack me; nor can President Trump. For a scientist like me, speaking out is low-risk. \nBut many of my colleagues are not so fortunate. Many of my colleagues, who have dedicated their lives to understanding the Earth\u2019s environment, are employed by Washington. That is, they are able to carry out research by obtaining federal grants. These grants pay for their instruments (satellites, sea level gauges, weather balloons, supercomputers, etc.), their offices, salaries, and so forth. And when these scientists speak out, it is an act of courage and selflessness.\nThis week, many of these scientists have spoken out. In an open letter, over 600 scientists from the prestigious National Academy of Sciences (America\u2019s best scientists) wrote the following:\nIn September 2016, over 375 members of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) signed an Open Letter calling attention to the dangers of human-induced climate change. The letter warned that U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accord would have negative consequences for the world\u2019s climate system and for U.S. leadership and credibility.\nIn the intervening 15 months, these negative consequences have become more obvious. Human-caused climate disruption is leading to suffering and economic loss. Suffering and loss are not future hypotheticals. They are happening now. Despite these serious negative consequences, the present Administration has fulfilled its threat to initiate U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accord. The United States is the only nation in the world that has taken this action. \nThe decision to withdraw is symptomatic of a larger problem: The Trump Administration\u2019s denigration of scientific expertise and harassment of scientists. The dismissal of scientific evidence in policy formulation has affected wide areas of the social, biological, environmental and physical sciences. It has been particularly egregious in climate science. A recent instance of this is the intention of the Administration to assemble a \u201cRed Team/Blue Team\u201d to re-litigate all aspects of climate science. Such an exercise seeks to foster the erroneous impression of deep uncertainty concerning the reality and seriousness of anthropogenically driven climate change.\nScientific evidence and research should be an important component of policymaking. We therefore call on the Federal Government to maintain scientific content on publicly accessible websites, to appoint qualified personnel to positions requiring scientific expertise, to cease censorship and intimidation of Government scientists, and to reverse the decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Accord.\nMy country has withdrawn from the most significant multinational agreement to stop climate change, has attacked scientists funding and censored scientists and threatened them to stay quiet, and has actively enacted measures to encourage pollution both in the US and worldwide.\nThis is not the USA I know in my heart. This is not the world leader I believe my country to be. This is a pariah nation led by a small number of people who are getting rich at the expense of public and environmental health. \nFor those who support these policies \u2013 shame. There is no ethical or moral justification to value polluters\u2019 profits more than the health of the planet and the inheritance of future generations. That\u2019s just greed, plain and simple.\nFor those who voted for Trump and who vote for other deniers of climate change, you can no longer say \u201cI just didn\u2019t know.\u201d Now is the time to acknowledge you were lied to. It is never too late to change course. But it is untenable to say you care about future generations yet still support politicians and policies that lead to future destruction. You have to choose one or the other; there is no middle ground, and we need to quit pretending there is.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change-scepticism", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/global-climate-talks", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/epa", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump"], "share_count": "0", "description": "John Abraham: Over 600 NAS members called out \u2018the Trump Administration\u2019s denigration of scientific expertise\u2019", "date_published": {"$date": 1524650445000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1524650505000}, "authors": ["John Abraham"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Climate change scepticism", "Paris climate agreement", "COP 21: UN climate change conference | Paris", "Global climate talks", "US Environmental Protection Agency", "Environment", "Climate change", "Science", "Donald Trump", "Republicans"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/25/americas-best-scientists-stood-up-to-the-trump-administration", "og:description": "John Abraham: Over 600 NAS members called out \u2018the Trump Administration\u2019s denigration of scientific expertise\u2019", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c7fd9888fa45ec2efc6f9794259e1eb06122529/0_4_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=9da690b8bac56880aa2a78f4a2026506", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "America's best scientists stood up to the Trump administration | John Abraham"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "d", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c7fd9888fa45ec2efc6f9794259e1eb06122529/0_4_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d471f0d54f50c44fc0b1a70622f6d1d8", "width": "3500", "height": "2101", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c7fd9888fa45ec2efc6f9794259e1eb06122529/0_4_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9fb4eb91debb6febe573339e47697b9e", "description": "A giant puppet depicting EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is carried among demonstrators during a People\u2019s Climate March, to protest U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s stance on the environment, in Washington, April 29, 2017.\nPhotograph: Mike Theiler/Reuters"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556126851230}, "comments": [{"id": "115347214", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1525254850000}, "author": "ComfortablyPlumb", "author_id": "14842422", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nThis is completely wrong.

This was always the plan- oil would have its day, coal would get to expensive and too toxic and just as the US took over from the UKs coal driven dominance so China would use clean energy to supersede the oil driven US.\nBoth Tesla and Nissan threw the gauntlet down to other automakers and the evidence is clear that they are setting the trend.But China is the bigger story- in the UK a couple of EV buses gets into the news- in Chinese cities they order 400 at a time and there are a lot Chinese cities- UK bus companies may um and er about if EV buses are ready- yet they reduce fuel costs by 70% and maintenance costs by 50%\nwith nuclear the transition is doable and relatively affordable now- in the first instance we should have kickstarted the revolution 20 years ago- in the UK we have a culture of just enough [with the exception if UK military] we do everything to its lower limit which keeps costs down but means roads melt in heat waves, snow and leaves stop trains, trains are just one maintenance away from breaking down etc. In the case of CO2 the govt action on wind and nuclear keep us on track but this is the easy part of the action plan which means the later phases become more expensive and problematic.\n20 years ago the UK could have set out an action plan to insulate to high standards all new builds and 80% of existing stock - but it could have also insured that we would not go through a housing stock crisis and unaffordable rents or ownership as we are now.\nIf it had done that it could get on with the 20 year challenge to get domestic gas heating converted to heat pumps- which we have not started. [the current incentive is wood pellets and heat pumps but only big users like the UK stately homes really benefit- or farmers in N.I.]\nThe transition is happening- and it is now getting cheaper than using fossil fuels. The West is being complacent - just as the UK car and motorcycle industry woke up to a new Eastern threat in the 1970s and did too little too late so one day we wake up to Chinese buses and cars [the london black cab is Chinese and its newest cab is EV].\nComplacency brings down great nations- and globally the same is true for AGW. Dealing with AGW fixes lots of other problems- such as health, housing, affordable living, rising costs, even productivity that is falling in the UK.

Such claims are typically made by either a student who barely learned anything about physics, or by someone who have not had a formal education in physics. There is somehow a notion that SR, GR, and QM have shown that classical physics is wrong, and so, it shouldn\u2019t be used. \nBQEND\n\nBQSTART\nClassical physics is used in an overwhelming majority of situations in our lives. Your houses, buildings, bridges, airplanes, and physical structures were built using the classical laws. The heat engines, motors, etc. were designed based on classical thermodynamics laws. And your radio reception, antennae, TV transmitters, wi-fi signals, etc. are all based on classical electromagnetic description. \nBQEND\n\nBQSTART\nNow let\u2019s look at how we do this in SR, which is the more general description of such kinematics. Here, we use what is known as the Lorentz transformation.\nBQEND\n\nBQSTART\nHere, H is t he Hamiltonian, Q is an operator representing any observable, the square bracket represents the commutator, while the angled bracket represents the average value. These are all the standard notations used in QM.\nBQEND\nBQSTART\nIt is why for someone not trained in physics, the idea that classical mechanics can actually be derived from seemingly a different animal of QM or SR/GR would not even cross his/her mind. Yet, in science/physics, this is quite common. We always show how new ideas and theories will turn into the old, tested, and well-known ideas and theories under the appropriate parameters.

We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming. Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming. In a second phase of this study, we invited authors to rate their own papers. Compared to abstract ratings, a smaller percentage of self-rated papers expressed no position on AGW (35.5%). Among self-rated papers expressing a position on AGW, 97.2% endorsed the consensus. For both abstract ratings and authors' self-ratings, the percentage of endorsements among papers expressing a position on AGW marginally increased over time. Our analysis indicates that the number of papers rejecting the consensus on AGW is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research.\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024\nBQEND", "recommendation_count": "3", "in_reply_to": "115200755", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "humans", "effect": "global warming"}]}, {"id": "115200865", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1524910721000}, "author": "Anthonyhu", "author_id": "17407909", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nthe scientists themselves say their work is being misrepresented\nBQEND\nWhere do they say this and have you confirmed by contacting the individuals that this is actually the case?", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "115200057", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "115223973", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1524970717000}, "author": "TTauriStellarbody", "author_id": "16773618", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Dial up the physics and all the strutting little fake experts go missing or implode like plumb.", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "115202706", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "115223711", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1524968909000}, "author": "Holierthancow", "author_id": "10450813", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Well, in Australia, our right-wing politicians brought a lump of coal into the parliament, passed it around, told us not to be scared of it, and that it was good for humanity.Australia, world leaders in tawdry anti-science carnival barkers.", "recommendation_count": "3", "in_reply_to": "115106634", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "115286180", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1525099838000}, "author": "johnnyny", "author_id": "100344814", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "most scientists don't believe in god....", "recommendation_count": "1", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "115276771", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1525088646000}, "author": "ID2310987", "author_id": "2515806", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "I really wonder who you are trying to impress Anthony?

Indeed, an unaltered approach would spend the global carbon dioxide emissions budget in 20 years.

The F-test show that the improvement obtained with the quadratic fit is statistical significant at a very high confidence level.\"\"We showed that a detailed analysis of the GRACE time series over the time period 2002\u20132009 unambiguously reveals an increase in mass loss from both ice sheets. The combined contribution of Greenland and Antarctica to global sea level rise is accelerating at a rate of 56 \u00b1 17 Gt/yr2 during April 2002\u2013February 2009, which corresponds to an equivalent acceleration in sea level rise of 0.17 \u00b1 0.05 mm/yr2 during this time. This large acceleration explains a large share of the different GRACE estimates of ice sheet mass loss published in recent years. It also illustrates that the two ice sheets play an important role in the total contribution to sea level at present, and that contribution is continuously and rapidly growing.\"That, of course, is old news (2009).

Pruitt has also previously falsely claimed that the lobbyist, Steven Hart, had no business before the EPA when he rented his wife\u2019s apartment. \nPruitt has come under severe pressure over the $50-a-night apartment deal, his spending of more than $100,000 from the public purse on first-class flights in his first year as EPA administrator, ostensibly to evade abuse from fellow passengers, as well as taking a large security detail on trips to Disneyland and the Rose Bowl.\nHe also oversaw the spending of $43,000 on a soundproof booth for his office, in violation of federal rules, and has reportedly retaliated against staffers who questioned his spending. Pruitt is facing multiple federal government investigations over his conduct, including two different White House inquiries.\nThere\u2019s a pattern of putting personal and special interests ahead of the American people\nFacing the House of Representatives energy and commerce committee, Pruitt departed from his prepared remarks to decry the \u201cdistorted\u201d reporting that has exposed his activities. \u201cI have nothing to hide as it relates to how I run the agency in the past 16 months,\u201d he said. \u201cFacts are facts and fiction is fiction. A lie doesn\u2019t become true just because it\u2019s on the front page.\u201d\nPruitt said he was \u201cnot afraid to admit there has been a learning process\u201d and vowed to correct any problems within the EPA. But he said that those who have \u201cattacked the EPA and me have done so to derail the president\u2019s agenda and priorities and I won\u2019t let that happen\u201d.\nPruitt declined to apologize but said the ethics scandals have proved a \u201cdistraction\u201d to the EPA. He said he had no idea of the $43,000 spent on the soundproof booth and cited security concerns for the first-class travel arrangements, reading out threats to \u201cput a bullet between your eyes\u201d and another that said: \u201cI hope your father dies soon in agony in front of your mother.\u201d This was despite a recent report claiming that Pruitt flew in coach on some flights that were at his own expense.\nCommittee Democrats poured scorn on Pruitt\u2019s responses and repeatedly called on him to resign, in a combative hearing. \u201cThere\u2019s seemingly endless misconduct, a pattern of putting personal and special interests ahead of the American people,\u201d said Paul Tonko, a Democrat from New York. \u201cYou\u2019ve abused this position for personal gain. You were never fit for this job.\u201d\nFrank Pallone, another Democrat, said Pruitt had used the job to \u201cenrich himself and his corporate friends\u201d with the apparent approval of Trump. \u201cIf I were the president I wouldn\u2019t want your help, I\u2019d just get rid of you,\u201d he told Pruitt.\nPruitt has earned Trump\u2019s admiration for his zeal in repealing environmental regulations and dismantling of action on climate change, such as Pruitt\u2019s successful agitation for the US to withdraw from the Paris climate accords. Trump has tweeted that Pruitt is \u201cdoing a great job\u201d.\nBut in recent days the White House has sought to distance itself from the beleaguered EPA chief as the extraordinary number of ethical problems mounted. Sarah Sanders, Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, said on Wednesday that \u201cwe expect the EPA administrator to answer\u201d concerns raised by Congress.\nEnvironment groups and Democrats have called for Pruitt\u2019s removal, joined by a small band of Republicans. During the committee hearing, Republicans praised Pruitt\u2019s deregulation agenda but some also raised concerns over his spending. \u201cThese issues are too persistent to ignore,\u201d said Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican. \nOthers, though, sided strongly with Pruitt. \u201cThis is a classic display of innuendo and McCarthyism that works against civility and respect,\u201d said David McKinley, a West Virginia Republican, criticizing Democrats. \nJoe Barton, a Republican representative from Texas, used his time to ask Pruitt if he had rented a \u201cparty jet\u201d. Pruitt said he hadn\u2019t. \u201cWell, that\u2019s good,\u201d Barton said.

The method it has developed does not detract from the taste of the finished drink, it says, while using less heat and water.\nBubbles are said to be crucial in determining the taste of a beer. Traditionally, gas bubbles in the early stages of brewing are generated through the natural cooking process, requiring bountiful levels of water and heat. AB InBev says, however, it is able to simulate the effects of boiling the brew.\nThe new method involves heating the brew to below boiling point and then blowing nitrogen or CO2 into the tank to create bubbles without changing the taste. The company claims that because the beer is brewed at a lower temperature in the early phase, it can also stay fresh for longer. The bubbles found in the finished product are still to be produced in the normal way, typically by the yeast\u2019s digestion of sugars or by pressurisation in the kegging process.\nDavid De Schutter, the company\u2019s research director for Europe, said: \u201cBoiling and these gas bubbles are the sacred formula in the brewing process. Each brewer goes through a boiling process.\n\u201cOur innovation is to heat everything up to just below boiling point, which provides 80% energy savings at this point in time. There is a lot less steam released, which allows you to spend less on water. In our case, we managed to go from 5% evaporated water to less than 1%.\u201d\nAB InBev claims that when it has adopted the technique in all its breweries around the world it will reduce its global CO2 emissions by 5% a year, equivalent to the energy consumption of 120,000 families.\nStudies suggest there will be 80% less evaporation as a result of a 0.5% reduction in water consumption, said to be \u201cthe equivalent of 1,200 Olympic swimming pools\u201d.\nThe company, which hopes all its breweries will adopt the technique within 10 years, is offering to share the patented technology free of charge with smaller brewers. \nA fee would be charged to the company\u2019s larger rivals in the market.

Viewed from above, the extent of land and sea ice in the far south has not changed as dramatically as in the far north. \nBut the new study found even a small increase in temperature has been enough to cause a loss of five metres every year from the bottom edge of the ice sheet, some of which is more than 2km underwater.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is that Antarctica is being melted away at its base. We can\u2019t see it, because it\u2019s happening below the sea surface,\u201d said Professor Andrew Shepherd, one of the authors of the paper. \u201cThe changes mean that very soon the sea-level contribution from Antarctica could outstrip that from Greenland.\u201d\nThe study measures the Antarctic\u2019s \u201cgrounding line\u201d \u2013 the bottommost edge of the ice sheet across 16,000km of coastline. This is done by using elevation data from the European Space Agency\u2019s CryoSat-2 and applying Archimedes\u2019s principle of buoyancy, which relates the thickness of floating ice to the height of its surface.\nThe greatest declines were seen in west Antarctica. At eight of the ice sheet\u2019s 65 biggest glaciers, the speed of retreat was more than five times the rate of deglaciation since the last ice age. Even in east Antarctica, where some scientists \u2013 and many climate deniers \u2013 had previously believed ice might be increasing based on surface area, glaciers were at best stable and at worst in retreat when underwater ice was taken into account.\n\u201cIt should give people more cause for concern,\u201d said Shepherd. \u201cNow that we have mapped the whole edge of the ice sheet, it rules out any chance that parts of Antarctica are advancing. We see retreat in more places and stasis elsewhere. The net effect is that the ice sheet overall is retreating. People can\u2019t say \u2018you\u2019ve left a stone unturned\u2019. We\u2019ve looked everywhere now.\u201d\nThe results could prompt an upward revision of sea-level rise projections. 10 years ago, the main driver was Greenland. More recently, the Antarctic\u2019s estimated contribution has been raised by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. But its forecasts were based on measurements from the two main west Antarctic glaciers \u2013 Thwaites and Pine Island \u2013 a sample that provides an overly narrow and conservative view of what is happening when compared with the new research.\nThe study\u2019s lead author, Hannes Konrad, said there was now clear evidence that the underwater glacial retreat is happening across the ice sheet. \n\u201cThis retreat has had a huge impact on inland glaciers,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause releasing them from the sea bed removes friction, causing them to speed up and contribute to global sea level rise.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/glaciers", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/antarctica"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The base of the ice around the south pole shrank by 1,463 square kilometres between 2010 and 2016", "date_published": {"$date": 1522685889000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1522702824000}, "authors": ["Jonathan Watts"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Polar regions", "Climate change", "Glaciers", "Environment", "Climate change", "Science", "Antarctica", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/02/underwater-melting-of-antarctic-ice-far-greater-than-thought-study-finds", "og:description": "The base of the ice around the south pole shrank by 1,463 square kilometres between 2010 and 2016", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a77c349ba4a6b9bc877c8a101578e13dfc4b5013/0_102_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=7d02346a10e329db0bd02798db916359", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Underwater melting of Antarctic ice far greater than thought, study finds"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a77c349ba4a6b9bc877c8a101578e13dfc4b5013/0_102_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8112a0186d230a9c75f5fad05a532de1", "width": "3000", "height": "1801", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a77c349ba4a6b9bc877c8a101578e13dfc4b5013/0_102_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25103e2bc85f83cad2d1f4586ee1e579", "description": "An Adelie penguin standing on a block of melting ice in East Antarctica.\nPhotograph: Reuters"}}]}]

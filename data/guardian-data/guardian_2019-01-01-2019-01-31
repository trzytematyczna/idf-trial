It\u2019s threatening to the world we know and everything in it. It\u2019s already killing people. This is beyond doubt or argument.\nWe have just years to change course. If we manage it, we could save the world, at least the one we recognise. Realistically, the prognosis at the moment is that we won\u2019t manage to steer the ship around in time.\nSo why have we, as people with everything to lose, not acted sooner?\nWe have a global climate agreement and we know what needs to happen. This is a problem we know how to solve. But we aren\u2019t acting with anywhere close to the urgency fit for the situation. Renewable energy is cheaper than the bad stuff anyway. Australia is a rich country with the means and the smarts to take on big challenges, so why aren\u2019t we doing it? What will it take to get people to respond in a fitting way?\nIt\u2019s not surprising that in response to a problem this huge, this existential, people seek out something they can do, from using a keep cup to being fastidious with the recycling. It makes us feel better, it gives us something tangible to do, it stops us from despairing. But we need to admit that even if every plastic bottle and tin can ever produced was recycled, we\u2019d still be on track for catastrophic climate change. No matter how many plastic straws are declined or ocean plastic turned into shoes, every indication points to our children never knowing coral reefs, the Arctic melting and the seas rising.\nIt is liberalism\u2019s most dangerous lie that an individual\u2019s action can solve problems of this scale.\nSo what should we be doing?\nStop Adani. Do not let that mine go ahead. My baby who has not figured out that a triangle block goes through the triangle hole could probably figure this one out. We need less pollution in order to keep the world\u2019s ecosystems functional. Digging more new coal to burn is bad maths. We cannot let new coalmines happen. Join a local action group, meet your MP, flick some cash to the people working on this full-time, lock yourself to a bulldozer \u2013 this one is really important and there\u2019s a movement set up ready for people to join in and get involved.\nMore important than any one person\u2019s composting is government policy. Shortly after Australia signed the Paris agreement, Queensland relaxed its land-clearing laws, wiping out any reduction in our pollution that we had committed to in front of the world.\nWe have a coal-smooching, wilfully ignorant prime minister and a government refusing to take on any climate leadership because it doesn\u2019t fit in with their ideology. Conservatives began the conservation movement, but this current crop of conservative politicians are trying to keep coal plants like Liddell open that even the coal companies want closed. \nAustralia does not have an energy policy. This is not due to lack of knowledge or understanding. It\u2019s due to lack of leadership and the influence of people who stand to make a buck now and will probably not be alive to see the worst of catastrophic climate change.\nThat\u2019s not something you can reason with. They\u2019re simply not up to the job.\nSo people need to act collectively. The first step is getting involved in this year\u2019s election, when governments are most susceptible to influence. The most important thing we can do is try and influence government decisions. We urgently need to stem the flow of climate pollution into the atmosphere and absorb the pollution already out there on a scale that individuals can\u2019t muster.\nWhen we sort our waste in our homes or remember our reusable shopping bags it\u2019s helpful, but in itself it is not up to the challenge of stopping climate change. If we are going to respond to the problem at the scale and urgency that reality demands, we need to do more. School children going on strike demanding climate action provide a shining example of disruptive, urgent, agenda-setting activism.

(But I am always open to persuasion.) I have taken a rather analytical stance on this.\nWell, I suspect what you say is because the environmental movement grew world wide from movements that sprang up to protect landscape, wildlife and areas of scenic significance from commercial exploitation. Sierra Club etc.So there is a natural synergy between them and labour movements committed to protecting rights of workers from commercial exploitation. Trade unions etc.In both cases it is collective action for collective benefit.\nThen along come post-modernist theories of the identity of the individual where the ills of the world were blamed on social dynamics, (I have studied post-modernism formally). The focus shifted to became about the personal experience of the individual.Don't get me wrong. These theories have done a huge amount to remove discrimination based on identity. And we are the better for it.\nBut, a couple decades ago it went tribal and morfed into a new type of class war built around the tropes of theoretical models. And more recently, like all class warfare, it has been about the exercise of, and disputation of - power. Power between self identifying identityists and those they blame for the ills of society. By the very nature of its focus of the impact on the individual, it has splintered into more and more narrowly defined identities.\nNeoliberalism focuses on the individual. It claims that in maximising the opportunities of the individual, society gains overall. Identityism makes the same claim. That in maximising the rights of the individual, society gains overall. Despite being at loggerheads, identityists and conservatives are both pursuing the cause of the rights of the individual.Neither are fighting for the collective rights of society. Both are battling for the power of groups within society.Both claim personal freedom is paramount above collective social laws where those laws inhibit the behaviour of individuals.\nNow you don't have to be Albert Einstein to see how the aims of the identity movement can and do conflict with the collective aims of the environmental movement which seeks overarching principles and laws for the protection of the environment that inevitably limit the freedom of the individual. (Such as restricted access or commercial activity.)\nEnvironmentalism seeks to limit the power of exploiters of nature.The collective good.Identityism seeks to limit the power of exploiters of minorities.The individual good.So it is not unexpected that they both end up on the left.\nBut, it is an uneasy alliance because of a fundamental dichotomy of purpose.\nWe are witnessing The Australian Greens Party ripping itself apart.And I believe that fundamental dichotomy of purpose is at the heart of its problems.\nOK.

It is beyond urgent, as you say.\nBQSTART\nSchool children going on strike demanding climate action provide a shining example of disruptive, urgent, agenda-setting activism. They acted like their lives depend on it \u2013 we all should.\nBQENDWe really should. And as adults we are responsible for the system which has done this to us. And as responsible adults we\nmust understand the intimate details of the system, to isolate precisely which bits are at fault, and actually fix the flaws, rather than merely paper over them between wars.\nIt is within your power if it is within the bounds of your intent.\n1. As the basis for economy, the Earth is all we have. All wealth must come from it, and ultimately be returned, from your next breath, to a wind farm to a vortex sword in WoW. Digital wealth is still dependent on the physical; requiring land, people and energy.\n2. Land(aka nature), Wealth(what you want/need) and Money(sharing mechanism) are three entirely different categories of \"thing\", as your baby could undoubtedly attest. Capitalism says that they are all forms of capital. This is the source of the distortion, the heist of the millennium, and the huge thorn in Earths paw.\n3. Wages are created by intelligently trained and employed people producing needed goods and services and available in the increased value of work-products, after work is done. The enormous production surplus achieved through division of labour, technology and other productivity multipliers underpin the value of the currency, always worth what you can buy with it.\nCapitalism says wages are drawn from capital. In a barely-efficient world the only limit to production is availability of working citizens. Unemployment is not only unjust, it is also inefficient and completely unnecessary, not a natural human state at all.\nSo where did capitalism come from and why has it destroyed the Earth?\nWhen the above creed was first written down by an unknown journalist in 1879 in then-remote San Francisco, Henry George, in the legendary Progress and Poverty. He sparked a global movement, including catalysing formation of Australian Labour. George was opposed to Marx's uncompromising revolution, preferring a social evolutionary approach, combining the best of individualism and collectivism based on the natural economy of the Earth and human desire/need.\nWhile Marx was left to rearrange his manuscripts and even foment revolution on the outskirts of Europe, Henry George's thesis of a single tax on commercial land value to singularly fund civilisation gravely threatened established global power elites.\nGeorge had set out to discover the true cause of recessions, and why the worst poverty always seemed to accompany the most progress. Succeeding spectacularly, Progress and Poverty promised salvation in this life, not the next, and remains the only published work in history to outsell the Bible, globally, in a single year. Which it did for twenty consecutive years.\nFrom Progress and Poverty chapter 17: \"The Problem Explained\":\nBQSTART\nThree things unite in production: land, labor, and capital. Three parties divide the output: landowner, laborer, and capitalist. If the laborer and capitalist get no more as production increases, it is a necessary inference that the landowner takes the gain. \nThe facts agree with this inference. Neither wages nor interest keep step with material progress. Yet rising rents and land values invariably accompany advancement. Indeed, they are the mark of progress! Increasing rent explains why wages and interest do not increase. The same cause that gives more to the land owner also denies it to the laborer and capitalist. \n..In short, the value of land depends entirely on the power that ownership gives to appropriate the wealth created by labor. Land value always increases at the expense of labor. The reason greater productive power does not increase wages is because it increases the value of land. Rent swallows up the whole gain.\n That is why poverty accompanies progress.\nBQEND\nSo he was stopped. Since they could not refute his arguments, Land Barons, Industrialists and Bankers literally bought entire economics departments to corrupt the language to steal the very value of civilisation itself; Oil magnate John.

Nor do I see our present major political parties denouncing consumerism for what it is: a planetary blight. Climate change is being driven by the consumerism that Capitalists and their governments promote. As a consequence of the harm being done to our planetary home in order to feed the demands of consumerism, I foresee a miserable future for our young as they grow up, one of increasing dearth and want, of ever more frequent, violent conflict for possession or control of ever more scarce natural resources, such as arable land, and water. I foresee the pressure on our own western civilisation reaching breaking point, as entire nations land up on our shores, driven here by the advance of desert and drought in their lands. I foresee the cost of energy rising astronomically, and (so that the rich need suffer no hurt via tax increases), fewer and fewer of us will have access to state, or affordable, healthcare, or state funded old age retirements, or indeed, any sort of material security at all.I foresee tens, then hundreds of thousands of workers rendered forever unemployed, as capitalist corporations turn increasingly to automation to cut production overheads. Only the adoption by the government of a universal living income (ULI) can address the consequences of such an inevitable development. Consumerism has been deeply destructive of our spiritual or inner lives, robbing millions of people of their connection with their spiritual selves, and casting them adrift in an entirely materialist jungle where they fall easy prey to Capitalist predators.\" (My Blog shares my user name appearing on this site).\nPerhaps the UK's Labour party will prove me wrong when I wrote above: \"Nor do I see our present major political parties denouncing consumerism for what it is: a planetary blight.\"Labour's shadow Treasury Secretary, Clive Lewis, said that politicians must persuade consumers to make dramatic lifestyle changes if devastating climate change and mass extinctions are to be averted. From cutting back on red meat to taking fewer flights, the Norwich South MP said the public must face up to \u201creal, stark choices\u201d in the years ahead.\u201cIf you want your children and grandchildren to avoid food shortages, to avoid power shortages, to avoid biological degradation, biodiversity loss \u2013 if you actually want a planet that\u2019s inhabitable \u2013 then we need to make some choices together, now, and some of them are about quite dramatic changes to how we live,\u201d Clive Lewis (the UK's Labour party shadow Treasury Secretary) said in an interview with the Guardian.\nI agree with Clive Lewis: \u201cLeadership and punching above your weight doesn\u2019t necessarily always have to mean gunboat diplomacy and bombing other countries into the stone age. It can actually mean leading by example, and helping other countries.\u201dIf Britain were to lead in radically transforming our consumer based economy, then other countries may within a few years follow.", "recommendation_count": "0", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "124224355", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1546421542000}, "author": "AlexanderGH", "author_id": "4503360", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Some people would be nervous of uncontrolled immigration when sub-Saharan Africa and southern Europe become uninhabitable.", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "124222246", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "124224273", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1546421404000}, "author": "AlexanderGH", "author_id": "4503360", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "It doesn't help that environmentalism is associated with the left, when it should be seen as conservative stewardship.Our only environmental party puts a lot of people off with its focus on gender and migration.", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "124222536", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "124224158", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1546421172000}, "author": "Hemptheworld", "author_id": "18277923", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Only around 90 or so fossil fuel corporations are producing 75% of alk carbon emissions .The public are getting played like a fiddle.", "recommendation_count": "2", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "124224149", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1546421138000}, "author": "drprl", "author_id": "3026692", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nAnd those votes need to be evenly spread across the country - no use having them all piled up in a few constituencies.\nBQEND\nEvenly spread does not work - you come second everywhere.

Now, with a federal election looming, he is gambling his parliamentary majority and political future on them.\nWhen Canadians cast their votes next October, they will do so amid standard electoral issues: jobs, the economy and foreign policy. But in a country largely dependent on resource extraction, a pair of politically fractious additions have risen to the top: carbon taxes and pipelines.\n\u201cThe good news for the prime minister is that when you ask Canadians who they think would make the best prime minister, he still has a comfortable advantage over Conservative leader Andrew Scheer,\u201d said Nik Nanos, a Canadian pollster. \u201cThe bad news is that leading up to the next federal election right now, it\u2019s basically a coin toss between the Liberals and Conservatives.\u201d\nCanadians have shown an increasing concern for the environment, but in a country largely dependent on resource extraction, the results are often messy.\nEarlier in the year, as part of its pan-Canadian climate change strategy, the federal government required all provinces have a minimum level of carbon pricing. For those that fail to do so, the government will implement its own carbon tax, set to begin in July 2019. Already, the levy has fired up Trudeau\u2019s political opponents \u2013 at both the provincial and federal level.\nBut the prime minister had been forced to fend off barbs from critics \u2013 including the left-of-centre New Democratic party and Indigenous communities, that any environmental goodwill he might have earned through his carbon tax has been sullied by the support for \u2013 and subsequent nationalisation of \u2013 an oil pipeline. \u201cThe only true test of a climate change plan, after all, is whether carbon is going up or down,\u201d said the NDP leader, Jagmeet Singh, in a statement about his frustrations with the Trans Mountain Pipeline, which runs from Alberta to the British Columbia coast.\nThe result for Trudeau is a tricky path forward as he heads off attacks that he has done too little on the environment \u2013 or too much.\n\u201cTrudeau has moved from having an environment that was friendly and pliant to one that is more combative and hostile,\u201d said Nanos, pointing to a string of shifts to Conservative \u2013 or right-of-centre \u2013 provincial governments across the country since Trudeau was elected in 2015. Doug Ford, Ontario\u2019s premier, has repeatedly called carbon pricing \u201cthe worst tax ever\u201d and at least five provinces have banded together to fight the tax in the courts, a battle legal experts believe they will lose.\nAlong with their provincial counterparts, the federal Conservatives have pledged to repeal any carbon taxes, with Scheer dismissing the policy as an \u201celection gimmick\u201d. This fight comes amid reports that Canada is not on pace to meet its 2030 climate goals.\n\u201cThe opposition or the politicians will convince people that the carbon price is hurting them, even though that\u2019s a lie,\u201d said Mark Jaccard, professor of sustainable energy at Simon Fraser University.\nJaccard, who has also served as a policy analyst, has previously warned respective governments that carbon taxes \u2013 while effective at reducing emissions \u2013 are politically difficult to sell and often not as effective as other policy options. He points out that the biggest emissions reductions in Canada came from the Ontario government\u2019s closure of coal plants. The recent plan to close all of Canada\u2019s coal plants by 2029 will have a far greater impact than a carbon tax \u2013 yet the tax will probably remain at the centre of the discussion.\nThe tax could end up being particularly appealing from an electoral standpoint, said Nelson Wiseman, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto. All proceeds from the levy will be remitted back to households in the form of a cheque, the first of which will arrive in July \u2013 a date Wiseman suspects will be close enough to the election that people will take notice.\nBut Wiseman, who has studied the country\u2019s elections for generations, cautions: \u201cWe\u2019re still a long way off. And things can change on a dime in politics.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/americas", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "October\u2019s parliamentary elections may hinge on the recent pipeline nationalisation and the government\u2019s carbon tax plan", "date_published": {"$date": 1546423212000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1546423328000}, "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "article_section": "World news", "article_tags": ["Canada", "Justin Trudeau", "World news", "Americas", "Climate change", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/02/justin-trudeau-environmental-record-canada-election-year", "og:description": "October\u2019s parliamentary elections may hinge on the recent pipeline nationalisation and the government\u2019s carbon tax plan", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7a23ccd5021b63b990b3540b0b97332474da8b1/0_19_2974_1784/master/2974.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=a7850f020efb8f5bbeac6cc2a03e88d3", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Trudeau's environmental record on the line in Canada election year"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7a23ccd5021b63b990b3540b0b97332474da8b1/0_19_2974_1784/master/2974.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1845ca27aa49f487ac311b3642227920", "width": "2974", "height": "1784", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7a23ccd5021b63b990b3540b0b97332474da8b1/0_19_2974_1784/master/2974.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0935abd7a20e94eeb0d4adf8110b79ec", "description": "The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has been attacked for doing too little on the environment \u2013 and too much.\nPhotograph: Canadian Press/Rex/Shutterstock"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4ff815d8e626529a267d85f9e0f86132c2511f0/0_44_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c886fd788acbd68347099c11c8cc8a23", "width": "3500", "height": "2101", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4ff815d8e626529a267d85f9e0f86132c2511f0/0_44_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=705aa7a8e22402ffa502cdaab2a0c1e7", "description": "Steel pipe for the pipeline construction of Canada\u2019s Trans Mountain expansion project sits on rail cars at a site in Kamloops, British Columbia.

Globally, livestock rearing is estimated to be responsible for about 15% of greenhouse gas emissions.\nLucas has tabled a parliamentary motion to require farming to be net zero in emissions as quickly as possible, which would involve ways to reduce fertiliser use and increase the amount of organic matter in the nation\u2019s soils, both issues that Michael Gove, the environment secretary, also espouses.\nShe said: \u201cWe need to bring the whole food chain into the circle of responsibility, not leaving farmers to work on their own, together with clear signals that society will play its part in funding this transition through a new agriculture policy.\u201d\nBut the notion of Veganuary has come under attack from some at the conference, with the National Sheep Association (NSA) claiming the movement, which encourages people to give up animal products for the month and consider permanent changes to their diet for health and environmental reasons, was part of a \u201ccampaign against livestock farming\u201d.\nPhil Stocker, chief executive of the NSA, defended British sheep farming as working to improve the environment rather than causing damage to it. \u201cOur concern is that our unique, grass-based method of sheep production in Britain is hidden within more global and general statistics,\u201d he said.\nHe contrasted the UK\u2019s sheep farming, which includes many upland areas unsuitable for other forms of agriculture and is one of the least intensive forms of livestock farming, with the megafarms and feedlots that characterise beef, pork and poultry production in many parts of the world, chiefly the US but increasingly being brought to the UK.\n\u201cWe are seeing criticisms from welfare campaigners, rewilders, climate change campaigners and health campaigners \u2013 but all these are connected and ignore the fact that UK sheep farming works very much in harmony with our environment, our landscapes and our human ecology, creating a countryside the majority of the public love and producing a food product that is healthy and nutritious within a balanced diet,\u201d he said.\nStocker said he opposed a meat tax: \u201cThe right meat, consumed sensibly, should be incentivised and not taxed. Sheep production is not damaging to the environment or to health \u2013 sheep mainly eat grass and grass is part of a complex and natural cycling of carbon, with soil storing carbon in organic matter.\n\u201cAny meat tax would be likely to affect all meat production and consumption \u2013 and there are many different forms of meat production. A meat tax would end up putting further pressure on primary producers \u2013 in the case of sheep this would impact on the profitability of many small family farms, yet these are highly desirable and deliver a host of economic, social and environmental goods.\u201d\nEarlier Gove told the conference that advances in synthetic biology meant that in the future we would be able to create traditional farming products such as meat, milk or eggs in laboratories, adding that \u201cthe potential for Britain to lead in this revolution is huge\u201d.\nBut asked whether the UK should be looking into increasing its production of \u201cfake meat\u201d, the National Farmers Union president, Minette Batters, said: \u201cWhen you have one of the very few areas in the world where you have the right climate for producing food, that surely is what you should be doing.\u201d\nShe added that \u201c95% of what we eat is produced in soil, it\u2019s nutrient dense and that is why it is such a valuable food.

The resulting images reveal a stark depiction of how climate change has taken its toll on the glaciated landscape.\nFor a forthcoming exhibition on Ruskin and Turner, Emma Stibbon was commissioned to go to Chamonix and record the glaciers around Mont Blanc where, in the early 1800s, Turner painted sublime watercolours that inspired Ruskin to embark on his Alpine tours decades later, photographing and drawing awe-inspiring glaciers such as the Mer de Glace.\nIn June, the same month in which Ruskin produced his daguerreotypes (early photographs) of the Mer de Glace more than 160 years ago, Stibbon found his viewpoint for her own images, using another early photographic process, cyanotype. While Turner and Ruskin observed the drama of a sea of ice almost at the level they stood, Stibbon looked down into an exposed deep valley with \u201ca dark moraine-covered floor, almost completely devoid of ice\u201d. She saID: \u201cIt\u2019s unrecognisable.\u201d\nHer commission forms part of the Ruskin, Turner &amp; the Storm Cloud, exhibition opening at the York Art Gallery in March and Abbot Hall, Kendal, in July. It is part of a worldwide programme of exhibitions, conferences and publications to mark the 200th birthday of Ruskin, a writer, artist and social reformer whose achievements are sometimes eclipsed by scandals, including his ill-fated, unconsummated marriage to Effie Gray and a libel action brought by painter James McNeill Whistler. \u201cWhen we think of the Alps,\u201d said Stibbon, \u201cwe think of iconic white peaks. By the end of this century, there probably won\u2019t be any snow.\u201d\nShe added that Ruskin was ahead of his time in realising \u201cthe Industrial Revolution was affecting air quality and that air pollution was linked to the use of coal. He could see that glaciers move and I think he suspected that there was some [ice] recession, which would have been starting around that period in the 1850s.\u201d\nSuzanne Fagence Cooper, research curator at York Art Gallery and author of a new book, To See Clearly: Why Ruskin Matters, said Stibbon\u2019s images show the glacier retreat \u201cvery clearly\u201d, and capture a \u201csense of real loss\u201d.\nWhile Ruskin events extend to Japan and America, in the UK there is a cinema screening, from 22 February, of Effie Gray \u2013 the 2014 film written by Emma Thompson \u2013 and the exhibition, John Ruskin: The Power of Seeing, from 26 January at Two Temple Place, London. It features more than 190 exhibits revealing how Ruskin\u2019s influence is still felt.\nRobert Hewison, author of the recently published Ruskin and His Contemporaries, said: \u201cRuskin was, by the end of his life, treated as a kind of prophet \u2013 although not in his own country \u2013 for predicting both economic and ecological deterioration.

She has contributed to more than 125 scientific papers and won numerous prizes for her science communication work. In 2018 she was a contributor to the US National Climate Assessment and was awarded the Stephen H Schneider award for outstanding climate science communication.\nIn 2018, we have seen forest fires in the Arctic circle; record high temperatures in parts of Australia, Africa and the US; floods in India; and devastating droughts in South Africa and Argentina. Is this a turning point? This year has hit home how climate change loads the dice against us by taking naturally occurring weather events and amplifying them. We now have attribution studies that show how much more likely or stronger extreme weather events have become as a result of human emissions. For example, wildfires in the western US now burn nearly twice the area they would without climate change, and almost 40% more rain fell during Hurricane Harvey than would have otherwise. So we are really feeling the impacts and know how much humanity is responsible.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its 1.5C report in October. A month later, the US federal government\u2019s climate assessment \u2013 to which you contributed \u2013 came out. How did these two massive studies move our understanding along? These assessments are important because there is a Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cat element to studying climate impacts. The act of observing affects the outcome. If people aren\u2019t aware of what is happening, why would anyone change? Assessments like these provide us with a vision of the future if we continue on our current pathway, and by doing so they address the most widespread and dangerous myth that the largest number of us have bought into: not that the science isn\u2019t real, but rather that climate change doesn\u2019t matter to me personally.\nCompared to past studies, how much media attention did these reports receive?There was significant coverage but a lot of media survive by generating controversy so they bring on opposing voices rather than explaining the scientific facts. Climate change shouldn\u2019t be fodder for commentators who represent the interests of the fossil fuel industry by muddying the science. As a human and a scientist, this focus on controversy is frustrating. A thermometer is not liberal or conservative.\nFossil fuels have brought us many benefits ... but the solution to our current crisis is to stop using them. That is scary\nAre there any signs that public opinion is shifting in the US and elsewhere? We haven\u2019t yet reached the tipping point to motivate sufficient action. But there has been a change. Ten years ago, few people felt personally affected by climate change. It seemed very distant. Today, most people can point to a specific way climate affects their daily lives. This is important because the three key steps to action are accepting that climate change is real, recognising it affects us, and being motivated to do something to fix it. Opinion polls in the US show 70% of people agree the climate is changing, but a majority still say it won\u2019t affect them.\nTrump was dismissive of these reports and has repeatedly tried to deny any link between climate change and extreme weather. What are the politics behind this denial? It\u2019s a vicious cycle. The more doom-filled reports the scientists release, the stronger the pushback from politicians whose power, ideology and funding depends on maintaining the status quo, and who are supported by those who fear the solutions to climate change more than they fear its impacts. Opposition to climate change is a symptom of a society that is politically polarised between those who cling to the past and those who recognise the need for a better future. Fossil fuels have brought us many benefits \u2013 and I\u2019m grateful for their contribution to my life \u2013 but the solution to our current crisis is to stop using them. That change can be scary, especially for those with most to lose financially from this shift. If you feel threatened, the instinctive reaction is to push back.\nProgress of sorts was made at the UN climate talks in Poland, though many scientists say global society is not moving fast enough. What is your take? Progress was made in Poland as the world agreed on a rule book to implement the Paris agreement. The agreement is like a global pot luck in which every nation brings something different to the party. For some it\u2019s soil conservation, for another wind power or carbon pricing. Poland gave us an agreed common standard on how to measure these contributions. That was progress. As scientists, we are like physicians for the planet who have been monitoring its rising fever for 80 years. We know that our lifestyle, specifically our dependence on fossil fuels is the cause of a problem that is rapidly becoming serious and in some cases even dangerous. So when we see the world dragging its heels and carbon emissions continuing to grow, we become concerned, anxious, and even frustrated. We know we aren\u2019t changing fast enough.\nOn current trends, if you had to give a percentage breakdown of the likelihood of the following three outcomes by 2100, what would you give: a) keeping to 1.5C; b) keeping to 2C; c) rising above 3C; and d) overshooting 4C?I\u2019d put my money on a gradual bend away from a higher scenario, which is where we are now, until accumulating and worsening climate disasters eventually lead to a collective \u201coh shit!\u201d moment, when people finally realise climate impacts do pose a far greater threat than the solutions. At that point, I would hope the world would suddenly ramp up its carbon reduction to the scale of a Manhattan Project or a moon race and we would finally be able to make serious progress. The multitrillion-dollar question is simply when that tipping point in opinion will come, and whether it will be too late for civilisation as we know it. I hope with all my heart that we stay under 1.5C, but my cynical brain says 3C. Perhaps the reality will be somewhere between my head and my heart at 2C.\nWhat is the best way out of the climate crisis? What policies would make a difference? The most important thing is to accelerate the realisation that we have to act. This means connecting the dots to show that the impacts are not distant any more: they are here and they affect our lives. It also means talking about solutions. The technology and knowledge are there. The economics already make sense. In Texas, where I live, the biggest military base, Fort Hood, switched last year to renewables because they were cheaper than natural gas. And finally, it means weaning ourselves off fossil fuels, which is challenged by the fact that the majority of the world\u2019s richest companies have made their money from the fossil fuel economy \u2013 so the majority of the wealth and power remains in their hands. \nAre there any climate engineering schemes or trials that have potential? One solution being discussed is the idea of deliberately geoengineering the planet to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and/or cool the planet. I believe it is important to discuss and study these technologies very thoroughly, because implementing some of them, like solar radiation management [spraying particles into the air to simulate a volcanic eruption and block some of the sunlight reaching Earth], is extremely risky. It would be like giving an experimental drug to every human on the planet before it had been tested. I\u2019m more hopeful about smaller scale, less risky geoengineering projects that suck carbon dioxide out of the air, such as those being trialled by Climeworks to turn carbon into stone or fuel: or even massive tree-planting efforts, as in Bhutan. \nWhat\u2019s the role of global finance? Can money managers, shareholders and multinationals exert pressure and take positive action in ways that short-termist, vote-hungry politicians seem unable to do? Yes! In the world we live in, money speaks loudly. Thanks to the growing divestment movement, we have seen cities, universities and entire countries, in the case of Ireland, withdrawing investments from fossil fuel assets. This isn\u2019t only happening for ethical reasons but for practical ones as well. As clean energy continues to expand, those assets could become stranded. When money talks the world listens.\nWhat are the most positive developments you have seen in the past year in the climate field? I\u2019m asked what gives me hope on a daily basis, and my answer is, I don\u2019t find hope in my science, I find it in people. Over the last few years, the number of people who want to talk about and do something about climate has increased exponentially. Then, there is the unexpected leadership of organisations such as Young Evangelicals for Climate Action, RepublicEN, the Iron and Earth group \u2013 young professionals in the oil and construction industries who want to be part of the move from fossil fuels; and the take-up of renewables even in conservative states like Texas, which now gets 20% of its energy from wind and solar power.\nFinally, there\u2019s the encouraging news such as solar being the fastest-growing power source around the world, clean energy jobs growing from India to the US, and new technology being developed every year that drops the price and increases the accessibility of fossil fuel alternatives.\nThis year has also seen the rise of disruptive campaigning, for example Extinction Rebellion in the UK; the student strikes led by Greta Thunberg; and direct action in the US and Canada against oil pipelines. Is there a point when scientists also have to speak out more forcefully? We are moving in that direction. Scientists are not just disembodied brains floating in a glass jar, we are humans who want the same thing every other human wants, a safe place to live on this planet we call home. So while our work must continue to be unbiased and objective, increasingly we are raising our voices, adding to the clear message that climate change is real and humans are responsible, the impacts are serious and we must act now, if we want to avoid the worst of them. \n\nWhat are the key political moments in 2019 for climate policy in the US and the world? International talks are important but we should be looking at subnational actors because there is a lot going on at the city and corporate level. Across the US a hundred cities have committed to going 100% clean energy. Companies like Apple have already achieved that goal. In the US there\u2019s a new climate bill with bipartisan sponsors, which is essential for legislation to succeed long-term. \nAre we likely to get any respite from climate change? (Sighs.) Climate change is a long-term trend superimposed over natural variability. There\u2019ll be good and bad years, just like there are for a patient with a long-term illness, but it isn\u2019t going away. To stabilise climate change, we have to eliminate our carbon emissions. And we\u2019re still a long way away from that.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/natural-disasters", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/solarpower", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/geoengineering", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The award-winning atmospheric scientist on the urgency of the climate crisis and why people are her biggest hope", "date_published": {"$date": 1546758006000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1546775327000}, "authors": ["Jonathan Watts"], "article_section": "Science", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Science", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "World news", "Solar power", "Renewable energy", "Energy", "Geoengineering", "Climate change", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/06/katharine-hayhoe-interview-climate-change-scientist-crisis-hope", "og:description": "The award-winning atmospheric scientist on the urgency of the climate crisis and why people are her biggest hope", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/106a4c5513099a9d357810d3494de5255bf0dbee/0_59_7793_4676/master/7793.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=ffa7bb87836834df6a990dcca09e28ff", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Katharine Hayhoe: 'A thermometer is not liberal or conservative'"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/106a4c5513099a9d357810d3494de5255bf0dbee/0_59_7793_4676/master/7793.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3fbc73aefafac4ea9e57855e1065177a", "width": "7793", "height": "4676", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/106a4c5513099a9d357810d3494de5255bf0dbee/0_59_7793_4676/master/7793.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=038e057b5335417f1a823dc749905f84", "description": "Katharine Hayhoe: \u2018Fear is a short-term spur to action, but to make changes over the long term, we must have hope.\u2019\nPhotograph: Randal Ford"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dc58e4e3cc63b2546690ec3ff2eae6c932899b2/0_173_5183_3109/master/5183.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b5b08e179ce21ae30ff65371524b0e33", "width": "5183", "height": "3109", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dc58e4e3cc63b2546690ec3ff2eae6c932899b2/0_173_5183_3109/master/5183.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2a69fe13d70b9c893e004af48ca24071", "description": "Extinction Rebellion marching with other groups through London in December last year.

Furthermore, green house gas emissions from power generation are less than 1/4 of human emissions. \nWhile progress is being made in use of renewables in power generation, much less progress is being made on the non-electricity emissions, that require societal solutions: public transport, strict building codes to diminish energy use in buildings, urban planning to reduce the number and length of motorised trips, etc. Nor is their much progress on non CO2 emissions, notably methane emissions from agriculture and from fossil fuel extraction.", "recommendation_count": "5", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "124318417", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1546770615000}, "author": "ScotEnvironmentalist", "author_id": "100775499", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\"This is counter productive - as all it does is piss off the ordinary people\"\nPissing off \"ordinary people\" has always been a factor in making change happen and will always be in the future.

The vast amount of energy being added to the oceans drives sea-level rise and enables hurricanes and typhoons to become more intense.\nMuch of the heat has been stored in the ocean depths but measurements here only began in recent decades and existing estimates of the total heat the oceans have absorbed stretch back only to about 1950. The new work extends that back to 1871. Scientists have said that understanding past changes in ocean heat was critical for predicting the future impact of climate change.\nA Guardian calculation found the average heating across that 150-year period was equivalent to about 1.5 Hiroshima-size atomic bombs per second. But the heating has accelerated over that time as carbon emissions have risen, and was now the equivalent of between three and six atomic bombs per second.\n\u201cI try not to make this type of calculation, simply because I find it worrisome,\u201d said Prof Laure Zanna, at the University of Oxford, who led the new research. \u201cWe usually try to compare the heating to [human] energy use, to make it less scary.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cBut obviously, we are putting a lot of excess energy into the climate system and a lot of that ends up in the ocean,. There is no doubt.\u201d The total heat taken up by the oceans over the past 150 years was about 1,000 times the annual energy use of the entire global population.\nThe research has been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and combined measurements of the surface temperature of the ocean since 1871 with computer models of ocean circulation.\nProf Samar Khatiwala, also at the University of Oxford and part of the team, said: \u201cOur approach is akin to \u2018painting\u2019 different bits of the ocean surface with dyes of different colours and monitoring how they spread into the interior over time. If we know what the sea surface temperature anomaly was in 1871 in the North Atlantic Ocean we can figure out how much it contributes to the warming in, say, the deep Indian Ocean in 2018.\u201d\nRising sea level has been among the most dangerous long-term impacts of climate change, threatening billions of people living in coastal cities, and estimating future rises is vital in preparing defences. Some of the rise comes from the melting of land-bound ice in Greenland and elsewhere, but another major factor has been the physical expansion of water as it gets warmer.\nHowever, the seas do not warm uniformly as ocean currents transport heat around the world. Reconstructing the amount of heat absorbed by the oceans over the past 150 years is important as it provides a baseline. In the Atlantic, for example, the team found that half the rise seen since 1971 at low and middle latitudes resulted from heat transported into the region by currents.\nThe new work would help researchers make better predictions of sea-level rise for different regions in the future. \u201cFuture changes in ocean transport could have severe consequences for regional sea-level rise and the risk of coastal flooding,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cUnderstanding ocean heat change and the role of circulation in shaping the patterns of warming remain key to predicting global and regional climate change and sea-level rise.\u201d\nDana Nuccitelli, an environmental scientist who was not involved in the new research, said: \u201cThe ocean heating rate has increased as global warming has accelerated, and the value is somewhere between roughly three to six Hiroshima bombs per second in recent decades, depending on which dataset and which timeframe is used. This new study estimates the ocean heating rate at about three Hiroshima bombs per second for the period of 1990 to 2015, which is on the low end of other estimates.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/sea-level", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Seas absorb 90% of climate change\u2019s energy as new research reveals vast heating over past 150 years", "date_published": {"$date": 1546891222000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1546941985000}, "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Oceans", "Sea level", "Climate change", "Science"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/07/global-warming-of-oceans-equivalent-to-an-atomic-bomb-per-second", "og:description": "Seas absorb 90% of climate change\u2019s energy as new research reveals vast heating over past 150 years", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa8509fe918ab482582b8a5c1862b7b1ad4da373/92_0_3272_1964/master/3272.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=740514acb4302ad07d3ed3591405963e", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Global warming of oceans equivalent to an atomic bomb per second"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa8509fe918ab482582b8a5c1862b7b1ad4da373/92_0_3272_1964/master/3272.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a0782622827c79dbd3e96bd6f07d7503", "width": "3272", "height": "1964", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa8509fe918ab482582b8a5c1862b7b1ad4da373/92_0_3272_1964/master/3272.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d206c09fdcf0948ff2db4c2771199657", "description": "An Argo float is deployed into the ocean.\nPhotograph: CSIRO"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07a45a2c3613145ed8cee"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/09/republicans-climate-change-conservatives-environmentalists-arkansas", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "I first read about Bald Knob, Arkansas, in 2010, after thousands of poisoned blackbirds dropped dead from the sky in nearby Beebe. On first look, Bald Knob has an unsettling aesthetic: a sparsely populated town, a bygone agricultural zone with toppled silos, old trailers, taxidermy businesses, boarded-up shops and a Waffle House. It\u2019s a narrative cliche to present a rural place below the Mason-Dixon line this way, yet the scenery fits the bill.\nI\u2019ve lived in places like these, where a casual observer sees a weathered town and locals just see home. I proceed with caution anyway. I\u2019m also unsettled by news reports of armed white nationalists marching at the capitol building in nearby Little Rock. I know this is how a lot of people experience the rural south \u2013 sorting through stereotypes and history as they go, wondering how much of the old south is present in the new.\nThe 12,900-acre Bald Knob Refuge, which sits about 60 miles north-east of Little Rock, is a blend of both the old and new south. It\u2019s a former rice farm that has grown rice and soybeans in order to provide much-needed habitat and fuel for migratory waterfowl like pintail ducks and snow geese since 1993.\nA half-mile into the refuge, the truck ahead of me spooks an unfathomable cloud of waterfowl. Hundreds of thousands of ducks rise from the wetlands, calling and circling. It\u2019s breathtaking to witness. Later, a huge flock of lesser snow geese passes above me. My heart pounds; it\u2019s moving to hear so many wingbeats overhead, to see the formations of a thousand white birds in the blue sky.\nAnother truck comes by. The man rolls down his truck window and asks, \u201cYou OK?\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d I tell him, climbing down from the roof of my rental car, and showing him my camera. \u201cWatching birds. You?\u201d I ask even though I can see his rifle in the back.\n\u201cOut scouting hunting spots,\u201d he says, flashing a charming smile. \u201cYou can get a better view if you take the road \u2019round that way.\u201d He points me toward a new route, then takes off.\nThe relationship between hunters and conservation has always surprised me. Yet it\u2019s often imperative to the success of major initiatives in the south, thanks to the influence of the not-for-profit organization Ducks Unlimited, which has a worldwide membership of 700,000 and has helped conserve over 13m acres of habitat. There are more than 34 million sportsmen and women in the United States.\nSportsmen and traditional environmentalists aren\u2019t always mutually exclusive, or easy co-conspirators. But, there is a critical need for information to flow between those on the ground and those in policy. In order to address the urgent realities of climate change, traditional environmentalists must continue to find ways to communicate and partner with non-traditional audiences: hunters, big agriculture, fishermen, corporations and loggers.\nI wanted to talk to people in the south who already work on these frontlines, and are able to build bridges between seemingly disparate audiences.\nCharlie Phillips, clammer and entrepreneur, is one of those men who\u2019s lived several lives, as a fishmonger, horse trader and shrimper.\n\u201cI\u2019m one of those rare Republicans that believe that if you don\u2019t take care of your environment, your environment can\u2019t take care of you,\u201d he says. Phillips, the owner of Sapelo Sea Farms in Georgia, makes his living growing clams, so water quality is crucial to him, which is why he serves on boards and tries to help scientists and fishermen find common ground.\nHe\u2019s frank about climate change and how it\u2019s affecting his industry. He talks about the onset of \u201cking tides\u201d, and fish stock moving north as waters warm. He was working on the back of a shrimp boat in 1968 when Hurricane Camille hit. \u201cI saw the big ships washed up on shore,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what big hurricanes can do. They\u2019re worse now. Things aren\u2019t what they used to be.\u201d\n\u201cListen,\u201d he says. \u201cFishermen just want to be able to catch what they want to catch and be left alone.\u201d\nHe says working fishermen end up not trusting scientists because the scientific reports don\u2019t match up with what they witness firsthand on the water every day. Reports from scientists, he says, \u201cfeel three or four years behind what the fishermen see\u201d. He thinks it\u2019s crucial for fishermen and scientists to interact and learn more from each other. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten really good at throwing rocks at each other,\u201d he tells me. \u201cBut we need to give up on throwing rocks. It\u2019s not conducive to fixing problems.\u201d\nPhillips is focused on what he cares most about: water. He\u2019s evangelical about it. \u201cIt affects everything,\u201d he says. \u201cWildlife, business, eco-tourism.\u201d He bought his father\u2019s restaurant, the Fish Dock, and uses the menus to educate customers about local water testing results. \u201cI took poetic license,\u201d he tells me, laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t use the word \u2018fecal\u2019, just \u2018water quality\u2019.\u201d\nThe following day I talk with Dr Zakiya Leggett, a forester and professor at North Carolina State University whose research focuses on carbon sequestration and soil ecology. She talks about her empathy for freshmen, many of whom tell her at the beginning of her class through a pre-course survey that they don\u2019t believe in climate change. They tell her she shouldn\u2019t try to change their minds.\n\u201cWe have to remember,\u201d she says, her tone compassionate, \u201cespecially if these students are coming fresh from home, that they haven\u2019t had time to form their own opinions.\u201d She adds, \u201cMaybe I can\u2019t impress my \u2018opinions,\u2019 but I will give them the facts, like graphs of temperatures rising.\u201d\nLeggett estimates that half of her students are coming from a rural environment. Born in Memphis, she recalls the difficult time she had adjusting when she went from the Tuskegee University to Duke University. She remembers struggling with elitism herself.\nNow she mentors students through this vulnerable transition, and is able to forge connections with first-generation college students and conservative students, as well as students of color \u2013 all groups who might otherwise struggle to join conversations about the scientific realities of climate change.\nDr Todd Merendino, the manager of conservation programs in the Ducks Unlimited Texas field office, negotiates strategic partnerships with wildlife state agencies, agricultural producers, hunters, biologists, private landowners, petrochemical companies and the oil industry. A hunter and fisherman, he has a practical, outcomes-focused approach to his work.\n\u201cOur mission is waterfowl and habitats,\u201d he says. \u201cI look for symbiotic relationships. Common ground. Common goals.\u201d\nHe speaks with corporations about responsible growth and convinces them that \u201cwetlands and marshes are your insurance policy against flooding\u201d. He ticks off the nature of their conversations: flood storage capacity, coastal restoration projects, storm surge abatement, initiatives that keep the marsh healthy.\nDucks Unlimited recently completed a beneficial dredge use project near Port Arthur, Texas, which will move 2m cubic yards of dredge material to restore approximately 1,300 acres of the Salt Bayou Marsh watershed, an important migratory bird flyway recently degraded by hurricane damage. It\u2019s generally more expensive to utilize dredge material in this manner, he says, but smarter to move it to a place where it serves a purpose.\nMerendino\u2019s work has large-scale outcomes, and with that objective in mind he welcomes chances to partner with corporations and big agriculture. \u201cIf the rice industry went away,\u201d he points out, \u201cthe amount of waterfowl habitat loss would be insurmountable, impossible to overcome.\u201d\nAfter seeing the beauty and importance of the Bald Knob Refuge, the scale, necessity and complexity of this work impresses me.\nIt\u2019s easy to be an armchair activist in 2019, or make condescending online comments about the state of climate change activism in the south. But it\u2019s much more difficult to swim against the ideological current, or to operate between two exasperating worlds in a hands-on way, in search of real impact.\nThere is certainly more opportunity for cooperation and partnership, and places where more traditional environmentalists like me could find common ground with a hunter in Arkansas or a fisherman in Georgia, so that we could, quite frankly, save what we both love.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/birds", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arkansas", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Progressives should think twice about who their allies are.

I was a few days into a rafting trip through Cataract Canyon with a bunch of young climate activists, and one of them, Will Munger, was telling me that since his months at the Standing Rock resistance camp, he had been encountering young Native people whose experiences at the protest site had encouraged them to dream of new possibilities and take actions that might otherwise have seemed out of reach.\nWandering back and forth along the edge of the water, we began to discuss how, often, the consequences of an uprising or a movement are not linear. Success and failure are often premature measures and oversimplifications; actions, interventions and conversations change beliefs and create new values, alliances and possibilities. We\u2019d seen this dynamic from many unanticipated uprisings and movements: the indigenous movement Idle No More, which began in Canada in 2012; Black Lives Matter; the feminist insurgencies since 2013 and the anti-gun movement in the hands of the Parkland youth.\nOn a cold day this January, I was thinking again about that conversation as I contemplated Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s decision to run for office. \u201cI first started considering running for Congress, actually, at Standing Rock in North Dakota,\u201d she said late last year. \u201cIt was really from that crucible of activism where I saw people putting their lives on the line \u2026 for people they\u2019ve never met and never known. When I saw that, I knew that I had to do something more.\u201d\nIn 2016, when LaDonna Brave Bull Allard and others launched the camps protesting the Dakota Access pipeline, they could not have known some of the indirect consequences of their actions \u2013 including prompting a young woman from New York City to run for office. Sometimes the results that matter are not direct or intended \u2013 though four tribes continue to litigate over the pipeline, and they had a modest court victory on 8 January.\nToday, Ocasio-Cortez represents New York\u2019s 14th district in Congress, and 45 congresspeople support the Green New Deal that she began promoting last fall. Significantly, the Green New Deal is not Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s creation. As Standing Rock prompted her to run for office, the Sunrise Movement created the climate vision she carried into Congress. Founded in 2017, Sunrise is a youth-led movement that aims to \u201cto stop climate change and create millions of good jobs in the process\u201d. As the movement\u2019s co-founder Varshini Prakash recently told the Huffington Post, Sunrise is trying to \u201cactivate the millions of Americans who are ready to fight for a Green New Deal but haven\u2019t heard of it yet\u201d. For me, the movement\u2019s sudden appearance in national politics this year was even more surprising and thrilling than Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s primary victory.\nThe Green New Deal is a much-needed response to what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and American scientists told us last fall: we probably have 12 years to transform the energy economy globally, or else. The proposal makes its mark by setting new goals for the nation and by reminding us that climate and jobs, ecology and economies don\u2019t have to be opposed, while recent polls tell the congressional leadership that the majority of Americans want swift and radical action on climate.\nGetting there requires understanding that the process may not be straightforward. Unsurprisingly, the Green New Deal was not immediately adopted by the Democratic leadership, and if you were to tell the story thus far in the terms that we\u2019ve learned from action movies and sports, it\u2019s a conflict that already has a conclusion: as the news site Politico put it: \u201cSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi 2, Ocasio-Cortez 0.\u201d\nBut, like the Standing Rock uprising, the work of the Sunshine Movement and Ocasio-Cortez will generate other benefits and consequences; if we are going to get to the goal it will, of course, be by a more circuitous route \u2013 though it must be a speedy one. Last Wednesday, Congressmen Jimmy Gomez and Ted Lieu of California introduced a bill, the Climate Solutions Act of 2019, with similar goals \u2013 or reintroduced it, since Lieu (who\u2019s also supporting the Green New Deal) has introduced a bill by that name twice before.\nYou could not possibly catalyze a movement in the Dakotas with the intention that a woman would run for Congress in New York City and then go to the Capitol to advocate on climate. You could not assume, imagine or calculate that that would be a consequence. But you can recognize how common such indirect consequences are, and how important it is to not discount them. The course of history is full of confluences and meanders, oxbows, watersheds, dams and floods, tributaries and distributaries.\nCataract Canyon is where the Colorado river pours into the reservoir of stagnant water backed up from Glen Canyon dam. When Glen Canyon dam was completed, a little more than 50 years ago, most people \u2013 whether they loved or hated this massive intervention in the wilderness \u2013 imagined that the reservoir would stand for centuries. But the dam is failing, thanks to overallocation of the river\u2019s water and to the way climate change has reduced rainfall and snowfall in its watershed.\nAt the end of my journey with Will and the other climate activists, I saw over and over how the river was cutting new channels through the silt that had built up when the reservoir was higher; how what was stagnant was now active again. This was never supposed to happen, or it was supposed to happen hundreds of years hence.\n\u201cLet us never, ever, ever give up,\u201d tweeted Ocasio-Cortez the day after her swearing-in, adding: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t long ago that we felt our lives were over; that there were only so many do-overs until it was too late, or too much to take \u2026 I honestly thought as a 28-year-old waitress I was too late; that the train of my fulfilled potential had left the station.\u201d Climate change tells is there is no time to waste. But history tells us that social change works in indirect and unpredictable ways, and that it\u2019s worth pressing on for what you believe in.\n\u2022 Rebecca Solnit is a Guadian US columnist and the author of Men Explain Things to Me and The Mother of All Questions", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/protest", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Press on for what you believe in \u2013 climate activism can have unforeseen results, says Rebecca Solnit, author of Call Them By Their True Names", "date_published": {"$date": 1547468179000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1547565899000}, "authors": ["Rebecca Solnit"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez", "US politics", "US news", "Protest", "Environment", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/14/standing-rock-ocasio-cortez-protest-climate-activism", "og:description": "Press on for what you believe in \u2013 climate activism can have unforeseen results, says Rebecca Solnit, author of Call Them By Their True Names", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7029cb8fe8a285e9a3b143e574c300fa91c34ae9/0_207_3100_1860/master/3100.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=8e49c61c2553f360aedd86087bd10d59", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Standing Rock inspired Ocasio-Cortez to run.

They include rules on how allocations will be made, when irrigators must cease pumping in low flows, pump sizes permitted, and rules for shepherding environmental flows down the river.\nBut NSW has failed to submit even first drafts of 12 of of its 20 required plans, including those for major rivers such as the Barwon Darling, the Lower Darling, the Namoi and the Murrumbidgee.\nInstead, NSW is operating its rivers under old plans, which have not been accredited.\nIn particular, the 2012 Barwon Darling water-sharing plan has come in for heavy criticism because it allows irrigators to pump during low and medium flows.\nThe revelations of NSW\u2019s slow progress come as as low river flows, hot weather and algal blooms in several rivers have caused massive fish kills.\nThe NSW minister for primary industries, Niall Blair, denied on Tuesday there was a problem of over-allocation in NSW, saying that the primary cause of falling dam levels and low flows was the drought.\n\u201cWe have water-sharing plans and we are developing and submitting our water resource plans for all across New South Wales to be signed off by Canberra,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a debate about over-allocation.\n\u201cThis is a drought. For people to jump on the bandwagon now and point the finger at farmers and tell them they are responsible for this \u2013 go and look at the records.\nBut the water-sharing plans Blair was referring to are incomplete and NSW lagging is far behind other states.\nThe MDBA said 12 of NSW\u2019s were only at the \u201cpreliminary phase\u201d in which NSW outlines its approach to the MDBA. The MDBA rated its level of confidence of NSW meeting the deadline at 30% or less.\n\u201cThe MDBA remains concerned about the large volume of work that needs to be completed,\u201d the report said. \u201cAt this stage MDBA considers that eight of the 20 NSW WRPs are on track for accreditation by mid-2019.\nWhile the authority said NSW was co-operating, it said the state still needed to resolve a number of complex policy implementation issues to enable the accreditation of its plans.\nThese included floodplain harvesting, water accounting issues and the protection of environmental water in the northern NSW catchments.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/rivers", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/farming", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change"], "share_count": "0", "description": "NSW under pressure over whether rivers over-allocated following Darling River fish kill", "date_published": {"$date": 1547571622000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1547617153000}, "authors": ["Anne Davies"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Murray-Darling Basin", "Environment", "Rivers", "Farming", "New South Wales", "New South Wales politics", "Climate change", "Australia news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/16/damning-murray-darling-report-says-nsw-well-behind-on-water-sharing-plans", "og:description": "NSW under pressure over whether rivers over-allocated following Darling River fish kill", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c59b27b02d89abf277a625af87d523ccbeb301b/0_337_3992_2395/master/3992.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=21b844255ee194b351f92e51ec9c8edd", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Damning Murray-Darling report says NSW 'well behind' on water-sharing plans"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "N", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c59b27b02d89abf277a625af87d523ccbeb301b/0_337_3992_2395/master/3992.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eb0ec887f0f9da1c5f27f0c18e536ddd", "width": "3992", "height": "2395", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c59b27b02d89abf277a625af87d523ccbeb301b/0_337_3992_2395/master/3992.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=993367bea84a26713144846f3ee51aa0", "description": "A Murray-Darling Basin Authority report says NSW is \u2018unlikely to meet agreed timeframes\u2019 for its water-sharing plans.\nPhotograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian"}}], "comments": [{"id": "124699634", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1547602724000}, "author": "orangefox", "author_id": "13007499", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "I used to think it best to buy Australian grown rice.

Maps of the ocean floor are less detailed than those of Mars or the moon. Marine biologists have discovered deeply weird and genuinely wonderful species: boxer crabs wielding anemones like weapons; the rope-like Praya dubia, up to 50 metres long; immortal jellyfish, which unlike any other known creature can revert from maturity to an earlier stage of development, akin to a butterfly becoming a caterpillar. But on one estimate we have identified less than a tenth of ocean-dwelling creatures.\nWhat we can be certain about is that the extraordinary diversity of life in the oceans is under immense and growing threat. This week we learned that the last five years were the hottest on record. Global warming has heated the oceans by the equivalent of one atomic explosion per second for the last century and a half; in recent years the pace has accelerated to between three and six atomic bombs per second.\nMore than 90% of the heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions has been absorbed by the seas. Billions of people living in coastal areas are under threat from rising sea levels, due both to the melting of ice \u2013 happening at a frightening and increasing rate \u2013 and the physical expansion of water as it warms. Climate change is making storms more powerful and disrupting the patterns of marine life on which communities depend.\nBut it is only the most comprehensive of the dangers. Carbon emissions are also causing ocean acidification. Intensive fishing, pollution and the exploitation of mineral resources are all taking their toll. Between a fifth and a quarter of marine species are already threatened with extinction; global marine populations have halved since 1970. Though only three humans have reached the deepest known point, the Mariana trench, our collective impact is felt there in the form of pollutants and plastics.\nRecently, an expert warned that today\u2019s children may be the last generation to see the glory of coral reef systems which have survived for tens of millions of years. Bleaching, first observed in 1983, has already affected up to a third of warm-water reefs. Scientists around the world are \u201cfarming\u201d corals in an ingenious attempt to sustain them, but the only real solution is to stave off the worst climate change scenario.\nThe New York summit overseen by the UN secretary general this September will be a key test of whether nation states are serious about cutting emissions. The new reports provide yet more evidence of how urgent this is. As one expert on ocean warming notes in the Guardian today, it can still be tackled if we act immediately; this is a test of will, not ability. We know that the human consequences if we fail will be catastrophic. And yet, because we have still to explore the oceans more fully, we may never realise quite how much we have lost.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/marine-life", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/editorials"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Editorial: We have barely begun to explore our seas, but our impact is felt on both humans and marine life", "date_published": {"$date": 1547665197000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1547720719000}, "authors": ["Editorial"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "Marine life", "Wildlife"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/16/the-guardian-view-on-warming-oceans-a-rising-toll", "og:description": "Editorial: We have barely begun to explore our seas, but our impact is felt on both humans and marine life", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4d845d87b419c2f394c15b685587d9f49fc0ead/0_216_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=4ab10a0464b65bcdbc31c84524385759", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "The Guardian view on warming oceans: a rising toll | Editorial"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4d845d87b419c2f394c15b685587d9f49fc0ead/0_216_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=658e1ada37aee2040878e580b7f7a6c5", "width": "5400", "height": "3240", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4d845d87b419c2f394c15b685587d9f49fc0ead/0_216_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ba22c060d675d61bf229c3010d3e5d2e", "description": "A boxer crab with defensive anemones.\nPhotograph: David Fleetham/Alamy Stock Photo"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556125352487}, "comments": [{"id": "124758601", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1547701905000}, "author": "Walsunda", "author_id": "12483673", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\"And the rest of the editorial is just green wishful thinking.\"\nThe rest of the editorial reports on global warming over the last five years based on the paper by Cheng et al (2019) on how \"2018 Continues Record Global Ocean Warming\" published in Advances in Atmospheric Science Volume 36 Issue 3 pp 249-252 \nIs the current reality that we all have to contend with \"just green wishful thinking\"?", "recommendation_count": "4", "in_reply_to": "124746593", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "124758592", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1547701789000}, "author": "Erik Frederiksen", "author_id": "15131989", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "How about sailboats?", "recommendation_count": "12", "in_reply_to": "124758576", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "124758576", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1547701619000}, "author": "Daniel Pye", "author_id": "12166228", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "And what do they explore the oceans with?\nElectric ships?", "recommendation_count": "1", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "124758574", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1547701586000}, "author": "Erik Frederiksen", "author_id": "15131989", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "From a TED Talk by a professor emeritus of the Scripps Oceanographic Institute titled How We Wrecked the Ocean\nBQSTART\nAnd another version of this sort of thing is what is often called red tides or toxic blooms.

In many areas in the northern half of Australia, the average number of days above 35C could increase by two to three times.\nLate in the century, towns such as Darwin, Alice Springs and Broome\u00a0 may experience days with temperatures above 35C for about a third of the year.\nThese higher temperatures will also result in higher evaporation, which will continue to make drought conditions worse.\nBut southern and coastal regions will experience the welcome relief of sub-30 temperatures and even rain. Melbourne is set for a maximum of 28C, Geelong 26C and Warrnambool 21C.\nIt will also cool in South Australia, at least compared with the record-breaking 48.9C recorded in Port Augusta on Tuesday.\nTemperatures will still hover in the 30s but the stretch of nearly-50C temperatures looks to be over.\nPort Augusta is set for 32C (down from 48.9C), Tarcoola 31C (down from 48.7C), Coober Pedy 38C (down from 47.8C) and Woomera 37C (down from 47.6C).\nBut central Australia will remain scorching. Oodnadatta \u2013 one of the hottest 15 places in the Earth this week \u2013 will still sit at 46C.\nIn NSW, the towns of Ivanhoe, Bourke and Wilcannia are all facing 46C. Gundagai will swelter through 44C, which is only slightly down on the 45C experienced on Wednesday.\nFarr said the summer had smashed records across the state.\n\u201cYesterday we saw some January records broken,\u201d Farr said. \u201cCobar (47.2C), Parkes (44.5C), Wagga (45.2C) and Tuggeranong (40.8C) all had their hottest January day since records began.\n\u201cOn Wednesday, we even saw some annual records broken. It was the hottest day since records began at Broken Hill airport (46.3C), Whitecliff (48.2C), Wilcannia (47.9C) and Albury (45.6C).\u201d\nTemperatures in NSW are expected to drop over the weekend. Menindee is set for 36C with some cloud cover and Penrith 32C. Wilcannia and Ivanhoe will drop to 40C, but Bourke is set to stay hot at 45C on Saturday, and hold at over 40C through all of next week.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/south-australia", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-capital-territory-act", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "On the fifth day of a record-breaking heatwave, temperatures in parts of NSW and ACT are forecast to soar above 40C", "date_published": {"$date": 1547775738000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548380745000}, "authors": ["Naaman Zhou"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Australia weather", "South Australia", "Victoria", "New South Wales", "Climate change", "Australia news", "Sydney", "Australian Capital Territory (ACT)"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/18/australia-heatwave-sydneys-west-to-hit-45c-after-week-of-extreme-weather", "og:description": "On the fifth day of a record-breaking heatwave, temperatures in parts of NSW and ACT are forecast to soar above 40C", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9dc228313dadd5b232a95a882ee20cd6937cd71/38_0_1786_1073/master/1786.png?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=a932d68456eb603c3fdc8e1d42f96de3", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Australia heatwave: overnight minimum of 35.9C in Noona sets new record"}, "headline": "N", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9dc228313dadd5b232a95a882ee20cd6937cd71/38_0_1786_1073/master/1786.png?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7eeaf81d5bd1541d03197f041de16b7c", "width": "1786", "height": "1073", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9dc228313dadd5b232a95a882ee20cd6937cd71/38_0_1786_1073/master/1786.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d7ee6be92bfc04ca77cf1498e4f5034b", "description": "Temperatures in Sydney\u2019s west and other parts of NSW were forecast to reach 45C on the fifth day of Australia\u2019s extreme heatwave, with more records expected to be broken.

The famous alpine ice masses in the Cascade Mountains in the north-west US have largely been spared from the trend.\n\u201cThe losses we would expect were reduced because we got a lot of additional snow,\u201d said David Shean, a co-author at the University of Washington. \u201cMoving forward we may not be so lucky.\u201d\nThe jet stream \u2013 the currents of fast-flowing air in the atmosphere that affect weather \u2013 has shifted, causing more snow in the north-western US and less in south-western Canada, according to the study released in Geophysical Research Letters, a publication of the American Geophysical Union. Changes in the northern hemisphere jet stream are increasingly firmly linked to global warming.\nThat warming from humans burning fossil fuels is also expected to continue to melt alpine glaciers, even under scenarios for more moderate greenhouse gas levels.\nWhile some of the fourfold increase in the melting rate in western North America is related to manmade climate change, the researchers can\u2019t say with certainty how much.\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to understand these shorter cycles that have real impacts on how the glaciers are behaving and how much water is stored in the glaciers,\u201d Shean explained.\nAlaskan glaciers get much of the attention in North America because Alaska is warming faster than the continental US. Mount Hunter in Denali national park, is seeing 60 times more snow melt than it did 150 years ago.\nThe North American glaciers analyzed in the new study are far smaller than those in Alaska, Asia and elsewhere, so they won\u2019t contribute much to sea-level rise as they melt. The authors say they offer critical lessons for water management, fisheries and flood prevention.\nWith shrinking glaciers, less water will be available for nearby river systems when rainfall is low. In some parts of the world, millions of people could lose their primary water supplies.\nIn the Pacific north-west US, if glaciers melted entirely, that could reduce the flow of certain watersheds by up to about 15% in dry months of August and September, Shean said.\n\u201cIn our case that will have an impact, especially if we\u2019re having a drought year \u2026 but in general at least for the foreseeable future we should be OK here in Washington,\u201d he said.\nSnow pack changes will be more important than glacier melt for water planners in the western US, Shean said.\nStill, changes in water temperature could pose problems for fish. And the sediment that comes with melting glaciers could fall to the bottoms of riverbeds, making them overflow during heavy rains.\nThe authors got their data by comparing satellite images of glaciers from 2000 to 2009 and from 2009 to 2018. They estimated elevation changes, which can be difficult to assess with the smallest glaciers. Other researchers are attempting to get spy satellite and aerial photos from the 1950s and 1960s declassified so they can study longer-term changes, Shean said.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/americas", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Satellite images show glaciers in US and Canada, excluding Alaska, are shrinking four times faster than in previous decade", "date_published": {"$date": 1547877606000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1547921637000}, "authors": ["Emily Holden"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Glaciers", "Environment", "US news", "Climate change", "Americas", "Science", "Climate change"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/18/north-america-glacier-melt-study-climate-change", "og:description": "Satellite images show glaciers in US and Canada, excluding Alaska, are shrinking four times faster than in previous decade", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd0636a78d3f10f01d6d1ec2660fdb8ce0b2aaa/0_296_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=0d6420e23f0d8f5f3e6d2aefb55e1fc3", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "North American glaciers melting much faster than 10 years ago \u2013 study"}, "headline": "N", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd0636a78d3f10f01d6d1ec2660fdb8ce0b2aaa/0_296_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=66cdaefc090e70536823df81caee3ee6", "width": "7360", "height": "4417", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd0636a78d3f10f01d6d1ec2660fdb8ce0b2aaa/0_296_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=36db487b00acd8a037955fb637d6567c", "description": "The Klinaklini glacier in British Columbia.\nPhotograph: Brian Menounos"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07a95a2c3613145ed8d0d"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/20/how-to-stop-the-climate-crisis-six-lessons-from-the-campaign-that-saved-the-ozone", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Amid the anti-globalist chest-thumping of Brexit, Donald Trump, and the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, it may sound like the stuff of folklore. But there was a time in the recent past when all the countries of the world moved quickly to discuss a common threat, agreed an ambitious plan of action and made it work.\nThe Montreal protocol, which came into effect 30 years ago, was drawn up to address the alarming thinning of the ozone layer in the Earth\u2019s stratosphere. It was the first agreement in the history of the United Nations to be ratified by all 197 countries. Since it came into effect on 1 January 1989, more than 99% of the gases responsible for the problem have been eradicated and the \u201cozone hole\u201d \u2013 which, in the late 80s, vied for headline space with the cold war, Diana, Princess of Wales, and Madonna \u2013 is receding in the sky and the memory.\nAccording to the latest UN study, the \u201cozone holes\u201d (there are actually two: one above each pole) are healing at the rate of 1% to 3% a decade and will have completely vanished in the northern hemisphere by the 2030s and the southern hemisphere by the 2060s. This is cause for back-slapping, but also frustration that the world has not been able to unite as effectively over the climate and biodiversity crises. Here are half a dozen lessons.\nThe satellite animation of the changing atmosphere over the Antarctic first shown in 1985 appeared to show a growing \u201cozone hole\u201d. This was a scientifically imprecise description of the thinning that was concentrated at both poles, but the metaphor \u2013 of the roof over our home planet being punctured \u2013 captured the public imagination and, most importantly, conveyed a sense of urgency. By contrast, many people feel distant from climate problems, which are usually illustrated with images of polar bears, filled with caveats and headlined with vague labels, such as \u201cglobal warming\u201d, which sounds benign (or even desirable for those living in cold countries), and \u201cclimate change\u201d, which comes across as a statement of the obvious.\nWhen scientists raised the alarm about chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) gases, there was initially uncertainty about their impact on the atmosphere and the process, but the risks from sunlight weakly filtered by the ozone layer (cancer, crop failure, ocean ecosystem collapse) were so great that world leaders decided not to wait. Instead, they applied the \u201cprecautionary principle\u201d: \u201cIf in doubt, cut it out.\u201d Even before the science was settled, they started to act. This was also supposed to be the case with the climate, but lobbying to deny the validity of the science, particularly in the US, has stymied action.\nGovernments temporarily put aside cold-war hostilities and united rapidly around a solution to the ozone problem. From the first research in 1973, it took just 16 years for the world to discuss, agree and put in place a solution that reversed the trend. By comparison, scientific warnings that carbon dioxide emissions could disrupt the climate date back to at least 1962 (and the risks were speculated on much earlier). Yet despite numerous international agreements on the subject since then (Rio 1992, Kyoto 1998, Copenhagen 2009, Paris 2015), emissions are still climbing.\nIn the 80s, the environment was not yet the polarising issue it has become, but the dominant figures \u2013 including the US president, George HW Bush, the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, and the British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher \u2013 still had to overcome business interests, treasury doubts and political short-termism to protect the future health of the planet. They refused to accept the delaying tactics of chemical companies, some of which argued action should wait until the science was clearer. Today, Trump, Bolsonaro and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, represent fossil fuel interests, deny science and undermine international cooperation.\nThe phased ban on CFCs and dozens of other ozone-depleting gases was an economic blow to chemical firms, refrigerator producers and aerosol-spray manufacturers. Rich countries dealt with the job losses, technology upgrades and other economic consequences internally, but also provided support for poorer nations to manage the transition. From 1991 to 2005, pledges totalled $3.1bn. Similar arrangements exist for climate accords, but the sums need to be far higher because the actions are so much more expensive, the responsibility of industrialised nations is so much greater, and the impact on poor countries is incalculably worse.\nThe Montreal protocol has been updated numerous times as the science has sharpened and new climate goals have been incorporated. This month, the Kigali amendment added a plan to cut hydrofluorocarbons by more than 80% over the next 30 years, which would reduce global heating by 0.4C by the end of the century. Under the Paris climate agreement, governments are supposed to ratchet up the ambition of their pledges to cut emissions, but most governments are failing to meet even their current inadequate targets.\nLooking at this list, a millennial might be tempted to conclude that the Montreal protocol was possible because it came about in a golden age when leaders were smarter, politicians more representative and populations more amenable to scientific persuasion. But, as anyone alive in 1989 knows, that is far too simple an explanation. The reality is that environmental action was easier then because the world had more ecological breathing room, capitalism was less dominant and the corporate push-back \u2013 and control over politics \u2013 was weaker. The ozone layer was a relatively simple fix compared with the climate, which is the biggest, most complex, multidimensional challenge humanity has ever faced. It is one thing confronting a handful of chemical firms, quite another to take on the world\u2019s fossil fuel companies, car manufacturers, cement-makers and agribusiness conglomerates, representing hundreds of millions of jobs, trillions of dollars and 200-odd years of industrial development.\nBush, Thatcher, Gorbachev and the then Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, knew this in 1989, when global temperatures were already rising at an unnaturally rapid rate. A year earlier, in a US congressional testimony reported throughout the world, the then Nasa scientist Jim Hansen had declared \u201cwith 99% confidence\u201d that this heating was a result of human activity. They also knew the problem would be easier to solve then than 30 years in the future. Initially, Bush promised to lead a determined global response to climate change, but \u2013 as the short-term costs of a long-term solution became apparent \u2013 he balked. Instead of a comprehensive response, he merely strengthened research, paved the way for a drawn-out global negotiating process and complacently put his faith in future innovation and entrepreneurship.\nHe may well have reassured himself that his environmental legacy was secure, thanks to action on ozone. But the climate can that he and others kicked forward 30 years ago is still clanking through the corridors of global conferences. It is a lot rustier now, but still basically the same half-response to a problem that becomes bigger and harder to solve with every year that passes.\nSo this year\u2019s anniversary of the implementation of the Montreal protocol should not just inspire nostalgia for 1989, but a curse on the first generation of leaders to dodge climate responsibility. And as we are already suffering the consequences of their failure, it should remind us that every day of delay has a massive and imminent cost. Each fraction of a degree of global heating that can be prevented will save lives, species and money.\nIn our lifetimes, the ozone hole will be closed in the stratosphere while the increasingly angry beast of climate rages below. How angry is up to us. Montreal reminds us that nothing in politics is inevitable, that profits do not have to come before people, that global problems can have global solutions, that we can shape our own future. That depends on how far we are willing to push. In 1989, that wasn\u2019t far enough. Nor has it been since. In 2003, the UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, called the Montreal protocol \u201cperhaps the single most successful international agreement to date\u201d. Sadly, that still applies today.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ozone-layer", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Thirty years ago, all 197 countries got together to ban the gases damaging the Earth\u2019s ozone layer.

The CO2 coming from a quarter of that ton will still be affecting the climate one thousand years from now, at the start of the next millennium.

But scientists have found that the largest ice loss in the decade from 2003 actually occurred in the south-west region of the island, which is largely glacier-free.\nThis suggests surface ice is simply melting as global temperatures rise, causing gushing rivers of meltwater to flow into the ocean and push up sea levels. South-west Greenland, not previously thought of as a source of woe for coastal cities, is set to \u201cbecome a major future contributor to sea level rise\u201d, the research states.\n\u201cWe knew we had one big problem with increasing rates of ice discharge by some large outlet glaciers,\u201d said Michael Bevis, lead author of the paper and a professor of geodynamics at Ohio State University. \u201cBut now we recognize a second serious problem: increasingly, large amounts of ice mass are going to leave as meltwater, as rivers that flow into the sea.\u201d\nThe research provides fresh evidence of the dangers posed to vulnerable coastal places as diverse as Miami, Shanghai, Bangladesh and various Pacific islands as climate change shrinks the world\u2019s land-based ice.\n\u201cThe only thing we can do is adapt and mitigate further global warming \u2013 it\u2019s too late for there to be no effect,\u201d Bevis said. \u201cThis is going to cause additional sea level rise. We are watching the ice sheet hit a tipping point.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see faster and faster sea level rise for the foreseeable future. Once you hit that tipping point, the only question is: how severe does it get?\u201d\nThe study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, used data from Nasa\u2019s gravity recovery and climate experiment (known as Grace) and GPS stations scattered across Greenland to analyze changes in ice mass.\nThis showed that Greenland lost about 280bn tons of ice per year between 2002 and 2016, enough to raise the worldwide sea level by 0.03 inches annually. If all of Greenland\u2019s vast ice sheet, 3km thick in places, was to melt, global sea levels would rise by seven meters, or more than 20ft, drowning most coastal settlements.\nThe rate of loss hasn\u2019t been even, however, with the ice melting four times faster in 2013 compared with 2003. Researchers said this was driven by rising global temperatures from human-induced climate change as well as the North Atlantic Oscillation, a periodic weather phenomenon that brings warmer air to western Greenland.\nThe fate of Greenland\u2019s huge glaciers in the south-east and north-west has long been viewed as a key factor in global sea level rise but the Ohio State-led research suggests the ice fields of the island\u2019s south-west may prove an unexpectedly large source of meltwater.\nScientists have been gaining a greater understanding of how the two massive ice masses on the planet, in Greenland and Antarctica, are reacting to a warming ocean and atmosphere.\nArctic ice loss has tripled since the 1980s, with melting in places such as Greenland and Alaska providing the greatest instigator of sea level rise while destabilizing the very ground underneath 4 million people\u2019s feet.\nAntarctica is becoming an increasing concern, however, with ice vanishing at its fastest rate in recorded history. The world\u2019s largest expanse of ice is now losing about 219bn tonnes of ice a year, a trajectory that would contribute more than 25cm to total global sea level rise by 2070. Should the entire west Antarctic ice sheet collapse, sea levels would balloon by around 3.5m, albeit over a lengthy timeframe.\n\u201cWe are warming the planet, this is melting ice, and that is raising sea level,\u201d said Richard Alley, a geologist and glacier expert at Pennsylvania State University. Alley added that while there are uncertainties over future sea level rise \u201cif the big ice sheets change more rapidly than expected, they could drive faster or much faster rise than expected\u201d.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The pace of ice loss has increased four-fold since 2003 as enormous glaciers are depositing ever larger chunks of ice into the Atlantic ocean, where it melts, causing sea levels to rise", "date_published": {"$date": 1548159222000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548161598000}, "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "article_section": "World news", "article_tags": ["Greenland", "Environment", "World news", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Science"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/21/greenland-ice-melting-faster-than-scientists-previously-thought-study", "og:description": "The pace of ice loss has increased four-fold since 2003 as enormous glaciers are depositing ever larger chunks of ice into the Atlantic ocean, where it melts, causing sea levels to rise", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9acc34d5e5ac70af556fa6bde0d937f8566c646/0_228_3878_2326/master/3878.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=ecc2e8172a71ac4b2b3d2637dae85262", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Greenland's ice melting faster than scientists previously thought \u2013 study"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9acc34d5e5ac70af556fa6bde0d937f8566c646/0_228_3878_2326/master/3878.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f5989389053a7f8710557fa1514be921", "width": "3878", "height": "2326", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9acc34d5e5ac70af556fa6bde0d937f8566c646/0_228_3878_2326/master/3878.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2ab2c3f01db00b230fc07c6b28edad34", "description": "Study shows Greenland lost around 280bn tons of ice per year between 2002 and 2016, enough to raise the worldwide sea level by 0.03 inches annually.\nPhotograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07ab1a2c3613145ed8d1b"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/22/specieswatch-will-population-of-nasty-cleg-fly-surge-again", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "A chemistry master at school was universally known by the nickname Cleg, at least when he was out of earshot.\nWhen quizzed, older pupils revealed that a Cleg, Haematopota pluvialis, is a particularly nasty form of fly that you do not notice until pain alerts you to the fact it has cut a hole in your skin and started to suck your blood. \nIt is very similar to a horsefly, except smaller, silent and stealthy, so normally not detected until the damage is being done.\nAt the time it seemed a rather apt name for an unpopular master, never happier than when wielding a cane, but was completely forgotten about until last summer\u2019s heatwave. \nThe wet spring benefited the overwintering larvae and the hot summer was ideal for the adults.

He argued consistently for the protection of tropical forests as a key step towards meeting environmental goals, helping build alliances between conservation, development and human rights advocates.\nHe was so well known that negotiators sought him out in his usual haunts, whether at a coffee table in the conference halls, or with his fellow smokers, where he would share a mixture of physics, political analysis and gossip.\nBorn in Surbiton, south-west London, John was brought up on Christmas Island, in the Indian Ocean, and then in Tanzania, where his father, Bill Lanchbery, a mechanical engineer, ran a power station. His mother, Betty (nee Ball), was a furnishings designer. John returned to Britain to take his A-levels at Dulwich college, in south London.\nJohn\u2019s early career was at ERA Technology in the development of innovative thin film and microelectronics technologies for a variety of applications. Meanwhile he studied part-time for a degree in mathematics at the Open University and then a master\u2019s in solid state physics at the City of London Polytechnic (now London Metropolitan University).\nA year teaching at the Open University followed and in 1991 he started at Vertic, the NGO that supports the implementation of international agreements, working on climate change monitoring, which led to his engagement in the climate negotiations and ultimately working for the RSPB.\nJohn operated through calm consideration, in both his scientific and personal lives. He was a rock for colleagues and a friend and mentor to many. He would always find time to explain the intricacies of the climate negotiations, enlivening the driest of topics with amusing anecdotes \u2013 especially over a glass of wine.\nJohn is survived by his partner of 28 years, Nicola Jenkins, his son, Christopher, and daughter, Alexandra, from a marriage that ended in divorce; and by a granddaughter, Pippa.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/rspb", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/birds", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/obituaries"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Other lives: Physicist and climate change expert", "date_published": {"$date": 1548262346000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548781586000}, "authors": ["Ruth Davis"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "RSPB", "Environment", "Birds"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/23/john-lanchbery-obituary", "og:description": "Other lives: Physicist and climate change expert", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/507b91d0a40682321514322e277fb22046c7493d/450_226_2813_1688/master/2813.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=761f1e135857fc9aff02fe1b9a15dfbb", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "John Lanchbery obituary"}, "headline": "r", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/507b91d0a40682321514322e277fb22046c7493d/450_226_2813_1688/master/2813.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=da476c9b197ad59de92273fa15ee906b", "width": "2813", "height": "1688", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/507b91d0a40682321514322e277fb22046c7493d/450_226_2813_1688/master/2813.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=04ef5441f54db4c88431b96c736ed090", "description": "John Lanchbery argued consistently for the protection of tropical forests as a key step towards meeting environmental goals"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07ac6a2c3613145ed8d1f"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/24/should-we-stop-eating-meat-not-while-humans-are-the-real-weapons-of-climate-destruction", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "As we are starting to see the effects of climate change materialise in front of our eyes, people are looking for things they can do to help heal our planet. One common theme has been a call to stop eating meat, mainly due to methane emissions from cows.\nThis is a simple answer, but I suggest it is an answer to the wrong question.\nHow did nature get things so horribly wrong when she allowed cows to evolve? After all, they are evil weapons of climate destruction, aren\u2019t they?\nLet\u2019s start with a few basics.\nCows are ruminant animals. This means they have a multi-chambered stomach, one part of which is called a rumen. This is a fermentation vat containing billions of microbes breaking down the plants the animal eats. As part of this process, some of these microbes produce methane.\nLots of animals produce some methane, including horses, dogs, termites, people and even kangaroos.\nRuminants evolved 50 million years ago, and today there are almost 200 different species. So ruminant animals have a rich ecological diversity and a long evolutionary history.\nOther ruminants include the American elk, Chinese goral, Himalayan tahr, Japanese serow, Reindeer, Siberian ibex, water buffalo and yak. There are mountain, marsh, snow and swamp ruminants. There are American, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, even Siberian ruminants.\nIf nature got it wrong when she allowed ruminants to evolve, she got it wrong at a global scale.\nBut maybe she didn\u2019t get it wrong after all? Maybe it\u2019s not her, maybe it\u2019s us?\nInstead of asking \u201cWhat do we humans need to do to reduce ruminant methane emissions?\u201d, we should be asking \u201cWhat have we humans done that has so unbalanced the natural methane cycle?\u201d\nBacteria that \u201ceat\u201d methane live in healthy, properly managed soils beneath the feet of healthy, properly managed livestock. (Remember, nature doesn\u2019t do \u201cwaste\u201d.)\nThese methane-eating bacteria (methanotrophs) act as a balance to the methane produced by the methane generating bacteria (methanogens) in the rumens of the livestock above ground. This is the missing part of the natural methane cycle that we need to restore.\nI believe there is a massive difference between \u201clivestock\u201d and \u201cproperly managed livestock\u201d.\nAs soon as we take grazing animals off grass and put them into a feedlot or confinement dairy, we have severed their link to the land. This means that we have now prevented nature from doing what she does best, which is utilise any \u201cwaste\u201d, cycle and reuse nutrients, and balance the system.  When we manage livestock properly, out on grass and respecting the natural relationship between soils, grasses and grazing animals, we get a cleaner, fresher and properly balanced production system. We get healthy ecosystems, healthy animals, healthy people.\nIf we start asking the right questions instead of the wrong ones, the answers begin to matter.\nThe answer to reducing our impact on the climate is not to stop eating meat, it is to properly manage land and livestock.\nTony Lovell actively manages land and livestock to regenerate ecosystems and produce positive financial, social, and environmental outcomes.

How, I wonder, is everyone so calm? So business-as-usual?\nThe field of ecopsychology explores our connection to nature, and the way it affects our state of mind. Many of us fail to realize how essential that connection is.\nGiven that southern Florida \u2013 with its billions of dollars of vulnerable real estate on exposed coastline \u2013 is considered by many scientists as ground zero for climate change, I started my listening tour there. Floridians receive a constant stream of bad climate news. I was curious: does the state of the environment \u2013 specifically, the pending losses of biodiversity, tourism and property, and the prediction of category 6 hurricanes \u2013 keep people up at night? \nAfter a long morning of driving through the Everglades, I stopped at Joanie\u2019s Blue Crab Cafe, a vibrant red shack on the side of Highway 41 in Ochopee. \u201cSit anywhere you like, baby,\u201d Lisa, the waitress, said.\nI grabbed a bottle of Coors from the cooler, and sat on the sun-soaked back deck overlooking a stretch of water lined with sawgrass and frequented by alligators. Over a few hours I saw cypress swamps, mangrove forests, osprey, bald eagles, roseate spoonbills and sandhill cranes. Even though there has been a 90% loss of wading birds in the Everglades this century, there is still so much left to lose.\n\u201cYou\u2019re having the blackened grouper sandwich,\u201d Lisa said. \u201cSo good it will make you cry.\u201d\nLisa was right \u2013 the grouper was incredible. And crying wasn\u2019t out of the question. The government shutdown had given my trip a raw feeling. That morning signs were posted at the national park sites: \u201cEnter at your own risk.\u201d The Everglades \u2013 the largest subtropical wilderness left in the United States \u2013 is an environmental treasure imperiled by pollution, toxic algae blooms, disrupted water flow and politicians who favor big industries like sugar.\nClimate change denial and avoidance are prevalent here. The new governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, announced surprising plans for big environmental reforms earlier this month, without mentioning climate change (a term his predecessor, Rick Scott, also refused to use).\nMany people I spoke to in the Everglades didn\u2019t want to talk about climate change. They considered it too political.\nAfter I got home, I reached out to Erica Henry, a biologist who studies at-risk butterfly populations in the Florida Keys and Everglades, for her take. \u201cYou could be fatalistic about the fact that the news is bad, or that particular species seem doomed,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could be paralyzed. But I\u2019ve picked off my little piece, the problem I can help solve.\u201d\nI drove north, through Florida\u2019s panhandle, witnessing miles of extensive tree damage from Hurricane Michael. I thought I\u2019d hear tales of increasing environmental anxiety over rising seas, and the misery of enduring hurricane seasons in the era of climate change. But in nearly all of my conversations, I encountered more resolve than anxiety.\nI booked a charter boat out of Ocean Springs, near Biloxi, to see Mississippi\u2019s barrier islands. My captain was Matthew Mayfield, a chef, restaurateur and fisherman with an infamous smoked tuna dip. As we pointed the skiff away from the Gulf Coast, he recalled how his wife\u2019s dresses were caught in the branches of the oak trees after Hurricane Katrina, just waving around.\nWe found a pelican skull and tail tracks of a small gator as we walked the white sand beaches of Horn Island, made famous by artist and conservationist Walter Anderson, who notoriously rode out Hurricane Betsy tethered to a tree. Mayfield told me about the clouds of monarchs that pass through in the fall. Generations from now, Horn Island may be gone.\nOn the way home, I worked up the courage to ask Matthew why he rebuilt his life on the coast. \u201cWhy do you stay?\u201d I asked. He said he needed time to think about it.\nIn the days that followed, he sent me reasons and pictures of the family property, colorful sunsets, local food, and a tame fox. \u201cPeople that live here realize that the reward greatly outweighs the risk and pain of a storm,\u201d he explained. \u201cNo one really cares how much you make or what you do for a living. Maybe we have a bond that storms intensify.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about the future?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI can\u2019t live my life like that,\u201d he said.\nA few days later, I stood across the street from the Saint Louis Cathedral in New Orleans, where 13 years ago Hurricane Katrina took down massive oak trees, ornamental fencing, a portion of roof and the marble hands of a statue of Jesus Christ.\nCammie Hill-Prewitt, who coordinates residencies for artists focused on the environment for Tulane University, agreed to talk to me about the spiritual tax of living on the coast in the era of climate change. She evacuated for Katrina, but stayed through Isaac, pregnant and with three house guests.\n\u201cI grind my teeth during hurricane season,\u201d Hill-Prewitt admitted. \u201cBut I have a 30-year mortgage. My partner owns restaurants. It\u2019s not easy to leave.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not exactly zen about it,\u201d she clarified. \u201cIf you came back in September, when it\u2019s hot, and there are four tropical depressions looming in the Atlantic, you\u2019d get different responses. Incredible how short our memory is.\u201d\nWhile waiting for the annual Joan of Arc parade to start, we talked about a kid she knew who processed the trauma of Katrina through his Lego play for years, building houses then smashing them to pieces.\nThousands of people had lined the street, drinking, wearing sequined dresses and feathered hats. The drums started. A green paper mache dragon was hoisted into the air, followed by angels, then Joan of Arc on a well-trained horse.\nHill-Prewitt leaned over to me. \u201cThis is why we stay,\u201d she said.\nLater, I met Anna and Cam working at The Little Toy Shop near the bustling Cafe du Monde. They were in elementary school when Katrina hit. When I ask if they were anxious about climate change forecasts, Anna shrugged. \u201cMaybe for a year or two after Katrina,\u201d she said. Then she said something quietly profound. \u201cYou just learn not to get too attached to things.\u201d\nFrom New Orleans, I drove through Mississippi, from Natchez, to Piney-Woods, and finally Oxford, where I joined Heather McTeer Toney for coffee. She was the first African American mayor of Greenville, Mississippi, and a former Obama appointee, overseeing the south-east region of the Environmental Protection Agency. I wanted to hear about her experience with frontline communities, people living near levees and in flood zones.\n\u201cOur story of climate change and the south has always been about attachment to land,\u201d Heather explained. \u201cIt\u2019s generational. Cultural. This is our home and we\u2019re as intertwined as flesh and blood.\u201d\nHeather agreed with me that the south \u2013 particularly communities of color \u2013 is often unfairly painted as uniformly oblivious, and disinterested, when in fact the conversation is just taking place in a different language.\n\u201cWe talk about climate concerns daily, but express our fears through the changes we see in hunting, fishing and farming instead of carbon emissions and PM2 standards,\u201d she said. \u201cWe understand it quite well and are fearful for the future of our homes and children.\u201d\nDuring my trip, I thought that I might observe more of a cultural tipping point, an urgency in places that need it most. But I found that many members of coastal communities have built up psychological resilience after living through years of extreme weather.\nAvoidance and denial are proven coping mechanisms. And, frankly, most people are just trying to work and get through the day, and express concern for the future differently, from off-record conversations to outright advocacy. But continuing to reckon with a science-based reality \u2013 as painful and worry-inducing as it might be \u2013 is an important step toward informing meaningful, individual action.\nHome is an emotional commitment. We\u2019re an adaptable species, but also habitual and sentimental; that\u2019s one reason we\u2019re stuck in denial. It\u2019s the reason change is going to hurt so much.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "From New Orleans to the Florida panhandle, many have built up psychological resilience after living through years of extreme weather", "date_published": {"$date": 1548331206000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548348198000}, "authors": ["Megan Mayhew Bergman"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Environment", "Climate change", "Energy", "US news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/24/us-south-climate-change", "og:description": "From New Orleans to the Florida panhandle, many have built up psychological resilience after living through years of extreme weather", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6631121830b1f143c9f4a81e1779a7649aa26f3c/0_414_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=703f2a6499dd68fc5c705a039ddfc3d5", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Why people in the US south stay put in the face of climate change"}, "headline": "l"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07ad7a2c3613145ed8d29"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/25/when-the-river-runs-dry-the-australian-towns-facing-heatwave-and-drought", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "As all of Australia suffered through a brutal heatwave last week, locals in the outback New South Wales towns of Walgett and Lightning Ridge were better prepared than most. Almost every day in summer is 40C or above here.\nUsually, the rivers provide relief: swimming in cool water, fishing for golden perch or Murray cod or seeking the solace of a big sleepy red gum that lines the banks.\nBut this year there are no rivers. With the mercury in the mid-40s, the Narran, the Namoi and the Barwon \u2013 all tributaries of the vast Murray-Darling river system \u2013 are dry, or reduced to a series of green, stagnant weir pools. The mighty red gums, roots exposed, are hanging on for dear life. Heritage-protected lakes and wetlands are empty, and with them have gone the breeding grounds of native birds and fish.\nAustralia has endured a searing summer of drought and extreme heat. Hundreds of feral animals have died of thirst or faced culling as they encroached on properties in search of water. All-time temperature records have been broken in South Australia, with Adelaide reaching 46.6C, while Melbourne had its hottest day since the catastrophic 2009 bushfires, and more fires swept through Tasmania.\nThe Murray-Darling basin, which stretches from Queensland, through New South Wales and Victoria before emptying into the Southern Ocean near Adelaide, should be the lifeblood of the continent in such times. But things have gone very wrong on the rivers.\nAt Menindee, near Broken Hill, thousands of fish were found dead on 6 January, including giant Murray cod up to 40 years old.\nGovernment ministers blamed the drought that set in across eastern Australia from April 2017. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, said the environmental disaster was down to the fact it \u201cjust hasn\u2019t rained\u201d.\n\u201cWe are experiencing a very, very dry period of unprecedented proportions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when it rains, it will come down in such torrents people will probably be saying \u2018what are we going to do with all the water?\u2019 That\u2019s Australia.\u201d\nBut the huge fish kill drew the nation\u2019s attention to the wider crisis on the Murray-Darling, which has been the subject of political wrangling between farmers, environmentalists and Indigenous groups for decades.\nWhile irrigation has expanded in some of Australia\u2019s driest regions, the Darling and its tributaries have been reduced to a series of muddy pools. It\u2019s not the first time the Darling has ceased to flow, but the unfolding severe ecological and social consequences have caused Australians to question whether its plan to save the Murray Darling basin from environmental disaster is working.\n\u201cWe have witnessed a catastrophic failure of Australia\u2019s supposedly world-leading water management system,\u201d Rene Woods, from the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations says.\n*******\nFor decades the states along the river had been handing out water licences to farmers without any thought about what unbridled extraction for farming would mean for the river or downstream states.\nBy the 1990s, the mouth of Murray at the end of the river system silted up. Salt levels became dangerously high, jeopardising Adelaide\u2019s water supply, as well as internationally recognised wetlands.\nGovernments were forced to act and in 2007, after years of difficult negotiations, the states and the commonwealth agreed to a plan that would licence water extraction and buy back a share of water for the environment.\nThis water is owned by the Commonwealth and is released periodically to mimic nature and, in theory, keep the rivers healthy.\nBut from the outset, the plan owed more to political compromise than science.\n\u201cThe best available science assembled for the guide to the the Basin Plan said that we needed 3,200GL to 7,600GL for the environment,\u201d said Jamie Pittock, a professor at the Australian National University and a member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists.\nBut ultimately only 2,750GL was allocated to the environment. Astoundingly, the plan also failed to take into account climate change, despite scientific reports showing that most of the basin will become hotter and drier.\n******\nThe Aboriginal nations of the basin have been all but ignored, too.\n\u201cIn the 1990s, when NSW water reform began, it was really difficult, because we had people say \u201cwhat have Aboriginal people got to do with water?\u201d They didn\u2019t see that we had a valid place at the table,\u201d Yuwalaraay man Ted Fields says.\nAboriginal people have some say over about a third of the country in the basin, but they hold less than 0.01% of Australia\u2019s water diversions.\nNative title rights do not include ownership of natural waters. They can include the use of water for personal, social, domestic and cultural purposes but an entitlement to extract water doesn\u2019t mean there is any water to extract, or that the water is drinkable. Traditional owners are angry at being shut out of the water conversation.\nThe loss is not just about day-to-day shortages. Gamilaraay and Yuwalaraay elders who have lived on the rivers all their lives say they have never seen conditions as bad as now, and they doubt it can ever be recovered.\n\u201cThis to me is the ultimate destruction of our culture,\u201d Gamilaraay elder Virginia Robinson says in Walgett.\n\u201cAll people think about now is there\u2019s no water. Aboriginal people were very close to nature and that\u2019s all unbalanced now. There\u2019s no nature to go back to.\u201d\nBuying up water to return to the environment remains deeply unpopular in much of rural Australia because of its impact on farms, rural towns and jobs.\nAt the same time the creation of a water market, where allocations can be traded, has benefited big agribusinesses who moved into industrial scale production of cotton and other high value crops, as well as water trading.\nThe Greens and Indigenous groups have called for a royal commission amid allegations of corruption and poor governance. South Australia has already held its own royal commission into the plan, but was hampered by the federal government\u2019s refusal to cooperate. It will report next week and is expected to warn that key aspects of the Murray-Darling plan are in breach of the Commonwealth Water Act.\nIn Walgett the dry river means the town must live on bore water indefinitely. Bore water is high in mineral content, especially sodium. It kills gardens and discolours basins and bathtubs. It comes out of the tap very warm \u2013 there\u2019s no need to turn on the hot tap to have a shower, but there is also no chance for a cool drink.\nLocals say bore water is not a long-term option as a drinking supply.

I want you to feel the fear I feel everyday' (25.1.19)And Greta goes further when she says 'nor does IPCC include tipping points or feedback loops'.

Its optimism. Even in the direst of circumstances, it is always able to find a silver lining.\nTake climate change, for example. After weird weather and ominous warnings of more to come, many of us are freaking out about an environmental apocalypse. Indeed, a new poll shows record numbers of Americans are worried about climate change and, after last year\u2019s heatwave, concerns about the issue have soared in Britain.\nNow, it seems that big companies are equally worried about global warming, but they are thinking about the future with cool heads. Rather than being consumed by doom and gloom, or considering the idea that we should curb consumerism, corporations have realised climate change is an exciting business opportunity. You can see evidence of this in recent disclosures to CDP, a UK-based environmental reporting NGO that surveys companies on the \u201crisks and opportunities\u201d they face because of changing weather patterns. The 2018 disclosures, reported by Bloomberg last week, provide a fascinating insight into how some of the world\u2019s largest corporations are, as Bloomberg puts it in a headline, \u201cGetting Ready to Monetize Climate Change\u201d.\nLet\u2019s start with the pharmaceutical industry, which is particularly well placed to profit from our dystopian future. As Merck notes in its disclosure to CDP, climate change may lead to \u201cexpanded markets for products for tropical and weather-related diseases including water-borne illness\u201d. AbbVie sees similar opportunities, saying that its \u201cimmunology product line could see an increase in sales\u201d as a result of more extreme conditions. And Eli Lilly, another large pharmaceutical company, cites research showing climate change may increase the risk of diabetes by \u201ccurtailing physical activity, disrupting traditional food supplies, and increasing food insecurity\u201d. While that is sad and all, the upside for Eli Lilly is a potential increase in demand for its diabetes products.\nIt\u2019s not just big pharma that sees dollar symbols in disaster. Honda reckons its generators may empower its consumers when the world\u2019s infrastructure crumbles. The company notes that \u201cthe Katrina disaster was followed by a 27% increase in unit sales of [Honda] generators\u201d. Meanwhile, the Home Depot is optimistic that, at the very least, it will sell more ceiling fans \u201cshould temperatures increase over time\u201d.\nThe tech industry, as one would expect, is taking an innovative view of how an apocalypse may affect the bottom line. Apple thinks that \u201cas people begin to experience severe weather events with greater frequency\u201d they will become increasingly glued to their mobile phones. It notes that, as well as helping you check in with your loved ones, your iPhone can \u201cserve as a flashlight\u201d. Which takes the idea of seeing the bright side of a bad situation to a whole new level.\nApple also says that, if disaster strikes, you can charge your mobile device using \u201chand cranks\u201d. Few people do that at the moment, but don\u2019t be surprised if you see iCranks, Armageddon-proof iPhone chargers, hitting a store near you soon. All in all, Apple says that if it is \u201csuccessful in creating products attractive to people whose purchasing habits are changing due to concerns about climate change\u201d it could raise annual net sales by $2.3bn (\u00a31.75bn). That\u2019s something to be cheerful about as the ice melts, eh?\nAnyway, while there are plenty more examples of corporate climate-change optimism, let\u2019s skip to the moral of this story, which is that, when it comes to global warming, we should all be acting more like multinationals. Rather than worrying about the planet being destroyed, why not ask yourself how you can best monetise the rest of your time on Earth? Invest in big pharma. Get a hand crank. And don\u2019t lose sleep over deforestation \u2013 after all, money doesn\u2019t grow on trees.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/business/pharmaceuticals-industry", "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple", "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/computing", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/honda", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "A new report reveals how Apple, among others, is already exploring the business possibilities that will come from the environmental crisis.

What millions on the left forget is what Marx pointed out in the Cawmunist Maniphesto: the progressive nature of capiltalism embedded in its ability to produce thing that people need and actually bring real improvement to their lives in contrast with their previous existence of rural idiocy. Marx wrote about that while not meaning rural people were always idiots:\n\u201c(\u2026) About the manifesto, it\u2019s not that he thought rural people were stupid (although I think he had an urban bias) but rather that capitalism, through urbanization and industrialization processes developed humanity\u2019s social nature to its greatest expression in history. He was arguing that the specifically capitalist mode of production and the urban systems it produced brought people together and compelled them to interact in ways not possible in rural regions. The type of interaction necessary in cities under capitalism allowed for the potential for human nature to develop, with progressive intellectual and cultural production, along with the development of science and technology, reaching heights not possible under feudal relations of agricultural production. It\u2019s not that rural people were inherently stupid, but rather that the comparatively atomistic lives they led, with arduous and extended labor taking place in relative isolation from a large and developed civil society, and under relations of indirect exploitation of the landlords, prevented them from engaging with a broader social world. They objectively could not pursue their intellectual and social development to the same extent (with Marx here operating under the assumption that knowledge and the intellect are socially produced and thus require social cooperation and conflict to develop).\n\"It goes without saying that he thought the particular organizational relations under which capitalism initiated this flowering of social development needed revolutionary change. He thought of capitalism as a progressive force that allowed intellectual and scientific change to occur through direct social contact and thus a force shattering the isolating restrictions of rural life, one that objectively socialized world production and brought everything under a totalizing mode of production. Unfortunately, this mode of production achieved this socialization through the privatization of ownership of the means of production and as such created the potential for full development only for those who became free from the shackles of direct labor, the capitalists themselves.\"\nThese same people then own not just the means of production of goods but also the means of production of culture. So those with nothing are informed that money doesn't buy you happiness. Although as Marx (Groucho) noted: \"\"It does buy you a much better class of misery.\"\nThey are also informed that poverty is only the product of personal failure; that hierarchy is natural; that their lack of resources are the fault of 'outsiders' such as immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers; that circuses, (Monarchy, Big Brother, Britain Has Got Talent, Strictly Come Dancing, Coronation Street, East Enders, Football, Cosmetics, Diet, Fashion, etc, ad infinitum, as nauseeum), are far more important than politics (boring).\nMoney doesn't grow on trees, trees are money. Everything is money. Nature is money. The environment is money. Politics is money. Culture is money. We are not charged for the air we breathe. Instead we are charged to fix the problems that breathing the air creates. Air is money. Our existence now is money. Every time we hand over our details in order to buy a product we don't realise we ARE the product.

The new products are exclusive to Selfridges.\nEnvironmental experts have long recommended insects as a sustainable food source that could help end world hunger and reduce the damaging impact of meat production. Insects are also nutritious, containing essential proteins, fats, minerals and amino acids.\nA regular portion of buckwheat pasta usually contains about 10g of protein, whereas Jimini\u2019s insect fusilli contains 18g. Jimini\u2019s cereal bars contain 20% protein and granola 14% \u2013 both products are blended with a selection of fruit and nuts for variety of texture. The products will be promoted in Selfridges initially in themed, pop-up \u201cbug bars\u201d but may remain on sale permanently.\nEdward Goodman, the food buying director of Selfridges, said: \u201cWe are sure our epicurious customers will be surprised and delighted discovering the new range in store.\u201d\nIn the UK, food choices are becoming increasingly important in the debate about how to counter climate change, reflected in the rise of \u201cflexitarianism\u201d whereby a largely vegetable-based diet is supplemented occasionally with meat.\nIn November, Sainsbury\u2019s became the first major UK grocer to stock edible crickets \u2013 selling the roasted insects as snacks in small bags from the UK brand Eat Grub in 250 of its stores.\n\u201cHaving sold over 10,000 packs of Eat Grub crickets in less than three months, we\u2019re continuing to see Sainsbury\u2019s customers explore edible insects as a new sustainable protein source,\u201d said Katherine O\u2019Sullivan, Sainsbury\u2019s buying manager. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking to provide our customers with new and exciting products such as these.\u201d\nThe global edible insect market is forecast to exceed $520m (\u00a3395m) by 2023, according to recent research. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization said at least 2 billion people regularly consume insects and they could help meet the food needs of the world\u2019s growing population.\nMore than 1,000 insect species are eaten around the world but they hardly feature in the diets of many rich nations.

The Campaign to Protect Rural England\u2019s recent report on this very issue echoed many of these concerns, highlighting that soil degradation costs at least \u00a31.2bn a year in England and Wales alone. Soil must be seen not only as a fundamental for delivering productive farming and a healthy countryside, but also critical to tackling climate change \u2013 or mitigating its worst effects. Its importance should not be understated.\nThere are solutions, however. By scaling up and incentivising farmers to switch to nature-friendly farming techniques, such as conservation agriculture and agroforestry, we will create a productive farming industry that works with nature and enables farmers to reduce their costs, while still producing the food and services that we need. Rebuilding biological life in soils is vital to enabling this life-giving asset to function as it should. Our soil will once again effectively lock in carbon, store and filter water, support ecosystems and restore the health of the natural environment.Graeme WillisSenior rural policy campaigner at the Campaign to Protect Rural England \n\u2022 On page 3 of the Journal I read \u201cthe modern western diet needs a complete overhaul if we are to avoid potential ecological catastrophe\u201d (Eat less meat \u2013 and redraw the entire global food system, 28 January).

The Thai farmer says this will be his best-ever harvest in 30 years and he will reap it four weeks earlier than usual.\nIt is very different on the other side of the field. Here, Junpeng planted his rice in closely spaced clumps of 20 or more seedlings in shallow water just as he, his father and millions of other small farmers across south-east Asia have always done. He used the same seeds but the conventionally grown plants are wind-battered and thin, and clearly have fewer, smaller grains.\nJunpeng is part of a pilot project to see if it\u2019s possible to grow more rice with less water and fewer greenhouse gases. The dramatic difference between his two crops points a way to help the world\u2019s 145 million small rice farmers, and could also greatly reduce global warming emissions from agriculture.\nThe project, backed by the German and Thai governments and by some of the world\u2019s largest rice traders and food companies, has seen 3,000 other farmers in this corner of Thailand\u2019s \u201crice basket\u201d near the Cambodian border trained to grow sustainable rice according to the principles of a revolutionary agronomical system discovered by accident in Madagascar in the 1980s.\nJesuit priest Henri de Lalani\u00e9 working in the highlands observed that by planting far fewer seeds than usual, using organic matter as a fertiliser and keeping the rice plants alternately wet and dry rather than flooded, resulted in yields that were increased by between 20 and 200%, while water use was halved. Giving plants more oxygen, minimising the competition between them and strictly controlling the water they receive is thought to make them stronger and more resilient to flood and drought.\nWhen it was first employed outside Madagascar in 2000, the system of rice intensification (SRI) was dismissed  by a handful of scientists who questioned the legitimacy of the reported increased yields. But since then, it has evolved and been developed by peasant farmers working in many different climates around the world.\nAcademic criticism has since all but disappeared and the SRI system of farming has been validated in hundreds of scientific papers and adopted by up to 20 million farmers in 61 countries, according to the SRI information centre in Cornell University.\n\u201cThe results consistently cite yield increases, decreased use of seed, water and chemicals, and increased income,\u201d says Norman Uphoff, professor of global agriculture at Cornell.\nVietnamese, Cambodian, Nepalese, Filipino, Indian and African farmers have all reported large increases. In 2011, a young Indian farmer broke the world record for rice production, harvesting 22 tonnes from a single hectare (2.47 acres).\n\u201cSRI is very positive in west Africa. It uses fewer seed and fertilisers and needs less water. Farmers saved up to 80% of the cost of seed and got increased yields and incomes. They see the advantages and they change. People are teaching each other now,\u201d says Professor Bancy Mati, director of the water research centre at Jomo Kenyatta University in Nairobi, Kenya.\nThe Thai farmers who took part in the Ubon Ratchathani trial say they are delighted. Says Khampha Bunchansee from Noan Dang village: \u201cIt was very easy to learn. I will use the extra money to invest in a tractor. If I can do it, anyone can. Everyone can come and learn.\u201d\n\u201cI applied more fertiliser on my conventional crop but it produced lots more leaf but not more grain,\u201d says Wanna Sriwila, also from Noan Dang. \u201cNow I bring other farmers to see what can be done. Seeing is believing.\u201d\nBut what is now exciting some of the world\u2019s largest food corporations and governments is that growing rice along SRI principles also greatly reduces emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane, which escapes when rice, or any other crop, lies waterlogged for weeks at a time.\nMethane is roughly 30 times more powerful than CO2 as a greenhouse gas, and rice emits as much as 1.5% of the world\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions. With the human population in south-east Asia expected to grow by around 100m people in the next 20 years, emissions from rice growing could increase 30% or more.\nThe urgency to act for the global good, self-interest in maintaining production and the possibility of accessing money to reduce farm emissions has now led heavy rice-using food companies like Mars and Kellogg\u2019s, and the agri-business colossus Olam, to set up the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP).\nThis coalition of companies, NGOs and governments sets the world\u2019s first voluntary sustainability standards for rice growing. It adopts the basic SRI principle of planting seedlings further apart, and keeping them moist rather than flooded, but adds targets and measurements to provide consistency.\n\u201cRice is both a victim and a cause of climate change,\u201d says Sunny Verghese, CEO of Singapore-based Olam\u2019s, which grows its own rice on 25,000 acres in Nigeria, owns mills and processing plants across south-east Asia and ships nearly 20% of the world\u2019s globally traded rice.\n\u201cSouth-east Asian rice farmers are among the world\u2019s most vulnerable to climate change impacts such as rising sea levels, salinity, temperature rise and droughts. Yields can decrease as much as 10% for each 1C temperature increase, threatening food security for billions of people.\n\u201cWith another two billion people we cannot carry on the way we are. We must go beyond what is currently being done and achieve far more at greater scale. We must re-imagine the whole food supply chain if the world is to become carbon neutral by 2050,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSRI should influence everyone\u2019s thinking. In Nigeria we saw a 70% increase in yields, albeit from a low base. SRI is revolutionary. It is a genuine change in thinking. It is difficult for scientists to understand that an amateur [like Lalani\u00e9] should have a solution. We want to partner with SRI, to scale up in Africa.\n\u201cBut reducing emissions from rice cannot be a trade-off that hurts farmers and communities who depend on it for their income and sustenance. We have to measure the true cost of food and dismantle the subsidy system.\u201d\nWorking with German development agency GIZ and south-east Asian governments, Olam now plan to roll out SRP rice to 100,000 farmers in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and India within five years, increasing yields and incomes, and reducing methane emissions by 50%.\nGovernments and global bodies must act too, says tropical agronomist Erika Styger, director of climate-resilient farming systems at Cornell University who led a three-year World Bank study of 50,000 farmers using SRI methods in 13 west African countries. This saw a 56% rise in yields in irrigated areas, an 86% increase in rain-fed areas and an average 41% increase in income.\n\u201cThe SRI revolution is happening. People are changing their practices and you can see SRI in the field in many places now. There is no reason why SRI should not become normal agronomic practice,\u201d says Styger.\n\u201cBut there is no long term funding. If we want to make it mainstream it needs to get to a critical mass. We are left with breadcrumbs, with only short-term project finding,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThe food system is broken. Olam on its own cannot fix it, we can only change it. We can\u2019t do it overnight but there is a new way of collaborating. Companies must change and reduce their resource intensity. The whole food sector must change,\u201d says Verghese.\n\u201cWhat is needed now is large retailers to brand SRP. It\u2019s the way we can reduce emissions, use less water and grow more. Win. Win.

Chris Uhlmann and Alan Moran blamed the high prices on wind power, Pauline Hanson called for people to use more power and Judith Sloan called demand management a bribe.\nThere were three notable things that happened with our energy system during what will become the new normal of extreme heat. \nAt the end of last week it was hot. Like, record-breaking, fry an egg on the pavement hot. Many parts of South Australian and Victoria faced their hottest days on record.\nAs Australians tried their best to stay cool, almost everyone who had an air conditioner switched it on and we experienced a \u201cpeak demand\u201d event. This is a period where our electricity system is stretched to its limit and wholesale electricity prices reach their peak.\nUpdated: pic.twitter.com/IclDc3fpai\nAs our planet warms we can expect more days like Thursday and Friday. While we still have time to avert the worst impacts of climate change, some warming is now locked in and that means the heatwaves we have experienced more than once already this summer are now an inevitable part of Australia\u2019s future.\nSo what should we do about it?\nAustralia needs to get serious about reducing climate pollution, which continues to rise and do our contribution to stop runaway global warming.\nWe can improve our houses and building so they better manage the heat. Australian houses are sometimes called leaky tents; they let in the heat in summer and the cold in winter.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Insulation, double-glazing, draft proofing, better building standards, all these things will keep your house passively cool and reduce (though not eliminate) the amount of air conditioning you need. It\u2019s not rocket science, but currently we aren\u2019t doing any of this.\nWe can also upgrade our air conditioners to be more energy efficient. According to energy analyst Tristan Edis, new air conditioners use half the electricity of the majority of air conditioners that were installed in the early 2000s. On hot days, this would make a significant difference.\nOur coal and gas plants are ageing. As they age, they breakdown and need maintenance more often. Last week was a case in point. In Victoria, Yallourn power station took one of its units offline for maintenance and another had to be taken offline unexpectedly early Friday morning. Also in Victoria, Loy Yang A had a boiler tube leak just before the heatwave hit and was out for the duration. In New South Wales, Liddell and the Tallawarra gas plants were both offline for many days due to unplanned faults.\nThese six coal and gas units totalling 2,225MWs of capacity were not available for at least some of the period of Australia\u2019s most intensive heatwave on record.\nThis is at best a sign that our coal plants are getting old and can\u2019t be relied on at peak times and at worst it was price-gouging behaviour by some of Australia\u2019s largest energy companies.\nWe need to get serious about demand response. Demand response is when households and industry are paid not to use electricity for some nonessential operations for a period of time. While this isn\u2019t a great idea all year round, for a few hours on a few days a year it\u2019s the cheapest and most effective way of maintaining an electricity system. This is standard practice in the US and Europe where they even have markets for demand response. This is urgently needed here, but was resisted by rule-maker, the Australian Electricity Market Commission (AEMC), until late last year.\nWe also need to continue to build new electricity supply in the form of solar, wind, battery storage, pumped hydro and similar.\nAt the end of last week we experienced two types of blackouts. First there were localised blackouts affecting about 25,000 households in South Australia on Thursday night. These were due to fuses blowing in our distribution infrastructure. These fuses are designed to blow when infrastructure gets too hot so that it isn\u2019t damaged. This was the electricity system working as it should. It isn\u2019t surprising given the record temperatures.\nThe second type of blackout experienced was \u201cload shedding\u201d. This is where the market operator temporarily cuts off some energy users from the system to ensure \u201csystem integrity\u201d and to ensure it doesn\u2019t fail catastrophically. In Victoria on Friday afternoon, 160,000 customers were blacked-out over a two-to-three-hour period.\nLoad shedding is the action of last resort and Aemo did everything it could before taking this path. It fired up emergency reserves, asked big energy users to power down and appealed to us to lower our electricity use.\nAustralia\u2019s electricity system is incredibly reliable, typically exceeding our reliability standard of 99.998%. That basically means that the electricity supply needed is available 99.998% of the time.\nAlmost all blackouts in Australia (96.6% according to the AEMC) are because of faults in the poles and wires. What happened on Friday was very rare \u2013 only 0.2% of blackouts occur because there isn\u2019t enough operational generation in the system.\nHowever, particularly for people suffering health conditions as well as older and younger people, power outages are dangerous and they aren\u2019t good for business either.\nSo what should we do about it?\nWe need more on-demand capacity \u2013 there is need for storage (batteries and pumped hydro) and dispatchable solutions (concentrating solar thermal and demand response), that can turn on and ramp up quickly.\nRenewables (hydro, solar and wind) account for about 20% of generation in the National Electricity Market, higher in South Australia. Over the two-day period in question, renewables averaged higher than 20% generation and on Friday afternoon, when power was needed most, a combination of hydro, wind and solar provided over one-third of Victoria and South Australia\u2019s power.\nHowever, while wind and solar will provide the bulk of our annual electricity need in the future, there is need for on-demand solutions. These solutions will fill the gaps in the two to six hours overnight where there is a lull in the wind, or when forecasts (demand or supply) are wrong.\nThe good news is that CSIRO and Aemo have found that just such solutions \u2013 wind and solar backed by batteries and pumped hydro are also the cheapest new-build options to deliver reliable, clean electricity supply.\nWe need to recognise climate change is causing more heatwaves which brings increased risk of localised blackouts and even load shedding. We need to start adapting to this new normal. One strategy to do this would be to create community cool zones where people can go to stay cool in extreme heat. These cool zones should have backup power that means they will stay cool even during blackouts.\nFinally, we also need to have strategies for giving people, particularly vulnerable people, more notice of potential blackouts. If we get serious about demand management there will be better systems in place to provide this notice to people and even incentives and support for folks to go to the movies or a community cool zone.\nWhile we can never have an electricity system that is 100% reliable, there are straightforward policy and engineering solutions that can increase our electricity system\u2019s resilience to climate change in the future.\nNicky Ison is the founding director of the Community Power Agency and research associate at the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology Sydney.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-weather", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/natural-disasters", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "We still have time to avert the worst impacts of climate change, but heatwaves are now an inevitable part of Australia\u2019s future", "date_published": {"$date": 1548885119000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548916008000}, "authors": ["Nicky Ison"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "Coal", "Australia weather", "Energy", "Fossil fuels", "Australia news", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Renewable energy", "South Australia", "Victoria", "New South Wales"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/31/what-happened-to-our-electricity-system-in-the-heat-coal-and-gas-plants-failed", "og:description": "We still have time to avert the worst impacts of climate change, but heatwaves are now an inevitable part of Australia\u2019s future", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a8b54b719085976187e7de6e7d4053995911804/0_307_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=683fc815376383ad10db0944986fc829", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "What happened to our electricity system in the heat?

These suggest progress in other aspects of tackling climate change is also possible, with greater effort from the public and private sectors.\nThe WIR looked at six key goals that have been pegged as necessary to cause emissions to peak in 2020 and achieve the targets of the 2015 Paris agreement. They include goals on energy, transport, land use, industry, infrastructure and finance.\nThe report found that renewable energy accounted for about a quarter of global electricity generation in 2017, and more than two-thirds of new power generation capacity. By 2020, electricity from renewables is likely to be consistently cheaper than fossil fuel energy, making it possible that 30% of electricity could come from renewable sources by 2030, one of the Mission2020 milestones.\nBut coal-fired generation is still increasing, with coal-fired power plants continuing to be built in some areas, while existing plants are not being removed from service fast enough. Electric vehicles, meanwhile, comprise 1.4% of overall sales, making a 2020 milestone of 15% of new car sales hard to reach.\nThe goals are the work of Mission 2020, a global coalition of several climate analysis organisations, headed by Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who negotiated the Paris accord. Mission 2020 has calculated that if these milestones are achieved by 2020, it will make the longer-term Paris goals possible \u2013 because progress now on reducing emissions will make it easier and cheaper to reduce them in the longer term \u2013 and wants to spur sufficient progress on climate change to bring that about.\nFigueres is attending the World Economic Forum in Davos to press political and business leaders for more support for climate change initiatives. She said: \u201cThe impacts [of climate change] have never been as clear, nor action so urgent, as we are quickly approaching tipping points of no return. It would follow, then, that leaders everywhere should now be discussing this number one concern as their number one priority.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThe decisions we take over the next two to three years are crucial for the unprecedented structural changes we must embark on to safeguard our climate and clean up our air. This is the make it or break it opportunity we have, knowing that the world is expected to invest about $90tn on infrastructure in the period up to 2030, with much of this investment to be programmed in the next few years.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Thinktank says not enough is being done to cut coal burning and end fossil fuel subsidies", "date_published": {"$date": 1548179636000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548238157000}, "authors": ["Fiona Harvey"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Fossil fuels", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Energy", "Paris climate agreement", "Environment", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/22/analysis-warns-lack-progress-2020-global-emissions-target", "og:description": "Thinktank says not enough is being done to cut coal burning and end fossil fuel subsidies", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78ee0af6b0e6fa41a5ebc4845ee0bf68997249c3/266_433_3170_1901/master/3170.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=1df6121134d1d1ae1a12f7e28c7d93ab", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Analysis warns of lack of progress on 2020 global emissions target"}, "headline": "0", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78ee0af6b0e6fa41a5ebc4845ee0bf68997249c3/266_433_3170_1901/master/3170.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25c936dc63a7a6909bddadd0c6544468", "width": "3170", "height": "1901", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78ee0af6b0e6fa41a5ebc4845ee0bf68997249c3/266_433_3170_1901/master/3170.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9e883a1f757389871ac2a59d7e5709e0", "description": "A coal-fired power station near the town of Ptolemaida in northern Greece.\nPhotograph: Alexandros Avramidis/Reuters"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07a1ba2c3613145ed8ce0"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/02/climate-change-environment-2019-future-reasons-hope", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Extreme weather hit the headlines throughout 2018, from the heatwave across much of the northern hemisphere, which saw unprecedented wildfires in Sweden, drought in the UK and devastating wildfires in the US, to floods in India and typhoons in south-east Asia.\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organisation, last year was the fourth hottest on record and confirms a trend of rising temperatures that is a clear signal that we are having an effect on the climate. Droughts, floods, fiercer storms and heatwaves, as well as sea level rises, are all expected to increase markedly as a result.\nLate in the year there was also the starkest warning yet from scientists of what our future will be if we allow climate change to take hold. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the global body of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists, which has been producing regular reports on the state of climate science since 1988, produced its latest comprehensive overview examining what the future will look like if we undergo 1.5C (2.7F) of warming.\nThat does not sound like a lot \u2013 most people would be hard put to notice a temperature difference of 1.5C \u2013 but in climate terms, 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is enough to take us into the danger zone. It would see the mass die-off of coral reefs, the extinction of some species, rising sea levels, wet areas of the world becoming wetter and dry areas drier, and the decline of agricultural productivity across swaths of the globe.\nThat is a future we should obviously try to avoid. But the UN climate conference in Poland that ended the year\u2019s climate-related events in December showed little sign that the urgency of the scientists\u2019 warnings had been heeded. Instead, countries discussed a \u201crulebook\u201d for putting the 2015 Paris agreement into practice, including such arcane matters as how countries measure and verify their emissions, and how often they should report on them, and rows over carbon credits.\nIn Poland, there were no firm commitments to ramp up countries\u2019 national targets in line with scientific advice, and this is unlikely to happen before 2020 at the earliest. On current national emissions-cutting targets, we are in for about 3C of warming. Yet the IPCC warned that if we want to avoid 1.5C of warming, we have about 12 years to bring global emissions under control and swiftly move to just half of their current level. That represents a massive shift needed in the global economy, and yet emissions worldwide look to be moving upward again slightly after a decade in which they showed signs of stabilising.\nThere was also bad news from the US at the talks, which played little part as Donald Trump prepares to withdraw from the Paris agreement, except to hold a side event at the conference celebrating a bright future for coal.\nLooked at this way, the omens from 2018 were not good. Fortunately, however, 2019 may indeed be a breakthrough year. Public opinion is mobilising around the world and politicians and businesses are paying attention. There will be a series of high-profile events that will engage the public and governments and may provide a better way forward than was managed last year.\nChief among them is the promise of Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, to hold a summit for world leaders that will require them to face up to the dangers of climate change head on. Guterres is uncompromising, warning in Poland that it would be \u201cimmoral and suicidal\u201d not to take firm and urgent action commensurate with the scale of the problem.\nLeaders will be put on the spot, and will come under very public pressure as coalitions of civil society groups seek to put their case around the summit and in the lead-up to it. The role of women, who are among the most vulnerable to climate change, will be highlighted, and the role of young people, who will have to live with the consequences of their elders\u2019 mistakes in a warming world.\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, is also holding a One World Summit, planned for the summer, at which the focus will be on persuading businesses to take a leading role, investing in projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and changing the way they use energy.\nThere are clear signs of hope on climate change also in the rapidly falling cost of renewable energy technology, which is now competitive with fossil fuels. And the Keep it in the ground campaign has succeeded in encouraging many investors to move their money out of fossil fuel stocks.\nBut most of all the civil society campaigns which have ramped up in 2018 and look set to increase their momentum in the coming year are taking effect. Public opinion around the world is that our leaders, governments and businesses should be doing more on this vital issue. This can be seen in some unexpected ways, such as the rise of veganism and flexitarian eating, as people seek to reduce their impact on the climate from eating meat. Through well-publicised and effective movements and actions, more and more people are refusing silently to acquiesce in ignoring the dangers to the climate.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "As we reflect on a year of extreme weather and ominous climate talks, 2019 could see some much-needed breakthroughs", "date_published": {"$date": 1546408806000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1546439861000}, "authors": ["Fiona Harvey"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "Membership"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/02/climate-change-environment-2019-future-reasons-hope", "og:description": "As we reflect on a year of extreme weather and ominous climate talks, 2019 could see some much-needed breakthroughs", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cfc0f259f855c2a6a0e34515826cd9a66f42f7f/0_28_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=da936d8c5cf178abaf6aafac2db15e25", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "'Momentum is growing': reasons to be hopeful about the environment in 2019"}, "headline": "0", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cfc0f259f855c2a6a0e34515826cd9a66f42f7f/0_28_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9577e0d71d8a17c9146333eda07c9175", "width": "3500", "height": "2101", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cfc0f259f855c2a6a0e34515826cd9a66f42f7f/0_28_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=189eed7289d476b5ce461dd8289dce2c", "description": "People enjoying the heatwave on Bournemouth beach in Dorset as the hot weather spread across the UK in summer, marking the driest start to a summer since modern records began in 1961.\nPhotograph: Andrew Matthews/PA"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07a33a2c3613145ed8ce7"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/06/live-in-hope-die-in-caergwrle", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "I was a magistrate who had to retire on turning 70, and it is entirely right that I had to do so.

I assume I\u2019ve fallen far enough that I\u2019ve pulled my climbing partner, Sean, into the crevasse with me. This is what it\u2019s like to die in the mountains, a voice in my head tells me.\nJust as my mind completes that thought, the rope wrenches my climbing harness up. I bounce languidly up and down as the dynamic physics inherent in the rope play themselves out. Somehow Sean has checked my fall while still on the surface of the glacier.\nI brush the snow and chunks of ice from my hair, arms and chest and pull down the sleeves of my shirt. Finding my glacier glasses hanging from the pocket of my climbing bib, I tuck them away. I check myself for injuries and, incredibly, find none. Assessing my situation, I find there\u2019s no ice shelf nearby to ease the tension from the rope, so Sean will not be able to begin setting up a pulley system to extract me.\nI look down. Nothing but blackness. I look at the wall of blue ice directly in front of me, take a deep breath and peer up at the tiny hole I made when I fell through the snow bridge spanning the crevasse \u2013 the same bridge Sean had crossed without incident as we made our way up Alaska\u2019s Matanuska Glacier towards Mount Marcus Baker in the Chugach Range.\n\u201cYou get to look down one more time, then that\u2019s it,\u201d I tell myself out loud.\nAgain, there\u2019s only the black void yawning beneath me, swallowing everything, even sound. My stomach clenches. I remind myself to breathe.\n\u201cSean, are you OK?\u201d I yell as I clamp my mechanical ascenders to the rope in preparation to climb up.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m all right, but I\u2019m right on the edge,\u201d he calls back. \u201cI can\u2019t set up an anchor, so we\u2019re just going to have to wait for the other guys to catch up.\u201d\nTime passes. The onset of hypothermia means I can\u2019t control my body from periodically shaking. To ignore my fear of dying, I gaze meditatively at the ice a few feet in front of me as I dangle.\nThe miniature air pockets found in the whiter ice near the top of the glacier have long since been compressed, producing the mesmerising beauty of centuries-old turquoise ice. Slightly deeper into the crevasse is ice that has been there since long before the Neanderthals.\nI hang suspended in silence, mindful not to move for fear of dislodging Sean. Giving my full attention to the ice immediately within my vision, I focus on how the gently refracting light from above seems to penetrate and reflect off the perfectly smooth wall. Staring into it, the blue seems infinite. Despite the danger of my situation, the glacier\u2019s beauty calms me.\nEventually our two other teammates arrive and work to extract Sean from his perch just six inches from the edge of the crevasse. The three of them set up a three-way pulley system. Laboriously, my teammates begin to haul me up, inches at a time, out of what nearly became my tomb. I continue to focus on the delicately shifting shades of blue in the ice as I draw closer to the surface.\nMy teammates pull me up to the lip of the crevasse. I repeatedly plunge the pick of my ice axe into the snow and haul myself out, never before as grateful for being on top of a glacier. I stand and gaze up at a mountain to the west, behind which the sun has just set. Snow plumes stream off one of its ridges, turned into red ribbons by the setting sun. Snowflakes flicker as they float into space.\nAs relief floods my shivering body, I roar in gratitude. Utterly overwhelmed by being alive and surrounded by the beauty of the mountain world, I hug each of my three climbing partners. Now that I am safe, it sinks in just how close to death I\u2019ve been.\nThat was 22 April 2003 \u2013 Earth Day. In hindsight, I believe the emotion I felt then stemmed in part from something else \u2013 a deeper consciousness that the ice I had seen was vanishing. Seven years of climbing in Alaska had provided me with a front-row seat from where I could witness the dramatic impact of human-caused climate disruption. Each year, we found that the toe of the glacier had shrivelled further. Each year, for the annual early season ice-climbing festival on this glacier, we found ourselves hiking further up the crusty frozen mud left behind by its rapidly retreating terminus. Each year, the parking lot was moved closer to the glacier, only to be left farther away as the ice withdrew. Even sections of Denali \u2013 the highest mountain in North America, which stands more than 20,000 feet tall and is roughly 250 miles from the Arctic Circle \u2013 had already undergone startling changes in 2003: the ice of its glaciers was disappearing quickly.\nOur planet is rapidly changing, and what we are witnessing is unlike anything that has occurred in human, or even geological, history. The heat-trapping nature of CO2 and methane, both greenhouse gases, has been scientific fact for decades, and according to Nasa, \u201cno question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response\u201d. Evidence shows that greenhouse gas emissions are causing the Earth to warm 10 times faster than it should, and the ramifications of this are being felt, quite literally, throughout the entire biosphere.\nOceans are warming at unprecedented rates, droughts and wildfires of increasing severity and frequency are altering forests around the globe, and the Earth\u2019s cryosphere \u2013 the parts of the Earth so cold that water is frozen into ice or snow \u2013 is melting at an ever-accelerating rate. The subsea permafrost in the Arctic is thawing, and we could experience a methane \u201cburp\u201d of previously trapped gas at any moment, causing the equivalent of several times the total amount of CO2 humans have emitted to be released into the atmosphere. The results would be catastrophic.\nClimate disruption also brings with it extreme weather such as hurricanes and floods. For instance, a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, leading to an increase in the frequency of severe major rain events, such as Hurricane Harvey over Houston in summer 2017, which dropped so much rain that the weight of the water actually caused the Earth\u2019s crust to sink by 2cm.\nEarth has not seen current atmospheric CO2 levels since the Pliocene epoch, some 3m years ago. Three-quarters of that CO2 will still be here in 500 years. It takes a decade to experience the full warming effects of CO2 emissions. Even if we stopped all greenhouse gas emissions, it would take another 25,000 years for most of what is currently in the atmosphere to be absorbed into the oceans.\nClimate disruption is progressing faster than ever, and faster than predicted. Seventeen of the 18 hottest years ever recorded have occurred since 2001. The distress signals from our overheated planet are all around us, with reports, studies and warnings increasing daily. Worst-case prediction made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change about the rise in temperatures, extreme weather, sea levels and CO2 levels in the atmosphere have fallen short of reality. Countless glaciers, rivers, lakes, forests and species are already vanishing at a pace never seen before, and all of this from increasing the global mean temperature by \u201conly\u201d 1C above the preindustrial baseline. Some scientists predict it could rise by as much as 10C by 2100. A study led by James Hansen, the former director of Nasa\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, warned that the rise we have seen so far has already caused unstoppable melting in both the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets.\nMountaineering in today\u2019s climate-disrupted world is a vastly different endeavour from what it used to be. Glaciers are vanishing before our eyes, having shrunk to the lowest levels ever recorded, and are now melting faster than ever. Seventy per cent of the glaciers in western Canada are projected to be gone by 2100. Montana\u2019s Glacier National Park will most likely not have any active glaciers by 2030. The Matanuska Glacier\u2019s ancient ice is already rapidly vanishing. Dramatic changes are occurring even in the planet\u2019s highest and coldest places. Even Mount Everest is transforming, as thousands of glaciers across the Himalayas are likely to shrink by up to 99% by 2100. A child born today will see an Everest largely free of glaciers within their lifetime.\nI lived in Alaska for a decade beginning in 1996, and spent time on the glaciers there. As early as the late 90s, large portions of the holiday season would go by in Anchorage without any snow on the ground. The waterfalls that my climbing friends and I had used for ice climbing barely froze some winters, and we could see the glaciers that we used to traverse to access peaks shrinking from year to year.\nIn Nepal the sacred mountain Machapuchare rises abruptly on the eastern boundary of the Annapurna Sanctuary. As a child I came across a photograph of this peak in a geography textbook and was immediately captivated by its majesty. Shaped like a fish\u2019s tail, the knife-edged ridge that forms its summit is a seemingly paper-thin line of rock that drops precipitously on either side, causing the apex of the peak \u2013 which is nearly half a mile higher than the top of Denali \u2013 to be one of the more dramatic summits anywhere. It is a masterpiece of nature.\nWhen I was 10 years old, I saw the Rocky Mountains of Colorado for the first time, their silhouettes against the setting sun, and I was awestruck. Years later I travelled to Alaska and drove a short way into Denali national park and preserve. When the afternoon clouds parted to reveal the majesty of Denali\u2019s summit, my first inclination was to bow in wonderment. A year after that I moved to Alaska, and began training myself in the mountaineering skills I needed to access these sanctuaries that stand far from the violence, speed and greed of society. John Muir, the Scottish-American naturalist, author, philosopher and early wilderness-preservation advocate, captured my feelings precisely: \u201cI am losing precious days. I am degenerating into a machine for making money. I am learning nothing in this trivial world of men. I must break away and get out into the mountains to learn the news.\u201d\nA glacier is essentially suspended energy, suspended force. It is, in a sense, life frozen in time. But now they are themselves running out of time. The planet\u2019s ecosystems, pushed far beyond their capacity to adapt to human-generated traumas and stresses, are in a state of freefall. Just as I watched hundreds of years of time compressed into glacial ice flash before my eyes in a matter of seconds as I fell into the crevasse, swathes of the natural world are, in the blink of a geological eye, falling into oblivion.\nModern life has compressed time and space. You can traverse the globe in a matter of hours, or gain information in nanoseconds. The price for this, along with everything we want, on demand, all the time, is a total disconnection from the planet that sustains our lives.\nI venture into the wilds and into the mountains in large part to allow space and time to stretch themselves back to what they were. The frenetic pace of contemporary life is having a devastating impact on this planet. Humans have transformed more than half the ice-free land on Earth. We have changed the composition of the atmosphere and the chemistry of the oceans from which we came. We now use more than half the planet\u2019s readily accessible freshwater runoff, and the majority of the world\u2019s major rivers have been either dammed or diverted.\nAs a species, we now hang over the abyss of a geoengineered future we have created for ourselves. At our insistence, our voracious appetite is consuming nature itself. We have refused to heed the warnings Earth has been sending, and there is no rescue team on its way.\nAt the end of July 2017 I flew to Alaska\u2019s northern shore. A couple of days after my arrival I took a morning walk along the Arctic Ocean. The only thing that was a constant was the shore beneath my boots and the crunching sound of the tiny stones as I walked. Up here, only 1,300 miles from the north pole, the sun never sets in summer, and time stretches until it loses its meaning.\nUtqiagvik (formerly known as Barrow), one of several ancient villages in the area, is the northernmost incorporated point in the US. The indigenous people here, the I\u00f1upiat, have learned to live on the edge of the tundra and the seas, with the whales, the birds and the ice floes.\nI met 55-year-old Marvin Kanayurak, who was born and raised here, as were his parents. He is a whaler and volunteers doing rescues. He tells me how there used to be pressure ridges in the sea ice (formed when two ice floes are forced together) during the winter that were 50 or even 60 feet high, but now they are \u201clucky\u201d to find any even 20 feet tall. Heading out across the ice to find open water in the spring used to take them two weeks of plotting and making a trail. Now it takes them only a couple of days because the open water is so much closer.\nKanayurak had told me that he was a volunteer gravedigger. The permafrost used to be 10-12 inches below the surface, so it would take three days of chipping with an ice pick to dig a grave. Now the permafrost is several feet below the surface, and softer, so he can dig a grave in a few hours.\nPermafrost is a layer of ground that is continuously frozen for a period of two years or more. It contains dead plants that absorbed CO2 from the atmosphere centuries ago, and then froze before decomposing. When it thaws, microbial activity converts a large portion of that organic material into methane and CO2, which is released back into the atmosphere. According to a Nasa report, over hundreds of millennia, \u201cArctic permafrost soils have accumulated vast stores of organic carbon\u201d \u2013 an estimated 1,400-1,850 gigatonnes, compared to 850 gigatonnes of carbon in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nThat\u2019s equal to around half of all the estimated organic carbon in Earth\u2019s soils, with most of it located in the top 10 feet of thaw-vulnerable soil. Scientists, along with others, are learning that the Arctic permafrost is less permanent than its name implies. Estimates of how much carbon will be released by thawing permafrost show it could average around 1.5bn tonnes annually, which is roughly the same amount as current US annual emissions from burning fossil fuels. Dr Kevin Schaefer, a research scientist for the National Snow and Ice Data Center who studies permafrost carbon feedback (PCF) \u2013 the warming of the surface of the planet that would result from the release of carbon from the permafrost \u2013 estimates that PCF by itself will increase temperatures by 0.2C by 2100, and even more beyond that. This means PCF will have a significant effect on the long-term climate, even if the goal of limiting atmospheric temperatures to 2C is reached.\nWhile I was in Utqiagvik I spoke to Dr Vladimir Romanovsky, a professor of geophysics at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, who also specialises in permafrost. His lab has been collecting temperature data each year in many locations around the world, but mostly across Alaska, Canada and Russia.\n\u201cIf it comes closer to thawing point, then it becomes unstable,\u201d Romanovsky said. \u201cFor any permafrost research, that is the crucial data: what is the temperature and how stable is it?\u201d\nHis lab is unique in that it now has nearly 40 years of data records from a variety of locations, and he generates permafrost temperature modelling to explain how the temperatures are changing.\nThe changes in the permafrost happening across Alaska\u2019s North Slope are due to some of the most dramatic temperature increases in the world. In 35 years of measurements here, the temperature at 20 metres below the ground has increased by 3C since Romanovsky\u2019s first measurement, and at the surface of the permafrost one metre below the ground, the average temperature has increased by a staggering 5C since the mid-1980s. Even small increases bring the temperature of the permafrost closer to 0C. Crossing that line means the permafrost will start to thaw.\nScientists used to believe the permafrost was stable across the North Slope, and that it would not begin to thaw this century. Romanovsky said: \u201cIf you look at our records, however, and extrapolate into the future another 30 years, assuming changes continue as they have been for the last 30 years, the permafrost on the North Slope will hit 0C by 2050 or 2060 at the latest. Nobody was expecting this, and most people would be surprised to see this happen so soon.\u201d\nSchaefer also expressed concern about the impact that thawing permafrost will have on the infrastructure and people of the Arctic. \u201cThawing permafrost represents a radical change to the environment and way of life in the Arctic, with unknown social costs,\u201d he said. I asked if he thought it would be necessary to relocate most, if not all, of the coastal villages in northern Alaska. He said that as sea levels go up and permafrost thaws, \u201cthere is risk the thawing will destroy critical infrastructure, which will require repair or moving it, and that includes entire villages. If you built your village right next to the ocean and it starts to melt, you have to move. This is happening in interior Alaska along rivers, and it\u2019s also happening across the entire Arctic zone.\u201d\nRoads, railroads, oil and gas infrastructure, airports, seaports \u2013 all these things were built across the Arctic on the assumption that the permafrost would stay frozen. \u201cWhen it is frozen it is solid, but it thaws out and turns to mud, so it\u2019s easy to see this causing a lot of damage to infrastructure,\u201d Schaefer said.\nDr Leonid Yurganov, a senior research scientist at the University of Maryland Baltimore County physics department and the Joint Center for Earth Systems Technology, is an expert in the remote sensing of Arctic methane levels. He told me his team of researchers had already detected long-term increases in methane over large areas of the Arctic, and warned that the fast liberation of methane would influence air temperature near the surface and accelerate Arctic warming. \u201cThe difference in temperatures between the poles and the equator drives our air currents from west to east,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this difference diminishes, the west-to-east air transport becomes slower, and north-south air currents become stronger. This results in frequent changes in weather in the midlatitudes.\u201d\nIt would change the climate, he says, \u201ceverywhere in the world\u201d.\nTwo days after leaving Utqiagvik, I flew from Anchorage to Seattle on my way home. Forty-five minutes before we landed, while flying at 35,000 feet, the plane entered a cloud of brownish-grey smoke rising from the 146 wildfires scorching British Columbia beneath us. At that point, they had burned more than 600,000 acres and forced 7,000 people from their homes. We descended into the brown cloud until we landed in Seattle, which was also enveloped in the smoke.\nA couple of days later, a leaked draft report from US scientists across 13 federal agencies warned of a worst-case scenario of 18F warming over the Arctic between 2071 and 2100. The report also noted that the Arctic was losing more than 3.5% of its sea ice coverage every decade, that the extent of the September sea ice had declined more than 10% per decade, that the land ice was disappearing at an increasingly rapid rate and that the severity of winter storms was increasing because of warming temperatures.\nThe grim news seemed endless: the snow-free season on Alaska\u2019s North Slope is lengthening. The year 2016 experienced the longest snow-free season in 115 years of record-keeping \u2013 roughly 45% longer than the average snow-free period over the previous four decades. The October temperature at Utqiagvik increased by a staggering 7.2C between 1979 and 2012.\nWe are already facing mass extinction. There is no removing the heat we have introduced into the oceans, nor the 40bn tons of CO2 we pump into the atmosphere every single year. There may be no changing what is happening, and far worse things are coming. How, then, shall we meet this?\nLike so many people, I have wondered what to do at this time. Each of us now must find our own honest, natural response to the conditions that we have brought upon ourselves.\nI am heartened by people like my friend Karina Miotto in Brazil, who has devoted her entire life to protecting the Amazon. Each time a report is published about increased deforestation in her beloved rainforest, I watch Karina become consumed in grief. But each time, she goes deeper within herself and her community, further strengthening her love for that portion of the planet where she lives, and repurposes herself into her next action to protect the Amazon. I find solace in the fact that there are millions of others like Karina, particularly among the younger generations, who have drawn their lines around their respective portions of the planet closest to their hearts and are making their stands.\nI find my deepest conviction and connection to the Earth by communing with the mountains. I moved to Colorado and lived among them when I was in my early 20s, and it was there I began to deepen my relationship with them, and to really listen to them. I would hike out and just sit among the peaks, watching them for hours, and write about them in my journal. Today I know in my bones that my job is to learn to listen to them ever more deeply, and to share what they are telling us with those who are also listening.\nWhile western colonialist culture believes in \u201crights\u201d, many indigenous cultures teach of \u201cobligations\u201d that we are born into: obligations to those who came before, to those who will come after, and to the Earth itself. When I orient myself around the question of what my obligations are, a deeper question immediately arises: from this moment on, knowing what is happening to the planet, to what do I devote my life?\nThis is an edited extract from The End of Ice by Dahr Jamail, which will be published by The New Press on 15 January\n\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/poles", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alaska", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/extract"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The long read: As global temperatures rise, shrivelling glaciers and thawing permafrost threaten yet more climate disruption.

"topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Last year was Australia\u2019s third-warmest year on record, with every state and territory recording above average temperatures in 2018.\nAccording to the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s annual climate statement, the nation\u2019s average temperature last year was 1.14C above the average for 1961-1990, making 2018 slightly warmer than 2017.\n\u201cWhen we look across all of Australia in 2018, we can see that every single state and territory had above average day and night-time temperatures,\u201d the bureau\u2019s senior climatologist, Lynette Bettio, said in a statement on Thursday.\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThe average maximum temperature for the country as a whole was particularly warm, sitting 1.55 \u00b0C above the 1961\u20131990 average, making 2018 Australia\u2019s second warmest year on record for daily high temperatures.\nNine of the 10 warmest years on record in Australia have occurred since 2005.\nBettio said the only part of the country to buck the trend for above average temperatures was Western Australia\u2019s Kimberley region, which had cooler than average nights for the year.\nThe bureau said rainfall totals in Australia in 2018 were the lowest since 2005.\nThe total was 11% below the 1961-1990 average, but many areas experienced significantly lower average rainfalls, the bureau found.\nBettio said large areas of south-east Australia had rainfall totals in the lowest 10% on record.\nNew South Wales had its sixth-driest year on record while the Murray-Darling Basin had its seventh driest.\nHowever, some parts of northern Australia and south-east Western Australia received above average rainfall totals.\nThe climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute, Richie Merzian, said the data confirmed what Australians knew about climate change.\nHe said increasingly hotter years were the country\u2019s \u201cnew normal\u201d and polling by the institute showed just under three quarters of Australians (73%) had serious concerns about climate change.\n\u201cMost Australians will feel vindicated that 2018 was officially one of the hottest years on record, having felt the impacts that are now becoming the new norm,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have entered a new normal of increasingly hotter years and in 2018 we had a spike in Australians seriously concerned about the changing climate \u2013 73% in 2018, up from 66% in 2017.\u201d\nThe bureau\u2019s statement follows a run of exceptionally high temperatures around the nation late last month, along with a prolonged heatwave in Queensland in late November and early December.\nGlobally, 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record, according to the European Union\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service assessment, released on Tuesday.\nThe last four years have seen the highest average temperatures globally since records began in the 19th century.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Bureau of Meteorology says average temperature was 1.14C above

To generate electricity, a chemical reaction takes place that sees electrons move from the negative electrode, called the anode, to the positive electrode, called the cathode.\nWhen you charge the battery, the process is reversed, sending electrons back to the anode.\nThere is around 500MW of large-scale battery power installed around the UK, a figure that is expected to double within three years, according to the analysts Aurora Energy Research. Almost all capacity uses lithium-ion.\nGlobally installed power is expected to top 50GW by 2020 \u2013 and surge to almost 1,000GW by 2040, according to Bloomberg NEF. That would equate to about 7% of the world\u2019s energy capacity.\nIn the UK, battery installations are primarily being deployed to supply services to National Grid. Such ancillary services are increasingly important to help match supply and demand as a growing amount of intermittent wind and solar power comes online.\nThere are also the beginnings of \u201chybrid\u201d renewable energy power plants, where batteries are installed alongside solar farms and windfarms. This is particularly important for the economics of solar farms, which can push down power prices around midday by peaking at the same time. Instead of exporting immediately, hybrid farms can store power to sell later at higher prices.\nIn other parts of the world, such as South Australia, batteries are being used to make the grid more resilient and avoid blackouts. Crucially, batteries are not yet suitable and do not make economic sense for interseasonal storage \u2013 that is, storing up solar power in summer to release in winter.\nElon Musk may have popularised the concept of a home battery when he unveiled Tesla\u2019s version three years ago, but the firm was not the first and is not the biggest in this field. Such batteries, which are about the size of a gas boiler, can store and release electricity either generated by a household or imported from the grid.\nThe German firm Sonnen, which has around a 25% global market share in home batteries, said most customers today are people who have solar panels or live in storm-hit regions and want a clean, reliable backup source of power. \u201cThe market is still in the very, very early phase,\u201d says the chief executive, Christoph Ostermann. Germany, Italy, Australia and the US states of California and Hawaii are the biggest markets so far.\nFor solar households, it makes more financial sense to store and consume the energy rather than be paid for exporting it to the grid. In future, as more time-of-use energy tariffs emerge, there might also be enough of an incentive to install one to avoid peak pricing.\nHowever, for Ostermann, the most exciting prospect is harnessing thousands of the batteries as a \u201cvirtual power plant\u201d. He describes this as an \u201cUberisation\u201d of batteries that the company does not own but can call on, with permission. \u201cWe are not heading for utility scale, but virtual power plants can provide significant power,\u201d he says.\nWe are just beginning to see the second generation of battery-powered vehicles, according to the entrepreneur Henrik Fisker, the founder of the electric car maker Fisker Inc. He views affordability and a decent range between charges as this crop\u2019s defining features.\nWhile the first models, with the exception of Tesla, could manage around 100 miles, most new ones now offer between 200-300 miles. \u201cI see the market starting to boom around 2020 or 2021, as there is more choice [of models],\u201d says Fisker.\nFisker also views ultrafast charging as vital to helping electric cars go mainstream. While a typical home will take about 8-10 hours to fully top up a car (with a 3KW socket), some new public chargers can do that in about 10 minutes (using a 350KW charger).\nElectric double-decker buses, built by the Chinese manufacturer BYD, already ply the streets of London. Elon Musk has announced plans for an electric truck.\nBut the energy density required for heavy transport makes it a lot harder for batteries to beat fossil fuels. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely more challenging,\u201d says Prof Paul Shearing, the Royal Academy of Engineering\u2019s chair in emerging battery technologies. \u201c[But] I think the future is going to be electric, no matter which way you cut it.\u201d\nWill we all be flying around in electric jumbo jets soon? \u201cNot yet,\u201d says Shearing, who adds that energy density and weight of batteries meant there would probably only be used in unmanned aerial vehicles in the short term. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a long time until we see an electric passenger plane,\u201d he says.\nA key element in lithium-ion batteries is cobalt, despite manufacturers\u2019 attempt to reduce the amount required. More than 60% world\u2019s cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where concerns have been raised about the social and environmental impact of mining the metal.\nThe lithium in the batteries comes mainly from three big producer countries, Australia, Argentina and Chile, along with emerging producers such as Bolivia, Brazil, Canada and Zimbabwe. Water consumption and scarcity in some producer countries is the big concern here. \u201cThere are definite ethics issues. Large companies are going to be driven by cost,\u201d says Shearing, of cobalt and lithium production.\nWhat happens to the batteries towards the end of their life is also a big challenge. Dr Jonathan Radcliffe, of the school of chemical engineering at the University of Birmingham, is worried about the fate of batteries when their performance in today\u2019s crop of electric vehicles is no longer good enough for cars. Some now have a second life as a home battery, but he fears the market could be saturated in a few years, undermining the financial case for reuse.\n\u201cThe risk is that there is no viable second-use in the UK and we have a large amount of battery waste, without the processes in place to deal with it,\u201d he says.\nThe bigger and denser the battery, the more chemical energy it can store and therefore the more electricity it can generate. But a bigger, denser battery is more expensive, heavier, takes longer to charge and has more potential for destruction if things go wrong.\nThe chemistry and internal construction of the battery also plays a role in how much energy it can store. Lithium-based batteries are popular because they have a relatively high energy-to-weight ratio and maintain their charge well when not in use.\nIn most devices, battery life is a trade-off between physical size, design, energy density and safety, alongside the energy efficiency of the device it powers.\nMost batteries can only maintain their full capacity for a finite time and number of charge and discharge cycles. The exact process of battery ageing is still a hot research topic, but there are several mechanisms at play that occur when the battery is used or stored.\nThe most common is the build-up of material on the anode, which slowly gets deposited when the battery is used or stored. A similar oxidation can also occur on the cathode, while the active ingredients of the battery can react and degrade over time. A combination of these effects reduce the amount of lithium ions and active material available for storing electricity, therefore reducing maximum capacity.\nBut the internal resistance of the battery can also increase as it ages, meaning its peak power output is lower, a process that causes issues in iPhones.\nHow a battery is used and stored can dramatically affect its ageing. For instance, batteries can be damaged by exposing them to extremes of temperature, which is more problematic for a car or similar than a smartphone.\nRapid cycling of the battery also increases wear, particularly if the power demands on the battery are very high, as is the case with electric cars. Charging and using the battery to its extremes also accelerates ageing, such as charging batteries to their maximum and discharging them to zero.\nSafety was thrown into the spotlight when some of the batteries inside the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 developed a fault that caused them to short circuit and catch fire.\nWhen something disrupts the chemical reaction inside the battery, it can cause \u201cthermal runaway\u201d, where uncontrolled reactions chain together, generating too much heat, typically resulting in batteries bursting or catching fire.\nVarious safety mechanisms, both electrical control circuits and physical measures including shielding and battery structure, mean such events are rare. But they are of particular concern for portable devices, which are often held on a person, and electric vehicles that may be involved in a collision that could damage the integrity of the battery.\nCompanies are working hard to increase the amount of energy that can be packed into a battery, and to bring down the cost of making them.\nFuture prices are unlikely to fall as fast as they have in the past, says Ostermann, because reductions have already been so rapid. Sonnen has seen prices fall from more than \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3905) per kilowatt hour of energy capacity when it started in 2010, to about \u20ac150-200 per kWh today. But the company expects to cut costs in electronics such as inverters.\nNew wonder materials will take a while to break through, Shearing says. \u201cThe next 10 years are going to continue to be lithium-ion dominated. It\u2019s taken a long time to get to this productivity and technological maturity level. For anything to catch up will take a while.\u201d\nMost innovation will be around lithium-ion, he believes, such as improving the energy density and lowering costs by reducing the amount of cobalt in a battery. The rate at which batteries can take on a charge will also improve, Shearing adds.\nRadcliffe agrees that lithium-ion will continue to dominate. Cost and performance will improve, driven by the scale-up of manufacturing and continued research, he says.\nBatteries will also be put to new uses. Fisker says that as technology improves, he expects to see them eventually appear on construction sites, in mines and in industrial equipment, replacing diesel generators. They will be deployed in increasingly small devices, such as medical implants, Shearing says.\n\u2022 This article was amended on 17 January 2019.

The scientists say it is therefore the choices being made by global society, not physics, which is the obstacle to meeting the goal.\nThe study found that if all fossil fuel infrastructure \u2013 power plants, factories, vehicles, ships and planes \u2013 from now on are replaced by zero-carbon alternatives at the end of their useful lives, there is a 64% chance of staying under 1.5C.\nIn October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the difference between 1.5C of warming and the earlier international target of 2C was a significantly lower risk of drought, floods, heatwaves and poverty for hundreds of millions of people.\nChristopher Smith, of the University of Leeds, who led the research, said: \u201cIt\u2019s good news from a geophysical point of view. But on the other side of the coin, the [immediate fossil fuel phaseout] is really at the limit of what we could we possibly do. We are basically saying we can\u2019t build anything now that emits fossil fuels.\u201d\nNicholas Stern, of the London School of Economics, who was not part of the research team, said: \u201cWe are rapidly approaching the end of the age of fossil fuels. This study confirms that all new energy infrastructure must be sustainable from now on if we are to avoid locking in commitments to emissions that would lead to the world exceeding the goals of the Paris agreement.\u201d \nThe study, published in the journal Nature Communications, used computer models to estimate by how much global temperatures would rise if a fossil fuel infrastructure phaseout began immediately. The lifespan for power plants was set at 40 years, cars an average of 15 years and planes 26 years. The work also assumes a rapid end to beef and dairy consumption, which is responsible for significant global emissions.\nIn this scenario, the models suggest carbon emissions would decline to zero over the next four decades and there would be a 66% chance of the global temperature rise remaining below 1.5C. If the phaseout does not begin until 2030, the chance is 33%.\nThe analysis did not include the possibility of tipping points such as the sudden release of huge volumes of methane from permafrost, which could spark runaway global warming.\nThe scientists accept their scenario is at the extreme end of ambition, but said it was important to know that meeting the 1.5C target was still physically possible and dependent on the choices made now and in the coming years. \u201cThe climate system is not stopping you [hitting the target], global society is stopping you,\u201d Smith said.\nOther work, using a different approach, has also shown that keeping within the 1.5C limit is possible if radical action is taken immediately. In some sectors, zero-carbon technology already exists, such as renewable energy. But in others, such as aviation, it does not. \u201cMaybe the solution here is flying less,\u201d Smith said.\nProf Dave Reay, of the University of Edinburgh, who also was not part of the research team, said: \u201cWhether it\u2019s drilling a new gas well, keeping an old coal power station open, or even buying a diesel car, the choices we make today will largely determine the climate pathways of tomorrow. The message of this new study is loud and clear: act now or see the last chance for a safer climate future ebb away.\u201d\nSmith\u2019s personal belief is that global heating will surpass 1.5C. \u201cWe are going the right way, but I don\u2019t think we will do enough, quickly enough. I think we are heading for 2C to 2.5C.\u201d\nBut he added: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a goal, you are not going to get anywhere. If you have a target that is really hard to achieve and you miss it slightly, that is better than wandering aimlessly into a future climate that is no good for anybody.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Scientists say it may still technically be possible to limit warming to 1.5C if drastic action is taken now", "date_published": {"$date": 1547568019000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1547577004000}, "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Fossil fuels", "Energy", "Environment", "Climate change", "Science"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/15/immediate-fossil-fuel-phaseout-could-arrest-climate-change-study", "og:description": "Scientists say it may still technically be possible to limit warming to 1.5C if drastic action is taken now", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b87eee384507d49a79a828fffc80b7eed7501313/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=d2c84ebc6b53755652f945231beb70c5", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Immediate fossil fuel phaseout could arrest climate change \u2013 study"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b87eee384507d49a79a828fffc80b7eed7501313/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e5dd48ef35cbb7b471d50ec681a12bd1", "width": "7360", "height": "4417", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b87eee384507d49a79a828fffc80b7eed7501313/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd22ee083935ccefd0105180f3ac36f8", "description": "The study found there is a 66% chance of staying below 1.5C above pre-industrial levels if immediate action is taken.\nPhotograph: Alamy"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07a66a2c3613145ed8cfd"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/16/global-tensions-holding-back-climate-change-fight-says-wef", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Growing tension between the world\u2019s major powers is the most urgent global risk and makes it harder to mobilise collective action to tackle climate change, according to a report prepared for next week\u2019s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\nThe WEF\u2019s annual global risks report found that a year of extreme weather-related events meant environmental issues topped the list of concerns in a survey of around 1,000 experts and decision-makers.\nBut with Donald Trump announcing protectionist measures aimed at China and the European Union in 2018, the report said the international cooperation needed to limit further global warming was breaking down.\n\u201cGlobal risks are intensifying but the collective will to tackle them appears to be lacking. Instead, divisions are hardening,\u201d the report said, noting that nine out of 10 people polled said they expected relations between the leading powers to worsen in 2019.\n\u201cThe world\u2019s move into a new phase of strongly state-centred politics, noted in last year\u2019s Global Risks Report, continued throughout 2018.\u201d\nThe global economy slowed in the second-half of 2018 and the report said activity this year would be held back by growing geo-economic tensions, with 88% of respondents expecting further erosion of multilateral trading rules and agreements.\nB\u00f8rge Brende, president of the World Economic Forum, said: \u201cWith global trade and economic growth at risk in 2019, there is a more urgent need than ever to renew the architecture of international cooperation.\u201d \n\u201cWe simply do not have the gunpowder to deal with the kind of slowdown that current dynamics might lead us towards. What we need now is coordinated, concerted action to sustain growth and to tackle the grave threats facing our world today,\u201d he said.\nEnvironmental risks continued to dominate the risks report, although there were also long-term concerns about the dangers posed by cybersecurity breaches in the years ahead.\nThe report tracks five environmental risks: biodiversity loss, extreme weather events, failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation, man-made disasters, and natural disasters. All five are thought to be in the high-impact, high-likelihood category.\nThe risks report is a collaboration between the WEF, the Zurich Insurance Group and the professional services firm Marsh &amp; McLennan.\nAlison Martin, group chief risk officer at Zurich Insurance Group, said: \u201c2018 was sadly a year of historic wildfires, continued heavy flooding and increasing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\u201cIt is no surprise that in 2019, environmental risks once again dominate the list of major concerns. So, too, does the growing likelihood of environmental policy failure or a lack of timely policy implementation.\u201d\nMartin said a significant increase in infrastructure was needed to effectively respond to climate change in order to adapt to the new environment and transition to a low-carbon economy.\nShe added: \u201cBy 2040, the investment gap in global infrastructure is forecast to reach $18tn against a projected requirement of $97tn. Against this backdrop, we strongly recommend that businesses develop a climate resilience adaptation strategy and act on it now.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda has involved pulling the US out of the 2015 Paris climate change agreement, the introduction of tariffs on imports into the US, the announcement that American troops are being pulled out of Syria and the decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.\nThe risks report said: \u201cReconfiguring the relations of deeply integrated countries is fraught with potential risks, and trade and investment relations among many of the world\u2019s powers were difficult during 2018.\n\u201cAgainst this backdrop, it is likely to become more difficult to make collective progress on other global challenges \u2013 from protecting the environment to responding to the ethical challenges of the fourth industrial revolution.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/business/global-economy", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/switzerland", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/global-climate-talks", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos-2019", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "After extreme weather-related events, there is \u2018need for international cooperation\u2019", "date_published": {"$date": 1547629216000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548413349000}, "authors": ["Larry Elliott"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Global economy", "Davos", "Business", "Environment", "Switzerland", "Global climate talks", "Economics", "Davos 2019"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/16/global-tensions-holding-back-climate-change-fight-says-wef", "og:description": "After extreme weather-related events, there is \u2018need for international cooperation\u2019", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/023568839a1a87efa6d2145c7cbc3e1e3382fc49/0_178_5342_3205/master/5342.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=b50e9dbadc3027812074bfdb822c0246", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Global tensions holding back climate change fight, says WEF"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/023568839a1a87efa6d2145c7cbc3e1e3382fc49/0_178_5342_3205/master/5342.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=042e09eab4cdda4b34159567a9a25e88", "width": "5342", "height": "3205", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/023568839a1a87efa6d2145c7cbc3e1e3382fc49/0_178_5342_3205/master/5342.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2dd2ad50c63d2ddd39465b5f13679e6f", "description": "World Economic Forum chief B\u00f8rge Brende wants \u2018coordinated, concerted action\u2019 among world\u2019s powers to halt climate change\nPhotograph: Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69c4fd31733d911f2c0eab21c06069871688440c/0_26_3757_2254/master/3757.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=66e6c8617f948504625625c17a48e75f", "width": "3757", "height": "2254", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69c4fd31733d911f2c0eab21c06069871688440c/0_26_3757_2254/master/3757.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b6e687b2805cc1c02b0f998575d5a27d", "description": "B\u00f8rge Brende.

Why? Firstly, because in the last 15 years Australia has gone from some of the lowest electricity prices in the world to some of the highest and a good number of people are hurting. Secondly, in the 2013 election Tony Abbott played us for a fool on electricity prices and it has been a key part of the Coalition election playbook ever since.\nBetween 2007 and 2013 electricity network companies spent about $50bn upgrading our poles and wires. That $50bn had to be paid for and it was by us, as consumers. According to the Productivity Commission this resulted in electricity prices rising by 70% over the five years to 2013. The voting public was well aware of the price hike, while being almost completely unaware of its causes. This allowed then opposition leader Tony Abbott to talk his way into the top job partly on the back of a scare campaign against carbon pricing and renewable energy.\nIn 2011 the Gillard government announced its Clean Energy Future Package to address Australia\u2019s contribution to climate change. The package included a carbon price which happened to take effect just as consumers had really started to notice the price hikes caused by network overspending. This isn\u2019t surprising since according to analysis by the Australian Electricity Market Commission, electricity prices had risen by about 40%.\nAbbott was able to blame the high cost of electricity on the carbon price even before it was implemented. Unlike the massive hike in network charges, the much more modest impact of the carbon price came with a compensation package that left most households better off. But this didn\u2019t save the carbon price from taking the fall.\nParts of Australia\u2019s mainstream media either fell asleep on the job, cheered him on or found that the lax regulation of network infrastructure spending or arguments about the Weighted Average Cost of Capital didn\u2019t make for juicy soundbites.\n\u201cAxe the tax\u201d was at the heart of Abbott\u2019s 2013 election campaign. And the rest, as they say, is history.\nCut to 2019, the Coalition is trailing in the polls and one of the major differences between the Coalition and the ALP is that the ALP has a climate policy and the Coalition doesn\u2019t. The centrepiece of the ALP\u2019s climate policy is a 45% emissions reduction target and a 50% renewables target both by 2030. The Coalition is already running a scare campaign that these targets will cause sky-high electricity bills.\nThe question is will the Australian people buy the Coalition\u2019s line and be played for a fool on electricity prices a second time?\nHere\u2019s are a few things that will help you navigate the electricity price spin in 2019.\nMost of Australia\u2019s remaining (and largest) coal power stations were built in 1970s and 80s. Typically, coal and gas-fired power stations are built to last 35 to 40 years and if they are looked after they might last 50 years, albeit with more frequent breakdowns.\nIn New South Wales, four of the five coal-fired power stations are scheduled to shut down in the next 15 years and they need to be replaced with new generation. Despite what Coalition backbenchers say, the cheapest new build generation is solar and wind, backed up by storage such as pumped hydro up by storage. This fact has been stated over and over by everyone from CSIRO and the Australian Electricity Market Operator (AEMO), to Bloomberg New Energy Finance to the federal government-owned utility Snow Hydro. AGL and the University of Technology Sydney also both found that a portfolio of new technologies dominated by renewables would be cheaper than to upgrade the 47-year-old Liddell station \u2013 currently Australia\u2019s oldest coal power station, which is slated for closure in 2022. These analyses don\u2019t even consider the climate impacts of burning coal.\nGiven our generation is ageing it is important to remember that new generation, no matter what type, will generally be more expensive to run than old and written-off assets. Wholesale electricity prices were always going to rise a certain amount during this decade and the next, but with better planning they need not have risen anywhere near as much as they did.\nWhat we pay as a electricity consumer is a result of three factors \u2013 electricity prices, the amount of electricity we use and the amount of electricity we produce ourselves. The first factor \u2013 electricity prices \u2013 we individually have little control over (though we can advocate and vote for good policy solutions), the other factors are definitely in our control. We can install solar panels, buy more energy efficient appliances, turn lights and air-conditioning off when we are out of the house and if we own our own home we can also install insulation and make a number of other upgrades. All of these solutions will help lower your power bills while electricity prices continue to rise.\nThis brings me to the issue of green schemes. If I had $1 for every time conservative politicians and pundits blamed green schemes and renewable energy for rising electricity costs, I\u2019d be rich. The \u201cenvironmental cost\u201d component of electricity prices are those which pay for government policies like the Renewable Energy Target, energy efficiency schemes and others. According to the ACCC these account for about 7% of your bill.\nWhile the policies have costs, numerous reports show these policies help lower electricity bills either through lower wholesale costs or helping household and businesses install solar and become more energy efficient. The ACCC found that households with solar pay on average $514 less than those without. While analysis by the Green Markets Institute found that the current renewables build driven by the RET will halve wholesale electricity prices in the next four years. These policies and programs lower bills, while also lowering climate pollution \u2013 a win, win.\nAs the impacts of climate change become more evident and the cost of clean technologies fall, the only people who are likely to look foolish this election are those that continue to deny the basic economic and environmental reality that acting on climate in the electricity sector, also helps lower our power bills. \n\u2022 Nicky Ison is the founding director of the Community Power Agency and research associate at the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology Sydney.

It\u2019s clear that this diet offers both better health than the current norm of a high-meat diet, and a more environmental food production system with its emphasis on plant rather than animal production. However, I doubt the validity of some claims in the report.\nThe report states: \u201cFood is the single strongest lever to optimise human health and environmental sustainability on Earth.\u201d Population reduction is a much more powerful lever. It reduces not just the need for food, but also the need for energy, housing, transport, schools, climate change mitigation strategies and waste disposal.\nMoreover, population reduction should be easier to effect than the proposed change of diet, the latter clearly being, as the report states, a daunting task. \u201cHumanity has never aimed to change the global food system on the scale envisioned. Achieving this goal will require rapid adoption of numerous changes and unprecedented global collaboration and commitment.\u201d Conversely, when women have access to education and contraception, they will not choose to have more children than they can support. Population decline follows. The provision of education for girls and women, and of contraception, needs only expansion of existing well-known programmes.Richard VernonIffley, Oxfordshire\n\u2022 Your story oversimplifies a report that does not acknowledge the significant differences in farming methods and consumption patterns across the globe, and could serve to misinform readers about the realities of our fantastic livestock production here in Britain.\nWe do not yet understand the implications of a heavily plant-based diet like the report recommends on either our health or the environment. There is a very real possibility it could see us relying on imported produce, produced to lower standards than our own and with increased transport emissions.\nIn Britain we have extensive grasslands, which act as carbon stores helping to mitigate climate change. The most effective and sustainable way to use this land is to graze livestock, which will turn inedible grass into high-quality, grass-fed, nutrient-rich beef, lamb and dairy, all reared in an extensive system.\nYour readers should be assured that when they buy British, they are buying a product that is high quality, safe and sustainable. It would be a shame if this report has the effect of undermining British farmers who do a fantastic job producing food for the nation, all while caring for our countryside.Stuart Roberts Vice-president, NFUJohn Davies President, NFU Cymru\n\u2022 The survey featured in your article (Strongest opponents of GM foods know the least but think they know the most, theguardian.com, 14 January), contains flaws that question the validity of its conclusions. The UK government\u2019s GM Nation? debate on GM crops and foods in 2002-03 included formal public engagement meetings. At these events, participants were presented with information on GM technology, including arguments for and against its application in agriculture.\nThe outcome was clear: the more knowledge about the subject the participants received, the greater was their concern, as reported by the Guardian at the time. The lesson learned from this exercise was that balanced scientific information on a technically complex subject such as GM must be provided so that people can make an informed decision. Thus the information gathered from surveys of the type featured in this latest article is meaningless, since no effort was made to educate the survey respondents on the topic in question.Dr Michael AntoniouHead, Gene Expression and Therapy Group, King\u2019s College London\n\u2022 Every January we get a shedload of articles in the media about health and diet followed by a plethora of correspondence arguing the points about what is good or bad, and what we should or should not eat and drink. It\u2019s almost like having an annual Brexit debate and just as tedious.\nI\u2019ve discovered a highly nutritious way to get oils, fibre and fruit in one bite-sized package every Christmas: brazil nuts \u201cenrobed\u201d (as they say in the industry) in plain chocolate. I manage to make them last through January to help cope with all the newspaper articles, magazine supplements and TV programmes that bang on about diets.

That\u2019s the way I like it; I don\u2019t want much money, because people who earn a lot have a high carbon footprint. This green lifestyle saves my family about \u00a310,000 a year on utilities, food and travel compared to the average family of four. But that\u2019s not the reason I do it.\nI\u2019m proud to make between \u00a33,000 and \u00a34,000 a year gigging as a children\u2019s entertainer called Professor Fiddlesticks, riding a unicycle and juggling. I also give talks on climate change and other green subjects, plus I sell compost, do gardening and bike trailer removals, which adds up to about \u00a32,000 a year.\nI live with my wife, Gill, who works full time as an unpaid carer, and two adult children. We bought our house outright after Gill\u2019s mother died, with help from my dad. As a family, we get a working tax credit of \u00a3367 a month.\nI\u2019m a freegan, which means I get food from bins, from foraging, or from my garden. I\u2019m largely vegan, but eat dairy if I find it thrown away. The most unexpected thing I found in a bin was a bottle of champagne. I buy unsold fruit and veg for a penny a bag from a local food shop and get four loaves of yesterday\u2019s bread for \u00a31 from the local bakers.\nWe spend about \u00a3100 a week on basics such as rice and pasta. I occasionally have a coffee or pint out, but we never go to restaurants or get takeaways.\nI\u2019m frugal with water. We only pay about \u00a3280 a year for it. In the bathroom our rule is \u201cif it\u2019s yellow, let it mellow. If it\u2019s brown, flush it down,\u201d and I also have a compost toilet in the garden. I wash every day in a cup\u2019s worth of cold water, using a flannel.\nI use a wood stove to cook meals as much as possible and our gas bill is about \u00a3200 a year. The electricity bill is about \u00a3340 annually with Good Energy. We have an energy-efficient fridge, freezer and washing machine and our solar panels earn almost as much as we pay for electricity.\nI travel by bike and sometimes by train. I haven\u2019t flown in a plane since 1997. We don\u2019t own a car or go on holidays. I don\u2019t care if my T-shirt has a hole in it. However, I did get a tattoo of a compost symbol for my 50th birthday.\nI haven\u2019t been able to afford a pension and I never have more than about \u00a32,000 in the bank. I never know when money will come in, so I don\u2019t budget. But I believe happiness is separate to your income. Aside from my sadness for the state of the planet, I\u2019m a happy bunny.\nI\u2019m always busy, either chopping wood, turning compost, or picking beans. I\u2019m autistic, which means I\u2019m very enthusiastic and a bit over-focused. But my focus isn\u2019t on cleanliness, or train numbers. It\u2019s on saving carbon and trying to promote the green agenda.\nI do a lot of volunteering. I help out with a group called Abundance York, picking unwanted fruit from gardens and taking it to local schools, food banks and homeless shelters. I also distribute spare freegan food and other items to places it can be recycled or reused. I give food to a friend who\u2019s on universal credit, and to Food Not Bombs, who provide free food in town.\nI\u2019ve been trying to get people to be more green for about 30 years and I am proud that I have such a low carbon footprint. However, I feel like a failure: the CO2 concentration has risen continually over this time and climate change is now an existential threat. Yet we still live in a wasteful society.\nI\u2019ve had a lot of negative comments about my lifestyle over the years. Some people feel challenged by me. They ask: \u201cDo you think what you do really makes a difference?\u201d I tell them that an ocean is made up of lots of individual droplets. I\u2019ll keep doing what I do for as long as I\u2019m fit and able.\nAs told to Abby Young-Powell", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbonfootprints", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ethical-living", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "description": "Green activist John Cossham, 52, on how he earns very little so he can live a low-carbon lifestyle", "date_published": {"$date": 1547881212000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548065048000}, "authors": ["Abby Young-Powell"], "article_section": "Money", "article_tags": ["Money", "Carbon footprints", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Environment", "Ethical and green living", "UK news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jan/19/im-a-freegan-i-get-food-from-bins-foraging-or-my-garden", "og:description": "Green activist John Cossham, 52, on how he earns very little so he can live a low-carbon lifestyle", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e0d821be2d93ace2e7ac2f5723f75eeae1901e/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=aa55ea936b3937a53ea9f90378bb240e", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "'I\u2019m a freegan \u2013 I get food from bins, foraging or my garden'"}, "headline": "\u2013", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e0d821be2d93ace2e7ac2f5723f75eeae1901e/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5df1a1fc3d6006c116c76932b78e30ff", "width": "6720", "height": "4032", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e0d821be2d93ace2e7ac2f5723f75eeae1901e/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fbd3824cda90ecc9ed9bcc05fe21e8e9", "description": "John Cossham salvages wood for fuel and food to eat and doesn\u2019t own a car.\nPhotograph: Gary Calton for the Observer"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07a84a2c3613145ed8d0a"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2019/jan/19/readers-hopes-2019-what-cover-this-year", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "We asked the Guardian\u2019s supporters around the world to reflect on what you hope to make space for in 2019: the causes and values that you want to prioritise, and what you would most like our journalism to focus on this year.

Beatrice Pate, New South Wales\nThe election of Jair Bolsonaro as president of Brazil is a watershed in Brazilian politics. It signals a significant swing to the right after years of rule by the leftwing governments presided over by Lula and Dilma Rousseff. Generally speaking, Brazil does not receive the attention in the world\u2019s media that a country of its size and importance deserves.

Adelaide Airport is also a record at 44.3C (previous record 44.1C 4th Jan 2013). Roseworthy is at 46.9 (prev record 46.7 on 28 Jan 2009).\nThursday\u2019s heat is set to spread across the states of Victoria and New South Wales, just days after an earlier record-breaking heatwave passed across the country.\nLast week, a dozen heat records fell, with nine alone in NSW. The small NSW outpost of Noona, around 800km west of Sydney, recorded the country\u2019s highest ever overnight minimum temperature of 35.9C.\nThe back-to-back heatwaves are part of a summer that the Bureau of Meteorology predicted as being hotter and drier than average, partially as a result of climate change.\nOn Friday, Victoria will become the \u201chottest place in Australia\u201d, according to Jonathan How from the bureau.\nThe cities of Mildura, Swan Hill and Echuca are set for 46C, which could break records.\nIn Melbourne, as Novak Djokovic and Lucas Pouille settle in for the semi-finals of the Australian Open, the maximum temperature will be 43C, with 44C in some suburbs.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/adelaide", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-weather", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/south-australia", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/extreme-weather", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Seventeen records broken in South Australia amid animal culls and mass fish deaths in other parts of the country", "date_published": {"$date": 1548323492000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548380648000}, "authors": ["Naaman Zhou"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Australia news", "Adelaide", "World news", "Australia weather", "South Australia", "Extreme weather", "Climate change"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/24/australia-heatwave-adelaide-breaks-its-all-time-heat-record-hitting-466c", "og:description": "Seventeen records broken in South Australia amid animal culls and mass fish deaths in other parts of the country", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75443da00b8d4121146514e22410635da7ffbd0f/0_27_4546_2730/master/4546.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=820aaeb1fbbc894275f063bb0aa6ddc8", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Adelaide breaks its all-time heat record, hitting 46.6C, in extreme Australia heatwave"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75443da00b8d4121146514e22410635da7ffbd0f/0_27_4546_2730/master/4546.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=30383ad3b9e1f6d2e313b74d70259401", "width": "4546", "height": "2730", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75443da00b8d4121146514e22410635da7ffbd0f/0_27_4546_2730/master/4546.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e91b4dff3aaaed791a56c46f696d65a2", "description": "People in Adelaide head to the beach to escape Thursday\u2019s record-breaking Australia heatwave.\nPhotograph: Kelly Barnes/AAP"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07acfa2c3613145ed8d24"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/24/school-strikes-over-climate-change-continue-to-snowball", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "The 16-year-old activist behind the fast-growing School Strikes 4 Climate Action has taken her campaign to the streets of Davos, to confront world leaders and business chiefs about the global emissions crisis.\nGreta Thunberg, whose solo protest outside Sweden\u2019s parliament has snowballed across the globe, will join a strike by Swiss schoolchildren in the ski resort on Friday \u2013 the final day of the World Economic Forum.\nThunberg travelled by train for 32 hours to reach Davos, and spent Wednesday night camped with climate scientists on the mountain slopes \u2013 where temperatures plunged to -18C.\nHaving already addressed the UN Climate Change COP 24 conference, Thunberg is rapidly becoming the voice for a generation who are demanding urgent action to slow the rise in global temperatures.\nAs she travelled down Davos\u2019s funicular railway from the Arctic Base Camp \u2013 while more than 30,000 students were striking in Belgium - Thunberg said the rapid growth of her movement was \u201cincredible\u201d.\n\u201cThere have been climate strikes, involving students and also adults, on every continent except Antarctica. It has involved tens of thousands of children.\u201d\nWow! They're back and this time they're 32,000 strong! These students want #climateaction and they are not going to stop marching until they get it! Be Like Them!!!#ActOnClimate #Klimaatmars #Youth4Climate #ClimateMarch #klimatstrejk #FridaysForFuture via @Green_Europe pic.twitter.com/Jra5Zq4TLg\nThunberg started her protest by striking for three weeks outside the Swedish parliament, lobbying MPs to comply with the Paris Agreement. After the Swedish election, she continued to strike every Friday, where she is now joined by hundreds of people.\n\u201cThis Friday I can\u2019t be there,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cSo I will have to do it here in Davos, and send a message that this is the only thing that matters.\u201d\nStudents around the world have been inspired by Thunberg, with thousands skipping school in Australia in November. Last Friday there were strikes in Germany, Belgium and Switzerland, where more than 20,000 students skipped school.\nMissing gym class, geography and religion each Friday is something of a sacrifice for Thunberg, who says she loves school and can\u2019t pick a favourite subject.\n\u201cI like all subjects. I love learning, which people maybe don\u2019t think about me.\u201d\nShe\u2019s also been forced to give up her hobbies, as climate change activism has taken more of her time. \u201cI used to play theatre, sing, dance, play an instrument, ride horses, lots of things.\u201d\nShe\u2019s sanguine, though, pointing out that climate activism is much more important: \u201cYou have to see the bigger perspective.\u201d\nThunberg said she would like more students to join her strike. \u201cThat would have a huge impact, but I\u2019m not going to force anyone to do this.\u201d\nIn the UK, only a small number of students have so far begun strikes, including 13-year-old Holly Gillibrand in Fort William. But plans are now being made for a big strike on 15 February. Thunberg predicts there will be protests in many locations.\nShe believes parents should be supportive if their children tell them they\u2019re striking on Friday. \u201cEveryone keeps saying that the young people should be more active, and they\u2019re so lazy, but once we do something we get criticised.\u201d\nThe world\u2019s scientists warned in October that, without a dramatic ramping up of action to cut emissions, global temperatures would rise by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, with severe consequences for humanity.\nThunberg believes the older generations need to acknowledge that they have failed to protect the environment.\n\u201cWe need to hold the older generations accountable for the mess they have created, and expect us to live with. It is not fair that we have to pay for what they have caused,\u201d she says.\nThunberg has also called on business leaders and politicians to commit to \u201creal and bold climate action\u201d, and focus on the \u201cfuture living conditions of mankind\u201d rather than economic goals and profits.\nIn a video address for leaders attending Davos she says: \u201cI ask you to stand on the right side of history. I ask you to pledge to do everything in your power to push your own business or government in line with a 1.5C world.\u201d\nThunberg has been diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome, which she believes helps her see the problem of climate change clearly.\n\u201cMy brain works a bit different and so I see things in black and white. Either we start a chain reaction with events beyond our control, or we don\u2019t. Either we stop the emissions or we don\u2019t. There are no grey areas when it comes to survival.\u201d\nThe school strikes last Friday were by far the biggest to date. In Germany, an estimated 30,000 students left their schools in more than 50 cities to protest, carrying banners including: \u201cWhy learn without a future?\u201d and \u201cGrandpa, what is a snowman?\u201d One 17-year-old student in Kiel, Moritz, told Deutsche Welle: \u201cWe want to help shape and secure our future so that there will be another world for us to live in in 60 years.\u201d\nIn Belgium, 12,500 students went on strike last Thursday and plan to strike weekly until the EU elections in May. Some teachers were tolerant of the truancy. Patrick Lancksweerdt, in Brussels, said: \u201cEducation has to turn youngsters into mature citizens. By their actions, they proved that they are.\u201d\nSchool strikes also took place in 15 cities and towns in Switzerland. In Geneva, 12-year-old Selma Joly said: \u201cFrankly, I would rather demand climate action than go to school. Otherwise, years from now, we may no longer be here.\u201d\nJanine O\u2019Keeffe, who helps coordinate and keep track of the school strikes from her home in Stockholm, Sweden, was surprised at the scale of last week\u2019s actions: \u201cI am still in shock, actually \u2013 a nice kind of shock.\u201d\nJennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace, says youth activism on climate change gives her hope. \u201cThe 15-year-olds just speak truth to power.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/protest", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos-2019", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/sweden", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/switzerland", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Protest by 16-year-old Greta Thunberg snowballs to last day of World Economic Forum", "date_published": {"$date": 1548334070000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1552566803000}, "authors": ["Graeme Wearden", "Damian Carrington"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Protest", "Environment", "Davos 2019", "World news", "Sweden", "Europe", "Business", "Switzerland", "Greta Thunberg"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/24/school-strikes-over-climate-change-continue-to-snowball", "og:description": "Protest by 16-year-old Greta Thunberg snowballs to last day of World Economic Forum", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/307f2f3133244dc8c41fa1d0c2076c49f9f20722/0_313_4694_2816/master/4694.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=936374d5a1210d56d6ceeb89859eeb7c", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Teenage activist takes School Strikes 4 Climate Action to Davos"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/307f2f3133244dc8c41fa1d0c2076c49f9f20722/0_313_4694_2816/master/4694.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=97e385f371c510d1676abd8a1ee2c2f7", "width": "4694", "height": "2816", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/307f2f3133244dc8c41fa1d0c2076c49f9f20722/0_313_4694_2816/master/4694.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9376133c056d0d8e51bd194176b65ae6", "description": "Swedish youth climate activist Greta Thunberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos, eastern Switzerland.\nPhotograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b28108f9d15f5c4beb0d816e854501442b341516/0_297_4463_2678/master/4463.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=45e568cab5319e76a12132b7e011df60", "width": "4463", "height": "2678", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b28108f9d15f5c4beb0d816e854501442b341516/0_297_4463_2678/master/4463.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=90e9a1e23ea93dddcb674b6556dc64d7", "description": "Greta Thunberg speaks to the media at the Arctic Basecamp in Davos.

This natural climate variation causes warm and dry conditions in the tropics, meaning the plant growth that removes CO2 from the air is restricted.\nLevels of the greenhouse gas have not been as high as today for 3-5m years, when the global temperature was 2-3C warmer and the sea level was 10-20 metres higher. Climate action must be increased fivefold to limit warming to the 1.5C rise above pre-industrial levels that scientists advise, according to the UN. But the past four years have been the hottest on record and global emissions are rising again after a brief pause.\n\u201cLooking at the monthly figures, it\u2019s as if you can see the planet \u2018breathing\u2019 as the levels of CO2 fall and rise with the seasonal cycle of plant growth and decay in the northern hemisphere,\u201d said Prof Richard Betts, at the Met Office\u2019s Hadley Centre. \u201cThe graph is a thing of beauty, but also a stark reminder of human impact on climate. Each year\u2019s CO2 is higher than the last, and this will keep happening until humans stop adding CO2 to the atmosphere.\u201d\n\u201cThis news is worrying and compelling,\u201d said Prof Nick Ostle, at Lancaster University. \u201cIt represents a call to innovate with rapid and radical responses to offset these growing emissions.\u201d He said cuts in fossil fuel use, deforestation and emissions from livestock were needed: \u201cIt\u2019s a massive challenge but there are real opportunities to make an impact individually and globally.\u201d\nThe Met Office has a good record of forecasting global CO2 levels and predicts that the average rise over 2019 will be 2.75 parts per million (ppm). That would put it among the highest annual rises in the 62 years since good records began.\nOnly years with strong El Ni\u00f1o events, 1998 and 2016, are likely to be higher. The rise in 2016 was 3.39ppm. In the decade after the first measurement on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Loa in 1956, annual rises were less than 0.9ppm per year.\nAn El Ni\u00f1o event occurs when the tropical Pacific swings into a warm phase, causing many regions to have warmer and drier weather. Trees and plants are natural carbon sinks because they absorb CO2 as they grow, but this is reduced in El Ni\u00f1o years.\n\u201cThis year we expect these carbon sinks to be relatively weak, so the impact of record high human-caused emissions will be larger than last year,\u201d said Betts.\nThe Met Office forecasts an average CO2 level in 2019 of 411ppm. Monthly averages are expected to peak at 415ppm in May, before the growing season temporarily reduces levels to 408ppm in September, when CO2 will begin rising once again. The level of CO2 in the atmosphere before the industrial revolution sparked the large-scale burning of coal, oil and gas was 280ppm.\n\u201cIt never rains but it pours,\u201d said Prof Dave Reay, at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cOur own CO2 emissions are still increasing, and now the world\u2019s natural carbon sinks are set for a bad year too. We know these sinks have been mopping up around half of all our emissions to date. We can only hope their faltering in 2019 is just a short-term blip, as without their help any chance of a safer climate future will turn to dust.\u201d\nProf Jos Barlow, also at Lancaster University, said the rising destruction of forests is serious concern: \u201cThis has been a particularly bad year. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased to around 8,000 square kilometres in 2018, which is equivalent to losing a football pitch of forest every 30 seconds. There are also worrying signs that deforestation is occurring at a faster rate in other Amazonian countries, such as Colombia, Bolivia and Peru.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/deforestation", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Levels of the climate-warming gas are set to rise by near-record amounts, Met Office predicts", "date_published": {"$date": 1548374480000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548414311000}, "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Environment", "Deforestation", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/25/worrying-rise-in-global-co2-forecast-for-2019", "og:description": "Levels of the climate-warming gas are set to rise by near-record amounts, Met Office predicts", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c41f417a3878a2be6a31780bf1922a6c76cb943d/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=f50e75b18d99dceedf7de90adca2dc9d", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "\u2018Worrying\u2019 rise in global CO2 forecast for 2019"}, "headline": "O", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c41f417a3878a2be6a31780bf1922a6c76cb943d/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1f20fd546ded9ded73a5d9b344092bec", "width": "3500", "height": "2100", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c41f417a3878a2be6a31780bf1922a6c76cb943d/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ffa9138172e173ee4185288ea340c192", "description": "Storm clouds gather over Shell\u2019s Pulau Bukom oil refinery in Singapore.\nPhotograph: Edgar Su/Reuters"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07ad5a2c3613145ed8d28"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/jan/25/australia-extreme-heatwave-victoria-tasmania-bushfires-live", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "And that\u2019s a wrap.

The fire there has grown in size from 300ha to 4,000ha and it is now too late for locals to leave. \nThere are six emergency warnings in place in Tasmania. Those cover locations including: Castle Forbes Bay, Geeveston, Port Huon, Cairns Bay and Waterloo; Waddamana, Hilltop and Penstock Lagoon; Bronte Park Area, Pine Tier Lagoon and London Lakes; Shannon; Lake Echo and surrounds; and Liawenee.\nMuch of southern Tasmanian, including Hobart, is covered a red, smoky haze. \nThe other big story of the day, of course, was the fact that about 200,000 homes across Victoria were hit by power blackouts. You can expect the political argy to roll on on that one for the next few days.\nWith that, I\u2019ll leave you.

The fire was 300ha this morning. Over the day it has spread to cover 4000ha. \nWe have a community who continues to do it very tough today. The Timbarra community, that whole region, which is living with the fire at the moment, a very active and dangerous fire. They had a really tough few days since the fire took off, and they are probably going to face this fire in their landscape for many weeks to come. The message I have right now is that it is still very early in the day. Please do not be complacent. \nVictoria\u2019s emergency services commissioner, Andrew Crisp, is addressing the media. \nHe\u2019s talking about the fire at Timbarra, which is the most dangerous of the fires burning across Victoria.\nCrisp says the fire has been burning since 16 January and residents have been provided advice about the need to activate their bushfire plans since then. \nThree people have made it to a relief centre at Buchan, but Crisp says authorities believe other locals have \u201cmade other arrangements\u201d. \nEarlier today, the CFA warned people it was too late to leave the area and that they should take immediate steps to survive. \n\u201cThe fire is a dangerous fire,\u201d Crisp says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to move fire fighters out of that particular area until things settle down.\u201d \n\u201cThe change is not expected to go through there until the evening.\u201d\nThanks to Naaman for briefly taking over.

Essentially most of that was as a result of failed infrastructure from coal and gas units \u2013 in particular coal.\n\u201cPeople should be rightly disappointed that the power grid was not up to the stakes today...we have a 20th century energy system, for a 21st century climate.\n\u201cThe fact is our thermal generators are ageing, they are becoming less and less reliable. Wind power came through today \u2013 it produced sufficient power generation. Our large batteries were available last night when we needed them the most. Renewable energy is the way of the future and the here and now.\u201d\nShe did also apologise to Victorians for the outages. \n\u201cThe market operator had to make the decision to minimise the impact of [the failures]\u201d, she said. \u201cAt 12 oclock today they directed load shedding distributed fairly across the state.\u201d\n150,000 Victorians had they power supply taken off \u201cfor a very short period of time\u201d, she said. \nIn Melbourne, the Victorian energy minister, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, is explaining why load shedding happened earlier today. \nShe says the state suddenly lost 1,800 megawatts of power \u2013 mostly due to failed coal plants \u2013 which created a 250 megawatt gap. \nSupply was low, and demand increased as people tried to keep cool. Aemo then decided to load shed until the cool change came. \n\u201cThis morning Aemo advised we had more than sufficient power to meet all of our needs. The situation changed very very quickly. \n\u201cThe extreme heat continued to remain with us and demand continued to increase to unanticipated levels. That caused greater stress on our existing thermal generators ... That came on top of the fact we los three coal generators in the La Trobe valley.\n\u201cThe market operator did what their job is, and decided there was an actual gap in energy supply to meet that continually rising demand.\u201d\nTasmanians are being reminded that the state has a total fire ban extending over the entire Australia Day long weekend. \nSome other ways to look at those record-breaking temperatures yesterday. \nAccording to weather researcher Maximiliano Herrera, Port Augusta\u2019s 49.5C is the highest temperature recorded at a coastal location in the southern hemisphere. \nOn Wednesday, Red Rocks Point in WA reached 49.1C. The measuring station is only 70m from the ocean, which potentially makes it the hottest temperature ever recorded so close to the sea. \nAustralia has just seen the world's hottest temperature recorded next to open ocean: 120.4\u00b0F (49.1\u00b0C), less than a block from the sea. https://t.co/fuEUt3Yqju\nBack to that press conference. Emergency services have warned that the cool change will create a change in wind direction \u2013 placing more people at risk. \nIf you are near a fire, be aware that the front could shift overnight. \nFire services have 30 aircraft across the state, and up to 700 people at work. \nA police spokesman says: \u201cLeave early before the need is there, ensure there is a planned route and travel slowly.\u201d\nTwo fires have worsened \u2013 residents of Wilburville and Flintstone may be at high risk within 2 to 6 hours.\nBoth are now at Watch and Act. \n. @tasfireservice has upgraded the Emergency Warning for Flinstone from 'Advice' to 'Watch and Act'. There is a bushfire at Great Pine Tier, Central Plateau that may put Flintstone at high risk within the next 2-6 hours.

More info at https://t.co/5HQddyRCbQ and https://t.co/jks9RaBYqx #Tasfires pic.twitter.com/PyZJwAk9wm\nThe bureau of meteorology also adds that the fire danger remains high. \nWhile temperatures are now dropping, the wind is picking up, meaning the risk is still as high as ever. \n\u201cWhile conditions are easing, the fire danger remains high for the moment,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cAs the temperature drop the winds are peaking \u2013 that is keeping the fire danger up.\u201d\nThere are \u201ccooler conditions and a slight easing of the winds\u201d forecast overnight, but the danger will remain.\nThere is not a lot of rain forecast for tomorrow \u2013 only a couple of millimetres. Tasmania\u2019s fire chief also warned that \u201csevere conditions will now move on to the east coast from now on\u201d. \nTasmanian emergency services are giving a press conference now. The topline is that conditions remain severe, and many fires are still posing a threat. \nTasmania\u2019s fire chief says there are still 56 active fires in Tasmania, with 30 uncontained.\n\u201cThirty of them still going, that means they are not contained, and they will be breaking their containment lines tonight,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt remains hot, windy and the fuels remain incredibly dry in this state right now. We have a long way to go. Do not underestimate the situation we are in. We can\u2019t let our guard down.\u201d\nIn Victoria, there is a house fire at Taylor Court, Colac. The fire is contained but an advice warning has been issued for Colac, Colac West, Colac East.\nIn Tasmania, the Zeehan Highway is closed. People looking to evacuate must travel via Strahan.\nPeople travelling from Zeehan to the evacuation centre at Queenstown Basketball Stadium must travel via Strahan, rather than the Zeehan Highway. The Zeehan Highway is currently closed due concerns about smoke and embers. #tasfires\nHello everyone, Naaman Zhou here taking over from Luke for a short while. \nThis WATCH &amp; ACT message is being issued for Buchan and Buchan South.Firefighters have been unable to stop the spread of the fire.

I learned from sport that you have to put the work in, and can\u2019t just turn up on the day hoping for the result. I will do the work for this, just as I did the work for sport and law.\u201d\nSteggall, born in Manly, is a well-known figure locally. She won a bronze medal in slalom at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, and a World Championship gold medal in 1999.\nPost-Olympics she studied media and then law and was admitted to the New South Wales bar as a barrister in 2008.\nSteggall holds director roles on several Australian sports bodies and was appointed to the International Council of Arbitration for Sport in 2017. She also serves on the governing council of the exclusive Queenwood school in Mosman.\nSteggall has adopted the rallying cry of independent Kerryn Phelps, who won the blue-ribbon Liberal seat of Wentworth in a byelection last year and has promised to operate from the \u201csensible centre\u201d.\n\u201cI support sensible centre economic policies for a strong, stable economy and will resist proposed changes to negative gearing, franking credits and capital gains tax,\u201d Steggall said.\nSteggall said in a statement her policy priorities include effective climate strategy, the economy, healthcare and improving politics.\n\u201cThe most common concern is the lack of action on climate change,\u201d she said.\nHer campaign has enlisted well-known scientist and recently appointed climate change expert at the Australian Museum, Tim Flannery, as an adviser on climate policies.\n\u201cPeople are also worried about the state of politics in this country, the lack of compassion on human rights, how rising congestion is disrupting our commutes, mental health and domestic violence,\u201d Steggall said.\nAt a doorstop in Sydney on Sunday, Abbott said the Australia Day weekend was \u201cnot a time for heavy politics\u201d but made his case for re-election based on policies including lowering power prices and his \u201c120% support\u201d for the northern beaches tunnel.\n\u201cApart from that, we\u2019ve just got to have the best possible government in Canberra and the best possible government is a Liberal government that keeps our country safe and our economy strong,\u201d he said.\nAsked about Steggall\u2019s attack on his record on climate change, Abbott said he would \u201cnot get into tit-for-tat arguments with any particular candidate\u201d, but argued Australia only contributed 1.3% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\u201cWe could close our economy down tomorrow and it wouldn\u2019t make a scrap of difference,\u201d he said.\nThe education minister Dan Tehan, appearing on Sky News on Sunday, said Abbott would put a strong case forward for his re-election.\n\u201cPeople underestimate what Tony does within the community, for the community, they underestimate his ability to campaign,\u201d Tehan told Sky News on Sunday.\n\u201cThere was talk before the last election that Tony might have been in trouble in Warringah, he was re-endorsed by the voters there quite strongly.\u201d\nTehan later told reports in Melbourne that Abbott has a \u201cvery good record to stand on\u201d and will put a compelling case to voters because he has \u201cmore to offer in politics\u201d.\nTwo other women \u2013 Indigenous Australian Susan Moylan-Coombs and Alice Thompson, a former employee of Malcolm Turnbull \u2013 have also said they would run as independents in Warringah.\nHowever, Steggall is likely to have the backing of several grassroots groups that have been running a campaign against the former prime minister, including selling anti-Abbott T-shirts and posters.\nThe groups have been liaising with GetUp, which has vowed to work to remove Abbott and other climate change deniers from their seats at the forthcoming election, likely to be held in May.\nAbbott has vowed to take on GetUp and the groups seeking to oust him, and has begun a social media campaign using the title of his first book, Battlelines.\nAn email from Vote Tony Out endorsing Steggall as the independent candidate for Warringah in the next federal election said: \u201cMore and more details will come out about Zali in the next couple of days but I can tell you she is an amazing woman who will make Warringah proud. She has been through quite a process to get to this point.\u201d\nWarringah has voted conservative since 1922 and Abbott, who first won the seat 25 years ago, holds it with a margin of about 15%.\nAdditional reporting from Australian Associated Press", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tony-abbott", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Olympics ski champion turned barrister has support of several grassroots groups in her bid to oust the ex-prime minister", "date_published": {"$date": 1548561655000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1549343085000}, "authors": ["Anne Davies", "Paul Karp"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Australian politics", "Tony Abbott", "Australia news", "New South Wales", "Coalition", "Sydney", "Liberal party", "Climate change", "Zali Steggall"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/26/zali-steggall-to-challenge-tony-abbott-warringah-nsw-seat", "og:description": "Olympics ski champion turned barrister has support of several grassroots groups in her bid to oust the ex-prime minister", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac974162692070bb4b260a780538024fe0691afa/0_123_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=eaf672db206c40f5cdd699697905a71f", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Zali Steggall to challenge Tony Abbott for Warringah seat"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac974162692070bb4b260a780538024fe0691afa/0_123_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e92a7111038e5d7adb7b89f59343e475", "width": "2016", "height": "1210", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac974162692070bb4b260a780538024fe0691afa/0_123_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fb847d2f823cf3898b8a9c68b78fe18d", "description": "Zali Steggall with her husband Tim Irving and sons Rex Cameron (L) and Reny Cameron (R) on Sunday.

Several Labor MPs prefer quitting politics entirely to the prospect of serving under Rudd's leadership.\nWell if it is the Daily Telegraph it must be true.\nAll those conservative papers did their best to rubbish Rudd. And many gullible people took the bait.\nBy reading comments here I can see the great influence Murdoch, other media commentators have on their views.\nRemembering how issues were at the time. A totally different picture emerges.\nMaxine McKew won Bennelong, Howard seat in 2007. She was horrified at the machinations by Shorten. Had been a respected journalist, not a party hack.\nAnd Gillard soothingly said \"we were helping you, could see you weren't coping\". But earlier in 2010 she asked Rudd \"when is it my turn to be PM?\"\n24 June 2010 ABC\nPolitical commentators say largely unknown Labor Party factional strongmen have shown their control of the Labor Caucus by engineering the political demise of Kevin Rudd.\nMr Rudd was ousted by his deputy Julia Gillard in an unopposed leadership spill after it became clear that he had no chance of marshalling the numbers to prevail in a contested leadership vote.\nSome of the strongmen behind his demise are union bosses, while others have made the transition into Parliament as members and senators.\nApart from wielding power, there is one thing that they have in common: they are largely unknown to the Australian public.\nDavid Feeney, Mark Arbib, Bill Shorten, Bill Ludwig, Karl Bitar, and Don Farrell are hardly household names, yet they hold sway within the Labor ranks.\nPolitical commentator Professor Ross Fitzgerald says the Labor Caucus largely reflects the views of the factional strongmen.\n\"The factions these days in the main reflect the Caucus,\" he said.\n\"But in terms of the exercise of power, when push comes to shove, the factions, and especially the right faction, wields tremendous power in the Australian Labor Party federally and in most states.\n\"For Kevin Rudd to say as he did that he wanted to break the power of the factions is laughable.\n\"I would have thought this is the factions' revenge. He went down like a house of cards.\"\nThe Ludwigs control the AWU along with the AWU's shining light in Federal Parliament, another Rudd coup plotter, Victorian MP Bill Shorten.\nProfessor Fitzgerald says Mr Shorten, along with fellow strongman Mark Arbib, will do extremely well out of the overthrow of Mr Rudd.\nThe World Today has spoken to former premiers, MPs and Labor stalwarts, who all agree that Mr Rudd suffered at the power of the factions.\nSo again this proves that Rudd was hard to work with is just a con by the big players in the Labor right faction.\nAnother reason :Shorten couldn't stand the screams of Gina, Twiggy, the Minerals council when Rudd proposed the Minerals Super Profit Tax.\nTo return money to Australians for the sale of our Minerals.\nHe is weak, vested interests will buy him every time.", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "125153672", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "125154053", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548642391000}, "author": "charleyb23", "author_id": "16236149", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Indeed he can work with all sorts of people.

It's population is almost entirely indigenous peoples who once lived in rural and agricultural villages on the Bolivian Altiplano. Altiplanic agriculture relied on the very small fraction of humidity available at that high altitude - and even the first few decades of warming started to eliminate that small fraction and villages simply started failing. Ironically, the glaciers El Alto rely on for water are fast disappearing, as with many glaciers at altitude.

If global demand for beef increases 95% by 2050 as expected then catering to the growing appetite could have severe consequences.\n\u201cIf you look at the next 20 years, methane is over 80 times more potent at warming the planet than CO2, so pollution from livestock is playing an outsized role in the climate-driven devastation we\u2019re already seeing from superstorms, floods, droughts and wildfires,\u201d said Ian Monroe, chief investment officer at Etho Capital and an earth systems lecturer at Stanford University.\nIn the US the majority of large meat processing plants that pollute streams and rivers face few consequences, according to research by Ceres, and the animal agriculture industry is exempted from reporting its greenhouse gas emissions.\nAcross the world, animal farming uses 83% of agricultural land despite providing only 18% of calorie intake, with consumers in Europe eating around five times the recommended amount of red meat, poultry and dairy products, according to Fairr. The organisation previously warned demand is set to exceed what can be met within \u201cplanetary boundaries\u201d, and that the intensification of animal farming is not sustainable, with scientists recommending people adopt plant-based diets.\n\u201cEvery day around 84 million adults consume fast food in the US alone, but the inconvenient truth of convenience food is that the environmental impacts of the sector\u2019s meat and dairy products have hit unsustainable levels,\u201d said Jeremy Coller, founder of Fairr and chief investment officer of Coller Capital. \u201cTo put this in perspective, if cows were a country, it would be the world\u2019s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cOther high-emitting industries, such as cars or oil and gas, are beginning to set clear yet ambitious climate targets, making animal agriculture one of the world\u2019s highest-emitting sectors without a low-carbon plan.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/food/fast-food", "https://www.theguardian.com/food", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/fooddrinks", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Coalition worth $6.5tn challenge fast food chains over lack of low-carbon plan", "date_published": {"$date": 1548765148000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548767480000}, "authors": ["Mattha Busby"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Environment", "Fast food", "Food", "Climate change", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Food & drink industry", "Business"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/29/investors-urge-kfc-mcdonalds-and-burger-king-to-cut-emissions", "og:description": "Coalition worth $6.5tn challenge fast food chains over lack of low-carbon plan", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dea9c6a1c1df804ed062e8b9d111812256d0eaa/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=078658d4eec4f88d7d0c36237b4d6c03", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Investors urge KFC, McDonald's and Burger King to cut emissions"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dea9c6a1c1df804ed062e8b9d111812256d0eaa/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e2229fd6063016f1c70da3c6bbafd33f", "width": "4256", "height": "2554", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dea9c6a1c1df804ed062e8b9d111812256d0eaa/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bc1d084e35a303b89f68cb8c4304df70", "description": "Livestock farming is one of the leading causes of deforestation and water pollution, and is responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nPhotograph: Alamy"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07b05a2c3613145ed8d3a"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/29/teen-activists-strong-words-for-world-leaders-at-davos", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Jeremy Corbyn considered it wasting time at a \u201cbillionaires\u2019 jamboree\u201d, referring to a quarter of the cabinet flying to Davos in the middle of the Brexit impasse (The week that was, Environment, 26 January).\nGreta Thunberg (Mountain mover, 26 January) clearly didn\u2019t think it was a waste of time.

After almost a week of the smell and the dark of the ever-present smoke it's difficult to avoid becoming habituated and perhaps complacent, which would be dangerous if there was an unexpected wind change.\nThe other issue is that given the sparseness of the population and the difficulty in getting images of the fronts, many people don't appreciate that we've already lost ~180,000 hectares of forest, some of it Gondwana relic that hasn't burned in a millenium, and that many rare and endangered species are at grave risk. It's great that the remoteness reduces the human impact, but that aside the fires are an ecological calamity.\nWhat many don't seem to appreciate is that these fires have been fostered more by the ongoing warmth and dryness of the changing climate, than from an import of extreme fire conditions from the mainland. In particular we've not had the really strong, hot and dry nor'westerlies off central Australia that might be expected to drive a catastrophic event. If we did have strong NW winds there'd be an order of magnitude more destruction than we already have...

The government is yet to confirm whether it will back an expansion adding 2,000MW of new generation capacity, which was approved by the Snowy Hydro board in mid-December.\nFrydenberg says the Coalition has presided over a reduction in per capita emissions, but emissions have been rising since the Abbott government repealed the carbon price legislated by the Gillard government.\nThe latest government projections show that Australia will miss its 2030 emissions reduction targets, despite Scott Morrison\u2019s regular assertion that the country is on track to meet its obligations \u201cin a canter\u201d.\nThe report, released in late December, says emissions in 2030 are projected to climb 4% above 2020 levels, driven by higher levels of liquefied natural gas production, growth in agriculture, increased transport activity and a drop in the amount of carbon reduction from activities such as reforestation in the land use sector.\nIt projects emissions from all sectors, except for electricity, waste and land use, will grow by 2030.\nA new report from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has found that Australia is not on track to meet its 2030 emissions targets under the Paris agreement and needs to bring its environment policies into line with the \u201cscale of the challenge\u201d the country is facing.\nYates joins other high-profile independents facing off against Liberals in the coming contest, with a number, including barrister and former Olympic skier Zali Steggall, who will take on Abbott in Warringah, citing inaction on climate change as a central motivation.\nThere is also continuing speculation that Julia Banks, a Liberal who quit the government for the crossbench late last year, will run against the health minister, Greg Hunt, in the Victorian seat of Flinders.\nYates will face an uphill battle to unseat Frydenberg in Kooyong, a prized Liberal seat held by party leaders including Robert Menzies. The treasurer and deputy Liberal leader tends his local turf assiduously, and won the seat in 2016 with a primary vote of 58%, which was a positive swing of 2% on the previous federal contest.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Treasurer says climate change is real and Scott Morrison\u2019s government takes emissions reduction \u2018very seriously\u2019", "date_published": {"$date": 1548833977000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548834100000}, "authors": ["Katharine Murphy"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Josh Frydenberg", "Coalition", "Australia news", "Australian politics", "Liberal party", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/30/josh-frydenberg-defends-coalitions-climate-record-as-he-faces-challenge-in-kooyong", "og:description": "Treasurer says climate change is real and Scott Morrison\u2019s government takes emissions reduction \u2018very seriously\u2019", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2073a13ffdb9a9f04edc81142d9b5fbf10dac99/0_176_4897_2940/master/4897.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=dbc35633bcc264a2efad678eb532a927", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Josh Frydenberg defends Coalition's climate record as he faces challenge in Kooyong"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2073a13ffdb9a9f04edc81142d9b5fbf10dac99/0_176_4897_2940/master/4897.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c86454b402824c7bfa5b1ca8dff82a07", "width": "4897", "height": "2940", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2073a13ffdb9a9f04edc81142d9b5fbf10dac99/0_176_4897_2940/master/4897.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=347883da55d4204594a5a5751ae668ff", "description": "Josh Frydenberg is facing a challenge from long-time Liberal and now independent Oliver Yates.\nPhotograph: Stefan Postles/AAP"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc078dda2c3613145ed8c51"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/25/extinction-rebellion-activists-occupy-scottish-parliament", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Around 40 climate activists have staged a peaceful occupation of the Scottish parliament\u2019s debating chamber, urging MSPs to introduce much tougher climate targets.\nCampaigners with the recently formed direct action group Extinction Rebellion posed as tourists on a visit to Holyrood before staging an hour-long sit-in in the chamber.\nThere were no arrests. Police escorted the protesters from the building through a side entrance and they were greeted by cheers from other campaigners gathered outside the parliament.\nExtinction Rebellion was launched last October with the backing of 100 academics and the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. Friday\u2019s occupation was the group\u2019s first direct action in Scotland, after sit-down protests in Parliament Square, Westminster, and at climate talks in Poland.\nRobert Alcock, a builder and eco-designer who took part in the sit-in, said the group wanted Holyrood to take up far more ambitious CO2 reduction policies geared towards cutting net emissions to zero by 2025, in line with analysis from the International Panel on Climate Change.\nExtinction Rebellion wants Scotland to convene a citizens\u2019 assembly to decide how to achieve that goal through consensus. It would be made up of 73 members of the public drawn from Holyrood\u2019s 73 single-member constituencies, and have the power to revise the parliament\u2019s climate bills.\nThe Scottish government insists the country\u2019s climate policies, enacted by Holyrood, are among the most ambitious and far-reaching in the world, and the most radical from any UK legislature.\nScotland\u2019s first target to reduce CO2 emissions by 42% by 2020 has already been met, and the parties are now debating a fresh target to hit 90% by 2050 in a new climate bill.\nAsked why Extinction Rebellion was targeting Holyrood rather than oil companies in Aberdeen or the oil refinery at Grangemouth west of Edinburgh, Alcock said: \u201cThis is a very symbolic place because it is representing the people of Scotland, and today is Burns Day, the day of Scotland\u2019s national poet.\n\u201cWhile it is relatively progressive compared to other countries it comes nowhere near what is necessary to really address the gravity of the climate emergency.\u201d\nA Scottish parliament spokeswoman said: \u201cAround 40 individuals on a free public tour refused to leave the chamber for approximately 60 minutes before leaving peacefully at 1.30pm.\n\u201cThe public tour route takes in the debating chamber when parliament is not sitting.

Analysis of 38 years of NASA climate data has shown that the average size of northern hemisphere heat waves has grown by 50% since 1980.

Although winter heat waves tend not to be as hot as summer ones they do still strain health services and confuse ecosystems. In particular false springs can trick plants into blooming prematurely and being in trouble when winter returns.

Awareness of this trend was among the factors leading to the Paris Agreement in 2015, with governments, businesses, the military and health professionals among the constituencies highlighting the growing impacts of extreme weather in the run-up to the summit.\nA year ago, the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) published an analysis detailing what scientists had discovered about the links between climate change and extreme weather in the two years since the Paris Agreement.1 Today, we update that analysis with a further year\u2019s-worth of scientific papers. This strengthens further the case that climate change is driving an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, documented on every continent except Antarctica.\nIn last year\u2019s analysis, we identified 59 papers published in 2016 and 2017 exploring a possible link between climate change and amplification of extreme weather events, of which 41 found a positive signal of climate change. The additional year has brought a further 43 papers, of which 32 found a positive link from climate change to the event\u2019s likelihood or intensity.

Reading on \"the scientific method\" (Wikipedia might help) could save werdzwerth from exposing his unawareness of the fact that, in science if nowhere else, the words used have precise meanings. Thus what science calls a scientific theory is not just a guess but is the acknowledgement that an hypothesis has survived huge amounts of checking, testing, challenging and re-checking by countless others of all abilities and experience. Thus werdzwerth is free, and most welcome however amateur, to provide evidence or argument to rationally defeat any current scientific theory, but not to denigrate a scientific theory by nonsensically suggesting that it, or other theories, have been easily disproved. Few scientific theories have been as rigorously and repeatedly tested as those of Einstein on Relativity, but a century of intense testing has yet to find fault. And the testing will never end for as long as there is science.\nPlease, werdzwerth, understand that to claim that science is malleable, or that scientists play the game for personal gain, gets one nowhere. As in any pursuit there are frauds; one thinks of the brutal Trofim Lysenko, but he and many others have been exposed by the unstinting efforts (some at great personal risk) of others in those fields. Sometimes it has taken many decades, or longer, for the validity of certain hypotheses (eg Alfred Wegener on plate tectonics) to be validated and accepted by science, but great hypotheses demand great proofs. And still there are the idiots, as now when, despite the increasing accessibility of real science, we have this smug rash of precious anti-vaccination campaigners wilfully endangering not just their own kids but whole communities and, in particular, those individuals whose condition of immunosuppression prevents them from being vaccinated.

As a prime example: our atmosphere once had a suffocating concentration of CO2 with almost zero oxygen but ~2.3 billion years ago underwent a massive change to oxygen-rich in the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) It appears that the GOE was triggered some 0.4 billion years earlier by the evolution of multicellular cyanobacteria - still with us today. It seems the greenhouse effect of that earlier CO2-rich atmosphere had kept the earth warm at a time when the early sun was far cooler than it is now.\nThat we exist today would still affect the atmosphere, earth and oceans even if we made nothing and lived by eating plants and occasional bare-handed sheep strangling, because any living thin consumes and emits. The GOE was a cataclysmic event at its time, but even that was a gradual process (it took 0.4bn years) compared with today's man-driven rates of CO2 and climate change.\nUntil the early C19th our effect on atmospheric CO2 was barely noticeable, swamped as it was by natural CO2-consuming processes. Even so, we were leaving various mineral footprints through our exploitation of metallurgy (lead poisoning being just one recurring issue, and having left a legible record in soil and bones since the Roman era and before, right up to today - e.g. Flint, Michigan). So a livable society without excessive CO2 emissions is possible.\nWhat is different today is our insatiable demand for \"energy\" which we most readily generate from the combustion of carbon-rich natural materials found now in fossil form as coal, oil, natural gas. Before 1800 most of our combustible fuel came from felling trees which, if re-planted, recovered the CO2 emitted by our combustion of the predecessors. Today, however, we're emitting CO2 at about twice the rate at which all available natural processes can remove it (and the significant proportion of this as oceanic absorption does not exactly \"remove\" CO2, just holds it for later emission).\nNow suppose we learn to halve, or much better than halve, our profligate CO2 emissions? That need not betoken the end of commerce, industry, travel. Indeed, we would certainly need the first 2 of these in good nick in order to achieve such a reduction, 'though far less travel of goods and people would certainly help balance the equation.\nSo let's have more local manufacture and agriculture; more truly community-based care; less conspicuous consumption; better-quality and longer-lasting products; more efficient and lighter vehicular transport. And let's bring back real work and skills for our young people, or those many for whom compulsorily extended school feels like a sentence of confinement, saving them from sterile addiction to smart-phones and social media and giving them real pride in achievement. Yet also encourage arts, literature and learning for learning's sake.\nDo that, and we really could have a worthwhile, low-carbon economy which might, just might, have the means and brains to survive the coming climatic crisis.", "recommendation_count": "4", "in_reply_to": "124557894", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "124583495", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1547394947000}, "author": "chrisbrown", "author_id": "3684556", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "correction \"I think what [you] mean is . . . \"", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "124579603", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "124581638", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1547390396000}, "author": "werdzwerth", "author_id": "12826250", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "I have been posting comments on CiF about creating a new money supply through making people-centred, environmentally-friendly jobs profitable and this is about the first time they have drawn a response but it seems that while so many know so much about climate change, we are mostly in the dark about replacing destructive work with non-destructive work, and destructive here also means the drudgery for the workforce.

But its industry, transport and on-demand power that also need some form of fuel, and you would be forgiven actually for thinking that there must be some other way around it. The unfortunate truth is that there is no real potential alternative for these three large components of our energy system; except perhaps biomass. We do not have enough biomass for all these use-cases. We have mostly reached the capacity of bioenergy in Europe, which is why we import it from places like Indonesia, and other places including the US. There is absolutely zero possibility of replacing the fossil fuels we use for power, industry and transport with bioenergy. It would be a devastating move for the environment.\nNow, its important to remember that we are indeed approaching capacity within the electricity grid, and you can verify this by the amount of curtailed wind that is already there; to triple the amount of energy being transported via wires would be highly problematic for grid operators. \nSo we need to use the gas grid. It would be ideal to use as much of the existing industrial facilities and turbines as possible. Converting steel production and other industrial processes to hydrogen is relatively straightforward; conversion to electricity is actually not possible in most cases - high grade process heat is often required. \nAnd for transport; we will need a charge point for every single car sold; where the vast majority of people living in cities do not have a private garage. I have studied this extensively, and as the TUV SUD e-mobility chief explains; all these 11kW charge points will require significant upgrades to the grid. If people want more range; more energy needs to be provided; so its constantly increasing cost for laying cables and upgrading substations.\nActually, he puts the cost for Germany at about \u20ac52 billion for electric charging, and \u20ac40 billion for hydrogen refuelling stations. I'd be inclined to agree with his figures; despite electricity grid operators being quite optimistic about what can be achieved - once the percentage increases; the grid infrastructure problems appear - and just simply the fact that so many million chargers need to be installed on streets. \nThen you've got the range and recharging issues. \nSo ultimately; we have to use hydrogen for the majority of use cases where we use fossil fuels today. If batteries were a genuine panacea, then it would be obvious to use them. The problem is that the characteristics of fossil fuels; including the storing transporting and weight-to-energy value, among other things, has meant that we are going to continue using them; or something like them. And the only element that resembles fossil fuels is hydrogen. \nWe have no choice; and the more people want to keep confusing the situation by thinking that we can store infinite amounts of energy in batteries are really slowing down what needs to be achieved quickly: a wholesale shift to hydrogen in all sectors - and the absolute best way of doing this is via a decarbonised gas grid.", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "124560136", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "124562148", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1547322550000}, "author": "werdzwerth", "author_id": "12826250", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "I am not a denier.

Trust me; I spend all my time researching and then explaining this to people; and I am aware there was a huge fuss made about hydrogen in the early 00s, and nothing came of it.\nWhats changed today is that we have very low cost renewables. In fact, we are approaching a nominal value for renewables lower than the natural gas import price; so very simplistically its cheaper. So this goes some way to explain why the world is now coming around to the idea again, after getting burned in the 00s.\nBut let me explain why there is no other option to hydrogen. First of all, the gas grid carries 5-7 times the peak capacity of the electricity grid. So when everyone turns their heating on, they use gas - and this is a large amount of energy that we cannot replace like-for-like with electricity. Initially, this is because we don't have that amount of dispatchable generation (gas turbines), and as mentioned the electricity grid can't transport that amount of electricity in one go.\nNow, the other reason we can't use electricity is because ASHP units cannot realistically replace gas boilers. ASHP essentially provides constant low-level heat; and so it requires very good insulation and very good windows. It also means that pipes and ducts need to be installed; and windows need to remain closed. It is unfair to ask the 80% of people in the UK who use gas currently, to switch to ASHP units. So thats why this is very unlikely to actually happen - the cost of insulating and installing these systems will mean that the system is simply unaffordable for most people.

Many extensive studies have been completed over the last few years and the government has finally agreed to an extensive CCS program in the UK, to start with large industrial users. The elegance of this route is that reformers are installed at the point at which gas enters the UK via pipeline, and the gas grid then undergoes conversion; which is actually minor because only the central line pipes where gas is stored at pressure need to be made of polyethylene. Most modern line pipes already are. The residential pipe network already used 'town gas' in the 1970s, so this isn't a worry.\nNow, the cost is the next part of this that people may be interested in. This is interesting to explain; because actually the 'gas' component of a gas bill is actually only 39%; the rest is operating costs and other expenses. This means that when we add the reformers where gas is entering the country, this imposes only a minor cost on the gas bill. CO2 is then safely piped offshore; and in fact Equinor (who will be the partner supplying gas) have just received licenses to find suitable storage sites in the North Sea. They have been storing carbon like this for 22 years without problems; the plain fact is that regulations have not previously been in place to necessitate the utilisation of CCS. It is not expensive or difficult. \nSo there we have it; I think this is essentially going to be the blueprint for every other country to follow. It is perfect because once you have a gas grid using decarbonised gas, every user of that gas grid is not producing emissions, be they industrial users or residential heating. And then you have transport and shipping, which will also use this gas in fuel cells. This is going to mean a faster expansion of refueling availability in the UK. \nAnd the main advantage then is that solar and wind can be plugged in at any point on the gas grid and not have to worry about highly erratic production; it just goes into the gas grid when it is produced. \nThe cost of the project is estimated by the award-winning Northern Gas Networks to mean a 7% rise in gas bills by 2035. So its not much. I think the net positive effects of the conversion will far outweigh the cost to the consumer. And transport fuel will be substantially cheaper using hydrogen (fuel cells are 50-60% efficient rather than 25% or so for combustion engines); this goes for either on-site electrolysis at the gas station or via the gas grid. \nIt will have a profound effect on everyones lives.", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "124555998", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "only the central line pipes where gas is stored at pressure need to be made of polyethylene", "effect": "which is actually minor"}, {"cause": "actually the gas component is actually only 39 %", "effect": "this is interesting to explain"}, {"cause": "once you have a gas grid using decarbonised gas every user of that gas grid is not producing emissions", "effect": "it is perfect be"}]}, {"id": "124557092", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1547308962000}, "author": "Daniel21x", "author_id": "101241012", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "(Part a) \nOkay, I'm going to explain this for the casual reader who may not be au fait with some the figures.\nFirst of all yes; there are multiple methods of obtaining hydrogen; and the main ones are electrolysis (power-to-gas) and reforming of methane which is employed at very large scale today in the petrol refineries and to make ammonia for fertilizer. Somewhere between 55-60 million tonnes of hydrogen are manufactured each year via natural gas. So; taking electrolysis as a primary method; the figures are quite good, although as the cost of renewable electricity decreases so too does the cost of hydrogen; and by 2030 we should have a price for electrolysed hydrogen lower than natural gas. Already, because a lot of renewable electricity is actually curtailed (its a small percentage, but it will increase), there are a lot of opportunities to produce hydrogen at low cost. With a \u00a325/MWh cost for (off-peak) wind or solar, we have reached an approximate price parity with natural gas. If we are offsetting natural gas imports, then this value could much higher as it is of greater economic value and thus perhaps a \u00a350/MWh cost for electricity is feasible, all things considered. Because you are not incurring excessive grid fees within a congested electricity grid, this reduces overall electricity costs; although crucially; finding a practical use for the hydrogen is paramount, and in this way the conversion of industrial processes and pipelines is going to become an important factor as more renewables are built. Its complicated; suffice to say that industry or gas turbines for example need to move in concert with the availability of hydrogen so as to use the energy produced.\nI will briefly explain a few important facts and metrics. First of all, no other grid-scale storage exists; batteries are far too expensive to use for heating, for example. And the electricity grid is already quite close to capacity in many instances; limiting the energy that can be distributed by wire.

Your options there would be nuclear, solar, wind and (tidal) water. But you seem to think there's some other energy source - a magic energy tree?\nThen with hydrogen you have the problems of distribution, storage and safety. All can solved, but involve very low temperatures and high pressures, and dealing with an odourless, volatile, invisible gas which will ignite explosively at almost any concentration in air.\nThen you burn the H2 in an engine? That has a rather low efficiency. Or you react it a bit more efficiently with air in fuel cells - another version of the battery (electrochemical) technology which it seems you reject.\nBetter solutions to our problems of energy generation and consumption exist.

This is what allowed scientists to warn about \"more extremes/higher/wilder/variable\" etc back in the early days of general circulation models of the 1980s. This is also what allowed the pioneers to point out \"Arctic Amplification\" and such terms that now are common from even simpler models. \nThat one in recent years are teasing out empirical trends in extreme weather before 2020 is simply terrifying. Because it indicates a strong weather dependence to average climate. Instead of a weak dependence (as it theoretically could be given the processing power and the resolution that was way below resolving synopitic scale weather patterns). \nTo try to explain - weather is the problem we face from season to season and day to day. A monotonous climate change is not what cause instant \"danger or issues\". Weather is what does that (heat wave, drought, flood, cold-wave etc). These latter is what makes \"news\" and \"warnings\". \nHence, when studies are accumulating and presenting that one discover trends in the inherent chaotic weather-systems of our planet (so chaotic that our weather-forecasts do not really have much predictability left after one week) - it is extremely worrying that such trends can be identified in datasets that are covering less than 40 years. Remember, high amplitude weather anomalies are very different from low-trend AGW. To the extent that where I grew up I was used to a >70 degree Celsius natural amplitude between peak winter and summer extremes when growing up (>minus 40 in winter and 30 degrees in summer). Compare this to a century scale warming of 3 degrees one is operating with a huge signal to noise ratio. \nIt is not surprising from a theoretical point of view - but it is worrying that these trends become evident in data that are mostly gathered from a sub 400ppm reality over such a short period. \nBecause in models - it is best to use peak emission scenario and look at the difference between pre-industrial 1700 conditions and 2100 without any emission constraints to identify these tendencies. \nRemember, ten-fifteen years ago climate science was always very careful to link extreme events to AGW. Because it was right to do so. Time series were shorter. The models one used was lacking in resolution. One must rule out low-frequent internal variability. And \"significance\" is king. (Same truth apply now, BTW - one can not link a single named storm as result of AGW - weather is more than a linear regression from average conditions). \nIt is all statistics of extremes. In Norway one is seeing places with a \"below one in 500 year chance\" with mid 20th century data, now expressing a \"one every third year\" reoccurrence. What matters most to us humans is how the very edges of a statistical probability curve (bell-curve) behaves. Small shifts in the median peak of things is \"normal and unnoticed\". What happens at the edges changes how much time we spend in the extremes. \nHaving said that - non-human (ecological) parts of reality do bother with the slow shift in the median peak. Fish in the ocean follow the mean. Some vegetation respond to a mean temperature jumping across a certain level for a certain number of days in winter - activating their spring response. While migrating birds bother with the length of days/position of sun to trigger their migration timing - causing a trickling-down problem of pacing. Glaciers are also a zero-order low-pass filter of weather (as climate is). The dynamics of inner continental Antarctica has not completely embraced that we have been in an inter-glacial for 11,000 years for example. The poorly ventilated deep water of the Pacific has likely just gotten the news of a \"little ice-age\" unfolding from 700 years ago http://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6422/70. (Just look at the radiocarbon age of those waters by the classic study of Wally Broecker from 1985: https://atmos.washington.edu/2002Q4/211/broecker.jpg, that age represent the last time it experienced air during the time of the Roman empire - but one must remember convection of heat occurs as well). \nThat meddling with CO2 and average global means turns up in weather-data already is a very very big red flag. The atmosphere is a high noise to signal problem compared to the delayed low-pass response of the more viscous fluid dynamics of water and ice. Oceans and ice-sheets are coupled to the atmosphere too. As the first law of thermodynamics point out - energy is conserved.

In 2019 she releases her fourth album which, judging by the excellent songs played to the Guardian, is sure to be another hit. But she also has a stack of ongoing extracurricular activities.\nWhere has your head been at since the last album?I finished touring, moved to New York, and I was jaded, depleted of any artistic inspiration. I just started cooking, going to the dry cleaners, learning piano. New York doesn\u2019t really have the same rock\u2019n\u2019roll scene it used to, and it was very lonely. I\u2019d often book studios and there\u2019d never be anyone else there. But it gave me a kind of freedom, because there was no one telling me to release an album. I wasn\u2019t forcing myself to write pop songs about boys and relationships, which I used to be so obsessed with when I was younger.\nAnd you got engaged. Did you write about that?I have a terrible habit of analysing things to within an inch of their lives, so I didn\u2019t want to overanalyse what I had with him \u2013 it\u2019s something much more pure, and something I didn\u2019t need to explain to myself in a song.\nBut on one new song, Love I\u2019m Given, maybe I was reflecting on how I finally felt I\u2019d found this person that was loving me for the right reasons. I don\u2019t think I ever got over being thrust into the spotlight, so I put on quite a tough exterior. I never had time to myself, and any time I did was in a hotel room somewhere \u2013 I\u2019d probably had a few drinks, knocked myself out. I don\u2019t know how I could have possibly given a good version of myself to anyone: friends, boyfriends, family. So I\u2019m very grateful Caspar came along, because I feel like I was able to be myself again.\nWhat else did you write about?Flux is about thinking about the person who you almost ended up with \u2013 I\u2019m a sucker for what could have been. Electricity is about a friend who had been cheated on quite cruelly for a couple of years. But I can\u2019t help writing with empathy, trying to understand why a person has behaved the way they have. Somebody tried to write a song to damage me, and it was a really horrifying thing to go through. I found it really baffling, and just sad, that something that I\u2019d built entirely by myself, my career, was somehow at risk. It had a huge effect on me. But I still didn\u2019t feel the need to be angry \u2013 so maybe that\u2019s a good thing.\nAre you talking about Ed Sheeran? [Don\u2019t is widely believed to be about Goulding.]Er \u2026 not specifically. [Sighs] There was a period where I felt someone was trying to sabotage me. So there probably are small pieces of the songs that relate to things that frustrate me, and things that are happening in the world, but I\u2019ve always been conscious that I want to keep songwriting as an escape.\nThere\u2019s a bit of a pop-rap feel to some of the new tracks \u2013 were you trying to do something new?I think it\u2019s important to know the way pop is changing \u2013 I would never release something completely blind, without listening to any radio or Spotify, and expect people to like it; and for it to compare with what\u2019s out there. But I still find it thrilling when people release something that doesn\u2019t sound like anything else \u2013 I\u2019m always fighting to work with producers coming up with whole new soundscapes. My voice doesn\u2019t sound like anyone\u2019s in the world, so I\u2019ve got that to my advantage, and I can also manipulate my voice as part of the track or make it into a sample. That\u2019s how I stay not sounding like anything else \u2013 I have that locked, for ever.Does pop ever feel frivolous compared with your climate change activism?Sometimes it does. But often I really need to just write a bloody good pop song after meeting climate scientists, or going to the climate assembly in Kenya last year. Going to Greenland and seeing glaciers collapse. It\u2019s gone beyond facts and boring data \u2013 we\u2019re seeing it with our own eyes. The wildfires [in California] were exacerbated by climate change, the crazy storms that have been happening: it\u2019s very obvious.\nOne of my motivations to have a bigger platform as a singer is so that I have more people to reach. Climate change has got to a critical point where we all need to be very active; we need to compensate for what\u2019s going on in certain political situations. I know that \u201ccelebrities shouldn\u2019t get involved in politics\u201d, but it\u2019s something we have to act on now. I can\u2019t help but feel a bit frustrated that I\u2019m the only one speaking out about something so important \u2013 no one else in my peer group is.\nThe next step is electing people who take this seriously, and to trust scientists. And having a bigger consciousness of your day-to-day actions. I don\u2019t eat that much meat; I try to use sustainable fashion brands; we\u2019re trying to make my tour completely plastic free, and cut down on flights, with a better eco-bus situation. I think I\u2019m probably doing more good than bad, overall.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock", "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/celebrity", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/activism", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Back with a bold fourth album, Ellie Goulding is set on a new sound, averting environmental catastrophe \u2013 and settling a score or two", "date_published": {"$date": 1546354863000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1546354863000}, "authors": ["Ben Beaumont-Thomas"], "article_section": "Music", "article_tags": ["Ellie Goulding", "Pop and rock", "Culture", "Music", "Celebrity", "Activism", "Climate change", "Environment", "World news", "Life and style"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/01/ellie-goulding-interview-fourth-album-2019-arts-preview", "og:description": "Back with a bold fourth album, Ellie Goulding is set on a new sound, averting environmental catastrophe \u2013 and settling a score or two", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7035d072806763f94ca11fcd8c7dee144c71ba73/0_236_4037_2422/master/4037.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=5e84236f4ab5251ef86443f869632c78", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Ellie Goulding: 'I'm finally myself again'"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7035d072806763f94ca11fcd8c7dee144c71ba73/0_236_4037_2422/master/4037.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=99f2dbacae43e8c9588dfd1369c957d6", "width": "4037", "height": "2422", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7035d072806763f94ca11fcd8c7dee144c71ba73/0_236_4037_2422/master/4037.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=23fce35cca4671dac12b3485be70112c", "description": "\u2018My voice doesn\u2019t sound like anyone\u2019s in the world\u2019 Ellie Goulding.\nPhotograph: Publicity image"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2591570e68ac03d73d8a3c814cdc0a02a6be654f/0_0_2362_2362/master/2362.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7c1bc43b5bf609a8f8fac9f77a38de02", "width": "2362", "height": "2362", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2591570e68ac03d73d8a3c814cdc0a02a6be654f/0_0_2362_2362/master/2362.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec4c92e057a7c924b9c8cdac4e3c79c", "description": "Ellie Goulding"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07a24a2c3613145ed8ce3"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/03/uk-power-stations-electricity-output-lowest-1994-renewables-record", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "The output of British power stations fell this year to levels last seen almost a quarter of a century ago, while renewables achieved a record share of the UK electricity supply.\nElectricity generation in 2018 was the lowest since 1994, when Tony Blair became the leader of the Labour party.\nThe reduced need for power came despite there being 8 million more people living in the UK. Analysts said the figures were a sign of increasingly efficient use of energy and the country\u2019s changing economy.\nThe UK website Carbon Brief, which analysed government and industry data, found that 335 terawatt-hours were generated by power plants last year, down by about 1% on the year before. Since 2005 the level has fallen by 16% \u2013 or the equivalent of two and a half Hinkley Point C nuclear power stations.\nSimon Evans, policy editor at the group, said: \u201cIt could be a combination of more efficient appliances, energy-saving lightbulbs and, more recently, LEDs. Then there\u2019s supermarkets installing better fridges, industry using more efficient pumps. Across all of those businesses, efficiency will have been going up. And of course there\u2019s the changing nature of industry in the UK.\u201d\nThe financial crisis could also have played a role in making homes and businesses more careful with their energy use, he added.\nWhile generation fell almost every year between 2008 and 2014, it remained stable between 2015 and 2017, before resuming its downward march in 2018.\nPrevious research by the government\u2019s climate change advisers has found that more energy efficient appliances helped save the average household \u00a3290 a year between 2008 and 2017.\nContinuing to use energy more efficiently would help the UK reach its binding climate goals, Evans said. \u201cUsing less as an end in itself isn\u2019t the point. But it is the case that meeting carbon targets is made easier if we use energy efficiently.\u201d\nSeparate data from the National Grid showed that 2018 was the greenest year to date for electricity generation as more power is sourced from renewable sources and less from coal. The carbon intensity from electricity generation was down 6.8% last year and has more than halved since 2013.\nThe analysis by Carbon Brief found that renewable sources including biomass, hydro, solar and wind power supplied a record 33% of electricity this year, up from 29% last year. Renewables were just 6.7% of the mix in 2009.\nGreen energy was boosted primarily by new windfarms connecting to the grid, as well as new biomass plants, which included the conversion of a coal unit at Drax power station in north Yorkshire and the conversion of a former coal plant at Lynemouth, Northumberland.\nMeanwhile the coal-driven output was down 25% despite warnings of a coal comeback driven by high gas prices. Nuclear power also had a weak year, with generation down 8%, mainly due to ageing reactors being taken offline for safety checks. Gas remained the top source of electricity supplies, but fell 4%.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuel-divestment", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Energy efficiency and changing economy cut generation by 1% in 2018 as renewables supplied 33% of electricity", "date_published": {"$date": 1546473666000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1546509507000}, "authors": ["Adam Vaughan"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Energy efficiency", "Fossil fuels", "Renewable energy", "Fossil fuel divestment", "Energy", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Environment", "Carbon footprints", "Business", "Copenhagen climate change conference 2009", "Government data", "Ethical and green living", "Politics", "UK news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/03/uk-power-stations-electricity-output-lowest-1994-renewables-record", "og:description": "Energy efficiency and changing economy cut generation by 1% in 2018 as renewables supplied 33% of electricity", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09dd7e4dcf138392ce173e4966983886f99613b8/0_72_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=47d0eb21c1fa4b9f3d5df38662f14ed4", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "UK power stations' electricity output lowest since 1994"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09dd7e4dcf138392ce173e4966983886f99613b8/0_72_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=05f899cb6656e50be5e0410da38b828c", "width": "5250", "height": "3150", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09dd7e4dcf138392ce173e4966983886f99613b8/0_72_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=895f3ce6f72eaa9a1e4e09dcad20038c", "description": "Gas-fired power station, Teesside, Britain.

It\u2019s warmer. I don\u2019t need my dressing gown now. All the draughts have gone. Before it [the home] looked like a rabbit hutch \u2013 it looks like a proper home now,\u201d she said.\nEnergiesprong differs markedly from previous efforts at upgrading the efficiency of Britain\u2019s housing stock, which is some of the draughtiest in Europe.\nPrevious policies such as the failed Green Deal largely resulted in piecemeal improvements, such as a new boiler or wall insulation. The Dutch approach aims to refurbish the entire house and bring it up to the high standards that will be needed in decades\u2019 time if carbon dioxide targets are to be met.\nEmily Braham, who is in charge of strategy and operations at the not-for-profit organisation Energiesprong UK, said: \u201cThe reason why this appealed to me so much is it gets us to a much better energy performance, where we have to be in 2050. That\u2019s a huge difference to standard retrofit in the UK.\u201d\nCosts are relatively high, at \u00a385,000 per property initially but are expected to fall to \u00a362,000 by the end of the programme. Braham said scale would help costs fall as the supply chain adapted.\n\u201cEnergiesprong is great, a gold standard \u2013 it should be pursued wherever possible for low carbon, low energy bills and high-skilled jobs,\u201d said Pedro Guertler of environmental thinktank E3G.\nHe added that Nottingham city council is a leader, but most austerity-hit councils no longer had the capacity to lead such work. The Treasury should increase energy efficiency investment by \u00a31bn a year, he urged.\nPilot Energiesprong projects are also planned in Maldon, Essex, and in the Exeter area. Braham said the government had indicated that it was interested in the initiative. There is currently a vacuum in energy efficiency policy, beyond schemes for people in fuel poverty.\nBraham said a no-deal Brexit could jeopardise Enegiesprong\u2019s prospects in the UK: \u201cIf we left without a deal, it would be a risk.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/money/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/nottingham", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Nottingham pioneers \u2018Energiesprong\u2019 after it wins \u00a35m funding from EU", "date_published": {"$date": 1546869615000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1546871887000}, "authors": ["Adam Vaughan"], "article_section": "Society", "article_tags": ["Housing", "Energy bills", "Energy", "Environment", "Society", "UK news", "Nottingham", "European Union", "Europe", "World news", "Climate change", "Business", "Netherlands", "Energy industry", "Money"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/07/dutch-eco-homes-idea-arrives-in-uk-and-cuts-energy-bills-in-half-nottingham-energiesprong", "og:description": "Nottingham pioneers \u2018Energiesprong\u2019 after it wins \u00a35m funding from EU", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76816f1a6588b76d4cc4e9451867a9d9ef6d94de/103_151_2457_1474/master/2457.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=866f820487b89b21304889b46da03895", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Dutch eco initiative halves energy bills in first UK homes"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76816f1a6588b76d4cc4e9451867a9d9ef6d94de/103_151_2457_1474/master/2457.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=905487c9fcd51554887603d7cde9898a", "width": "2457", "height": "1474", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76816f1a6588b76d4cc4e9451867a9d9ef6d94de/103_151_2457_1474/master/2457.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4a29988e8d8ff172d9b1df12c922cfd1", "description": "More than 150 social housing homes will receive new wall cladding, windows and solar panels.\nPhotograph: Energiesprong International/IET"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f3fbf17dae09f1e36cfe991f79da0e4bc7bc16a/0_0_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0ed06124417f120f1ee83f03e14a083e", "width": "4032", "height": "2419", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f3fbf17dae09f1e36cfe991f79da0e4bc7bc16a/0_0_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=535cd951782dc56de873b54e45d0e9d4", "description": "Joan Warburton: \u201cIt looks like a proper home now.\u2019 Photograph: Nottingham City Council"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07a41a2c3613145ed8cec"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/08/carbon-emissions-trump-agenda-climate-change", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "A new analysis shows US greenhouse gas levels are increasing as the Trump administration unravels efforts to slow climate change.\nCarbon emissions rose sharply last year, increasing 3.4%, according to new estimates from the economic firm Rhodium Group. That year\u2019s jump in emissions is the biggest since the bounce back from the recession in 2010. It is the second largest gain in more than two decades.\nCoal plants are shutting down, but electricity demand is growing. Natural-gas fired power emits about half as much carbon as coal but still contributes to climate change. The fossil fuel is replacing most of the coal plants that are closing and also fed most of the higher demand, increasing power-sector climate pollution. Outside of the power sector, transportation, industry and buildings all increased their emissions as well, according to the estimates.\nThe numbers undercut one of the Trump administration\u2019s key defenses for dismissing federal science reports that show rising temperatures will wreak havoc on the economy, kill people and cause more extreme weather. Trump has said he doesn\u2019t believe the findings and his officials have argued they are exaggerated.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency chief, Andrew Wheeler, often trumpets declines in greenhouse gases, citing data showing that they fell 2.7% from 2016 to 2017.\nBut the EPA is rescinding Obama-era climate work, including regulations meant to speed a shift from coal. The agency contends that Donald Trump\u2019s agenda is driving energy innovation that could help cut emissions. Energy experts, however, say Trump is doing the opposite by rolling back the rules and policies that could have sped renewable growth and by forgoing new regulations beyond the electricity sector.\nRhodium Group tracks the most prevalent greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. The firm found a modest decrease in carbon emissions between 2016 and 2017, in part because of a warmer-than-usual winter that didn\u2019t require as much heating. Since then carbon output has surged.\n\u201cThe tailwinds of Obama administration policy are dissipating,\u201d said Trevor Houser, a partner at the firm. \u201cThis year makes it abundantly clear that energy market trends alone \u2013 the low cost of natural gas, the increasing competitiveness of renewables \u2013 are not enough to deliver sustained declines in US emissions.\u201d\nHouser said the numbers would have been worse without the state and local policies enacted during the past five to 10 years. But that the groundswell of climate commitments by governors and mayors since Trump said he would exit the international Paris climate agreement might not translate into policy for some time, he added. He said those efforts are likely to be significant but not sufficient to meet the levels the US pledged.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Last year\u2019s 3.4% jump in emissions is the largest since 2010 recession and second largest gain in more than two decades", "date_published": {"$date": 1546941607000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1546953716000}, "authors": ["Emily Holden"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Trump administration", "Climate change", "Environment", "US news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/08/carbon-emissions-trump-agenda-climate-change", "og:description": "Last year\u2019s 3.4% jump in emissions is the largest since 2010 recession and second largest gain in more than two decades", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e579f371c13752463eeca5090f36060b656b374b/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=02c4664986db6cc8d1d679eb5fb1e3e7", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Carbon emissions up as Trump agenda rolls back climate change work"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e579f371c13752463eeca5090f36060b656b374b/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=04b218ec3a489bd7a746d60c089d27f4", "width": "5184", "height": "3110", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e579f371c13752463eeca5090f36060b656b374b/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fb6431be3f177d17fedbe88e19f5b4f7", "description": "The Tesoro refinery in Carson, California.

Warmer oceans are also a major factor in increasing the severity of storms, hurricanes and extreme rainfall.\nOceans store heat so effectively that it would take decades for them to cool down, even in the unlikely scenario that greenhouse gas emissions were halted urgently.\nThe report, published on Thursday in the journal Science, found that the warming of the oceans was accelerating and was matching the predictions of climate change models, which have shown global temperature rises are likely to lead to extreme weather across the world.\nZeke Hausfather, co-author of the paper and a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, said: \u201cWhile 2018 will be the fourth warmest year on record on the [earth\u2019s] surface, it will most certainly be the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. The global warming signal is a lot easier to detect if it is changing in the oceans than on the surface.\u201d\nOceans absorb more than nine-tenths of the excess energy trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases, and play a key role in regulating the world\u2019s climate.\nBut the role of oceans in the global climate system was overlooked for many years, in part because of a lack of data and the difficulty of studying the marine environment. Only in recent years have scientists come to realise the full importance of oceans, which have effectively absorbed much of the impact of climate change in recent decades, but are now understood to be reaching their capacity as a buffer.\nSeparate recently published research extrapolated temperature estimates for the oceans for the past 150 years, and found substantial warming.\nPublished in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, that research found the total heat taken up by the oceans in the last century and a half was about 1,000 times the annual energy use of the world\u2019s population.\nA Guardian analysis of those findings suggested that the amount of energy absorbed by the oceans was equivalent to an atomic bomb per second for the past 150 years. Scientists said this was unsustainable in the long term without seeing further massive effects, including extreme weather, fiercer storms, and sea level rises.\nThe heating could also affect sea currents around the world, with unpredictable consequences.\nLate last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that the world would face dire effects from global warming from 2030 unless urgent and drastic measures are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe new Science paper analysed four studies published between 2014 and 2017, which corrected for discrepancies between different types of ocean temperature measurements and gaps in measurements.\nSatellite monitoring, buoys and ships are all used to gather data on the effect of climate change on the oceans. In the past decade, a network of 4,000 buoys known as Argo has provided an unprecedented data set on the temperature, salinity and acidification of oceans.\nBy taking the four studies, with different methodologies, into consideration the authors of the new analysis were able to build a fuller picture than was previously possible, with calculations extrapolated back to the 1970s.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/sea-level", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Seawater temperature is rising faster than predicted, which is likely to worsen extreme weather events around the world", "date_published": {"$date": 1547146808000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1547166302000}, "authors": ["Fiona Harvey"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Oceans", "Environment", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Science", "Sea level", "Greenhouse gas emissions"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/10/warming-oceans-likely-to-raise-sea-levels-30cm-by-end-of-century-study", "og:description": "Seawater temperature is rising faster than predicted, which is likely to worsen extreme weather events around the world", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dae72c9201a533785e21f8646d23b5d422e2962d/0_1170_3333_2000/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=99013437469a5367fe6945a1e49a45ca", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Warming oceans likely to raise sea levels 30cm by end of century \u2013 study"}, "headline": "0", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dae72c9201a533785e21f8646d23b5d422e2962d/0_1170_3333_2000/master/3333.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c77d339b4f89782de8b2c8b0a91aaebb", "width": "3333", "height": "2000", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dae72c9201a533785e21f8646d23b5d422e2962d/0_1170_3333_2000/master/3333.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ea0e52f3df91ea8ab598b00647c3378", "description": "A family wades through seawater that flooded their village in Kiribati central Pacific.

At Hyams beach, in Jervis Bay, New South Wales, thousands of cars and illegal campers have to be cleared every season. Wherever we go, a tide of plastics and microplastics follows us. Two years of data analysed by Guardian Australia shows that plastic accounts for 75% of the litter on our beaches \u2013 chip packets, cups, decaying bags.\nClimate change is speeding up coastal erosion, and even the deadly jellyfish are moving south, thanks to warming waters.\nWe have more than 11,000 beaches in Australia, and cannot include them all in the poll.

The first Sitka spruces were notched into the grassy Borders hill just over 40 years ago, making them almost a decade older than me. For all my life, Wolfhopelee hill \u2013 which shares its abstruse name with, and is visible from, the house I grew up in \u2013 has been covered in rows of trees. When they were smaller, adders basked along the crushed stone track, and the grassy rides remained as fragments of the old sheep-grazed landscape. As the trees grew, the rides shrank and woodland species arrived: goldcrests, siskins and the occasional red squirrel.\nNow the spruces\u2019 time is up. This whole section of forest is being felled and will be replanted. Clear-felling is banned in Switzerland and has largely been abandoned in Germany, but is still favoured by British forest managers: it is faster and more profitable than selective felling.\nI watch a contractor load logs on to his eight-wheeled forwarder, picking up giant scoops with the claw-like grab arm. Using the grab as a counterweight, he bumps over an undulating mat of twigs and broken branches to the log stack. It\u2019s skilled work. The best lengths will be milled for construction or fencing, while thinner sections go for biomass pellets or chipboard.\nThe Cumbrian naturalist Derek Ratcliffe likened a clear-felled plantation to a battlefield, and this is what awaits me round the corner. I pass a forester\u2019s caravan with a satellite dish and a sign warning me that I am on CCTV, and reach the summit. What I remember as a patch of open tussocks fringed with spruce (a favourite viewpoint) is now a quarry, the hill gouged out to remove the shale that surfaces the tracks. Otherwise there is nothing but a flattened mess of brash, with the occasional dead tree left standing, like the survivor of a wildfire.\nThen I hear a familiar sound. Through the still morning air comes the rising and falling chinking and clinking of a flock of crossbills in flight.

The insect population that once provided plentiful food for birds throughout the mountainous national park had collapsed. On the ground, 98% had gone. Up in the leafy canopy, 80% had vanished. The most likely culprit by far is global warming.\n\u201cIt was just astonishing,\u201d Lister said. \u201cBefore, both the sticky ground plates and canopy plates would be covered with insects. You\u2019d be there for hours picking them off the plates at night. But now the plates would come down after 12 hours in the tropical forest with a couple of lonely insects trapped or none at all.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a true collapse of the insect populations in that rainforest,\u201d he said. \u201cWe began to realise this is terrible \u2013 a very, very disturbing result.\u201d\nEarth\u2019s bugs outweigh humans 17 times over and are such a fundamental foundation of the food chain that scientists say a crash in insect numbers risks \u201cecological Armageddon\u201d. When Lister\u2019s study was published in October, one expert called the findings \u201chyper-alarming\u201d.\nThe Puerto Rico work is one of just a handful of studies assessing this vital issue, but those that do exist are deeply worrying. Flying insect numbers in Germany\u2019s natural reserves have plunged 75% in just 25 years. The virtual disappearance of birds in an Australian eucalyptus forest was blamed on a lack of insects caused by drought and heat. Lister and his colleague Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda also found that insect numbers in a dry forest in Mexico had fallen 80% since the 1980s.\n\u201cWe are essentially destroying the very life support systems that allow us to sustain our existence on the planet, along with all the other life on the planet,\u201d Lister said. \u201cIt is just horrifying to watch us decimate the natural world like this.\u201d\nIt was not insects that drew Lister to the Luquillo rainforest for the first time in the mid-1970s. \u201cI was interested in competition among the anoles lizards,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re the most diverse group of vertebrates in the world and even by that time had become a paradigm for ecology and evolutionary studies.\u201d\nThe forest immediately captivated Lister, a lecturer at Rensselaer Polytechnic University in the US. \u201cIt was and still is the most beautiful forest I have ever been in. It\u2019s almost enchanted. There\u2019s the lush verdant forest and cascading waterfalls, and along the roadsides there are carpets of multicoloured flowers. It\u2019s a phantasmagoric landscape.\u201d\nIt was important to measure insect numbers, as these are the lizards\u2019 main food, but at the time he thought nothing more of it. Returning to the national park decades later, however, the difference was startling.\n\u201cOne of the things I noticed in the forest was a lack of butterflies,\u201d he said. \u201cThey used to be all along the roadside, especially after the rain stopped, hundreds upon hundreds of them. But we couldn\u2019t see one butterfly.\u201d\nSince Lister\u2019s first visits to Luquillo, other scientists had predicted that tropical insects, having evolved in a very stable climate, would be much more sensitive to climate warming. \u201cIf you go a little bit past the thermal optimum for tropical insects, their fitness just plummets,\u201d he said.\nAs the data came in, the predictions were confirmed in startling fashion. \u201cThe number of hot spells, temperatures above 29C, have increased tremendously,\u201d he said. \u201cIt went from zero in the 1970s up to something like 44% of the days.\u201d Factors important elsewhere in the world, such as destruction of habitat and pesticide use, could not explain the plummeting insect populations in Luquillo, which has long been a protected area.\nData on other animals that feed on bugs backed up the findings. \u201cThe frogs and birds had also declined simultaneously by about 50% to 65%,\u201d Lister said. The population of one dazzling green bird that eats almost nothing but insects, the Puerto Rican tody, dropped by 90%.\nLister calls these impacts a \u201cbottom-up trophic cascade\u201d, in which the knock-on effects of the insect collapse surge up through the food chain.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think most people have a systems view of the natural world,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s all connected and when the invertebrates are declining the entire food web is going to suffer and degrade. It is a system-wide effect.\u201d\nTo understand the global scale of an insect collapse that has so far only been glimpsed, Lister says, there is an urgent need for much more research in many more habitats. \u201cMore data, that is my mantra,\u201d he said.\nThe problem is that there were very few studies of insect numbers in past decades to serve as a baseline, but Lister is undeterred: \u201cThere\u2019s no time like the present to start asking what\u2019s going on.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/animals", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Scientist Brad Lister returned to Puerto Rican rainforest after 35 years to find 98% of ground insects had vanished", "date_published": {"$date": 1547532013000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1547532132000}, "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Insects", "Wildlife", "Climate change", "Environment", "Animals", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/15/insect-collapse-we-are-destroying-our-life-support-systems", "og:description": "Scientist Brad Lister returned to Puerto Rican rainforest after 35 years to find 98% of ground insects had vanished", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d852d18cba6b5a7b9d7d25e7749fa9f9b90655b/117_184_4217_2531/master/4217.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=557931a933e427400517080626f3eb2d", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Insect collapse: \u2018We are destroying our life support systems\u2019"}, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d852d18cba6b5a7b9d7d25e7749fa9f9b90655b/99_160_4280_2805/master/4280.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5ee9b59ab745804cb6ba1e2fa5c9c174", "width": "4280", "height": "2805", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d852d18cba6b5a7b9d7d25e7749fa9f9b90655b/99_160_4280_2805/master/4280.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8814ba5967e1c7deca473f918614d111", "description": "El Yunque national forest in Sierra de Luquillo, Puerto Rico.\nPhotograph: Stuart Westmorland/Corbis/Getty Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/245765a7399b63502a64442ce8c44ed278a7611b/0_0_6016_4016/master/6016.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=54f7730f4d435bddca95d8293084c7d3", "width": "6016", "height": "4016", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/245765a7399b63502a64442ce8c44ed278a7611b/0_0_6016_4016/master/6016.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4dea8a7845556e0e8026418f62dd3ffe", "description": "The El Yunque national forest.

And they warn the consequences could continue long into the future. \n\u201cIt\u2019s as egregious as I\u2019ve ever seen it, starting from the very top with the president just denying the existence of science, manipulating the system on behalf of special interests,\u201d said the former surgeon general Richard Carmona, who testified to Congress that the George W Bush administration pushed him to weaken or suppress public health findings.\nTrump\u2019s high-profile denial of manmade climate change has occasionally overshadowed the many other ways his agencies are contradicting established research.\nThe administration is really not using science. It is using ideology\nThe agriculture department last month rolled back standards for schools to serve more whole grains, less salt and non-fat flavored milk. Department officials claimed schools struggled with the programs because students wouldn\u2019t eat healthier foods.\nBut research found the food changes didn\u2019t deter students from getting lunch and didn\u2019t cause more plate waste. And the healthier food requirements were projected to be effective: one study estimated they could prevent 1.8 million cases of childhood obesity over a decade.\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s pretty clear that these standards are working and that given more time, they will work better,\u201d said Karen Perry Stillerman, a food policy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists.\nThe Trump administration is also cutting short evidence-based grants for teen pregnancy prevention programs, favoring curriculum focused on abstinence instead, despite a large body of research that shows abstinence-only programs don\u2019t work. A 2007 evaluation of four federal abstinence programs found that they had no impact on sexual activity or rates of unprotected sex among teens.\nSara Flowers, the vice-president of education for Planned Parenthood, said the majority of the programs previously funded demonstrated young people changed their behavior in at least one of five categories: delaying sex, reducing sexual partners, increasing contraceptive use, reducing rates of sexually transmitted infections or reducing rates of pregnancy. \n\u201cThe administration is really not using science. The administration is really using ideology, and those are very different,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cThis [program] has been rigorously tested by experts and vetted and analyzed.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has also erroneously questioned the effectiveness of contraceptives in rules expanding exemptions for employers that don\u2019t want to cover them under insurance plans.\nClimate change and environmental science have also been at the forefront of the battle between science and the Trump administration. Power plant and car standards are being rolled back, as are pesticide restrictions and wildlife protections.\nThe Trump administration has ignored climate scientists\u2019 warnings that rising temperatures and more extreme weather will hurt the US economy and risk lives. The interior department initially sought to remove references to manmade climate change in a report about how sea-level rise might flood national parks.\n\u201cThe notion of there being political appointees who try to impose their political agenda in a way that is contrary to scientific evidence is not a new thing, but it has reached an entirely new level in the Trump administration,\u201d said the Obama science adviser John Holdren.\nOne of the first major decisions by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was to forego a ban on the pesticide chlorpyrifos, which is associated with developmental delays and health problems in children and has sickened farm workers. Judges ordered the EPA to bar the substance, citing the science that shows it is dangerous. The agency is appealing the case.\nAgency officials have also made fundamental changes to how the federal government weighs environmental and health research.\nThe former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt barred scientists working with EPA grants from serving on the science advisory panels that help shape policies. Instead, industries and states now have more sway over those boards.\nThe agency also plans to limit what science it will consider, requiring any studies used in the regulatory process to publish confidential participant data. \nA Democratic staffer for the House science committee, which plans to investigate the administration\u2019s science cuts, said it\u2019s been hard to even track all the agency changes.\nJohn Bachmann, who advised the controversial Reagan-era EPA appointee Anne Gorsuch Burford on air pollution science, said she would listen to briefings on peer-reviewed data, even as she slashed budgets and eased enforcement.\n\u201cThat was the most comparable period,\u201d Bachmann said. \u201cThat was nothing compared to what we\u2019re seeing now.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usdomesticpolicy", "https://www.theguardian.com/food", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Experts say the administration is blatantly dismantling proven programs, and the consequences could be dire", "date_published": {"$date": 1547618412000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1547648499000}, "authors": ["Emily Holden"], "article_section": "US news", "article_tags": ["US politics", "Trump administration", "Science", "US domestic policy", "Food", "US news", "Donald Trump", "Climate change", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/16/trumps-war-on-science-how-the-us-is-putting-politics-above-evidence", "og:description": "Experts say the administration is blatantly dismantling proven programs, and the consequences could be dire", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6c505deb2ca535eea8f68f2d684a06a90f46cb5/0_346_5119_3071/master/5119.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=1ddad6e014097f158c3268211b90a8ce", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Trump's war on science: how the US is putting politics above evidence"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6c505deb2ca535eea8f68f2d684a06a90f46cb5/0_346_5119_3071/master/5119.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=aa6bc11c65cabf2f8eb3deef9edcd00c", "width": "5119", "height": "3071", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6c505deb2ca535eea8f68f2d684a06a90f46cb5/0_346_5119_3071/master/5119.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dd4be13974aa700e328a9110d8946940", "description": "The Trump administration has rolled back standards for schools to serve healthier food.\nPhotograph: Alamy"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bc3df28a53f3245179cc96cf024045747f21a7d/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=535e1c06c62b642d9f4ba5ad81ef07f2", "width": "5616", "height": "3370", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bc3df28a53f3245179cc96cf024045747f21a7d/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5c574da018dbdb71673c0783db61bfa0", "description": "Abstinence programs are being favored over evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention.

It requires huge cuts in red meat-eating in western countries and radical changes across the world.\nThe \u201cplanetary health diet\u201d was created by an international commission seeking to draw up guidelines that provide nutritious food to the world\u2019s fast-growing population. At the same time, the diet addresses the major role of farming \u2013 especially livestock \u2013 in driving climate change, the destruction of wildlife and the pollution of rivers and oceans.\nGlobally, the diet requires red meat and sugar consumption to be cut by half, while vegetables, fruit, pulses and nuts must double. But in specific places the changes are stark. North Americans need to eat 84% less red meat but six times more beans and lentils. For Europeans, eating 77% less red meat and 15 times more nuts and seeds meets the guidelines.\nThe diet is a \u201cwin-win\u201d, according to the scientists, as it would save at least 11 million people a year from deaths caused by unhealthy food, while preventing the collapse of the natural world that humanity depends upon. With 10 billion people expected to live on Earth by 2050, a continuation of today\u2019s unsustainable diets would inevitably mean even greater health problems and severe global warming.\nUnhealthy diets are the leading cause of ill health worldwide, with 800 million people currently hungry, 2 billion malnourished and further 2 billion people overweight or obese. The world\u2019s science academies recently concluded that the food system is broken. Industrial agriculture is also devastating the environment, as forests are razed and billions of cattle emit climate-warming methane.\n\u201cThe world\u2019s diets must change dramatically,\u201d said Walter Willett at Harvard University and one of the leaders of the commission convened by the Lancet medical journal and the Eat Forum NGO. The report, published in the Lancet and being launched to policymakers in 40 cities around the world, also concluded that food waste must be halved to 15%.\n\u201cHumanity now poses a threat to the stability of the planet,\u201d said Prof Johan Rockstr\u00f6m at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, Sweden, another author of the report. \u201c[This requires] nothing less than a new global agricultural revolution.\u201d Farm yields in poorer nations must be improved to create a sustainable, healthy world, the report found.\nThe planetary health diet is largely plant-based and allows an average of 2,500 calories a day. It allows one beef burger and two servings of fish a week, but most protein comes from pulses and nuts. A glass of milk a day, or some cheese or butter, fits within the guidelines, as does an egg or two a week. Half of each plate of food under the diet is vegetables and fruit, and a third is wholegrain cereals.\nWillett said these provide the ingredients for a flexible and varied diet: \u201cWe are not talking about a deprivation diet here; we are talking about a way of eating that can be healthy, flavourful and enjoyable.\n\u201cThe numbers for red meat sound small to a lot of people in the UK or US,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t sound small to the very large part of the world\u2019s population that already consumes about that much or even less. It is very much in line with traditional diets.\u201d\nThe planetary health diet resembles those already known to be healthy, such as the Mediterranean or Okinawa diets, the researchers said.\n\u201cThe planetary health diet is based on really hard epidemiological evidence, where researchers followed large cohorts of people for decades,\u201d said Marco Springmann at Oxford University and part of the commission. \u201cIt so happens that if you put all that evidence together you get a diet that looks similar to some of the healthiest diets that exist in the real world.\u201d\nThe report acknowledges the radical change it advocates and the difficulty of achieving it: \u201cHumanity has never aimed to change the global food system on the scale envisioned. Achieving this goal will require rapid adoption of numerous changes and unprecedented global collaboration and commitment: nothing less than a Great Food Transformation.\u201d\nBut it notes that major global changes have occurred before, such as the Green Revolution that hugely increased food supplies in the 1960s. Moves to tax red meat, prevent the expansion of farmland and protect swathes of ocean must all be considered, the commission said.\nProf Guy Poppy, from the UK\u2019s University of Southampton, and not part of the commission, said: \u201cThis \u2018call to arms\u2019 with its clear solutions is timely, comprehensively researched and deserves immediate attention.\u201d\n\u201cThis analysis is the most advanced ever conducted,\u201d said Prof Alan Dangour, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and also not part of the team. \u201cBut there is a major question about the ability of populations to shift to such dietary recommendations and their wider public acceptability.\u201d\nProf Nigel Scollan, at Queen\u2019s University Belfast and part of the industry-backed Meat Advisory Panel, said: \u201cThis report tells us what we have known for millennia: an omnivorous diet is optimal. In the UK, encouraging people to eat less red meat and dairy will have little impact on the environment and is potentially damaging to people\u2019s health.\u201d\nBut Richard Horton and Tamara Lucas, editors at the Lancet, said in an editorial that global changes as set out by the planetary health diet were essential: \u201cCivilisation is in crisis. We can no longer feed our population a healthy diet while balancing planetary resources. If we can eat in a way that works for our planet as well as our bodies, the natural balance will be restored.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/diets-dieting", "https://www.theguardian.com/society/health", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/farming", "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/meat-industry", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "\u2018Planetary health diet\u2019 would prevent millions of deaths a year and avoid climate change", "date_published": {"$date": 1547681401000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1547681526000}, "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Food", "Diets and dieting", "Health", "Climate change", "Farming", "Environment", "Health & wellbeing", "The meat industry", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Pollution"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/16/new-plant-focused-diet-would-transform-planets-future-say-scientists", "og:description": "\u2018Planetary health diet\u2019 would prevent millions of deaths a year and avoid climate change", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a72d9b1ce8bcc77035bf25077537788882fc979a/0_254_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=a7a40eb2b54fd77d7b1a628e26ddd0e1", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "New plant-focused diet would \u2018transform\u2019 planet\u2019s future, say scientists"}, "headline": "N", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a72d9b1ce8bcc77035bf25077537788882fc979a/0_254_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7c24f004e0804da53eccd7173c7ec0ba", "width": "4032", "height": "2419", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a72d9b1ce8bcc77035bf25077537788882fc979a/0_254_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=07a946096bb1a0b0c74d4af7a41491b0", "description": "The planetary health diet allows an average of 2,500 calories per day.\nPhotograph: Molly Katzen/Eat Forum"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03b41a755f94707baf0b236fd9eb061a6b1c1db2/0_68_5347_3209/master/5347.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=677695b57e01777a0d5e3fe226f966bf", "width": "5347", "height": "3209", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03b41a755f94707baf0b236fd9eb061a6b1c1db2/0_68_5347_3209/master/5347.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5894095a398b23383944a72e9c7a1767", "description": "Red meat and sugar consumption needs to be reduced by half around the world.

But cities are not invulnerable to climatic changes. Indeed, when it comes to heat, they can fare worse. They are also far from homogenous. Counter to the images of \u201cdomed cities\u201d that Buckminster Fuller proposed for Manhattan in the 1960s and that Dubai is touted to be pursuing, cities do not have equally distributed temperatures. Even if they do, the risk those temperatures represent are far from equally perceived or experienced.\nAustralians typically pride themselves on being pretty sanguine about the nation\u2019s extreme weather, at least when it comes to spectacular events like Dorothea Mackellar-esque \u201cflooding rains\u201d or disasters playing out elsewhere on our vast continent. But this week even our assumed role as the world\u2019s most variable climate took a turn for the worse, as Australia hosted the planet\u2019s 15 hottest sites. Many of these extreme temperatures were recorded inland in small settlements. Port Augusta, for example, with 15,000 residents, was number two on the list at 49C. Nonetheless, the heat wave rolled across the continent affecting major urban settlements such as Canberra and Western Sydney.\nJust as it is not merely an issue for \u201cthe inland\u201d, heat is also far from external to cities. Heat is produced unevenly by cities themselves, especially given the way many urban settlements have been developed to date. As detailed in the well-understood \u201curban heat island\u201d effect, dense building materials like concrete take longer to heat up and cool down. Metals reflect heat back into city environments. Buildings block the wind and stop the city from cooling down. Vehicles and other machinery all produce heat, including the air-conditioning that many of us rely on to cool our internal retreats. All this means that in general the outdoor environment of a city is several degrees warmer than the surrounding countryside.\nMetals reflect heat back into city environments. Buildings block the wind and stop the city from cooling down\nAustralia\u2019s cities complicate this classical view of the heat island model to the extent that city centres are close to the coast and heat is ameliorated by the immense heat-absorbing capacities of the ocean and associated breezes. But the size of Australia\u2019s cities and in many places, their lack of greenery produces large contiguous patches of heat-absorbing and -emitting materials. Many of our cities\u2019 heat islands are therefore better termed \u201cheat continents\u201d reflecting their size and inland location.\nFor those who need or want to move around the city on foot or by bike, people are advised to stay in the shade. For this reason, the City of Greater Bendigo is working with RMIT and Spatial Vision to develop an app that enables people to find \u201cshadeways\u201d. But much more could be done. In some places, shady routes simply do not exist, nor do safe pedestrian or cycling routes. Increasingly cities are working to make cities more walkable in recognition of the multiple benefits that come from doing so. But these efforts need to go hand in hand with shading. In hotter cities, walkability and rideability is increasingly not only about access but about the physical qualities of those routes. Are unshaded footpaths and cycling lanes alongside busy roads really walkable or rideable? More broadly, the shading and transpiration of tree canopies can ameliorate the temperature of any space, even indoor spaces that otherwise rely on expensive and maladaptive air-conditioning.\n\u201cLeafy suburbs\u201d have a head start when it comes to seizing the temperature controlling properties of trees. They also tend to be the older, more expensive and better built suburbs and thus inaccessible to the majority of city residents who live in hotter, more air-conditioning-dependent areas and buildings. In growing recognition of trees as an important form of public infrastructure, numerous initiatives are seeking to increase tree cover.\nBut trees take a long time to grow. They are also themselves vulnerable to heat and other climatic conditions, particularly in areas where urban development means the basics of good soil and water are hard to find. Besides tree planting and maintenance, therefore, protecting existing trees is paramount. At present, development for new housing tends to occur on greenfield sites where one of the first steps is to remove existing trees to enable the movement of building equipment and later cars. While some of this tree removal is compensated by later plantings, the net loss, uncertainty and lag time in accessing the ecological services of trees can be immense.\nThe development industry needs to rethink the term \u201cgreenfield\u201d towards \u201ctreefields\u201d. This would be a rediscovery of well-known landscape ecological principles put forward by Ian McHarg and others in the Woodlands development more than 50 years ago. Designing new housing leaving the trees in the ground and the existing ecosystem in place, augmented with new strategically placed plantings, would help future proof new development sites against extreme heat by reducing the amount of heat the site itself produces. Combined with the role of trees in holding carbon and absorbing carbon dioxide and thus reducing the global warming that is worsening heat extremes, protecting existing trees in treefields and further afield is ever-more essential. The \u201cbubble\u201d we need to live in is not a glass air-conditioned dome, it is a tree canopy.\n\u2022 Marco Amati and Lauren Rickards are associate professors at the Centre for Urban Research in the School of Global, Urban and Social Studies at RMIT University, Melbourne", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/cities/urbanisation", "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Leaving trees in the ground and planting new ones could help future proof new development sites against extreme heat", "date_published": {"$date": 1547792647000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1547792650000}, "authors": ["Marco Amati", "Lauren Rickards"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Australia weather", "Urbanisation", "Cities", "Architecture", "Climate change", "Australia news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/18/more-trees-are-the-answer-to-cool-down-our-cities", "og:description": "Leaving trees in the ground and planting new ones could help future proof new development sites against extreme heat", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22acf43ab986579a771357ca0ba3a19bc97bbf06/0_352_5400_3241/master/5400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=4b17de8facc5347e1a2aca325edb81ad", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "More trees are the answer to cool down our cities | Marco Amati and Lauren Rickards"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22acf43ab986579a771357ca0ba3a19bc97bbf06/0_352_5400_3241/master/5400.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cf7151c62d777b7da0645190b8017f55", "width": "5400", "height": "3241", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22acf43ab986579a771357ca0ba3a19bc97bbf06/0_352_5400_3241/master/5400.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=12a1e1217a7ad628ae9a54b4e921af56", "description": "\u2018At present, development for new housing tends to occur on greenfield sites where one of the first steps is to remove existing trees to enable the movement of building equipment and later cars\u2019\nPhotograph: Alamy Stock Photo"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556125355845}, "comments": [{"id": "124902080", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548028935000}, "author": "GangstasParadise", "author_id": "100076479", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": ".This site ....... https://www.google.com/maps/@-27.3436491,153.0427759,494m/data=!3m1!1e3\n........

Plants grasses and herbs and shrubs in the same vicinity, encourage mulch, try to bring the soil back to life, because chances are if you\u2019re planting in urban or former industrial-agricultural areas the soil has been killed off, all lifeforms from invertebrates to fungi are absent; the soil needs to be organic.The more diversity in flora that one can reintroduce \u2013 species wise and variety in age - the wider the range in diversity of fauna; get the bottom-end of the food-chain in place (bugs, skinks, etc) and other species will return.And it just need not be trees that are planted, for in some locations they are ill-suited; bushes and small trees make suitable alternatives.Whilst the article extols the virtues of \u2018native\u2019 trees, this comes with a few conditions dependent upon region. Some native trees constitute weeds when planted in foreign eco-systems; a well-known example being Cootamundra wattle (Acacia baileyana), a native from the Wagga wagga region, but weed from the Blue Mountains to the Otways. The preference therefore is to seek out indigenous plants; ie plants native to your specific bioregion, for not only are they well-suited to specific areas, they are very often extremely cheap or even free from community nurseries.Furthermore, according to the California Air Resources Board, a dollar spent on capturing methane from dumps, improving car gas mileage, or planting trees cuts five times as much greenhouse gas as a dollar spent on renewables. Research from Oxford Uni notes that trees help the atmosphere no matter what, they\u2019re comparatively low-cost, and they carry little additional risk. Each year, the Earth\u2019s trees suck more than a hundred billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Consequently, the more of us the more trees the planets needs. It is time town-planners (sic) rejected the endless urban sprawl based upon the destruction of ecosystems and included compact design with an abundance of flora.So, whilst it is indeed good to plant a tree.

I think it should be recognised as a basic human right and planned for by governments. \nWe have plenty of sensible planners but the property industry has a heap of influence in local, state and federal governments and many ways to get around regulations or destroy them. Their actions go unnoticed because planning is all about compromise in land use, a difficult subject and it is not \"sexy\" politics. However it\u2019s still scandalous.

In general Liberal influenced governments at each level spend more time trying to find ways around regulation than they spend planning.

I have also been experimenting with local area cooling effects of planting belts of different trees. I am in a very hot area in Africa. \nThe most spectacular results I have achieved are with belts of moringa oleifera and azidirachta indica on the windward side of the area of measurement. These trees can reach effective heights in one growing season. I have found that you can produce a very cool semi-temperate growing area on the sheltered side of a 50 metre wide tree belt with strong prevailing drying winds from the North East.\nIt is interesting that very little practical research seems to have been done on tropical wide area cooling effects of tree planting. Some studies such as \u2018Cooling Effects and Humidification Potentials in Relation to Stomatal Features in Some Shade Plants, Abdulrahaman, A. A. et al., International Journal of Applied Science and Technology Vol. 3 No. 8; December 2013\u2019 seem to be raise more questions about variety selection and the wider implications of stomata vapour loss as a mechanism to be relied on for cooling. Abdulrahaman and his colleagues concluded that \u2018Based on the canopy characteristics and stomatal features possessed by each of these shade plants as well as their rate of transpiration, species such as T. catappa, A. indica, A. lebbeck, F. trichopoda, L. cyanenscens, D. oliveri, and A. auriculiformis are the most preferable shade plant.\u2019 It seems to me that one needs to look at the effect of long-term transpiration on the area water balance as well. \nCertainly, I find that tree behaviour in response to arid conditions suggests that one may want to look for trees that actually have mechanisms for collecting and storing excess water that can be made available for transpiration during droughts. That is why I have found moringa\u2019s trunk and root storage mechanism to allow much greater heat exchanging from its multitude of small leaves when exposed to hot winds. Neem trees on the other hand offer denser shade and strong resistance to arid conditions. We can also reduce excessively drying wind speeds with other high plantings such as bambusa gigantica so that heat exchanging trees can have a longer time before they experience too much water loss and lose their ability to transpire effectively. \nIt is certainly an area where individuals can do a lot of useful work to help themselves. \nWe need a great deal more tree planting all over the tropics but individuals can effect great changes in cooling their living conditions by local planting.

Michelle Coles, the owner of the local cinema, took off her shoes at night to test the concrete before letting the dogs out. \u201cPeople tend to stay at home,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t walk around when it\u2019s like this.\u201d\nIt\u2019s easy to see why: in the middle of the day it takes seconds to blister a dog\u2019s paw or child\u2019s foot. In Mildura, in northern Victoria, last week gardeners burned their hands when they picked up their tools, which had been left in the sun at 46C. Fish were dying in the rivers.\nAlmost every day last week a new heat record was broken in Australia. They spread out, unrelenting, across the country, with records broken for all kinds of reasons \u2013 as if the statistics were finding an infinite series of ways to say that it was hot.\nThe community of Noona \u2013 population 14 \u2013 reached the highest minimum ever recorded overnight in Australia \u2013 35.9C was the coldest it got, at 7am on Friday. It was 45C by noon.\nA record fell on Tuesday in Meekatharra in Western Australia \u2013 the highest minimum there ever recorded (33C). Another fell on Wednesday, 2,000 miles away, in Albury, New South Wales \u2013 their hottest day (45.6C).\nIt was 45C or higher for four consecutive days in Broken Hill \u2013 another record \u2013 and more than 40C for the same time period in Canberra, the nation\u2019s capital. Nine records fell across NSW on Wednesday alone. Back in Port Augusta, Tuesday was the highest temperature since records began in 1962.\nIn the Niagara Cafe in Gundagai, whose claim to fame is that the former Australian prime minister John Curtin once popped in during the second world war, Tina Loukissas turned off the deep fryer, then the grill.\n\u201cIt feels like you\u2019ve walked into a sauna,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s getting up to 43C or 44C, because you have all these machines going, the air conditioning isn\u2019t coping very well.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got tables outside that nobody has sat at for the last couple of days \u2026 You\u2019d be crazy to sit outside on a day like today.\u201d\nIn Mildura, Tolga Ozkuzucu, owner of Top Notch Gardens, had the misfortune to be working outdoors.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been like hell,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to try to leave your tools in the shade. If you don\u2019t, it burns your fingers. There\u2019s not much you can do.\n\u201cI try to start as early as I can. I\u2019m not going to risk my body and health. People here are very understanding of that because they know how hot it is \u2026 nobody wants to be outside when it\u2019s 46C.\u201d\nIn South Australia, they declared a \u201ccode red\u201d across Adelaide, the state capital. Homelessness services were working overtime and the Red Cross started calling round a list of 750 people who were deemed especially vulnerable.\nAt the Australian Open in Melbourne, only the sea breeze kept the temperature below 40C. At Adelaide\u2019s Tour Down Under, a bike race, it was 41C.\nOn Monday last week the hottest spot in New South Wales was Menindee, a river town that feeds the country\u2019s largest water system, the Murray-Darling basin. It was 45C. It climbed to 47C on Wednesday, and by Thursday the fish were gasping.\nAustralia\u2019s native Murray cod can live for decades under normal conditions, growing all the while. The oldest are a metre long, with heavy white bellies that have to be held with both hands. Last week, hundreds died, choked of oxygen due to an algal bloom that fed and grew in the heat, and collapsed when temperatures dipped.\nBlue-green algae flourishes in hot, slow-moving water. Then, when temperatures inevitably drop, the algae dies and becomes a food source for bacteria, who multiply and starve the river of oxygen. The fish rise to the surface.\nThe mass fish death has reignited a debate over water management in the region, where cotton farmers upstream have been accused of taking more water than they should.\nThe heat is not the root cause, the locals stress. But the five punishing days settling over the river have not made it better. Last Thursday the cod were up near the surface and struggling. On Friday, it was 45C again. In Menindee, the locals believe the fish kill will happen again, with temperatures in the 40s expected to continue into this week. The water will be running hot.\nBut away from the Darling, Michelle Coles from Port Augusta says she is used to the heat.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was that hot yesterday, if you want an honest answer,\u201d she said last Wednesday, the day after the temperature hit 48.9C.\n\u201cYesterday at the cinema, it was very quiet. People tend to stay home. We\u2019re quite used to it. Once it\u2019s over 40, it\u2019s hot.\n\u201cWe\u2019re conditioned to it. Honestly, I\u2019d much rather be in 48C heat in Port Augusta than in the city. You\u2019ve got so much concrete and it\u2019s closed in, but here it\u2019s quite open.\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t stand out in the sun though.

That word \u201cunprecedented\u201d is coming to define our time. Most of us were short-changed by educations that ignored ecology. We need clear explanations of climate change, what it means and how to cope with it.\nTim Flannery, an Australian mammalogist, is a supple writer with a wide-ranging and questioning mind. His 2005 The Weather-Makers gave lucid and easily understandable explanations of climate change, both a history and a look into what might come next. It is still a basic starting point.\nClimate scientist Michael Mann and Washington Post cartoonist Tom Toles collaborated on The Madhouse Effect. It is drawn straight from the frontline of the climate wars. In trenchant sentences the authors skate out, hockey sticks swinging, and scythe the legs from under the cabal of vested interests, venal payola scientists and shadowy political \u00e9minences grises. They name names and present a player list as well as the irrefutable tough news. \nThe Water Will Come by Jeff Goodell is especially good at showing the daunting complexity of solutions to on-the-ground problems in places such as Miami Beach, Alaska, New York, Venice and remote islands whose residents have nowhere to go. Here are real-world headaches of flood insurance, transportation, nuclear reactors on eroding shorelines, the tendency to rebuild rather than rethink following disasters.\nAmitav Ghosh\u2019s The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable is literate and probing. He presents a critical discussion of the Paris Agreement vis-a-vis Pope Francis\u2019s Laudato Si\u2019. As for the \u201cunthinkable\u201d in his book\u2019s title, it is left to the reader to decide which of several dreadful outcomes he means. I concluded one was truly unthinkable.\nCharles Wohlforth\u2019s The Whale and the Supercomputer: On the Northern Front of Climate Change looks at two different and sporadically intermeshed groups \u2013 science experts from distant universities and local whale-hunter people of the Arctic with millennia of ice experience. The cooperations and rivalries between local residents and academic scientists matters in the way we handle the hellishly complex changes bearing down. Both groups work towards understanding how best to survive.\nPeter Brannen\u2019s The Ends of the World is a witty review of Earth\u2019s previous global species extinctions. His discussions with experts present the evidences in the ancient rocks showing that in the vast life collapses of the geologic past CO2 was a major operative and thus a patterned back-story to our present situation; climate change extinction is new to humans but not to the planet. It puts a lid on the hubristic belief that Earth exists solely for human use.\nPoet-linguist Robert Bringhurst and classicist philosopher Jan Zwicky offer a meditative approach in their Learning to Die: Wisdom in the Age of Climate Crisis. Bringhurst\u2019s essay The Mind of the Wild outlines the liminal relations between the natural world and humans. Here the wild is the bedrock of human ethical and moral values.\nHe suggests that to understand what is happening we should individually \u201cpractise thinking like an ecosystem ... \u201d by \u201cspending a day in the wilds \u2013 alone with reality, keeping quiet and letting things unfold\u201d. This exercise can clarify our thinking and open windows of perception. Zwicky\u2019s essay A Ship from Delos guides us towards ways to live and know the situation of climate change.

Unfortunately; most of these have been ironed out at this stage. So in this way; if you want to know what the worst scenarios are; then you might want to wade through the political stuff in James Hansen's book. However; this is really a confirmation of what Tim Flannery outlines, and its again relating to feedback events - essentially the difference between carbon dioxide and methane. \nSo if you want to get to the more extreme possibilities and think about that, then read James Hansen's book; Curt Stagers book and relate that to Tim Flannery's earlier book and then you have most of the details.\nThe important element which is still not clear is how fast this could happen. I think we should all agree, however, that the risks are very, very big; and considering the world has the money to shift to renewable energy, in many different forms - we should use this money now. Essentially, hydrogen is where we should be spending money right now; we need a wholesale shift from hydrocarbons to hydrogen - and the faster this happens the sooner we stop emissions.\nI suppose the good news is that this is starting to happen.

This alone should be enough to colour his musings for good.\nSo you have someone with no expertise whatsoever in climate science, policy or economics, who refuses to publish their views in scientific journals (as has been basic practice for several centuries), a person whom climate scientists, published literature reviews and independent ethics bodies claim systematically misrepresents climate science, and who is paid $750,000 per year by an unknown list of donors (more than any actual expert in the field) in the context of billions of dollars paid to misrepresent climate science by fossil fuel interests.\nBut, again, it really comes down to this: Lomborg has never studied climate science, policy or economics and he has never published an academic paper on climate science, policy or economics so... why are you bringing up a non-expert?\nLomborg's track record is not consistent with an expert, but is consistent with a fake PR skeptic for hire with no ethics or expertise.", "recommendation_count": "2", "in_reply_to": "124959435", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "his premise can not pass review by a single one of his peers", "effect": "it is not interesting"}]}, {"id": "124965450", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548164391000}, "author": "Brainingtree", "author_id": "15275664", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "thanks rocky.

How much is it worth spending now to avoid the worst effects of climate change in the future. \nIn my opinion it is worth spending a lot to avoid climate change (so, this is called a 'low' discount rate). But the problem today is that the options for just spending money and 'fixing' the problem are very limited; we are still waiting for any country to decarbonise successfully. \nReally; you could say that it is not a straight carbon tax, in my opinion. It is putting in place effective policies; and the main one (which every country will have to do) is to replace methane for heating and industry, with hydrogen. This is going to be a little bit complicated, no matter how we do it; and it will require cooperation between countries to see out successfully, if we are not to try to capitalise on each others efforts.\nBut this is the central component. This is and the use of hydrogen in transport; which is now well on its way with recent announcements from Hyundai, China and Japan. There will be a flood of cheap fuel cell cars and we should not wait until they arrive to build the infrastructure.\nBut I believe the damage will be severe, and we should spend money on what we genuinely need to do now because we may not have the money in the future to make the fundamental changes necessary. I also believe that this is a very good reason for the global economy to remain going strong just so that we we have the money to convert all these industrial plants and so on away from fossil fuels. If we are poor, then we will never be able to do this. So its that balance between maintaining a functional economy just until we have all industry, heating etc decarbonised and switched to hydrogen. \nBoth CCS and electrolysis will be used in order to decarbonise our gas grids; but the low cost of renewable electricity (and electrolysers) and the use of hydrogen in transport (and fuel cells for heating etc) should necessitate generic use of hydrogen only.

This declining insolation produces cooling of the climate at those high northern latitudes and results in incomplete melting of the previous winter's snow and hence gradual build up of snow which eventually results in widespread glaciation at those latitudes burying peatlands, increasing albedo or reflectance, reducing oxidation of those peatlands at the same time as peatlands spread south sequestering more carbon. Reduced albedo and increased Carbon sequestration lead to lower atmospheric CO2, typically a drop from around 280 ppm to around 200 ppm, reducing the Earth's greenhouse effect and causing global cooling.\nThe demise of the last ice age or glacial period which occurred between 19,000 and 9,000 years ago was initiated by a peak in Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation which caused a meltwater pulse into the North Atlantic from the North American and Eurasian continental glacial ice sheets.

As DWilliams notes below, a dearth of policy and political will lies at its core. We could be starting the energy transition now on a myriad fronts if governments (national, state, borough, city) functioned properly and worked in tandem. As it is, much sterling effort to curb climate change is sporadic and small; and many governments are in thrall to fossil fuels. A number of national economies are at least partly defined by them (Canada, US, China, India, Nigeria, the Gulf states, parts of Central Asia, Norway, etc etc). \nAs with CFC eradication, the effort has to be global. But CFCs were deployed mainly in fridges, freezers and air conditioners. By contrast, petroleum products have seeped into society through transport, energy, manufacturing and beyond; and fossil-fuel companies are corrupt and intractable. Big Ag - a vast source of methane emissions through livestock production - is just as corrupt and intractable. Manufacturing of useless consumables, unnecessary shipping, landfill - there are scores of other emissions sources that will not halt because of a kind of fatal apathy: this is the way it's all set up now, they'll lose money, and all the rest of the business-as-usual litany.\nAll of that makes the transition to renewables - including, as Nicholas Stern has pointed out, hundreds of thousands of new jobs in innovation and industry - much more difficult than it should be. Governmental and industrial unwillingness and corruption also mean that societies don't have the subsidies they need to afford installing top-notch solar panels, re-engineering their homes for energy efficiency, or make other changes necessary to radically whittle emissions down. \nDuring WWII, people made the changes necessary (blackout windows, backyard shelters, stockpiling) to survive, and the government conducted a vast public-information campaign to ensure it.

The atom bombs are piling up in the factories, the police are prowling through the cities, the lies are streaming from the loudspeakers, but the earth is still going round the sun, and neither the dictators nor the bureaucrats, deeply as they disapprove of the process, are able to prevent it.\u201d\nBut, of course, now they have.\nToday spring\u2019s no longer spring \u2013 at least not in the old way.\nWith climate change wrecking the seasonal rhythms, scientists find plants emerging from the soil earlier than ever before. Almost everywhere, the ancient patterns have gone awry: last November, for instance, summer temperatures killed a third \u2013 yes, a third! \u2013 of Australia\u2019s remaining spectacled flying foxes.\nThe atom bombs, the police, the dictators and the bureaucrats remain with us and, God knows, so do the lies streaming from the loudspeakers. But, as the sociologist John Bellamy Foster noted back in 2002, Orwell\u2019s beloved toads are now vanishingly rare, with some 200 different species of amphibians driven to extinction in the last few decades.\nSome Thoughts on the Common Toad appeared in the socialist newspaper Tribune in 1946 just as the planet entered what environmentalists call \u201cThe Great Acceleration\u201d: the period in which the human boot, weighing heavily since the industrial revolution, began to stamp on the face of nature.\nThroughout the post-war boom, the tremendous expansion of the global economy drew more and more of the world into the circuit of capital. Ocean acidification, biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions: all of these, and other indicators, shot violently upward from the late 1940s on.\nThe periodisation highlights a fundamental problem in the fight against climate change today.\nWe know now that scientists understood all the key principles of global warming decades ago. Furthermore, as Nathaniel Rich notes, back in the 1980s a real response seemed eminently feasible as \u201cmany prominent Republicans joined Democrats in judging the climate problem to be a rare political winner: non-partisan and of the highest possible stakes\u201d.\nBut the early consensus for climate action coincided with what Naomi Klein dubs \u201cthe absolute zenith of the neoliberal crusade\u201d. As a result, the leaders who committed to fighting warming also ruled out any response to emissions incompatible with their free market dogma.\nThus, in the negotiations that led to the Kyoto Protocol, the US, with the backing of companies like Enron, insisted that international efforts for climate change mitigation rely on business-friendly, market-based mechanisms such as cap and trade schemes. Even though Washington eventually refused to ratify Kyoto, the methodology championed by it (and institutions like the World Bank) became, by the early 2000s, an unassailable political orthodoxy.\nAgain, the notion that the market offered the best (or indeed the only) mechanism for fighting climate change was always pure ideology. For instance governments can shut down coal-fuelled power stations whenever they like \u2013 they don\u2019t need price signals to pass legislation. In the real world, as researcher Jesse Jenkins explained to the New York Times \u201cpolicies other than carbon pricing have driven the majority of emissions reductions to date\u201d.\nThe ideologically-determined attempts to generate environmental outcomes through market action thus resembled huge Rube Goldberg machines, dependent on ultra-convoluted systems for results that can also be produced by non-market means.\nBut those fossil fuel corporations who supported (and sometimes led) the early campaigns for emissions trading systems saw the redundant complexity of market environmentalism as a feature, not a bug. Companies like BP and Shell understood \u2013 better than many environmentalists \u2013 that, in practice, a trading system could amount to a massive subsidy for big polluters since they could profit hugely by \u201cselling\u201d emissions they didn\u2019t actually require.\nFurthermore, because a trade in carbon allowed the purchase of credits associated with carbon offsets (usually in the developing world), tremendous opportunities opened up for creative (and sometimes blatantly dishonest) accounting. An EU study from 2017 found that a full 85% of offset projects actually failed to reduce emissions at all.\nMany progressives reluctantly embraced free market environmentalism, judging any action to be better than none \u2013 particularly as overt climate change denialism grew.\nBut that missed something else that the corporates grasped: namely, that the \u201cput a price on carbon\u201d slogan accepted, by definition, the commodification of the environment.\nThat was, after all, the goal of pricing: transforming nature, in all its complexity and diversity, into an asset legible within a corporate ledger.\nFixing a market value on carbon was never supposed to halt the economic activity underpinning the Great Acceleration. On the contrary, it was intended to speed it up. Even if trading schemes do cut greenhouse gases (which, by and large, they don\u2019t), they\u2019re designed, as pro-business measures, not to limit industrial expansion but to foster it. They\u2019re meant explicitly to encourage more economic growth \u2013 and that\u2019s something that\u2019s no longer compatible with the preservation of nature.\nAs Foster points out, a continuous 3% average annual rate of growth means that world industry doubles every twenty-five years, grows by a factor of sixteen every century, and 4,000 times every three centuries. Given the current state of the planet, how would that not bring utter ruination? The World Wildlife Fund says that populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians have declined by 60% since 1970. What will be left if we continue economic metastasisation for another half century?\nIn political terms, the embrace by progressives of mitigation schemes so closely associated with big business has proved utterly disastrous. Over the last decades, an \u201cenvironmentalism\u201d that rewarded rapacious corporations seemed to many ordinary people less a strategy for preserving the planet they depended upon and more a rhetorical bludgeon wielded by an out-of-touch political class.\nTake the experience in France, where President Emmanuel Macron, pledging to Make the Planet Great Again, introduced another neoliberal nostrum \u2013 a carbon tax.\nA recent study revealed that carbon taxes don\u2019t make a meaningful difference to the climate because governments invariably set them at too low a rate. Why? Well, carbon taxes are innately regressive \u2013 they pass the cost of reform onto the consumers who can least afford it \u2013 and thus are rarely popular.\nIn France Macron implemented his levy on fuel as part of a broader austerity package \u2013 and spurred the Yellow Vest revolt, a rebellion led by workers living outside the metropolitan centres, and with no choice but to use cars.\nIn other words, in the name of environmentalism, Macron managed to alienate France\u2019s poorest \u2013 the very people who will suffer most in a warming future and so should have been a key constituency for change.\nThat\u2019s why Thoughts on the Common Toad repays re-reading.\nIn his essay, Orwell takes for granted an affinity between everyday nature and working class people, who can, he suggests, find an alternative to oppression and exploitation in the environment around them.\n\u201cEven in the most sordid street the coming of spring will register itself by some sign or other, if it is only a brighter blue between the chimney pots or the vivid green of an elder sprouting on a blitzed site. Indeed it is remarkable how Nature goes on existing unofficially, as it were, in the very heart of London.\u201d\nIn other words, Orwell celebrates an uncommodified environment, explicitly because it doesn\u2019t obey the rules of the market.\n\u201c[T]he pleasures of spring are available to everybody, and cost nothing,\u201d he explains, before exulting at the thought of birds, in the midst of bourgeois Britain, flagrantly avoiding rent.\nThe Great Deceleration we require today means deploying our scientific and technical knowledge to undo the damage we\u2019ve wreaked. It means embracing economic planning, so that we use scarce resources for human need rather than corporate profit; it means confronting the military-industrial complex and abandoning the fossil economy; it means involving ordinary people in the decisions that shape their lives.\nIt means, in other words, constructing a non-market society, as scary as that idea will seem to some\nIn 1946 Orwell, a lifelong socialist, defended an appreciation of nature as something that made \u201ca peaceful and decent future a little more probable\u201d. The joy that he took in toads and kestrels and other creatures that evaded the market\u2019s invisible hand hinted at an older kind of society \u2013 and potentially, a newer one.\nThe dictators and bureaucrats might be ruining spring, as they force every living organism to bear the consequences for their profits. But for most of human history we did not live under generalised commodity production, an economic order that\u2019s remarkably recent. And if the past was different, the future can be, too.\nAs we struggle to preserve our only planet, that insight matters more than ever.\n\u2022 Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/books/georgeorwell", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Environmentalists miss what corporates grasp: \u2018put a price on carbon\u2019 accepts commodification of the environment", "date_published": {"$date": 1548126552000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548126552000}, "authors": ["Jeff Sparrow"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Environment", "Climate change", "George Orwell"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/22/george-orwell-said-the-worlds-bureaucrats-couldnt-take-spring-from-us-but-they-are", "og:description": "Environmentalists miss what corporates grasp: \u2018put a price on carbon\u2019 accepts commodification of the environment", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cfe29d86c7a5231e352183238a11ede82c7c9e1/0_49_5573_3343/master/5573.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=ae736a0c3a11339b5f4e3fdece020cec", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "George Orwell said the world\u2019s bureaucrats couldn\u2019t take spring from us, but they are | Jeff Sparrow"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cfe29d86c7a5231e352183238a11ede82c7c9e1/0_49_5573_3343/master/5573.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ae775adb2a15c3a365e5b56db982ed42", "width": "5573", "height": "3343", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cfe29d86c7a5231e352183238a11ede82c7c9e1/0_49_5573_3343/master/5573.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=45c49f68153593c05bcc69a7c08fc4f7", "description": "For most of human history, we did not live under generalised commodity production, an economic order that\u2019s remarkably recent.

Total heartfelt agreement. The momentum of \"the system\" probably will not be stopped, since we're already half-way down the cliff, telling ourselves the vertigo is just performance anxiety over [insert anxiety here].\nSo I don't think change can happen at the speed of light, only communication. After that, at least we've informed ourselves a) What the real situation is and why, and b) What are our collective options? \nMost people think they understand the basics of Capitalism, Socialism and Communism, and that's all there is. While perhaps we will choose between variants of these \"known\" economic configurations, we would be shortchanging ourselves by not investigating a 4th way.\nIt was developed as a \"Middle Path\" between Capitalism(Full private ownership of value-creation) and textbook Socialism(Full public ownership of value-creation). Called \"Economic Democracy\", it has been hailed as the ultimate reconciliation between individualism, collectivism, and environmentalism by no less than Albert Einstein, Winston Churchill, Leo Tolstoy, and Aldous Huxley.\nIt is described in a free online book, Henry Georges Progress and Poverty, which built upon Adam Smiths 1776 Wealth of Nations to try to explain the failures of Classical Economics which Smith had so lamented: Industrial and Commercial recession, and the problem of persistent poverty amidst almost unimaginable technical progress. The introduction could have been written in 2019:\nBQSTART\nYet we must now face facts we cannot mistake. All over the world, we hear complaints of industrial depression: labor condemned to involuntary idleness; capital going to waste; fear and hardship haunting workers. All this dull, deadening pain, this keen, maddening anguish, is summed up in the familiar phrase \"hard times.\" ~ Henry George, San Francisco 1879\nBQEND\nIn a nutshell, by scrambling the definitions of Land(aka nature), Wealth(what you want/need) and Money(sharing/trading mechanism) by magically pronouncing them all to be interchangeable forms of Capital(wealth reserved to make more wealth), the linkage between the Earth and real value(usable wealth) is lost.\nCapitalism says Land equals Wealth equalsMoney equals Capital, which means pretty much whatever whoever controls the Myrmidons of the rent-takers wants it to mean.\nThat is of course, until production cannot underwrite the enormous rents, brutally extracted at whatever the market will bear. Then the economy crashes, and the monopoly game starts again on a smaller board.\nEconomic Democracy rights this obfuscation, by assigning the correct relationship as:Land causes Wealth causes Money with _repeated_ application of Labor, true Capital and Trade.\nNominal owners of natural opportunities should pay for civilization, not those who do the work of building and maintaining it. Economic Democracy suggests a simple market-based mechanism to get the most out of the least land, while the benefits of land ownership accrue to everyone, not just inheritors. Everyone has incentive to make sure land doesn't degrade, and the power to enforce those desires.\nIf you're interested in further investigation, especially in why no one seems to know about this, or pretends they do and insists it is old hat even though they can't explain why, Here are a few rabbit holes I found fascinating. I've also written a lot in these comments if you have absolutely nothing else better to do.

A few walked on the floor around my legs. Some sat on the tables behind me.

We can save a few whales or dolphins or turtles. We can do our best to switch to solar power on our homes. We can have our websites or go out onto the streets with our voices and our placards. We can sing songs and make movies and documentaries about our sleepwalk into what has become our blindingly obvious destruction and degradation of our own planetary home and all life upon it - including ourselves.  We can write books or articles or write comments like this one here on the Guardian. We can elect new governments or political parties. We can pray to our Gods or our spiritual \"whatevers\" and hope they'll deliver us some kind of \"saviour\" or planetary \"rescue\".We can get emotional over it all as we watch it happening here and now, in real time, in OUR time.  We can get angry, frustrated, sad, grief-sticken, broken-hearted, incredulous, disbelieving. We can get very DEFIANT. However, our defiance is akin to watching a giant tsunami rolling towards us from the ocean. We can feel all these emotions and defiance - but - there's really nothing we can do to stop the tsunami.

The only ones who CAN actually be the \"saviours\" and the \"rescuers\".\nTragically and blindly, all they are willing to give someone like Sir David Attenborough or someone like me is \"polite applause\".And \"polite applause\" is NOT going to save our Planet Earth - or ourselves....", "recommendation_count": "6", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "you are the only ones who are really in the positions of power to take the responsibility and the control", "effect": "you are the ones with the responsibility and the control"}]}, {"id": "124984000", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548197741000}, "author": "Geoff Langdale", "author_id": "15451637", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Well, yes.

The latest forecast is for a high of 44C in Melbourne, 39C in Canberra and 38C in Penrith in western Sydney (the forecast for Sydney is for a high of 29C). Hobart is expected to reach a high of 37C, Brisbane 32C and Darwin 32C.\nSA\u2019s Port Augusta, where it hit a maximum of 49.5C earlier today, will still be very hot \u2013 37C.\nMenindee, the site of recent fish kills in western New South Wales, is predicted to reach 48C on Friday.\nWe will bring you the latest on the Tasmanian bushfires and the ongoing heatwave tomorrow.\nThe heatwave has been hard on animals and humans alike. This image was sent to us by reader Andrew Correll.\nThe ABC is reporting South Australia\u2019s emergency power generators have been switched on for the first time amid the ongoing heatwave.\nIt reports: \u201cTemporary diesel power generators owned by the South Australian government have been switched on for the first time, as the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) deals with record-breaking heat conditions across SA and Victoria.\n\u201cThe state government said AEMO ordered the generators to deal with a supply shortfall in Victoria.\u201d\nAnd here\u2019s how far the heat will stretch tonight. There\u2019s still a lot of 40C spots, as of right now, all across the country. \nAs was expected the extreme heat has shifted towards the southeast. The current temperatures again show the vast extent of this heat extending across the country, with large areas above 40 degrees. Take care heading home tonight. #heatwave #scorcher https://t.co/TmC85ZM3UL pic.twitter.com/WoZk7IU1yu\nI\u2019m now remembering some ominous words from the mayor of Port Augusta, Brett Benbow, who we spoke to earlier. \u201c[The heat] won\u2019t peak until about 7.30 tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cThat heat won\u2019t just disappear, it takes hours.\u201d\nFor context, the highest temperature ever recorded in Australia is 50.7C, at Oodnadatta airport in South Australia, on 2 January 1960.\nAt 49.5C, Port Augusta is now equal to the highest ever Queensland temperature, recorded on Christmas Eve 1972 at Birdsville police station, and only 0.2C below the highest NSW temperature \u2013 from 10 January 1939 at Menindee post office.\nPort Augusta has already beaten the highest temperatures in Victoria, the Northern Territory and Tasmania.\nWe\u2019ve already watched Port Augusta \u2013 the hottest place in Australia today \u2013 break its all-time heat record with 49.1C earlier in the day. The previous record was set just 10 days ago (48.9C). \nNow it\u2019s crept up again. Port Augusta has hit 49.5C, as of 4.22pm. \nHello everyone, Naaman Zhou here, taking over from my colleague Luke. \nSome further clarification has come in on Adelaide\u2019s record-breaking heat. It\u2019s even hotter than you thought. \nThat 46.6C figure comes from the bureau\u2019s official temperature gauge for the city, which is at West Terrace. Other parts of Adelaide, by the bureau\u2019s own calculations, are in fact soaring up past that \u2013 but can\u2019t be included as the maximum for Adelaide. \nKent Town, for example, has officially hit 47.4C today. \nWhile the West Terrace observation is the \u201cofficial\u201d Adelaide temperature, look at the reading in Kent Town \ud83d\udc41 \ud83d\udc41 pic.twitter.com/flRK7bkIXc\nThe mercury has continued to rise in Adelaide, which can now lay claim to being the hottest capital in Australia \u2013 at least for today. \nIts peak temperature on Thursday of 46.6 has eclipsed the record held by Melbourne, which reached 46.4C. \n#Adelaide is now the hottest capital in Australia, having just reached 46.6C at 3:35pm, beating the previous record in #Melbourne of 46.4 @BOM_Vic More records: Whyalla 48.5 (prev. record 48.0), Leigh Creek 46.9 (prev. 46.3), and Port Augusta 49.1 (prev. 48.9) #heatwave\nA reminder that Melbourne is expected to drop to an \u201coppressive\u201d 29C tonight. The overnight record is 30.6C.\nThe bureau has also revised its forecast up to 44C for tomorrow. As it stands, today\u2019s forecast has also been blown out of the water. The top temperature in central Melbourne was 40.4C at 4pm, according to the bureau. It was only expected to reach 36C. \nAn oppressive night ahead for #Melbourne. \ud83e\udd75 pic.twitter.com/JLnF0kcx4I\nI would not recommend this. \nHottest day in Adelaide. I left meat in my car. After 2 hours, the meat is ready to eat. #AdelaideHeatwave #AdelaideWeather #adelaide pic.twitter.com/wYFRfhqzUs\nAll eyes have been on whether Port Augusta, the hottest place in Australia, can break its own record of 48.9C that was set on 15 January. \nIt appears to have done so. The Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s observations data says the town hit a peak temperature of 49.1C at 3.15pm. \nCrews battling scores of fires across Tasmania will be without water-bombing aircraft on one of the highest-risk days on record and major national parks will be closed as a precaution.\nFifty fires are burning across the state on Thursday. Two-thirds of them are considered uncontained, and authorities are bracing for worsening conditions.\n\u201cOn a whole, across the whole part of the state, I haven\u2019t seen conditions at this level,\u201d the Tasmania Fire Service\u2019s regional chief, Jeff Harper, said.\nThe conditions are set to peak from 5am on Friday, with hours of dry air, temperatures reaching into the high 30s, and 40km/h winds gusting up to 90km/h.\n\u201cThe weather tomorrow may see that our aerial assets that have been so vital to us over the past week or so not able to fly,\u201d Harper said. \u201cThe wind conditions are so turbulent that rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft, it\u2019s not safe for them to fly under those conditions.\u201d\nGround crews will be stepped up to try to cover the loss of aircraft, but Harper said human safety and property defence efforts would be prioritised.\nTwo fires have could threaten communities. One at central Great Pine Tier could bear down on the township of Shannon, and the other the Gell river fire southwest of Hobart which has been burning since December 28.\nResidents are being told of the threat and efforts are being made to clear fuel from around the communities. In some cases there is 40 tonnes of fuel each hectare.\nOne house has been lost near central Miena, and residents remain on alert at Barren Tier, Tods Corner, Penstock Lagoon, Liawenee and Shannon.\nA statewide fire ban is in place until Monday.\nThe government will close some of the state\u2019s major national parks. The road to the pinnacle of Mount Wellington, overlooking Hobart, will be closed from Thursday night.\nOther popular sites including Mount Field national park near Hobart, and Hastings Caves, south of the capital, will be closed.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s priority is community and visitor safety,\u201d the premier, Will Hodgman, said.\nThey have closed the roof at the tennis. And for good reason. At Rod Laver arena, the on-court temperature is 39C. \nAfter winning through to the Australian Open final, Petra Kvitova said: \u201cI was happier than the fans that the roof closed.\u201d Understandable. \nSo I made it to the Thebarton Ice Arena. pic.twitter.com/YNFIv3ZwVb\nMarko Jovanovic-Jozic, 18, brought his cousin Mary to beat the heat.\n\u201cMy cousin came from Germany for the warm weather,\u201d Marko said. \u201cShe came from -38 degree weather and the experience here has gotten a bit much. I told her if you want to cool off, the best place is the ice arena.\u201d\nThat may be true, but even the chillers at the Thebarton Ice Arena in Adelaide\u2019s west have been struggling in the heat, and the industrial ice is wet. Still, more than 350 people have come through its doors.\nMarko, 18, and his cousin Mary say they came to the Thebarton Ice Arena to beat the heat. Four days ago she flew out from Germany where it was -36, for the warm weather of Australia. Today, it got a bit much. #adelaide #heatwave pic.twitter.com/Q5cHlW3xcg\nI don\u2019t believe these temperatures have been confirmed by the Bureau of Meteorology but this gives you a sense of how it is in Australia right now. \nThe hottest places in the world right now: https://t.co/IZVNXXi28R pic.twitter.com/y6D2h1FGEV\nAs South Australia continues to swelter, let\u2019s look ahead briefly to tomorrow when the heat is expected to sweep through to Victoria. \nOn Thursday Melbourne eclipsed its forecast top by two degrees, reaching 38C. Earlier I spoke to Jonathan How, a forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology, who set the scene:\n\u201cVictoria will be the hottest place in Australia tomorrow. Places like the Murray will be getting into 45-46C territory; places like Mildura, Swan Hill, Echuca are all going to be 46C. Some of those places will break January records.\n\u201cMelbourne is going for a top of 43C but it could get as hot as 44C in some of the suburbs.\n\u201cIt all depends on the timing of the change coming through. If the change comes through a little bit later it might be higher than 43C. If it comes through earlier it might not get as hot.\u201d\nHow also noted that Melbourne would drop only to a \u201chumid\u201d 29C overnight. \nHere our full report on the likely culling of dozens of animals in central Australia. \nYes please. \nElite marketing by Royal Park Foodland \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc #adelaideheatwave pic.twitter.com/IMMLZdywLq", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/south-australia", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/extreme-weather", "https://www.theguardian.com/weather/victoria", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tasmania", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bushfires"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Adelaide broke the all-time weather record, while Victoria and NSW also suffered under extreme heat", "date_published": {"$date": 1548319821000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548378161000}, "authors": ["Luke Henriques-Gomes", "Naaman Zhou", "Royce Kurmelovs", "Lisa Cox"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Australia weather", "South Australia", "Australia news", "Extreme weather", "Victoria", "New South Wales", "Tasmania", "Bushfires", "Climate change", "Drought"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/jan/24/australia-extreme-heatwave-south-australia-45c-tasmania-bushfires-victoria-temperature-nsw-weather-forecast-live-news-updates", "og:description": "Adelaide broke the all-time weather record, while Victoria and NSW also suffered under extreme heat", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd28cb8986c91c024887c15fe0e07c350cfc15ed/0_245_1265_759/master/1265.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&s=bca670cdace244ebc11460722b718776", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "South Australia breaks temperature records as Port Augusta hits 49.5C \u2013 as it happened"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556125445773}, "comments": [{"id": "125032542", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548320398000}, "author": "Cato321", "author_id": "11915672", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Thanks, I'd wondered at why they weren't citing the 47.7 reached at Kent Town.

What is more, the facts back him up.\nVictoria's State Electricity Commission (SEC) generated and sold power to Victorian consumers from 1926 to 1998. In every single year it reduced the real price of power to customers. This meant that for ordinary households buying electricity took a smaller part of their earnings in each successive year.\nSince privatisation, however, electricity prices to the consumer have gone up 50 per cent (2010).\nManaging price was undoubtedly the SEC's crowning achievement. \nBut the SEC also trained thousands of apprentices in electricity and other workplace skills. Eventually, many of these highly skilled tradesmen found their way into the wider workforce. In a similar manner, the SEC also trained engineers and other skilled workers, not all of whom chose to remain in the commission's employ. Either way, the community got the benefit of skills-training provided by the SEC.\nThe current privately-owned generating company does none of this. Nor does Stokes HRL which he got for a song after $30million of taxpayers' money was spent on how to try and clean up brown coal at Hazlewood.\nAs to the matter of safety and security, the old non privitised SEC maintained its generating and delivery systems in pristine condition. The same cannot be said for the private operators. For example, Black Saturday bush-fires, some fires were started by poorly maintained power lines.\nBut how could the SEC have run a system cheaper and better than the current private operators, especially when we have been told repeatedly over the last 30 years that governments cannot do these things as well as private enterprise?\nTaken from this article:\nhttp://newsweekly.com.au/article.php?id=4292", "recommendation_count": "10", "in_reply_to": "125031490", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "125031845", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548318786000}, "author": "familygardener2", "author_id": "17730933", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "That's a Pulitzer right there.", "recommendation_count": "3", "in_reply_to": "125031649", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "125032407", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548320078000}, "author": "AwakenstoEmptiness", "author_id": "100031067", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "The thanks goes both ways.", "recommendation_count": "14", "in_reply_to": "125032190", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "125032382", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548320023000}, "author": "TheParlormentOz", "author_id": "101240973", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Stay alert, hydrated, safe, & cool y'all.", "recommendation_count": "8", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "125031296", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548317437000}, "author": "D_K_4_8", "author_id": "14637422", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "It's actually a dark and brutal country song that I'm proud to be a part of.", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "125030166", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "125031294", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548317436000}, "author": "TheParlormentOz", "author_id": "101240973", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Something about a Victoria's Yallourn coal-fired power station having running only 3 of their 4 generators running due to scheduled maintenance, & AEMO now later today back tracking on their original advice asking high energy users to now today to power down.", "recommendation_count": "8", "in_reply_to": "125031148", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "scheduled maintenance", "effect": "running"}]}, {"id": "125031814", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548318721000}, "author": "DeadCross", "author_id": "100369813", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "This comment was removed by a moderator because it didn't abide by our\ncommunity standards.\nReplies may also be deleted.

The only other time the Bulletin has judged the world as being this close to catastrophe was 1953, in the early volatile stages of the cold war.\nThe reasons given by the Bulletin\u2019s panel of experts included the collapse of arms control treaties, and the emphasis in Washington and Moscow on modernising nuclear arsenals rather than dismantling them, and the lack of political will to reverse climate change.\n\u201cWe are like passengers on the Titanic, ignoring the iceberg ahead, enjoying the fine food and music,\u201d said Jerry Brown, the former governor of California, said. Since leaving office this month, Brown has become the Bulletin\u2019s executive chairman, citing the imminent threats to humanity. \u201cIt\u2019s late and it\u2019s getting later. We have to wake people up. And that\u2019s what I intend to do!\u201d\nThe former US defence secretary William Perry said that the summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore last June, succeeded in calming some of the \u201chysteria\u201d in the standoff between the two countries, but had not led to any North Korean moves to dismantle its nuclear arsenals.\nPerry pointed to Trump\u2019s declared intention to suspend compliance with the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty on 2 February, and serve notice of US withdrawal, as a sign of the erosion of contacts between the world\u2019s most heavily armed nuclear weapons powers.\n\u201cWhen you withdraw from treaties you are losing this important vehicle of dialogue,\u201d Perry said. \u201cWe will have only one [arms control] treaty left, the New Start treaty, which could very well go away when it expires in another two years.\u201d\n\u201cMy own judgment is, relative to a year ago, we are slightly worse off,\u201d Perry said.\nRachel Bronson, the Bulletin\u2019s president, said there should be no comfort taken from the fact that the clock did not move forward over the past year.\n\u201cThis new abnormal is a pernicious and dangerous departure from the time when the United States sought a leadership role in designing and supporting global agreements that advanced a safer and healthier planet,\u201d Bronson said. \u201cThe new abnormal describes a moment in which fact is becoming indistinguishable from fiction, undermining our very abilities to develop and apply solutions to the big problems of our time.\u201d\nAs governor of California, Brown introduced emissions controls and other regulations aimed in part at mitigating the impact of Trump\u2019s decision to walk out of the Paris Climate accord, but he said that states and businesses could not combat climate change effectively without support from the White House.\n\u201cI find that the political response is alarming. It\u2019s akin to sleepwalking,\u201d Brown told reporters on Wednesday night. \u201cWe\u2019re headed toward a very bad situation on the climate front and it will drive many more migrants to the border and create more political instability politically. So all the problems we have are going to be made worse and we may have passed a tipping point where we can\u2019t make them better in any reasonable time and so that will undermine the entire basis of democratic governance.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "description": "Warning that \u2018We are like passengers on the Titanic, ignoring the iceberg ahead\u2019 in face of nuclear arms and climate change threats", "date_published": {"$date": 1548350670000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548362400000}, "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "article_section": "World news", "article_tags": ["Nuclear weapons", "Climate change", "World news", "Environment", "Trump administration", "US news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/24/doomsday-clock-2019-two-minutes-midnight-nuclear-war-new-abnormal", "og:description": "Warning that \u2018We are like passengers on the Titanic, ignoring the iceberg ahead\u2019 in face of nuclear arms and climate change threats", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a15aaa9cdf35255c2232fdc17489f7f40626e3f/0_21_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=e13d011233498fd081d5579e16d06eac", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Doomsday clock stays at two minutes to midnight as crisis now 'new abnormal'"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a15aaa9cdf35255c2232fdc17489f7f40626e3f/0_21_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6d177ee921dcec97f54d689b6bd93d1a", "width": "3000", "height": "1800", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a15aaa9cdf35255c2232fdc17489f7f40626e3f/0_21_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=feebb4afeb0211ca4397e8c62c06c958", "description": "The former California governor Jerry Brown, left, and former US secretary of defence William Perry unveil the Doomsday Clock in Washington DC on Thursday.\nPhotograph: Mark Wilson/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07ad8a2c3613145ed8d2a"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/25/cod-stocks-on-course-to-crash-if-ocean-warming-continues", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Fish fingers and cod and chips are under a far greater threat from carbon emissions than previously thought, according to a recent study that has grave implications for food security.\nThe North Atlantic cod stock in the Barents Sea is likely to first rise and then crash, possibly to almost zero before the end of the century if climate change isn\u2019t addressed, says the scientific paper, published by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme.\nThe grim forecast is based on the most comprehensive study to date of the effects of climate change on cod, which \u2013 for the first time \u2013 takes into account ocean acidification as well as warming.\nIt found larvae mortality rates were 75% higher when exposed to the combined pressures of the two factors \u2013 both of which are caused by emissions \u2013 than to heating alone. As a result, fish numbers, catches and revenues will decline faster than previously estimated.\nThe Barents Sea, which is in the Arctic, is a major source of seafood nutrition for northern Europe. Along with Iceland, it is a key source of cod imports into the UK, which has over-fished its own waters. More Atlantic fish are migrating into this region as a result of global warming.\nBut this ocean has the highest level of acidification in the world because cold water absorbs more carbon dioxide, which changes its pH level. It is also the ocean that is experiencing the fastest rates of heating. While the global average is a rise of 1.1C since the start of the industrial revolution, the coastal breeding grounds of the cod in the Barents Sea have experienced a temperature increase of 3.5C.\nUnless the warming trend is controlled, the stocks will see a boom and then a bust.\nA temperature rise of up to 4.5C is beneficial to the cod. By this time, catches are projected to be worth 255 million Norwegian kroner per year (\u00a323m). But after this point, the larvae rapidly start to die off. At 6C of warming (less than 3C for the rest of the world), they completely disappear.\nEven if nations keep to their Paris commitments, which is currently not the case, global temperatures are on course to rise above 3C, which would mean well over 6C for the Barents Sea.\nThe numbers, which were released on the fringes of this week\u2019s Arctic Frontiers conference in Troms\u00f8 this week, may yet prove an under-assessment of the risk because oxygen depletion \u2013 another side-effect of man-made climate change \u2013 is not accounted for.\n\u201cWe are trying to show the magnitude of risk and it looks very significant,\u201d said Martina Stiasny, one of the co-authors. \u201cThis is one of the most important fish stocks in the world. It will be a problem for food security.\u201d\nResponding to the findings, the Norwegian environment minister, Ola Elvestuen, said the study showed the need for urgent cuts in emissions. \u201cThe first task is to stop this happening. This is one more piece of news that shows the need for urgency. We must work to stay within 1.5C. We need to move forward really fast.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oceans", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/fishing-industry", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Barents Sea is key source of UK cod imports and could see temperature rises of over 6C", "date_published": {"$date": 1548427225000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548457017000}, "authors": ["Jonathan Watts"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Oceans", "Fishing industry", "Environment", "Business"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/25/cod-stocks-on-course-to-crash-if-ocean-warming-continues", "og:description": "Barents Sea is key source of UK cod imports and could see temperature rises of over 6C", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9bf335bbe3e05fce6cea55393cdbc1d7a1e6d13/79_241_4766_2859/master/4766.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=17eaf1b7133c33cb220357594ba4b5bf", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Cod stocks on course to crash if ocean warming continues"}, "headline": "d", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9bf335bbe3e05fce6cea55393cdbc1d7a1e6d13/79_241_4766_2859/master/4766.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eda190f40c22a9dd236ff8e337f2b149", "width": "4766", "height": "2859", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9bf335bbe3e05fce6cea55393cdbc1d7a1e6d13/79_241_4766_2859/master/4766.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b98a619ad4a0a1ff0a2117859059aa3e", "description": "British food staples like fish fingers and cod and chips could be threatened if cod stocks in the Barents Sea were to collapse.\nPhotograph: Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07ae0a2c3613145ed8d2e"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/27/tony-abbotts-worst-fear-as-zali-steggall-gets-off-to-flying-start-in-warringah", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "If enthusiasm and grassroots support are the keys to a successful political campaign, Zali Steggall got off to a flying start in her quest to wrest Warringah from former prime minister Tony Abbott and the Liberal party.\nMore than 400 supporters wearing striking turquoise \u201cVote 1 Zali Steggall\u201d T-shirts assembled under a Moreton Bay fig in a park in Balgowlah on Sunday morning as the athlete-turned-barrister launched her campaign as an independent.\n\u201cZali, Zali,\u201d they chanted as kids and dogs milled around the large media pack.\nThe former alpine skiing Olympian  is taking on one of Australia\u2019s toughest politicians who has held the seat of Warringah for 25 years, something she acknowledged in her launch speech.\nBut Steggall is also Abbott\u2019s worst fear: a photogenic woman with a strong public profile and deep roots in the electorate \u2013 she was born and grew up in Manly, went to school at Queenwood in Mosman (she now serves on its board) and lives in Balgowlah in the heart of the electorate.\nAs one attendee put it: \u201cYou needed to have been wheeled in a pram down the Corso to qualify as local \u2013 and she was.\u201d\nSteggall\u2019s father was a solicitor in Manly for 30 years and a member of the Manly rugby club \u2013 a bastion of Liberal party support.\nAnd as Steggall quipped: she drives the bridge (that\u2019s the Spit bridge for non-locals) and knows the traffic problems facing her electorate.\nWith a high profile already established, Steggall\u2019s task now is to define what she stands for and to differentiate herself from Abbott without breaking her own promise of a respectful campaign and new-style politics.\n\u201cI certainly never started a race at the Olympics thinking I had a sure thing won. [Abbott is] a wily and seasoned politician. He\u2019s been there for many years,\u201d she said.\nWarringah has for too long had someone who is set in his ways, unwilling and unable to change\nIs Abbott an embarrassment? \u201cAsk the voters,\u201d Steggall said, as the crowd erupted into shouts of \u201cyes\u201d.\nRather, Steggall pointed out that many constituents see Abbott as out of step with their concerns.\nClimate change policy provides the starkest contrast, and is a potent issue with progressives in this northern beaches and harbourside electorate.\nSteggall said it would be a focus of her campaign. She has enlisted well-known climate change campaigner Tim Flannery as a policy adviser, and he was by her side at Sunday morning\u2019s launch.\n\u201cWe do not want to be remembered as the generation who had all the facts but failed to act. Climate change is not a political football,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWarringah has for too long had someone who is set in his ways, unwilling and unable to change. He does not represent who we are and what we stand for.\u201d\nSteggall also promised to tackle mental health issues, and expressed support for Kerryn Phelps\u2019s campaign to bring children to Australia from Nauru and for the humane treatment of refugees.\nPhelps is already acting as a sounding board, but the other worry for Abbott is the Manly end of his electorate, which has dallied with independents in the past by electing David Barr and Peter McDonald to state parliament.\nThere are still shoals to be negotiated. In this wealthy electorate, Steggall was quick to rule out supporting Labor\u2019s changes to negative gearing or its plans to stop people being able to claim back franking credits in excess of the tax paid by companies.\nSteggall said she would support stability in the superannuation system and would not back changes where people have put in place investment strategies.\nBut further announcements from Liberal and Labor during the election campaign, including possible tax cuts, will call into question where she stands on economic issues.\nSteggall said she will support tax cuts for small and medium businesses, and appeared to rule out a carbon tax, saying the debate had \u201cmoved on\u201d .\nThere will be constant attempts to either paint Steggall as a Labor plant or a tool of the Liberal moderate faction, which in New South Wales is locked in a vicious war for control of the heart and soul of the party.\nHer campaign has signed on Anthony Reed, the former chief of staff to former NSW Labor politician Phil Costa, and she is already being asked about who is funding it.\nThe former Liberal moderate convener Michael Photios and other former Liberal party members were sighted at anti-Abbott and climate change events in the electorate almost a year ago. Alex Turnbull, the son of Abbott\u2019s bitter rival, former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, has also offered support for the Vote Tony Out campaign.\nSteggall said she hoped to attract the support of moderate Liberals \u2013 but it was clear she was talking voters, not apparatchiks.\n\u201cWe have a website \u2013 zalisteggall.com.au; there is a donate button, please click on it,\u201d she said.\n So far Steggall\u2019s campaign has been powered by local groups with a uniting goal of just getting rid of Abbott. Now they have a candidate, the campaign could get more willing.\nAbbott responded to the day\u2019s events on Twitter, going hyper-local: \u201cI\u2019m going to keep pushing for the northern beaches tunnel to beat the traffic jams and for a safe and prosperous Australia as part of a good government,\u201d he tweeted on Sunday.\nThe Australia Day weekend is not one for heavy politics but I\u2019m going to keep pushing for the northern beaches tunnel to beat the traffic jams and for a safe and prosperous Australia as part of a good government.\nLater in the day, asked about Steggall\u2019s attack on his record on climate change, Abbott said he would \u201cnot get into tit-for-tat arguments with any particular candidate\u201d, but argued Australia only contributed 1.3% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\u201cWe could close our economy down tomorrow and it wouldn\u2019t make a scrap of difference,\u201d he said.\n", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tony-abbott", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/australia-economy", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The athlete-turned-lawyer who has deep roots in the electorate is set to zero in on the former PM\u2019s weak spots", "date_published": {"$date": 1548564125000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1549343085000}, "authors": ["Anne Davies"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Australian politics", "Tony Abbott", "Australia news", "Sydney", "New South Wales", "Climate change", "Liberal party", "Australian economy", "Tax", "Labor party", "Zali Steggall"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/27/tony-abbotts-worst-fear-as-zali-steggall-gets-off-to-flying-start-in-warringah", "og:description": "The athlete-turned-lawyer who has deep roots in the electorate is set to zero in on the former PM\u2019s weak spots", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c8ab00295cdda6ad7700ac709045c05a25a7c13/0_119_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=948ae1023e0df59b70144b0746940b91", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Tony Abbott\u2019s worst fear as Zali Steggall gets off to flying start in Warringah"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c8ab00295cdda6ad7700ac709045c05a25a7c13/0_119_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a95900dcc9fd7e642d16937e9200162a", "width": "1125", "height": "675", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c8ab00295cdda6ad7700ac709045c05a25a7c13/0_119_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7225c21cf4c8484e880286db9e3115d9", "description": "Former Olympian Zali Steggall (second from right) with her husband Tim Irving and sons Rex (L) and Remy (R) Cameron at her Warringah campaign launch on Sunday.\nPhotograph: Georgia Platias"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52251a362fedddbe78ee5c117f92620de4e8c334/0_0_1125_828/master/1125.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d7154dfa66c65c611f74221a37659a44", "width": "1125", "height": "828", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52251a362fedddbe78ee5c117f92620de4e8c334/0_0_1125_828/master/1125.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a716c89f9d39aa16367bb5a0f5ab892e", "description": "Zali Steggall talks to volunteers and a local at the launch of her independent candidacy.

Visiting Australia for only the third time since it was custom-built for Greenpeace in 2011, the ship came to explore the wild and untouched waters of the Great Australian Bight, due south of the Nullarbor Plain.\nClockwise from top: Navigating waters around Greenly Island, Maria Martinez, the chief mate of the Rainbow Warrior III, first engineer Erik Mekenkamp enters the water nearby Massillon Island, and scientist Sam Owen completes his monitoring of marine species.\nThe bight is our wild, uncompromising underwater backyard.

BP has since pulled out, as did Chevron, however Norwegian company Equinor (formerly Statoil) plans to be drilling by October this year. Earlier this month, only days after the Rainbow Warrior left Australian waters, NOPSEMA (the regulatory agency for offshore oil drilling) approved an application for seismic surveys off the coast of Kangaroo Island and Eyre peninsula from 1 September for three months.\nSea Lions around Hopkins Island, South Australia. Sea lions use sound for communication, social interaction and navigation. Sound disturbances such as blasts from seismic testing can cause permanent hearing loss, which can have fatal consequences.\nLending its voice to the now-urgent movement to protect the bight, the Rainbow Warrior III came to showcase the unique marine life of this remote ocean pocket, where 85% of the species are not found anywhere else in the world. We joined the diverse crew of 30 as they sailed from Adelaide and Ceduna, exploring the remarkable but little-known Great Southern Reef.\nA school of fish surround filmmaker and scientist Stefan Andrews.\nA turbulent ocean greeted us as we neared Greenly Island. We were 30 kilometres west-south-west of Point Whidbey on Eyre peninsula, South Australia, and an eerie grey cloud clung to the island\u2019s granite peak. As Michaela and the other three divers descended to depths of 30 metres, they found themselves between underwater mountains dressed in kelp that danced with the current. A curious sea lion came to investigate their strange-looking flippers. As they explored the ledges sheltered from the swell surge, an array of sea life was revealed \u2013 fish nurseries, rarely seen sponges, corals and an explosion of colour, shape and life.\nVideographer Stefan Andrew rests after a dive in the waters around Massillon Island, part of the Nuyts archipelago off the coast near Ceduna, in the Great Australian Bight.\nOver the course of a week, dive after dive revealed an abundance of life and plethora of species. Some difficult to identify as these areas have not been well-documented compared with other marine parks in Australia. When the divers surfaced, the questions began. How was the dive? What did you see? Any sharks?\nClockwise from top: Volunteer deckhand and environmental activist Luca Lamont learns the ropes from Manuel Marinelli, the view of the Great Australian Bight from inside the galley, and Lamont.\nSimilarly, when the underwater remote operated vehicle (ROV) trawled the ocean floor, a genuine interest in those seldom-explored deep underwater environments was palpable among those on board.\nAppreciation for this valuable ecosystem permeated the floating micro-community and it was infectious.

"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Oliver Yates, the son of a Liberal politician and longtime party member, wants to take on Josh Frydenberg in a seat once held by Robert Menzies to start a people power campaign not only in Australia, but around the world.\nThe former Macquarie banker, and head of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, who will confirm his intention to run in Kooyong as an independent publicly on Wednesday, says the challenges of climate change are now so serious, so pressing, that citizens need to \u201ctake out\u201d their environment ministers when they occupy the portfolio but fail to protect the environment and the climate.\n\u201cI want, globally, to hold accountable environment ministers who have disregarded their responsibility to the environment,\u201d Yates tells Guardian Australia.\n\u201cI want this to be a worldwide campaign where citizens take out their environment ministers if they do not care for the environment, because clearly they are not doing it anywhere round the world, and citizens are not making any progress in this.\n\u201cWe all tried as business people. We\u2019ve been good, and managed our positions, but this is serious. It\u2019s a really serious issue that needs to be addressed.\u201d\nThe newly minted independent candidate dismisses a rationale that Frydenberg, while federal environment and energy minister, did attempt to land a policy that would have reduced emissions in the electricity sector before it was scuttled by the party conservatives who took out Malcolm Turnbull as Liberal leader.\nFrydenberg, Yates contends, has policy views that are out of step with the majority of Kooyong electors, and \u201chad plenty of opportunity to stand up in relation to the environment when he was minister, or even now, as a more influential person, but he\u2019s failed to discharge his duty in relation to environmental responsibility\u201d.\nHe says the only way the Liberal party will get the message is if sensible independents are prepared to enter the arena. \u201cIt\u2019s an important aspect of our responsibilities as citizens to take this murky field up, and play the game, to try and deliver a better outcome for each other and the globe.\u201d\nAs well as sending a signal that citizens have agency when parliaments fail to provide policy leadership, Yates has bigger ambitions. He thinks the time has come to rethink the mechanics of politics in Australia. He points to other parliaments around the world that are less dominated by a rigid two-party system.\nHe says if he were to win Kooyong at the coming federal election, he would, for example, be open to serving in a newly elected government, or providing policy advice relevant to his professional expertise in finance and climate change policy.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I would able to be bound by caucus or cabinet rules, so it would be quite difficult, however I would openly offer my services. I will do that in any way \u2026 that delivers the best outcome for the taxpayer.\u201d\nYates believes people are sufficiently sick of the status quo to be open to new ways of political representation. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can say the way government has operated, or the way parliament has operated in the past, is the way it is going to be going forward. That\u2019s an assumption.\n\u201cThe hold of the [major] parties when the membership is less than that of the Hawthorn footy club, and the party members don\u2019t get to determine policy, policy is dictated by a central executive of members of parliament \u2013 I don\u2019t think the business model under which the Liberal party currently operates is sustainable.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself, I have a big challenge in this seat, but I think it\u2019s crazy to always think about the world as it has been and you can\u2019t imagine something different.\u201d\nHe says a collective failure of imagination and innovation is now deadweight on the Liberal party, and has led to \u201ccultural failure\u201d.\n\u201cObjecting to everything has left them in a very dark place, psychologically. They won\u2019t look out and embrace change. They resist change. The Liberal party has become a party of resisting change and that\u2019s terribly negative for society \u2013 to have a government resist change. Change is coming in every way, and change creates opportunity.\u201d\nIf Labor wins the coming federal election, and Yates manages to secure a position on the crossbench, he says he\u2019s open to a discussion about negative gearing concessions, but wary about changes to pensions or superannuation.\nOn negative gearing he says: \u201cThe question is: is it right for people to negative gear 100% of their income away and have seven houses? Shouldn\u2019t people always be paying some level of tax as they are receiving some level of services.\n\u201cI think the government or the opposition has the right to suggest reforms, and as independents, we\u2019ll be able to offer alternative views or comments or practical changes, which they may find acceptable.\u201d\nWhile the candidate has big ambitions, Yates faces an uphill battle to blast Frydenberg out of the blue ribbon seat he has held since 2010. The treasurer and deputy Liberal leader tends his local turf assiduously, and won the seat in 2016 with a primary vote of 58%, which was a positive swing of 2% on the previous federal contest.\nIt seems unthinkable that the government would lose Kooyong, long the jewel in the Liberal party crown, and held by three previous party leaders, but last year\u2019s state election delivered a 9% negative swing in the state seat of Hawthorn, with the seat falling ultimately to Labor.\nThe state seat is within the boundaries of Kooyong. \u201cWe saw the turn in Hawthorn and they refuse to listen to that electoral defeat being driven by significant inaction on climate change.\u201d\nYates says state Liberal John Pesutto, who lost Hawthorn last year, had described voters worried about the environment as tribal. \u201cIf he wants to describe people who want to protect the environment for the future as tribal then go ahead, because it is the tribe who will take you on.\u201d\nHe says he will run an open ticket, but expects Labor and the Greens to direct preferences his way. \u201cI\u2019m expecting that sensibly the Greens and Labor would probably understand their probability of winning here is low, and if they\u2019d like to achieve their stated objectives of environmental action then they\u2019d be inclined to support my campaign.\n\u201cI would be hopeful I would receive their preferences. I understand it\u2019s an uphill battle \u2026 but we need to force this government and future governments into taking climate change seriously because they are beholden to inaction.\n\u201cI would like to see Liberals challenged on a seat-by-seat basis until they get the message.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/energy-australia", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/josh-frydenberg", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The longtime Liberal party member wants to take on Josh Frydenberg to start a people power campaign", "date_published": {"$date": 1548766835000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548803274000}, "authors": ["Katharine Murphy"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Australian politics", "Energy", "Coalition", "Liberal party", "Josh Frydenberg", "Australia news", "Melbourne", "Climate change", "Environment", "Business (Australia)"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/30/its-time-to-take-out-environment-ministers-who-fail-on-climate-says-oliver-yates", "og:description": "The longtime Liberal party member wants to take on Josh Frydenberg to start a people power campaign", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d0f849afb48d709eeb30aa7551557b6a2693660/0_232_4700_2821/master/4700.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=09207ed874b2e6aa9aba05fa122dc41e", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "It's time to 'take out' environment ministers who fail on climate, says Oliver Yates"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "O", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d0f849afb48d709eeb30aa7551557b6a2693660/0_232_4700_2821/master/4700.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=24fd1fbd40944ac71da15ca54b5b0ab4", "width": "4700", "height": "2821", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d0f849afb48d709eeb30aa7551557b6a2693660/0_232_4700_2821/master/4700.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1467442dd2a772a9381adbb5419fed5c", "description": "Oliver Yates, the former chief executive of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, is preparing to run as an independent against Josh Frydenberg in the Melbourne seat of Kooyong.\nPhotograph: Thomas S Dalhoff"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556125495481}, "comments": [{"id": "125361653", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548988699000}, "author": "grahameasom1", "author_id": "15915689", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Bit late mate, but I just must say, \"You know me not at all\"!Don't give \"newbies\" a fair go, i.e., \"give them a chance\", because, as history has shown us, that allows entry to all sorts of really bad people, and then we are sometimes powerless to control them.

Yes I see that you are seeing the world through the eyes of an economist. I no doubt, in part, see the world through the eyes of a biologist. As living things we all need to consume. In that respect you are correct. However, it is rampant consumption that is going to damage our planet's environment and lead to the demise of other living species; ultimately including ourselves. Without a radical change in the collective thinking of humans we are on a path to self destruction. Sure we can all say that we need to consume the basics of life but if there are too many of us and we are all saying that that we are entitled war, famine and self destruction will be the outcome. I should also qualify my comment on growth. There is growth in ideas and culture. These are things that you can't physically touch. Ideas and culture do not necessarily stress our planet, yet the have value. The problem with growth comes with things that we can touch. These are things that we usually buy: a new car, washing machine etc. The concept that we can continue with growth as such is a game of intellectual charades. It is an impossibility and every economist should acknowledge this.Having said all this I believe humans can still live good rewarding lives. However, when we purchase something we should make it last. Moreover, anything manufactured should be made to last. How it is possible to get this message through to the major manufacturing corporations I'm not sure.

You can argue that consumerism is taking more than your share, but even this is nebulous. What level of human development would you consider adequate? As to the rest, the short answer is that people directly cause GW. From the food you eat to the clothes you wear to the house you inhabit, they all generate vast amounts of GH gases in their creation and maintenance. There is a vast diffetence in the energy usage between subsistence living and even middling modern living, and I assume you are not pining for plain survival. China's emissions are a case in point, having essentially quadrupled in 25 years (but being, per capita, less that half those of the US). We can argue about how much of this rise has been aimed at improving the quality of life of the population (since China's command economy has pushed for vast amounts of essentially useless infrastructure), but it is safe to safe that a significant portion was necessary. Now project it to the rest of the developing world and you will understand why your complaint about economic models is misplaced. We have an engineering problem that is being solved in spite of politics (the real problem), albeit initially at a pace insufficient to the accommodate the medical improvements that have made our population explode.

We welcome the report, but also say the recommendations need to be acted on urgently.\u201d\nAccording to the Climate Council, transport is Australia\u2019s second-largest contributor to greenhouse gas pollution after electricity, contributing 18% in 2018.\nThis makes electric and other clean-energy transport critical to addressing climate change \u2013 a fact not lost on the Australian public.\nIn polling released Wednesday, the Australia Institute surveyed 1,449 people across the country on specific policies to support the uptake of electric cars.\nWhile most opposed more direct policies such as a ban on the sale of petrol cars after 2030, it found the overwhelming majority were supportive of encouraging their uptake.\nAlmost four in five people said they wanted the government to expand the network of charging stations and to ensure new cars sold in Australia were more fuel efficient \u2013 even if they cost more.\nRoughly three in four said they wanted to see the government add more electric cars to its fleet and ensure new apartment blocks were required to install electric car-charging stations.\nRichie Merzian, director of the Climate and Energy Program at the Australian Institute, said the results showed the public support was there and it was time Canberra stepped up.\n\u201cThe appetite for Australians to pay more for their cars if they believe there are core benefits came through quite strongly,\u201d Merzian said. \u201cThere\u2019s some really strong support for low-hanging policies that the government could take up.\n\u201cAll that\u2019s missing now is federal government support.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/motoring", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/travel-and-transport", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Senate committee urges government to create policies to encourage use or risk missing out on a transport revolution", "date_published": {"$date": 1548829563000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548829947000}, "authors": ["Royce Kurmelovs"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Electric", "hybrid and low-emission cars", "Australia news", "Australian politics", "Motoring", "Environment", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Travel and transport"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/30/australias-paltry-electric-car-uptake-will-cost-health-jobs-and-environment-report", "og:description": "Senate committee urges government to create policies to encourage use or risk missing out on a transport revolution", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30c8985bfcc1362e97a435147256440654f896f1/0_0_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=996423850b5a79edbdb7416ea8526574", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Australia\u2019s paltry electric car uptake will cost health, jobs and environment \u2013 report"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30c8985bfcc1362e97a435147256440654f896f1/0_0_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e0061cdb50c10ed94ce9ff8bda333831", "width": "3500", "height": "2102", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30c8985bfcc1362e97a435147256440654f896f1/0_0_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03162bcc4873c0292a667d9aecd8bb3d", "description": "There are only around 7,300 electric cars on Australian roads, with most people unable to afford current models.\nPhotograph: Jorge Silva/Reuters"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556125498633}, "comments": [{"id": "125386802", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1549053767000}, "author": "LINDAJANICE", "author_id": "3031680", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\"Sweden has opened the world's first electrified road.

The average high temperature in January is -9C, or 15F. In a typical year, the city will experience 109 days of subzero weather.\nBut this week the nickname seems particularly appropriate.\nAt 8am on Wednesday, the temperature in International Falls, at the very northern tip of Minnesota, was -36.4F (-38C). The windchill was -58F (-50C).\nThe National Weather Service warned that it could get even colder here on Wednesday night \u2013 potentially down to -65C (-85F). But in this little city of 6,000 people, people were carrying on as usual, using a few tricks they\u2019ve learned from a lifetime of frigid temperatures.\n\u201cYou gotta have that International Falls shuffle going on,\u201d said Stephanie Heinle, owner of the Coffee Landing Cafe downtown. Heinle demonstrated the manoeuvre by shuffling quickly across the wooden floor of the cafe. It\u2019s a method of walking across ice that minimizes risk, she said.\n\u201cBecause in this weather you can fall and break a hip and if someone doesn\u2019t see you you freeze to death,\u201d Heinle said.\nForecasters are describing the icy influx sweeping the American midwest as the coldest weather in a generation. On Wednesday, Chicago is predicted to see its lowest \u201chigh temperature\u201d \u2013 the warmest point of a given day \u2013 since records began, and Minneapolis could also see historic lows.\nThe cold won\u2019t stop there. It\u2019s expected that 75% of the contiguous US will see sub-zero temperatures over the next week, a result of the polar vortex Arctic air pressure system bursting apart in early January. The wind system normally traps cold air at the North Pole, but its splintering has whipped frigid air far further south than normal.\nFew have experienced the kind of cold currently occurring in International Falls. The temperature in a commercial freezer is -18C (-0.4F). In New York City the all-time coldest temperature was recorded as -26C (-15F), back in 1934. The record low in the United Kingdom is -27.2C (-17F), which has been reached on three occasions, each time in northern Scotland and most recently in the Highland village of Altnaharra, in 1995.\nOn Wednesday the thermometer here never made it past -30C (-22F).\nStill, at midday Coffee Landing was a hive of activity. There was a birthday party going on in the back, with eight people wearing little strap-on hats, and people bundled in and out, barely mentioning the weather.\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried at all,\u201d Heinle said. \u201cBecause I know it\u2019ll go away. I know it\u2019ll warm up.\u201d\nWhen she\u2019s walking around town or running errands, Heinle doesn\u2019t even wear a hat and gloves.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re used to wearing them when it\u2019s only this temperature,\u201d she said \u2013 there was a windchill of -45F at this point \u2013 \u201cThen when you go snowmobiling or something where you really have windchill, you\u2019re going to be really cold. I know it sounds crazy.\u201d\nHeinle offered a personal tip on staying warm: \u201cA little alcohol helps.\u201d\nIt was a bit early to take Heinle\u2019s advice, so I shuffled soberly out into International Falls\u2019 main street.\nInternational Falls is undeniably beautiful, divided from Canada by the picturesque Rainy river. The paper mill, a big local employer that looms over the city, pumps out steam as it turns wood into pulp, sending cascades of mist down the high street. It covers the trees in a crystalized frost, with the fog creating an other-wordly atmosphere.\nBut it is preposterously cold. Within seconds of stepping outside my nostril hairs had frozen. After two minutes my moustache was covered in ice.\nI\u2019d prepared well, I thought. I was wearing two pairs of long-johns, a pair of thick jeans, thick socks, insulated boots, two long-sleeved undershirts, a wool jumper, a fleece, a ski jacket, a balaclava, a \u201cdeep-winter\u201d hat and two pairs of gloves, but still I was surprised to find my teeth literally chattering.\nMy phone quickly stopped working, as did my voice recorder, and my pen. My hat, purchased for cycling in New York winters, started letting in the cold after about two minutes. My ski-gloves, which my dad found in the back of a rental car in 2006, lasted about 30 seconds.\nThe winter has its upsides for the city. Tourists come to hunt and ice fish, and to drive the picturesque seven miles route around the frozen Rainy Lake.\nCar companies, including Kia, Hyundai and Land Rover, come too, testing new vehicles in the frozen conditions, and on Monday more than a hundred endurance athletes traveled to the area for the Arrowhead 135, a 135-mile race across northern Minnesota on cross-country skis, fat-tyre bicycles or just on foot. The winner, Jordan Wakeley, managed to set a new record in the race, on a bike, although around half of the 146 entrants dropped out in the freezing cold.\nIt was a boon for the local taxi company, which worked through the night picking up frozen athletes along the trail.\nBut there is no escaping the fact that it is dangerously cold. In a weather warning issued on Tuesday, the National Weather Service said that the wind chill could cause frostbite on exposed skin in just five minutes.\n\u201cHypothermia can set in quickly, which may lead to death,\u201d the NWS added.\nIn this weather some households keep their water running nonstop, for months at a time, to prevent pipes from freezing and bursting. People leave their cars running while they eat inside bars and restaurants, to prevent doors from freezing shut and engines conking out. Extra time has to be allocated each morning to pull on layers of clothing, extra money spent on arctic-level jackets and boots.\nIt might raise the question as to why people choose to live here.\nFor International Falls\u2019 mayor, Bob Anderson, the answer is easy.\n\u201cI love my city,\u201d Anderson said.\n\u201cYou can go ice-fishing, cross-country skiing. We have a beautiful lake that opens up every May through October, a beautiful river.\n\u201cI just really enjoy the birds, the animals. We have very distinctive seasons, we also enjoy that a great deal.\u201d\nAnderson, 76, was born and raised in International Falls, and has been mayor since 2012. He worked at the paper mill for 51 years before retiring in 2011, and remembers a nine-day stretch in the 1970s when the temperature never rose above -18C (-0.4F), and a record snowfall in 1996.\nWhen the ice descends on the the city it doesn\u2019t thaw for months. But it doesn\u2019t bother Anderson.\n\u201cThe cold is probably akin to the heat in the south. I would not want to be where it\u2019s 110F in the summer time. I know I would melt,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI enjoy the cold. I\u2019m not bothered by it terribly. You take a few more precautions, do a bit more reading in the winter time, and life goes on.\n\u201cAnd for 120, 130, 140 years it\u2019s always been a white Christmas.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-weather", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Residents of International Falls are carrying on as usual, using a few tricks they\u2019ve learned from a lifetime of frigid temperatures", "date_published": {"$date": 1548877000000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548966468000}, "authors": ["Adam Gabbatt"], "article_section": "US news", "article_tags": ["Minnesota", "US weather", "US news", "Climate change"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/30/polar-vortex-what-is-it-like-cold-temperatures-midwest-life", "og:description": "Residents of International Falls are carrying on as usual, using a few tricks they\u2019ve learned from a lifetime of frigid temperatures", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b92538d067d8d74b470e8072b3e39d1a80dd411b/898_0_5313_3188/master/5313.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=963cd0241b8d098ab89b786c95230df8", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Life at -58F: I went inside the frozen heart of America's polar vortex"}, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b92538d067d8d74b470e8072b3e39d1a80dd411b/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bed18c5abf22cd3ca59f1f9950624f78", "width": "6720", "height": "4480", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b92538d067d8d74b470e8072b3e39d1a80dd411b/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ca1e963e88f4ee5f76cea08e1e2dbb7a", "description": "The Viking Bar displays the temp in International Falls, Minnesota, on Wednesday.\nPhotograph: Jenn Ackerman and Tim Gruber/The Guardian"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ccfa48ce98a2de32bdeacbb281d524739ee7a33/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eee5fb725ad476d7e88d534d32b0b6af", "width": "6720", "height": "4480", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ccfa48ce98a2de32bdeacbb281d524739ee7a33/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e96372d2f439ccf55ae5d37941ff36c3", "description": "Icicles form on a building in International Falls, Minnesota.

As expected, the mud contained remnants of photosynthetic algae that lived and died in the area millions of years ago when Antarctica was much warmer.\nBut the mud also contained the bodies of other, more recent creatures. Researchers found eight-legged tardigrades, the speckled shell of a shrimp-like crustacean with legs dangling from it, and a second shell still bristling with delicate hairs. What at first looked like worms in the mud turned out to be the tendrils of a plant or fungus.\nAware that the creatures might have contaminated other equipment, the scientists cleaned their kit and lowered it into the lake once more. When they hoisted it up and analysed the mud a second time, they found more of the same remains.\nIt is not clear how the organisms came to be in the ice-covered lake, but scientists believe that they may have lived in nearby ponds and streams during warm periods when the glaciers retreated either 10,000 or 120,000 years ago.\nOne possibility is that the creatures washed into the lake through rivers under the ice. Alternatively, they may have been carried in after becoming stuck to the underside of an encroaching glacier.\nMartin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College and head of the Lake Ellsworth Consortium, a UK project that aims to explore a subglacial lake under the ice of west Antarctica, said it was \u201ca lovely finding\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cIt hints that life may exist in more complex forms than thought previously underneath the massive ice sheet in Antarctica.\u201d\nSiegert said more work was needed to establish whether the organisms had been flushed into the lake from upstream \u2013 suggesting there was life under the middle of the Antarctic ice sheet \u2013 or from the sea, or by some other route. \u201cEach of these would be intriguing,\u201d he said.\nSandra McInnes, an expert in tardigrades at the British Antarctic Survey, said: \u201cIf they can get DNA out of these remains, that would be fantastic.\u201d\nIf the tardigrade DNA perfectly matches that of species alive today, then scientists will suspect the animal was carried into the lake on contaminated drill equipment.\nBut the DNA may be far older and indicate an ancient relative of a modern species. Genetic analysis might also confirm whether it was a marine or terrestrial creature, McInnes said.\nSo far, nothing has been pulled alive from the Mercer subglacial lake. With so much ice overhead, too little light may reach the water to sustain organisms such as photosynthetic algae.\nBut Byron Adams, a researcher at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, told Nature that he still hoped to find something that had set up home in the lake. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that you could still find things that are alive,\u201d he said.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/animals", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Scientists surprised by haul of crustaceans and tardigrades in undisturbed subglacial lake", "date_published": {"$date": 1547826978000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1547848504000}, "authors": ["Ian Sample"], "article_section": "World news", "article_tags": ["Antarctica", "Science", "World news", "Climate change", "Environment", "Animals"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/18/antarctica-tardigrades-crustaceans-mercer-subglacial-lake", "og:description": "Scientists surprised by haul of crustaceans and tardigrades in undisturbed subglacial lake", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f32a25485fd55e282c6b22d12e28891460b36aba/0_544_4354_2613/master/4354.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=b1f81d94f2d24df508477d8126b9d17e", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Antarctic expedition yields remains of tiny, ancient 'water bears'"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f32a25485fd55e282c6b22d12e28891460b36aba/0_544_4354_2613/master/4354.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ac3e112954d44df8e668fcbdcbd3a769", "width": "4354", "height": "2613", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f32a25485fd55e282c6b22d12e28891460b36aba/0_544_4354_2613/master/4354.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=20ccce909f1c4a66b282231342edb41e", "description": "Tardigrade, a tiny aquatic invertebrate, is also known as a \u2018water bear\u2019.\nPhotograph: Steve Gschmeissner/Getty Images/Science Photo Library"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07a18a2c3613145ed8cde"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/01/time-for-politicians-to-make-stark-choices-over-climate-change", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Politicians must persuade consumers to make dramatic lifestyle changes if devastating climate change and mass extinctions are to be averted, according to the shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis.\nFrom cutting back on red meat to taking fewer flights, the Norwich South MP said the public must face up to \u201creal, stark choices\u201d in the years ahead.\n\u201cIf you want your children and grandchildren to avoid food shortages, to avoid power shortages, to avoid biological degradation, biodiversity loss \u2013 if you actually want a planet that\u2019s inhabitable \u2013 then we need to make some choices together, now, and some of them are about quite dramatic changes to how we live,\u201d Lewis said in an interview with the Guardian.\nHaving returned to Labour\u2019s frontbench a year ago, after resigning in protest when Jeremy Corbyn whipped MPs to support the triggering of article 50, Lewis was given the job of examining how a Labour government could champion sustainable economics. He has repeatedly made it clear he regards the issue as a test of political leadership.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a crunch point now coming for politics. You often hear there\u2019s no leadership in politics \u2013 and this isn\u2019t a leadership pitch, I promise you \u2013 but when you talk about leadership, there\u2019s leadership in different forms,\u201d he said.\nOn red meat, for example, Lewis said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and say, yeah, let\u2019s ban red meat \u2026 but you can show leadership by asking, well actually, is it right that we publicly subsidise an industry that is contributing so much to greenhouse gas emissions, and often is a very unsustainable practice?\u201d\nHe said the government\u2019s role should be to \u201cencourage people and show leadership as to how we\u2019re going to shift people\u2019s eating habits on to a more sustainable footing\u201d.\nOn air travel, he said Labour was starting to come up with options, including a tax \u201cescalator\u201d, which would have the biggest impact on frequent fliers, who tend to be the wealthiest.\nIn a wide-ranging interview, Lewis also mused about everything from the four-day week to universal basic income, and how to ensure the rapid technological innovation of the \u201cfourth industrial revolution\u201d benefits the wider public.\nWhile many such policies are at an early stage of development, Lewis said the next Labour manifesto should be significantly different to the previous one.\n\u201cThe 2017 manifesto gave a lot of people a kind of warm, cuddly glow, and it was a great reset of our values and where we are, but it was a base on which to build,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next manifesto needs to be a radical manifesto, which builds on the reset, and is 21st-century socialism in action. There\u2019s a hunger for that.\u201d\nMcDonnell has asked the former head of the civil service Bob Kerslake to examine how to rework the Treasury green book \u2013 the manual for government spending decisions.\nLewis said he hoped environmental sustainability could be incorporated into Whitehall thinking as part of that review.\n\u201cThe Treasury has been the instigator of selling off the green investment bank, of scuppering [the] Swansea tidal [lagoon power plant], of undermining the plastic tax and electric vehicles \u2013 because it simply sees things in a very short-term, revenue-generating manner,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat we want to do is open out how the Treasury looks at spending and revenue, and looks in a longer term, more holistic and sustainable way \u2013 and that is radical.\u201d\nLewis recently secured \u00a317,500 from individual donors to fund his work on sustainable economics, giving him a measure of independence from the party machine.\nHe argued that developing a more sustainable economic model could allow Britain to take a leadership role in the world after Brexit.\n\u201cLeadership and punching above your weight doesn\u2019t necessarily always have to mean gunboat diplomacy and bombing other countries into the stone age. It can actually mean leading by example, and helping other countries,\u201d he said.\nLewis was widely considered a rising star on the left of the party when he arrived in parliament in 2015, and was catapulted on to the frontbench by Corbyn, as many more experienced MPs refused to serve or were sent packing.\nBut the former army reservist and TV reporter does not fit the mould of a career politician and has repeatedly charged headlong into controversy. In 2016, as shadow defence secretary, he clashed with Corbyn\u2019s close aide Seumas Milne over last-minute changes to a party conference speech.\nIn late 2017, he apologised after video footage emerged of him using the phrase \u201cget on your knees, bitch\u201d at a party conference fringe event, and was then suspended \u2013 and cleared \u2013 over accusations that he groped a party member.\nMost recently, Lewis was criticised after miming putting a gun in his mouth during a debate in the House of Commons as a Conservative MP interrupted his frontbench colleague Anneliese Dodds.\nLewis, who postponed his wedding to defend a wafer-thin majority in the 2017 general election, and recently became a father for the first time, said he found the BBC documentary Blue Planet too unsettling to watch.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t watch BP for a long time, until I started doing this job, because I knew in my heart that Blue Planet, as beautiful as it was, at the end they would always have the human impact, and I struggled to watch it because I felt so powerless,\u201d he said.\nHe said he believed countering the human threats to the environment would have to mean junking \u201cthe obsession with flat-screen TVs and consumption\u201d.\n\u201cOn their deathbed, do people think: \u2018I wish I\u2019d spent more time with my Ferrari\u2019? Or do they say: \u2018I wish I\u2019d spent more time watching my kids grow up, I wish I\u2019d spent more time country walking\u2019?\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the things that matter in life, and how we have an economy that better reflects that,\u201d he said.\nOn Brexit, meanwhile, Lewis stuck rigidly to the party line, dismissing questions about what Labour would put in its manifesto if there were to be a snap general election as \u201chypothetical\u201d.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/politics/economy", "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/food", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "MPs must show leadership on issues such as meat production and air travel, says Clive Lewis", "date_published": {"$date": 1546345603000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1546403615000}, "authors": ["Heather Stewart"], "article_section": "Politics", "article_tags": ["Clive Lewis", "Economic policy", "Labour", "Climate change", "Environment", "Politics", "UK news", "Food"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/01/time-for-politicians-to-make-stark-choices-over-climate-change", "og:description": "MPs must show leadership on issues such as meat production and air travel, says Clive Lewis", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c66118b73b4941052c60408bfb1d8daf506fe86/0_1032_4931_2960/master/4931.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=17e5bd2dd9f1722ddfc99eb7d43d43b9", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Time for politicians to make 'stark choices' over climate change"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c66118b73b4941052c60408bfb1d8daf506fe86/0_1032_4931_2960/master/4931.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4dd9f18849fb7e39c6f210b5219d4869", "width": "4931", "height": "2960", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c66118b73b4941052c60408bfb1d8daf506fe86/0_1032_4931_2960/master/4931.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=32a13cde7cdebbab01d1aaf86529ad39", "description": "Clive Lewis: \u2018If you want your children to avoid food shortages \u2026 we need dramatic changes.\u2019\nPhotograph: Graeme Robertson/Guardian"}}], "comments": [{"id": "124220984", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1546404122000}, "author": "David Heseltine", "author_id": "10900281", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "But the Tories never end up getting the blame for anything.

Nor do I see our present major political parties denouncing consumerism for what it is: a planetary blight. Climate change is being driven by the consumerism that Capitalists and their governments promote. As a consequence of the harm being done to our planetary home in order to feed the demands of consumerism, I foresee a miserable future for our young as they grow up, one of increasing dearth and want, of ever more frequent, violent conflict for possession or control of ever more scarce natural resources, such as arable land, and water. I foresee the pressure on our own western civilisation reaching breaking point, as entire nations land up on our shores, driven here by the advance of desert and drought in their lands. I foresee the cost of energy rising astronomically, and (so that the rich need suffer no hurt via tax increases), fewer and fewer of us will have access to state, or affordable, healthcare, or state funded old age retirements, or indeed, any sort of material security at all.I foresee tens, then hundreds of thousands of workers rendered forever unemployed, as capitalist corporations turn increasingly to automation to cut production overheads. Only the adoption by the government of a universal living income (ULI) can address the consequences of such an inevitable development.

More than half said they were doing what they could to reduce their use of plastic.\nIn Australia, public pressure led many supermarkets this year to announce they were phasing out single-use plastic bags. These include Coles, Woolies and Harris Farm.Just producing plastic uses huge resources \u2013 it takes around 12m barrels of oil to make the 100bn plastic bags used annually in the United States alone.\nThis year Britain\u2019s Iceland supermarket has led the way \u2013 and others are beginning to follow suit. Iceland has pledged to eliminate plastic packaging on its own goods in five years.\nSo what can you do to reduce your own plastic footprint and put pressure on supermarkets and manufacturers to move towards reuseable plastic items and hugely increase the amount of recycled plastic in their products? Here are 10 top tips:\n1. Start at home. Do a plastic audit of your household. Shower bottles, deodorants, washing up liquids, shampoo bottles. Aim to make reductions here by ditching shower gel for soap and the plastic cotton buds for biodegradable ones; buy liquid detergent in recycled plastic bottles and find a refill station to fill them up. Shampoo bars and toilet paper in recycled packaging are also available.\n2. In the US, 1bn plastic toothbrushes are thrown out each year, creating some 50m pounds of waste. Try using bamboo toothbrushes instead which only take about six months to biodegrade back into the soil when you have to replace your brush.\n3. Carry reuseable fabric shopping bags.\n4. Try buying wholesale and putting dried products such as rice, pasta andlentils into glass jars to avoid buying products wrapped in plastic.\n5. Recycle old plastic children\u2019s toys. Search for a toy library in yourarea to borrow from or donate to. And consider charity shops when looking for gifts.\n6. Carry a reuseable coffee cup or flask; 7m plastic-lined coffee cups are thrown away in the UK every day.\n7. Say no to plastic cutlery. Carry a fork with you or use a compostable alternative.\n8. Ditch cling film wrap for your food. It cannot be recycled in most UK collections. Foil is recyclable, so use foil instead or reuseable plastic boxes.\n9. Use an electric razor instead of plastic disposable one.\n10. Write to companies whose packaging is non-recyclable, asking them to consider using less destructive materials. Maybe even think about starting a social media campaign to raise awareness. Strength in numbers!\n\u2022 This article was amended on 3, 4 and 18 January 2019. An earlier version suggested that 12m oil barrels produced 100m plastic bags. That figure is more like 100bn bags. In addition, the estimate of 1bn plastic toothbrushes being thrown out each year relates just to the US, not globally. This has been corrected. It was further amended to remove a reference to a branded product, and to refer to biodegradable cotton buds rather than recyclable ones.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/plastic", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Guardian environment correspondent Sandra Laville explains why we can\u2019t recycle our way out of the plastics problem, and suggests ways to reduce your footprint", "date_published": {"$date": 1546495206000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1547830961000}, "authors": ["Sandra Laville"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Environment", "Plastics", "Climate change", "Membership"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/03/plastics-consumption-reduce-2019-10-easy-ways", "og:description": "Guardian environment correspondent Sandra Laville explains why we can\u2019t recycle our way out of the plastics problem, and suggests ways to reduce your footprint", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5456eed8b041786049ae81998bd6db02b9217509/0_244_4764_2859/master/4764.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=bee73731532777da50f5a1c60be9e876", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "'Ditch cling film and switch to soap': 10 easy ways to reduce your plastics use in 2019"}, "headline": "0", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5456eed8b041786049ae81998bd6db02b9217509/0_244_4764_2859/master/4764.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cd54b02fe9ea8964aa75d42e117293ff", "width": "4764", "height": "2859", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5456eed8b041786049ae81998bd6db02b9217509/0_244_4764_2859/master/4764.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd43d05b4e3472aeea058ad66bc3fab5", "description": "A plastic bottle littering a beach in Melbourne, Australia.

Without research and development, the coffee sector will need up to 180m more bags of coffee in 2050 than we are likely to have.\u201d\nTo address this, the organisation is undertaking the international multi-location variety trial, testing 35 coffee types across 23 countries to measure performance in different climates \u2013 including in regions not typically associated with coffee production, such as Australia.\nIn what could be Australia\u2019s most significant contribution to coffee since the flat white, scientists at Southern Cross University will be testing 20 \u201cclimate-resistant\u201d varieties.\nProf Graham King, a leading plant science researcher at SCU, says that in January up to 900 plants will be planted at the tropical fruit research station in Alstonville, northern New South Wales. According to King, climate change is expected to devastate the world\u2019s major coffee-growing regions through extreme weather and by increasing attacks by crop pests and diseases.\n\u201cMany current mountainous tropical production areas of the world are likely to become untenable for coffee as climate change progresses,\u201d he says. \u201cWithin Australia we currently have the benefit of no coffee rust or cherry borer, or other major pests and disease. This is quite unique compared with most production areas of the world.\u201d\nThe impact is already being felt. As detailed in a 2016 report by Fairtrade Australia, in 2012 Central America was hit by a wave of coffee leaf rust (Hemileia vastatrix) after unusually high temperatures and high-altitude rains, causing US$500m in crop damages and putting nearly 350,000 labourers out of work.\nDroughts and frequent storms have led to Costa Rican farmers giving up coffee for orange plantations. Outside Latin America, the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) \u2013 which used to only appear at a maximum altitude of 1,500 metres above sea level \u2013 is being found above this limit, thanks to unseasonably hot conditions and higher rainfall on plantations from Tanzania to Indonesia. On Mount Kilimanjaro plantations, the beetle is now found 300 metres higher than last century.\nThe future of coffee \u2026 and the livelihood and wellbeing of coffee farmers, workers and their families is at stake\nNot only is Australia free of these blights, says King, but climate change could open up more Australian regions for growing coffee cherries owing to reduced frost damage in winter.\nKing warns that the trial will need at least five years to reap results, but funding from the federal government-funded AgriFutures Australia runs out in May. He says it has offered \u201cpretty poor engagement\u201d on the issue.\nAgriFutures\u2019 business development manager, Duncan Farquhar, says the coffee sector has been provided with funding for developing new varieties since 2014. \u201cEmerging industries, including the coffee industry\u201d have been invited to compete for a new round of funding, he says.\nThe organisation\u2019s figures indicate that local coffee production has a long way to go to meet domestic demand. In 2011\u201312, just under 50 Australian growers produced about 1,000 tonnes of dry green beans, while about 67,000 tonnes were imported. Its experts say Australian coffee is 10% to 15% lower in caffeine than much overseas coffee because it is grown in a low-stress environment. Caffeine is produced by coffee plants as a defence mechanism against threats from pests and diseases.\nAn agronomist and coffee industry adviser, David Peasley, says rising temperatures could hurt coffee growing in north Queensland but agrees that in subtropical coffee growing regions they could help. He cautions that climate change could leave Australian plantations more vulnerable to pests and diseases and that extreme weather events will present a challenge.\nIndeed, without hardier varieties, Australian growers may find climate change brings more challenges than benefits. A grower, Zeta Grealy, says conditions have become increasingly difficult since she created her Zeta\u2019s Coffee plantation on the border of NSW and Queensland in 1994.\n\u201cIn the past we had fabulous conditions, a lovely microclimate for coffee,\u201d she says. \u201cIt used to look rainforest-y around here, now it\u2019s very sparse. It has been a gradual change \u2013 where once we\u2019d be getting two metres of rainfall, [across 2018] we had less than one.\n\u201cOur crop actually didn\u2019t happen this time, we had overripe cherries and completely green cherries, flowers on the tree \u2013 not what we want. So we decided to strip the trees and get them ready for next year.\u201d\nThe crop was down to 19kg from a typical year of about a tonne. Grealy is hopeful that the trials lead to access to varieties that can cope with lower rainfall.\nWorld Coffee Research is encouraging the industry to do its bit to safeguard the crop\u2019s global future by contributing to its Checkoff program, in which roasters can donate up to 0.20 cents a kilogram of green coffee from participating suppliers to help fund initiatives such as the global trial.\nSupporters include Single O\u2019s director of coffee, Wendy De Jong, whose company will be the first roaster to import a full container of \u201cfuture-friendly\u201d coffees to Australia.\n\u201c[We] are calling on Australian roasters and importers to do their part to fund the critical research and development needed for coffee and farmers alike by signing up to the WCR Checkoff program,\u201d she says.\nFairtrade Australia\u2019s chief executive, Molly Harriss Olson, welcomes research into hardier varieties, noting that by 2080 wild coffee \u2013 a vital bedrock of genetic diversity for developing new varieties \u2013 could become extinct. She notes that expanding Australian plantations won\u2019t prevent climate change\u2019s impact on coffee growers in other countries.\n\u201cMore frequent and severe drought is associated with a deep and disturbing sense of failure, loss, powerlessness, heightened anxiety, stress, depression and an increased suicide rate among farmers,\u201d she says.\nHarriss Olson urged coffee consumers to educate themselves about the challenges facing growers, seek out brands that are both carbon-neutral and help producers to adapt to a changing climate, and urge businesses and governments to pursue a carbon-neutral economy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crucial that we all take action now,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause the future of coffee, one of the world\u2019s favourite commodities, and the livelihood and wellbeing of millions of coffee farmers, workers and their families is at stake.\u201d\n\u2022 This article was amended on 8 January 2019 to correct Prof Graham King\u2019s job title.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/food", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/rural-australia", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/farming", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/fair-trade", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Climate change may devastate the globe\u2019s major coffee-growing regions through extreme weather events \u2013 but Australia could be the solution", "date_published": {"$date": 1546819967000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1546920139000}, "authors": ["Max Opray"], "article_section": "Food", "article_tags": ["Coffee", "Environment", "Food", "Rural Australia", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Farming", "Australia news", "Climate change", "Fair trade", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jan/07/the-end-of-coffee-could-australia-save-the-worlds-beans", "og:description": "Climate change may devastate the globe\u2019s major coffee-growing regions through extreme weather events \u2013 but Australia could be the solution", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22be41e9b61e70a8a9ad755d6b3b359294570eb9/0_327_7952_4774/master/7952.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=f47bb85d5efc480c183ae08b00b90b7d", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "The end of coffee: could Australia save the world's beans?"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22be41e9b61e70a8a9ad755d6b3b359294570eb9/0_327_7952_4774/master/7952.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6fa5ae732d812487562034697428e96e", "width": "7952", "height": "4774", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22be41e9b61e70a8a9ad755d6b3b359294570eb9/0_327_7952_4774/master/7952.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7663908198ebfb039b01b0e9d262367c", "description": "Demand for coffee is expected to double by 2050 and, if nothing is done, more than half of the world\u2019s suitable coffee land will be pushed into unsuitability owing to climate change.\nPhotograph: andresr/Getty Images/iStockphoto"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c49e8bd8da699023089707f6ec787984e92c5e4a/0_21_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f5ee85d7029f9fa72ec040bc4f7a1d6b", "width": "5760", "height": "3456", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c49e8bd8da699023089707f6ec787984e92c5e4a/0_21_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3cb83d6f5241ab923097cb8b4590cd20", "description": "Freshly roasted coffee beans.

The plant disease spread quickly through highlands, affected more than 50 per cent of the crop, with some Guatemalan producers losing up to 85 per cent of their crop. In Colombia, the fungus is being reported in mountainous regions previously too cool for it to survive. In 2012\u201313, crop damages amounted to around US$ 500 million with nearly 350,000 Central American labourers put out of work. The Coffee Berry Borer (Hypothenemus hampei), a major pest originating in Congo but now seen around the Bean Belt, causes crop damage in excess of $US 500 million annually. Since 2001, the borer, previously confined to crops below 1,500 metres above sea level, has spread upslope, drawn by hotter, wetter conditions in places like Tanzania, Uganda, and Indonesia. On Mt Kilimanjaro, the borer is now found 300 metres higher than where it was last century.

So hard to predict the sort of things that will change and the sort of things that won't. Humanity has been well informed about the climate for many many years; on another level the famous Club of Rome report in 1973 or so indicated a deep concern about relentless growth. All that knowledge hasn't changed either the use of air travel or damaging habits like intense farming or high levels of meat consumption. In fact all those things have only increased in the intervening years. Governments haven't even been able to tax air travel!People are starving now in their millions. Just look at Yemen. Like many others, I have changed my habits but I don't harbour any hope that humanity at large will do so in time to put a stop to the ongoing catastrophe. The present speculative, greedy form of capitalism looks like turning out to have been the lowest and final stage of human development (capital itself is not the issue for me, you can use it for good or bad ends, use it for food speculation or build a hospital). It is destroying the planet, most of the rainforests, millions of years of natural history. These are facts. And politicians only ever care about the next few years: Germany is a case in point, they have missed their own climate goals, these politicians are unable to exert their will (and they are not alone in that, but I don't mean to be derisive about many honest activist efforts among people with a conscience). I am with all those who fight climate change, but not because I harbour the slightest hope. I suggest you read Jean Ziegler's books, the former UN special rapporteur on the right to food. He paints a precise portrait of a nasty global elite bent on destroying everything for the sake of personal profit (do I need to mention Saudi Arabia? Or China with its huge \"re-education\" camps for its non-Han Chinese population?

The split already exists, but for now, it\u2019s being held together with sticky tape and string. And Credlin\u2019s preselection could well be the spark that lights the fuse, and blows the whole thing up.\nThe Liberal party is suffering an existential crisis. And no other issue defines this crisis like the looming threat to our safety and security caused by inaction on climate change. Credlin understands this and has used her position as a climate change-denying, hard-right mouthpiece of the Murdoch empire to advance her own political interests, and the interests of the coal industry.\n\u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nShe\u2019s consistently claimed climate change is a political hoax, and used her position in the media to undermine a sitting prime minister and any energy policy supported by the Coalition party room that does not involve more coal and the end of renewables.\nShe doesn\u2019t represent real liberal views, and if she appeals to what\u2019s left of the \u201cbase\u201d, then many people who used to vote Liberal will keep moving for the exits.\nInspired by Donald Trump, Credlin has argued Australia should tear up the Paris agreement, tear up any sensible national energy guarantee. Credlin has demanded taxpayers\u2019 money go to the Adani coalmine and be used to build new coal-fired power stations. It\u2019s madness.\nAustralians don\u2019t want this. We would prefer a Great Barrier Reef, renewable energy and a future we can survive and thrive in.\nThese views are so ignorant \u2013 their political manifestation through Tony Abbott, Craig Kelly and their ilk \u2013 that it presents a grave economic and security threat to Australia\u2019s future. And it could be the final death knell to the Liberal party.\nCredlin\u2019s demonstrated lack of understanding of the serious climate emergency we face, or even the basic economics of power production costs are breathtaking. She promotes the view that climate change is some leftwing conspiracy and that the science is rubbish.\nThese views need to be called for what they are: dangerous.\nIn her media roles, Credlin has even attacked the scientific foundation for energy and climate policy. From the desk at Sky, she announced her displeasure that former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull asked chief scientist Alan Finkel for real consideration of the climate change transition and energy policy. Instead she demanded a manufactured report devoid of reality.\nIt is essential now that real liberals stand against this reckless game of Russian roulette\n\u201cWhat started out as a report designed to expose the South Australian Labor government\u2019s catastrophic handling of energy policy leading up to last year\u2019s blackouts\u201d \u2013 promoting the lie that the blackouts were caused by renewables \u2013 \u201cis now a report that threatens the tense equilibrium of the Coalition party room\u201d, warned Credlin.\nHeaven help us if facts were allowed to get in the way of the stability of the party room or facts should reach the people!\nWe should be deeply concerned that the Liberal party is once again seeking to preselect people who are prepared to sprout deranged conspiracy theories.\n\u201cGreen ideology has trumped sensible economics. Affordable power, from abundant coal and gas, is Australia\u2019s principal competitive advantage and in recent years, we\u2019ve given it away in the name of saving the planet.\u201d\nGood luck finding a bank, or anyone under 35, to agree with you.\nThe job of any politician should be to put the long-term wellbeing of the public before cheap and dangerous political point-scoring. People are sick to death of it. This kind of pandering to the hard-right\u2019s views did not serve Matthew Guy well in Victoria, and it will not serve the Liberals well at national level either.\nAustralians know it\u2019s getting hotter every summer and see the increases in extreme weather. Report after report, overflowing with scientific evidence, traditionally a solid foundation for investment and public policy making, has been abandoned by the federal Liberal party. We understand how this will threaten our families, economy and security, and we must act to provide people with a real liberal alternative.\nCredlin, Abbott and the rest of the hard-right\u2019s \u201ccommitment to coal\u201d is entirely political. The calculation they\u2019ve made is that their short-term political interests, and the interests of the coal industry, are more important than the future of our country, our people and holistically the environment we all share.\nIt is essential now that real liberals stand against this reckless game of Russian roulette the hard right are playing with our future. If not, they too will adorn the walls as climate change deniers, who, despite all the evidence, refused to act.\n\u2022 Oliver Yates is a member of the Liberal party and former chief executive of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/energy-australia", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change-scepticism", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Credlin has put short term political interests, and the interests of the coal industry, before the future of our country", "date_published": {"$date": 1547000617000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1547013259000}, "authors": ["Oliver Yates"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Peta Credlin", "Australian politics", "Australia news", "Coalition", "Liberal party", "Climate change", "Energy", "Climate change scepticism"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/09/peta-credlins-preselection-could-be-the-spark-that-blows-up-the-liberal-party", "og:description": "Credlin has put short term political interests, and the interests of the coal industry, before the future of our country", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8bc365332515a9d5afce453443e5f957b0bb0af/0_115_2214_1328/master/2214.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=76c949491bfcc3da5a6572d44cd7cf2a", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Peta Credlin's preselection could be the spark that blows up the Liberal party | Oliver Yates"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8bc365332515a9d5afce453443e5f957b0bb0af/0_115_2214_1328/master/2214.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=573816895820bb1a317999dd8e5e9fbf", "width": "2214", "height": "1328", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8bc365332515a9d5afce453443e5f957b0bb0af/0_115_2214_1328/master/2214.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a95a3c574ee8c0d5c9dc0daf2d200216", "description": "\u2018[Peta Credlin] doesn\u2019t represent real liberal views, and if she appeals to what\u2019s left of the \u201cbase\u201d, then many people who used to vote Liberal will keep moving for the exits.\u2019\nPhotograph: Sam Mooy/AAP"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556125307777}, "comments": [{"id": "124420093", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1547013578000}, "author": "kejovi", "author_id": "14861525", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "As a Labor voter I do appreciate your columns Oliver Yates, it is reassuring in one way that there is still some sane people left in the Liberal Party and they haven't been silenced or purged by the far right nutters who have been infiltrating the party since John Howard gave them the nod and the wink in the 90's.The problem for the Liberal Party is if there is a split, ala ALP/DLP in the fifties, it could find itself in the wilderness for decades and any cobbled together coalition of hard right Liberals, centre right Liberals, Nationals in government would be fraught with the drama we are witnessing today.And will the Nationals be a political force as their prediliction for coal over cows and corn make their 'base' look at and vote in independents who have rural and regional farmers and constituents on their minds now, instead of a seat on the board of mining company in the future.The future looks difficult and will only be made more difficult if the predicted electoral landslide happens and the LNP are left with around 50 seats.........", "recommendation_count": "80", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "124420091", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1547013559000}, "author": "TheMadMonkeyPod", "author_id": "100650499", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Kansas folk?", "recommendation_count": "3", "in_reply_to": "124419921", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "124420090", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1547013550000}, "author": "GeelongOldF", "author_id": "12204485", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "The real reason why women don\u2019t get selected in pre selection is they can\u2019t raise massive donation and are not bids on either the Conservative or Progressive front.

As soon as the Libs are soundly and deservedly thrashed in May (or March?), and he can't be blamed for it, Malcolm Turnbull should copy Menzies and start a new, genuinely representative centre-right party reflecting his own genuine values.

Jair Messias Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil is not just another country that elected a far-right president at a time when the world\u2019s most powerful nation is led by Donald Trump. It\u2019s not just South America\u2019s version of the current trend of countries sliding into authoritarianism, like we\u2019ve seen in Hungary, Poland, Turkey and the Philippines. It\u2019s not simply a peripheral nation with a pathetic leader. Brazil has become the apocalyptic vanguard that signals how radical this moment is \u2013 one with the power to worsen the climate crisis at top speed and blight the entire planet.\nBolsonaro was elected in October, on his pledge to go back \u201850 years'. Brazil lived under a military dictatorship then\nThe election of Bolsonaro is a response to what we might call civilisation\u2019s new discontent. Maybe people can\u2019t identify the source of their anxiety, which has driven up the consumption of tranquillisers and sedatives. The average citizen might apply more familiar labels to the corrosion of their quality of life, air, and water; to a relentless fear of the \u201cother\u201d; to the feeling they\u2019re walking in quicksand. But what\u2019s underpinning this new discontent pervading all areas of human experience is our climate crisis.\nBolsonaro was elected in October, on his pledge to go back \u201c50 years\u201d. Fifty years ago, Brazil lived under a military dictatorship. For Bolsonaro and his followers, who are outright defenders of torture and the elimination of adversaries, it was a glorious era. Despite the terrifying menace of nuclear war, the world was still a place where science promised nothing but progress and solutions \u2013 it delivered no bad news, like global warming, that led to limitations on an individual\u2019s daily life or on government actions. It was a time when white, heterosexual men held power and knew precisely who they were. They may have faced some resistance from minorities, but they still enjoyed absolute hegemony.\nWe cannot comprehend what is now happening in Brazil \u2013 and around the world \u2013 unless we understand that our culture wars are tightly bound up with humanity\u2019s need to say goodbye to 20th-century illusions of power and face a planet made more hostile by human hand. Things will soon reach catastrophic levels if nations and their residents do not unite in a global effort to do something extremely hard and unpopular: impose limits on ourselves to counteract global warming.\nThe election of Bolsonaro ties all this together like no other event. The Bolsonaro administration promises a \u201cnew era\u201d \u2013 a return to a time free of doubts and insecurity, with certainty about what a man is and what a woman is and a clear sense who\u2019s in charge of the public sphere and the family. Their ultra-conservatism is at times corny, at times biblical \u2013 but never innocent.\nSoon after Bolsonaro\u2019s inauguration last week, the minister of women, family, and human rights, Damares Alves \u2013 an evangelical pastor \u2013 stated in a video that now \u201cgirls wear pink and boys, blue\u201d. Beside her, a supporter held an Israeli flag. Some neo-Pentecostals likewise waved Israeli flags at the inauguration. These religious groups, who are growing numerically and wielding greater power in Brazil, voted overwhelmingly for Bolsonaro.\nA significant portion of them believe Jews will play a role in fulfilling scriptural prophesies about the return of the Messiah. It must be remembered that Bolsonaro was baptised in the River Jordan, in Israel, a couple of years before the presidential campaign. Now in power, he has announced that Brazil will move its embassy to Jerusalem, which, say these evangelicals, will be the \u201cstage for Armageddon\u201d. In a recent visit to Brazil, Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, declared: \u201cWe have no better friends in the world than the evangelical community.\u201d\nErnesto Ara\u00fajo, the dogmatic foreign minister, said Bolsonaro\u2019s rise will be marked by \u201cGod through the nation\u201d. He has also written that climate change is an \u201cideology\u201d dreamed up so imperialist nations could determine Brazil\u2019s future. \u201cThe people who say there are no men and women are the same ones who preach that countries don\u2019t have the right to protect their borders,\u201d Ara\u00fajo stated in his inaugural speech.\nThis Brazil, stitched from a patchwork of dogmas, might be a fascinating topic of study if it didn\u2019t put the whole planet at risk. Ideological discourse serves to instil the notion of destiny and to ensure cohesion within a population frightened about everything it might lose, from salaries and jobs to symbolic positions in the realms of race, gender, and sexual orientation. When Bolsonaro says he\u2019s going to \u201cfree Brazil from political correctness\u201d, he\u2019s pledging to break both the \u201cchains\u201d that force people to respect minorities and those that curtail devastation of the Amazon forest.\nIn his first days in power, the president shifted responsibility for demarcation of indigenous and quilombola territory \u2013 which makes up a large part of the protected Amazon \u2013 to the agriculture ministry. This government sector is controlled by agribusiness, responsible for much of deforestation and eager to get their hands on the remaining forest. Bolsonaro promised to turn the public land occupied by indigenous peoples into private land where mining and agribusiness concerns can reap profits. The goal is to make more forest land available for capitalist speculation: cattle, soybeans, mining, and major construction projects.\nThis is why government ideologues fabricated the idea that \u201ccommunism\u201d \u2013 a system never implemented in Brazil and now largely irrelevant worldwide \u2013 is a looming threat to Brazilians. The supposed \u201cinternational Marxist plot\u201d serves to justify turning the forest into a commodity. In this fantasy, indigenous peoples, who are the chief barrier to destruction of the Amazon, are portrayed as a \u201cthreat to national sovereignty\u201d.\nThe deforestation rate for 2018 was the highest in a decade. The mere possibility that Bolsonaro might win had a liberating effect on deforesters and further inflamed conflicts in a country where more environmental defenders are killed than in any other.\nWithout the world\u2019s biggest tropical forest, there is no way to control global warming. If Bolsonaro\u2019s messianic capitalism is not stopped, life on this planet will be much worse for everyone. For a contingent of neo-Pentecostal evangelicals, this may be welcomed as an apocalypse preceding the final salvation of \u201ctrue believers\u201d.

Marie and Tony Newton\u2019s back garden is filled with summery colour: miniature mauve cyclamens, frilly red camellias, graceful hellebores, seasonal snowdrops and the bright green sheaths of bulbs promising more flowers to come. A few winters back, their first daffodil bloomed on Boxing Day.\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically chaotic,\u201d says Tony of the new climatic normal. \u201cIt\u2019s non-stop flowers from now on. Winters are milder on average and there\u2019s every opportunity to have a riot of lovely flowers from December right through till spring.\u201d\nDeadly floods in Bangladesh, devastating wildfires in California, melting glaciers in Greenland, coral bleaching in the oceans \u2013 this is climate change in action. Highlighting far more benign changes in Britain, long blessed with a moderate climate, may appear trivial or downright insensitive. Our gentle extremes \u2013 the beast from the east, or summer 2018 being England\u2019s hottest ever \u2013 are far from drastic. But they still pose challenges, and there is more change coming.\nBritain\u2019s 27 million gardeners could be the canaries in our coalmine. How are gardeners experiencing climate change in Britain and how is it transforming our gardens? And can adapting our gardening styles mitigate the negative impacts of climate change?\nMarie and Tony couldn\u2019t see their garden when they first viewed the house in 1982 because it was covered by a snowdrift. In the years since, as their south-facing quarter-acre evolved from a children\u2019s play-space to a \u201cfour-seasons garden\u201d with an all-year-round rainbow of flowers, shrubs and trees, they have witnessed the Midlands climate become steadily milder. Autumn frosts are much later, if they strike at all, and September is a summer month now. Their begonias continue until October. \u201cThat would never have happened in the past; we\u2019d barely get through September without air frosts,\u201d says Tony. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s warming up, you\u2019ve got to plan for the extremes. We\u2019re still going to get very severe winters and it will wipe out many gardeners\u2019 new species.\u201d\nThey know about this only too well. Their garden features a jungle area of bamboo, palm trees, a banana tree and the stumps of several Tasmanian tree ferns. These ferns survived the winter of 2009, the coldest for 30 years, but a run of -15C nights and sub-zero days the following December killed them off. \u201cIt\u2019s a mortgage to replace them,\u201d grimaces Marie. Climate change is encouraging many gardeners to buy exotic plants but \u201cwe still need truly hardy varieties,\u201d says Tony. Their banana is wrapped in black cloth over winter. He ensures that whenever they add a shrub to the 3,000 in their garden it can survive at -15C.\nMarie and Tony\u2019s garden fared better during last summer\u2019s drought. Their clay soils retain moisture, which helps, but they didn\u2019t lose a single plant to the weather, despite being on holiday for two weeks. This may be because they are obsessive mulchers. Mulch is material added to the surface of the soil to increase organic matter and repress weeds. The Newtons have added 108 cubic metres of tree bark to their soil over the years; each year they also compost all their garden leaves and cuttings, reapplying this to their soil. This organic matter has steadily improved soil quality and, crucially, helps it retain moisture.\nWhen Liam Shoesmith, deputy parks manager of Truro city council, saw how dry 2018 summer\u2019s long-term forecast looked, he suggested the city\u2019s gardeners should plant succulents and cacti for their Britain in Bloom competition entry. \u201cIt was a bit of a joke really,\u201d he says. But the community group that organises Truro\u2019s displays took his advice. In what the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) described as the \u201ctoughest year for community gardening in 54 years\u201d, Truro\u2019s blend of exotic, drought-tolerant plants, including palms and Mediterranean herbs, serviced by a solar-powered rainwater-harvesting system, thrived. And Truro won the Britain in Bloom competition for the first time.\nShoesmith is currently dispatching his team to mow parkland grass: milder winters mean Truro\u2019s grass grows all year round. He began gardening as a boy in the 1980s. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely milder and wetter,\u201d he says. \u201cThe difficult thing we have with the climate is the more changeable weather. Last winter was probably one of the wettest on record here and then we went into one of the driest summers. The capricious nature of the weather is very hard to anticipate and work with.\u201d\nWe don\u2019t think of mild winters as extreme weather events, but December 2015 was the most anomalous month ever recorded, 5.1C above average, and the warmest in the Met Office\u2019s central England temperature dataset, which stretches back to 1659. Shoesmith notices how pollinating insects, such as solitary bees, often emerge during these mild midwinters. If there are no flowers, and no nectar, they will perish. \u201cClimate change is a big issue and as gardeners we can all do our bit to help by planting the garden so it\u2019s flowering throughout the year,\u201d he says. \u201cWe all want that anyway.\u201d\nWildlife-friendly gardening focuses on native flowers, but Shoesmith argues we have long had non-native plants \u2013 particularly in milder Cornwall \u2013 and many exotic species are just as attractive to pollinators. In general, Britain\u2019s 400,000 garden plant species provide genetic diversity, enabling more selection and breeding to adapt to future extremes. But Shoesmith also has a motto \u2013 \u201cdon\u2019t go silly buying too much frilly\u201d \u2013 because certain varieties of exotic flowers with lots of petals lose their nectar-holding sexual organs and so become useless for pollinators. Daisies, aconites, crocus, hellebores are good for winter-waking bees.\nAllotment holders are also adapting to the increasingly capricious climate. Mandy Barber has turned to growing perennial produce on her plot in Ashburton, Devon. \u201cAnnual vegetables needed a lot more watering and it was touch and go whether they would make it last summer, but perennial vegetables have a lot more resilience to temperature changes,\u201d she says. Barber is experimenting with crops including Taunton Deane kale; poireau perp\u00e9tuel, a perennial leek; and Hablitzia tamnoides, or Caucasian spinach, which is grown in Scandinavia and can survive -25C. \u201cThe Hablitzia tamnoides plants go on for decades, they are like a rampant triffid, but you get a crop between February and June every year and the leaves are a bit like baby spinach,\u201d says Barber. She also propagates and sells these perennials.\nEvery gardener I speak to agrees that milder winters are enabling more pests to survive and encouraging new pest species. Allan Trigg has been growing vegetables for more than 40 years and has an allotment in Chelmsford, Essex. \u201cThis is my little patch of England,\u201d he smiles. Fewer frosts means his fellow allotment holders plant out runner beans, sweetcorn and potatoes earlier. With an extended growing season, Trigg can grow more, and second crops, although last year he grew less because he was spending so much time watering his vegetables. The dry weather produced lower yields of crops such as potatoes. After 2017, his potatoes lasted him and his wife through to February; this winter, they were eaten by November. And allium leaf miner and leek moth are a growing problem. \u201cI used to grow loads of leeks but now I don\u2019t bother,\u201d he says. He pulls one up to show the damage below ground. \u201cWe never used to have this trouble years ago.\u201d\nIn Walsall the Newtons are accepting of their growing losses to pests such as the lily beetle and the lace bug. \u201cIt went absolutely berserk after the hot summer,\u201d says Tony. \u201cI thought it was going to kill all the plants in the garden.\u201d Barber is beset by voles (which survive the milder winters), while in Cornwall, Shoesmith has noticed the spread of fuchsia gall mite along the hedges. \u201cIt had the opportunity to come to Britain for decades, but only arrived this century because of the milder winters,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same amount of frosts now and so we get many more fungal problems.\u201d\nThese observations precisely match the more scientific language of Gardening in a Changing Climate, a 2017 RHS report that outlines the challenges \u2013 milder winters, more unpredictable extremes and more pests \u2013 posed by climate change. But the RHS also asks how gardeners might help save the planet. The way we garden is still sometimes part of the problem \u2013 using precious water in pursuit of a perfect lawn during a drought springs to mind \u2013 but it can be part of the solution. Gardeners can reduce carbon dioxide emissions, mitigate pollution and flooding, and help increase their neighbourhood\u2019s resilience.\n\u201cWater use in gardens is going to be a major issue in the future,\u201d says Alistair Griffith, director of science at the RHS. London is forecast to require 100m litres a day more than it can supply in 2020, with this deficit rising to 400m litres a day by 2040. The use of energy-intensive mains water on gardens is still socially acceptable and Britain lags behind more water-stressed countries where grey-water recycling is commonplace. But hosepipe bans could become perpetual for some regions in coming decades.\nApart from using only rainwater \u2013 even a small balcony can catch and store rainwater with a mini-reservoir \u2013 Griffith recommends gardeners provide \u201cas much greenery as possible\u201d. He suggests planting hedges instead of fencing and planting trees. Trees not only dispel pollution but can alleviate flash flooding and provide shade for a home during heatwaves. Perhaps the most overlooked way gardening can benefit the climate is via the soil: adding organic matter (mulch from home-composting, not peat) can create a soil that stores more carbon and retains more water, also making gardens more resilient in flood and droughts.\nGriffith\u2019s final practical suggestion for climate-friendly gardening is to make everything permeable. Unfortunately, paving gardens for parking continues (in 2015, the RHS found that the number of paved, plant-free front gardens had tripled in 10 years from 1.5m to 4.6m). Even car park gardens can be permeable and planted with trees and shrubs around the edge. But, according to Griffith, people resist, citing a lack of time and a nervousness about failing at gardening. \u201cGardening is always trial and error,\u201d he says. \u201cGive it a go.\u201d\nGardening won\u2019t stop climate change, but it could make our local communities more resilient when faced with extreme floods, heat \u2013 and mild weather. In troubled times, it is also a fundamentally optimistic gesture.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Across Britain, gardeners are facing the challenges of an unstable climate: extreme weather, unpredictability and prospering pests \u2013 and trying a range of solutions to cope", "date_published": {"$date": 1547463600000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1547471151000}, "authors": ["Patrick Barkham"], "article_section": "Life and style", "article_tags": ["Gardens", "Climate change", "Life and style", "Environment"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/14/growing-pains-how-the-climate-crisis-is-changing-british-gardens", "og:description": "Across Britain, gardeners are facing the challenges of an unstable climate: extreme weather, unpredictability and prospering pests \u2013 and trying a range of solutions to cope", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6445145b185e327c4cb10209bb02c96af0984177/0_108_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=2b4196f365f360a040478b76910ef855", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Growing pains: how the climate crisis is changing British gardens"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6445145b185e327c4cb10209bb02c96af0984177/0_108_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6f97caeb29e7613c087c7249defcab59", "width": "3500", "height": "2101", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6445145b185e327c4cb10209bb02c96af0984177/0_108_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5f6cf84e1ec0a23e5c43fc5c742ef5fa", "description": "Tony and Marie Newton\u2019s \u2018four-seasons garden\u2019.\nPhotograph: Henry Nicholls/Newsteam"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36670e3d2bbef873569326d8ea78e2142df1e46f/0_0_2335_3508/master/2335.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d19e55f45d0082df077e976202dd05e2", "width": "2335", "height": "3508", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36670e3d2bbef873569326d8ea78e2142df1e46f/0_0_2335_3508/master/2335.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3125fcbe3c8337c3ccef1efa96adcf38", "description": "Part of Truro\u2019s winning entry to the Britain in Bloom competition.

I also have a clay soil, grey leading to red. I live on what was a floodplain, the land was recovered over the last 200 years. Worms do the main work in \u2018no dig\u2019 and I saw a massive increase in worms.\nRather than grass lawn I went with herbs and I was happy to put up with a work in progress for a decade. I have a small garden, maybe 5M square which made the work manageable.\nThe worms have mixed the clay in with the improved soil and general composting keeps on top of things by adding soil volume each year.\nOne benefit has been our council has adopted strict recycling targets which means you HAVE to compost because the bins are just far too small to just recycle. A rabbit turns a large amount of green waste into ready to use compost and he takes up much less space than a recycling/compost bin and that is important in my small garden and it cuts down on flies and associated problems with composting which are also problematic in smaller gardens.\nMy rabbit (and chickens when I kept them) are free range, raised beds protect the crops I really care about. Chickens destroy everything but I\u2019ve found rabbits tend to calm down over time and don\u2019t destroy everything- I grow kale just for the rabbit, the rabbit loves dandelions so they are absent from the garden, and we agree to share things like sorrel and similar salad crops.\nAnd of course a rabbit is a cheap pet.

Before we became simple farmers we practiced no dig, we were hunter gatherers. Then we started to clear land and grow crops that suited that parcel of land in that spot. To extend that area would have a cost and the clearance cost was greater than the reseeding cost. At the same time, as we became sedentary (as in we weren\u2019t nomadic, or we were less so) we enriched the soil in the short term, partly by natural composting and manure, partly by bringing soil nutrients into play over time.\nLater we collectivise and protect our land against other groups, and that reinforces \u2018digging\u2019, and that pressure on land just increases over time.\nFast forward to today and things are different and you could adopt no dig as the land has long been cleared and parcelled out. Over a decade ago my back garden soil was dead and contaminated, dead from years of being used to grow crops (the last pig was shot on the property in 1928) and dead because a steel works had been built a few miles away and over the years it had contaminated the soil. I dug away a good 30 cm of soil and disposed of it, and then over time rebuilt the soil level by keeping chickens, rabbits, and growing certain crops- the land had become overgrown so there was a lot of tree/shrub wood that was mulched and added and that takes years to give up its nutrients.

Oceans absorb more than 90% of the heat that results from greenhouse gases, so if you want to measure global warming you really have to measure ocean warming.\nThere are other ways to measure climate change, but none are as convincing as the oceans. Air temperatures are most commonly reported in the media as evidence of global warming, but the problem with these is they are very erratic. While there is certainly a long-term trend of higher air temperatures, any given year may be warmer or colder than the last.\nSo oceans are key, and they are telling us a clear story. The last five years were the five hottest on record. The numbers are huge: in 2018 the extra ocean heat compared to a 1981-2010 baseline amounted to 196,700,000,000,000,000,000,000 joules. The current rate of ocean warming is equivalent to five Hiroshima-size atomic bombs exploding every second.\nThe measurements have been published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences in an article by Lijing Cheng, the lead author, and his colleagues from the Institute for Atmospheric Physics in China. His collaborators, of which I am one, included researchers from around the world. The article charts ocean heat back to the late 1950s, showing a steady increase.\nOcean warming is incontrovertible proof of global warming, and there are real consequences to a warming ocean. Firstly, warmer water expands, and this expansion causes sea levels to rise. Approximately a third of the rise in ocean waters is a result of the heat absorbed by the oceans. Scientists expect about one metre of sea level rise by the end of the century, which would be enough to displace 150 million people worldwide. \nThe warming waters also make storms more powerful. In the US recently, we have seen hurricanes pass over extremely warm ocean waters, which has supercharged them and increased the damage they cause. Other kinds of storms are also being made stronger. Heavier downpours of rainfall are increasing flooding around the world. Simply put, our emissions of greenhouse gases have caused loss of life and property. We are all responsible, but the people who have denied the science and the solutions own a special responsibility that history will judge harshly.\nIt isn\u2019t just humans that are suffering and will suffer more in the future. The heating of oceans is causing tremendous problems for sea life, particularly coral reefs. If we continue to warm the planet, we can expect to lose much of these reefs. We can also anticipate reductions in fish and sea life populations. \nWe scientists sound like a broken record. Every year we present the science and plead for action. Not nearly enough is being done. We can still tackle climate change, but we must act immediately. We have the means to make a difference, we lack only the will.

It\u2019s also classified as the most at-risk beach from erosion in New South Wales and the third most at-risk in the nation.\nCollaroy takes its name from an 1881 shipwreck. The paddle steamer Collaroy, that plied its trade between Newcastle and Sydney as a passenger vessel, grounded at the end of my street, according records in the State Library of NSW.\nAs for \u201cNarrabeen\u201d, its name is disputed as meaning either \u201csource of fresh water\u201d or \u201cswan\u201d. Camaraigal descendant and historian Dennis Foley, describes the idyllic shores and waterway of Narrabeen Lagoon, \u201cthe heart of our world\u201d before British settlement.\nCollaroy-Narrabeen is mecca for international surfers. A bucket-list wave.\nQuick trivia question: which is the only non-American surf spot mentioned in the Beach Boys\u2019 Surfin\u2019 USA? It\u2019s Narra-beyaaan\u2026 There you go. Look it up. (You owe me a chop from your next triumphant meat tray.)\nWorld-renowned surfing legends Simon Anderson, Terry Fitzgerald, Nat Young, Damien Hardman, Laura Enever, Mark Warren, Col Smith and Ozzie Wright had their pick of waves along the stretch \u2013 from the powerful beach break at Collaroy to the fabled left-hander at North Narrabeen known as \u201cnorthy\u201d.\nSurf writer Nick Carroll says: \u201cIt is possible that more surfers learned to pull vertical off-the-lips here than any other surf spot in the world.\u201d Standards and expectations are high and routinely met.\nMaster the hassle at \u201cnorthy\u201d and you\u2019ll survive any competitive break on earth, my surfing husband Brendan Donohoe reckons. He\u2019s been the president of the northern beaches branch of Surfrider Australia since 1999 (also former chair of the board) and through him I\u2019ve had a front-row seat to observe the pitched battles fought over Collaroy-Narrabeen.\nFor those not immersed in surfing culture, the beach is that one in those ubiquitous news pictures of smashed houses, tangled timber and a swimming pool wrenched from its moorings \u2013 all flung to the sand in the wild winter storm of 2016 which swallowed 50m of coastline, 150m of sand and dumped it in the surf zone.\nThe images don\u2019t surprise anyone with a passing local knowledge. Storms have been claiming houses and various bits of the beach\u2019s four surf life saving clubs regularly since the first recorded image of splintered timber in 1920. Ask the old-timers.\nQuestion is, can a man-made seawall hold back the tides?\nOne thing is absolutely certain according to coastal scientists worldwide: seawalls protect land property in the short-term but, eventually, destroy beaches.\nThink of the dunes of a beach as its precious lungs \u2026 breathing in and out with the tides. Sand is accreted, washed away. Breathe in. Breathe out. For the vast swathes of Australia\u2019s uninhabited shoreline it\u2019s a dynamic, natural process.\nWhen humans build houses in the dunes or breakwalls and seawalls on beaches and rivers, they harden the coast and its ability to recover naturally. Such structures have the inevitable effect of reflecting and concentrating wave energy and accelerating erosion.\nEventually, the beach narrows and disappears.\nIn 2002, the Surfrider Foundation called on the beach-loving residents of Collaroy-Narrabeen to protest the building of a seawall more than a kilometre long proposed by the then Warringah council. Also noted was that seawalls are eye-wateringly expensive to maintain, adding huge imposts to council rates.\nThousands gathered, held hands, drew a \u201cline in the sand\u201d. Said \u201cNo to seawalls\u201d and the audacious engineering project was scrapped.\nDecades earlier the council had committed to a \u201cbuyback\u201d of properties in the wave impact zone. A strategic retreat from the worst of it. A handful of properties were purchased, but the policy was abandoned in 2007, deemed as \u201cunsustainable\u201d into the future, estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars by the MP for Pittwater, Rob Stokes.\nIn 2013 Tony Abbott, member for Warringah, declared that a \u201cgreen army\u201d would build seawalls up and down the coast. The rising waters would be forever thwarted! Northern beaches mayors said \u201cyeah, nah\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of the direction councils are going in.\u201d\nThe science is in. And it\u2019s not that simple.\nThe new, amalgamated Northern Beaches council now has a policy of approving partial seawall reinforcements with costs largely borne by the homeowners themselves.\nIt\u2019s seen as unfair by some. No comfort to the many thousands of homeowners along Australia\u2019s vast, settled coastline whose precious properties (built in good faith) are now subject to the merciless forces of evermore destructive coastal surges due to climate change.\nSo, what\u2019s the answer?\nCoastal municipalities have been tackling the problem with a suite of measures. For some it will be a strategic retreat with assets that can be moved, for others it will be building partial seawalls, cliff reinforcement and revegetation. As is happening in other parts of the world, the costs of defence will sometimes be calculated as too onerous and properties will be abandoned to topple into the sea.\nWhat about pumping more sand to replenish the beach? I hear you ask. Good question!\nIt\u2019s what Surfrider Australia and others (including Rob Stokes) have been advocating for decades.\nAfter all, it\u2019s been done on the southern Gold Coast since 1976 after breakwalls built in the 60s on the Tweed River disturbed the natural flow of sand, leaving local beaches bare and bereft. Sand is pumped through pipes on to the beaches, to the point where many now complain there\u2019s too much of the stuff.\nHowever, the topography of threatened beaches in NSW is very different to the Goldie. Most of our eroding beaches are locked between headlands and sand is washed directly offshore to deep water, making restoration of our beaches a much more expensive and tricky proposition.\nIn October 2017, a technical report on sand nourishment was prepared by the University of NSW\u2019s Water Research Laboratory for the state Office of Environment and Heritage.\nIt notes that in the US the trend since the 1960s has been to move away from fixed structures for coastal protection. These days some 80%-93% of US Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 expenditure is directed to replenishing sand.\nThe detailed report covers the waterfront in its analysis: the optimum width of beaches that sun-lovers expect; the sourcing of suitable sand with the right grain size; how to get it on to our beaches by either road or via a variety of offshore sand dredges and the attendant environmental impacts.\nIt\u2019s well worth a read if you\u2019re wondering if sea-level rise is coming to a beach near you. Spoiler alert: it is.\nThere\u2019s increasing clamour from coastal experts for the NSW government to invest in a dredging vessel (or two) that could ply our coast and continually pump sand on to our most at-risk beaches.\nWe could name one Beachy McBeachface!\nRenting sand-pumping vessels is also an option \u2013 there\u2019s plenty of spare global capacity. The cost would be considerable, the oversight demanding and, no doubt, the science and technology is continually evolving. But the utter negligence of government(s) to not act, or even model future solutions, is unfathomable.\nThe sheer volume of reports commissioned and left mouldering in bottom drawers could in themselves be a handy bulwark in the face of gathering storms.\nAnd those increasingly ferocious maelstroms are coming. Leaving in their wake another round of useless hand-wringing and blame. Hearts and homes broken.\nAsk yourself, what is a beach worth? To our economy, tourism and our adored beach-going and surfing culture?\nOn Collaroy-Narrabeen, at least, the cost of doing something has been estimated.\nToo high a price to pay?\nThe loss of my beloved beach, and yours \u2013 and it could happen in our children\u2019s lifetime \u2013 is incalculable.\nIt\u2019s way past time to act.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oceans", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "share_count": "0", "description": "As Australian beaches succumb to destructive coastal surges due to climate change, Wendy Harmer considers the price of inaction at storm-battered Collaroy-Narrabeen", "date_published": {"$date": 1547658024000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1550203349000}, "authors": ["Wendy Harmer"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Australia news", "Environment", "Oceans", "Climate change", "New South Wales", "Sydney", "New South Wales politics"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/17/holding-back-the-tides-sydneys-battle-against-coastal-erosion", "og:description": "As Australian beaches succumb to destructive coastal surges due to climate change, Wendy Harmer considers the price of inaction at storm-battered Collaroy-Narrabeen", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9655aa65739b908155aae6991f374bd8f61bbe71/0_72_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=0830b55d38cac6804cd60c76aaeff8a5", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Holding back the tides: Sydney's battle against coastal erosion | Wendy Harmer"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f9297000fce30867a35b54787e9601c9003657a/0_0_3630_2418/master/3630.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=41856098f5d42f06b2953145c9fcd448", "width": "3630", "height": "2418", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f9297000fce30867a35b54787e9601c9003657a/0_0_3630_2418/master/3630.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6b0a6c824859d28731fb84e6d179f3e8", "description": "Surfers take advantage of a large swell at Collaroy on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches.

Enormous amounts of work have been done in numerous disciplines in my lifetime. Collectively it has provided us with very good ideas of what has happened through history going back millions of years. The carbon cycle is not one of the parameters having any significant causal role in determining the climate.\"\nYour last sentence is wrong. The carbon cycle was the major factor in causing the global warming which led to the end of the last glacial period or \"ice age\" over the 10,000 years of deglaciation between 19,000 and 9,000 years ago. The carbon cycle was also the cause of the early mid-Pliocene warming around 5 million years ago and the Palaeocene Eocene thermal maximum 55.5 million years ago.\n\"The current state of knowledge is that a significant number of periodic variables in the solar system and the sun itself drive the planet's climate.\"\nThe sun's energy output as a star has been increasing very slowly through the 4.543 billion years of the Earth's existence. This rate of increase is far to slow to have any noticeable impact on the Earth's climate in times spans of a couple of million to a couple of centuries over which which we have observed recent and Pleistocene climate change.\nPeriodic changes in the Earth's axial tilt, eccentricity of rotation and the point in the planets orbit where it is closest to the sun cause cycles in Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation (NHHLSI) over periods of 10,000 to 100,000 years. A peak in NHHLSI 19,000 years ago produced some melting of the North American and north Eurasian glacial continental ice sheets which at that time extended as far south as the regions of Yosemite, Chicago, New York, London, Milan and Belgrade.\nThis produced a large meltwater pulse in the North Atlantic shutting the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) which cools the Southern Ocean, which led to oxidation of oceanic oozes in the Southern Ocean increasing atmospheric CO2 resulting in global greenhouse warming over the next 10,000 years causing the Northern Hemisphere continental glacial ice sheets to retreat to their current levels.\nAtmospheric CO2 reached 280 ppm 8,000 years ago on the shoulder of that NHHLSI peak.

Just adjacent lies The Basin with its secret cunji island where we would prise the meat out of those little sea squirts to use as bait, and explore its wondrous underwater secrets revealed in long hours of snorkelling its reef which formed the natural eponymous basin, perfectly safe for children and infants to play on its shore; around the headland to the ocean pools with their chain fence - big one for grown ups and the smaller one for the kids, where once a man became stuck in the outlet when the pool was being emptied for maintenance and the episode was the talk of the locals for weeks. Whenever I see the glossy-leaf mock laurel, I am always reminded of hedges framing the main beach against the backdrop of the Children's Hospital where kids with polio and other handicapping conditions were brought to have some time in the sun, out on the sloping lawns, many of them in their beds. Those lawns were such fun to roll down on the way to the playground with its swings which seemed to be the longest in the world to my child's eyes. How many times we would all run to the surf club to get the lifesavers to rub us down with vinegar when we were stung by bluebottles; how often did we get rides in the long wooden surf boats riding great wave sets into the shore. How often were we amazed by the beautifully crafted sand sculptures created for the competitions run by the Daily Tellie. How many memorable evenings were spent around bonfires on the beach as spin the bottle was played and first boyfriends discovered. In later years how proud we were to know we learned to ride boards alongside the giants Midge Farrelly, Nat Young, Mark Warren and their mates in the days when there was room for everyone and we Gidget girls were still very much a novelty especially if we paddled out to surf the bombora off Long Reef\u2026", "recommendation_count": "2", "in_reply_to": "124754022", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "i missed the sound of the waves at home", "effect": "could not get to sleep for ages there"}]}, {"id": "124758472", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1547700674000}, "author": "Erik Frederiksen", "author_id": "15131989", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\"three studies have found evidence that the threat of higher seas is also undermining coastal property values as home buyers \u2014 particularly investors \u2014 begin the retreat to higher ground.\"\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/sea-level-rise-is-eroding-home-value-and-owners-might-not-even-know-it/2018/08/20/ff63fa8c-a0d5-11e8-93e3-24d1703d2a7a_story.html?utm_term=.f8eba54ca57e\nBut yeah, that's with what, around 8 inches of global mean sea level rise.

Some years back the NSW government passed a law that prevented local councils from approving Development Applications (DAs) on any land considered 'at risk' in then-current models for sea-level rise by 2100. It was taken to affect all land within 1m elevation of standard (1970) sea-level in NSW. It was known that this approach would 'cap' the liability - lessening the value of assets that would eventually be lost to rising sea-levels. As houses have estimated life-times of under 50 years, by prohibiting the building (and re-building) of such houses in areas to be underwater in 90 years time, it was thought that the 'eventual loss' would be minimal, when retreat became the only option.\nThe problem was that the Liberal-voting Northern Beaches of Sydney complained vociferously through their Liberal political representatives. That may seem strange, given that it is the Liberals who are committed to climate-denialism, but insisting upon one's right to build an even grander home on low-lying land is really just another form of climate-denialism. So the NSW Liberal Party, in response to objections from their Sydney's Northern Beaches' Liberal counterparts, overturned the law, leaving NSW with NO POLICY for rising sea-levels under the Liberals.\nIt is very similar to when Malcolm Turnbull said that if one wanted to address climate, a market-based mechanism (such as carbon pricing) would be the best way... then the Liberal Party fought tooth-and-nail to prevent any such pricing mechanism, and indeed overturned an existing/working one (introduced by Gillard). In the same way, the NSW Liberal Party knew the right path to plan for rising sea-levels, then overturned their own law on the matter, to allow/encourage climate-denialism.\nI'm sure there's a lesson there somewhere!", "recommendation_count": "19", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "124754751", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1547683108000}, "author": "Panjandrum1", "author_id": "4364000", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "The most amazing thing about the beach at Collaroy-Narrabeen is there are still people who think buildings backing onto it can be saved.

Wylfa\u2019s death means a second Hitachi plant planned for Oldbury, Gloucestershire, is doomed, too.\nTogether the three projects would have provided 15% of today\u2019s electricity demand.\nThat begs the question: is it time to rethink plans for new nuclear or redouble our nuclear efforts? With the cost of wind, solar and batteries dropping rapidly, have renewables and smart technologies matured enough to fill the gap?\nWhat is not in question is the UK\u2019s need for more low-carbon power. Coal and old nuclear plants are shutting in the 2020s and tough climate targets are looming.\nThe Green party and groups such as Greenpeace advocate ditching nuclear in favour of more renewables, energy efficiency and flexibility through imports, batteries and other technologies.\nHowever, most energy industry experts think the future involves some new nuclear. The government has already restated its commitment to new nuclear power.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see a low-carbon energy system in the future which has no new nuclear,\u201d says George Day, the head of policy and regulation at the government-funded Energy Systems Catapult.\n\u201cIf you try to rely on just renewables and storage, without carbon capture and storage or nuclear, you are looking at a very challenging transition and one that is more costly than a balanced mix [of supplies].\u201d\nAll of National Grid\u2019s four future energy scenarios envisage some new nuclear, although the amounts differ considerably.\nPeter Atherton, an analyst at Cornwall Insight, said it was hard to imagine an energy system without the baseload power \u2013 or continuous electricity supply \u2013 provided by nuclear.\n\u201cThere is a school of thought that says baseload is a 20th century thing. They might be right \u2013 but it would be a big call by government to bet baseload won\u2019t be a thing by 2025.\u201d\nThe government has already downgraded the amount of new nuclear it expects to be built in the future. It assumes 13 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity by 2035, implying three further nuclear power stations in addition to the 3.2GW plant at Hinkley.\nThere are now only two firms in the running, which are both involved in plans for two new plants.\nFrench state-owned EDF Energy, which is behind Hinkley, wants to start building a carbon copy of that project at Sizewell, on the Suffolk coast, in 2021. Chinese state-owned CGN, meanwhile, is accelerating work on a Chinese-designed reactor for Bradwell in Essex, with the aim of being operational around 2030.\nHitachi\u2019s withdrawal suggests the financing model used for Hinkley, and proposed for Wylfa, is dead. The government will likely junk that approach \u2013 of offering a guaranteed price of power for 35 years \u2013 for an alternative known as the \u201cregulated asset base\u201d (RAB) model.\nThe Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has created a whole division to develop RAB, where a regulator would set a fixed sum for the power station\u2019s costs and fixed returns for the developer, paid for by energy billpayers or taxpayers. Officials are assessing RAB\u2019s viability, with a decision expected this year.\nBut critics say the approach loads the risk of nuclear plant construction delays, such as those seen in France and Finland, on citizens. Returns would also be paid for years before any electricity was generated.\nEDF Energy backs the RAB model and the Chinese have said they would look at it. The influential government adviser Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at Oxford University, has called it \u201cplausible and preferable\u201d to the Hinkley approach if the UK wants new nuclear. Day believes it could produce the power stations that ministers want.\nLabour, which is pro-nuclear, has branded the approach risky and reckless but has not put forward an alternative.\nGiven the uncertainty over new nuclear, could the UK manage without it? Maybe. The obvious route is a lot more renewable power capacity than currently planned.\nThe government\u2019s climate change advisers last year hiked up the amount of renewables they expected four years ago, to 45-60% of electricity supplies by 2030, up from 40-55% previously. Both are a big increase from the 33% level today.\nThe Committee on Climate Change said there is evidence the energy system could cope with as much as 60% of supplies coming from intermittent renewables.\nFilling the 9.2GW-sized hole left by Moorside, Wylfa and Oldbury would require 14GW of offshore wind power, according to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank. That is equivalent to more than 20 of the world\u2019s biggest offshore windfarm, which consists of 87 turbines.\nAccording to Atherton, the only way renewables and storage could plausibly fill the nuclear gap would be to \u201cspend a vast amount of money on saturating the UK with offshore wind\u201d. That could end up with enough turbines in enough different locations to replicate the \u201calways-on\u201d nature of nuclear.\nLarge-scale batteries will help with the variable nature of renewables and are expanding fast. But they will not address the fact that electricity demand is much higher in winter than summer, or solve long windless spells.\nThe other big techno fix in the arsenal of low-carbon energy options is carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, many years of government efforts to kickstart it failed and ministers have switched their focus away from CCS for power stations to CCS for industrial uses.\nDay said gas power stations with CCS still looked \u201cpretty promising\u201d but significant policy changes would be needed to enable firms to invest in it.\nOthers, however, are more dismissive. Atherton said: \u201cPeople have been working on CCS gas for 20 years and nobody has got within a mile of it yet. People will tell you the technology works \u2026 that doesn\u2019t mean I can do it on a budget.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/nuclearpower", "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy-storage", "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/energy", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/analysis"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Despite recent scrapping of three plants, experts still feel the energy has stake in future", "date_published": {"$date": 1547724230000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1547748302000}, "authors": ["Adam Vaughan"], "article_section": "Business", "article_tags": ["Energy industry", "Energy", "Nuclear power", "Business", "Environment", "Wales", "UK news", "Renewable energy", "Energy storage", "Energy", "Technology", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "National Grid", "Hinkley Point C", "Utilities", "Climate change", "Carbon capture and storage (CCS)", "Gas", "Gas", "Hitachi", "Toshiba", "Japan", "Technology sector", "Commodities", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/17/does-the-hitachi-decision-mean-the-end-of-the-uks-nuclear-dream", "og:description": "Despite recent scrapping of three plants, experts still feel the energy has stake in future", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d977cb26f2ad2d91ed4b411583d8b5ab0c77f6f/0_169_3286_1971/master/3286.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=d81942e0dd3471d579e5fd0f2aa1a705", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Does Hitachi decision mean the end of UK's nuclear ambitions?"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d977cb26f2ad2d91ed4b411583d8b5ab0c77f6f/0_169_3286_1971/master/3286.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=28ac0d611906781aa548c65fe65fb882", "width": "3286", "height": "1971", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d977cb26f2ad2d91ed4b411583d8b5ab0c77f6f/0_169_3286_1971/master/3286.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8af6083cfc560fb03e53f7f375b96a92", "description": "Artist\u2019s impression of the planned nuclear power station at Bradwell, Essex.

Before the referendum, civil servants warned that such a task \u2013 untangling 40 years of legal agreements, ripping out a delicate web of connections that had become embedded \u2013 would consume all their energies. Naturally, their warnings were dismissed as Project Fear. But even the head of Vote Leave, Dominic Cummings, before he took on the form of Benedict Cumberbatch, conceded via Twitter that leaving the European Union would present the British state with the \u201chardest job since beating Nazis\u201d.\nJust think of what else we could have done with all that time and money, including the \u00a34bn we\u2019re spending to guard against the entirely avoidable and self-inflicted calamity of a no-deal crash-out from the EU. The effort we could have made for jobs or housing, or to repair the damage inflicted by austerity; the work that could have been done to improve life for those left behind by three decades of change, globalisation and automation. But Whitehall didn\u2019t have the bandwidth. Governments might be able to walk and chew gum at the same time, but walking while shooting yourself in both feet \u2013 that, it turns out, is impossible.\nIt\u2019s not just the machinery of state that has seized up since June 2016, all but paralysed by Brexit. It\u2019s affected what you might call the attention economy too: both the news media and its consumers, those who shape the collective conversation and those who take part in it. So enveloped are we in Brexit that we hardly have the space to contemplate anything else. Our gaze is turned inward, and we can barely see what\u2019s going on around us.\nIf news bulletins, front pages and social media feeds were your guide, you\u2019d think climate change had gone away, quietly resolved while we were obsessing over the Northern Ireland backstop. Not so. It barely made a ripple, but last week came word that the oceans are warming at a rate some 40% faster than previously understood. Remember, it\u2019s the seas that absorb most of the extra heat going into the climate system, and the dangers posed by a rise in ocean temperature are clear and present, whether it\u2019s fuelling ever more extreme storms and hurricanes or increasing sea levels, thereby flooding low-lying areas and rendering potentially hundreds of millions homeless. It\u2019s just one more sign, along with melting ice-sheets or the drying up of the Rhine, Europe\u2019s most critical waterway \u2013 where low water is rendering whole stretches impassable \u2013 that while the government tears itself apart trying to fulfil a nostalgic fantasy of taking back control, global temperatures are getting relentlessly out of control.\nPerhaps it\u2019s harsh to blame Brexit for our apathy about climate change, which long predates the 2016 referendum. But even those subjects that we used to discuss barely get a look-in now. The war in Syria rages on. This week, as MPs were debating their confidence in Theresa May, the UN reported that at least 15 infants, including eight babies, had died for lack of medical care and from extreme cold. Most of their families had fled the fighting to seek refuge on the Jordanian border. It\u2019s a reminder that the world has not stopped turning just because we\u2019ve stopped looking.\nMore pertinent for Britons, perhaps, given our government\u2019s still warm relations with the country, is that Saudi Arabia\u2019s dirty war in Yemen goes on, causing what the UN has repeatedly called the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disaster. It is a war so dirty that even the perpetrators are victims: the Saudis are recruiting young survivors of the horrors of Darfur to serve as child soldiers on the front line.\nIn the 1980s, pictures of starving children in Ethiopia prompted global outrage and determination to act. Now, footage from Yemen of emaciated babies and wizened toddlers, and a toll of 85,000 children dead through hunger, induces no more than a shrug. And yet, the famine in Yemen should offend us morally at least as much as the suffering of three decades ago, for this catastrophe is entirely manmade, and therefore avoidable.\nPerhaps it\u2019s giving ourselves too much credit, but I\u2019d like to think that, were we not so distracted by the customs union and Norway plus, we would at least have registered that China is currently holding an estimated 1 million Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang region in what seem to be Mao-style \u201cre-education camps\u201d. Forced to listen to hours of Communist party propaganda aimed at their \u201crehabilitation and redemption\u201d, inmates are held in squalid conditions and subject to brutal interrogations. There are reports of prisoners taking what, in their despair, they conclude is the only way out: suicide. One former captive describes being held still in a \u201cmetal device\u201d that kept him entirely rigid. That rather puts our debates about \u201cfree movement\u201d into perspective, doesn\u2019t it?\nThe Chinese authorities call these places, which satellite photographs reveal have dramatically expanded, \u201cvocational training centres\u201d. But they are behind barbed wire and high perimeter walls. The authorities say they inoculate \u201ctrainees\u201d against the lure of terrorism. The truth is they represent state persecution of a reviled religious minority. The historical resonances are obvious, and should have provoked fierce condemnation from our leaders. But they, and we, are all too busy.\nEven those stories that not long ago commanded our attention now struggle to be noticed. Last year, Israel\u2019s use of live ammunition against protesters at the Gaza frontier rightly made big news, as did the presence of antisemitism within Labour\u2019s ranks. You might imagine both issues had faded away, given how rarely they\u2019re now discussed. But the Gaza protests continue and the anguish of daily life there has not receded: witness, by way of an exception, Mishal Husain\u2019s BBC report from a hospital struggling to function.\nMeanwhile, every day brings fresh evidence that within Labour\u2019s ranks there remain some deeply suspect attitudes toward Jews: note the Labour councillor in Fife who reckoned concerns about anti-Jewish racism were all part of a Mossad-orchestrated plot \u2013 in other words, a Jewish conspiracy. She was briefly suspended but is now safely back in the Labour fold.\nOr you could look to the United States, where the former Trump campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has admitted sharing polling data with the Russians \u2013 as slam-dunk a proof of collusion as you could wish for. So conclusive is it that Trump\u2019s own lawyer, the once credible Rudy Giuliani, has reversed his previous line of defence: now he all but admits there was collusion, but says Trump himself was not involved.

After years of being worried of the tainted brush of high interest rates and recession, it embraced their reforms and dared the Coalition to run its scare campaign about interest rates and economic management in the face of concerns about economic ructions occurring overseas.\nSo wedded was the Coalition to these scare tactics that, in the run-up to the 2013 election, it was still saying interest rates would always be lower under the Liberal party, even though the cash rate was then over 4% points lower than it had been when the Howard government lost office.\nIt\u2019s a good reminder that reality will never stop the scare campaign, and that the Coalition is very slow to change \u2013 it will keep banging out its fear until well after anyone has stopped caring or listening.\n2007 was also a good year for the ALP to push the issue of climate change. The nation was in drought and the push to reduce emissions and be active on the international stage was prominent.\nThis year economic ructions overseas are again present and so too is a drought and the need to take action on climate change. And where the 2007 opposition stopped being afraid of the economic legacy of the last ALP government so too should the current opposition not run from the climate change policies of the Gillard government. Because, as interest rates showed, regardless of the ALP\u2019s policy, you can be sure the Coalition will keep shouting about carbon tax bogeymen.\nIt\u2019s always amazing how things repeat themselves. Now, a decade on from the GFC, the worrying signs from overseas are there again just as we see the ALP looking set to take office.\nThe yield for US five-year treasury bonds is now lower than for one-year bonds \u2013 suggesting investors believe the economy is going to get worse.\nThis doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate than the US will go into a recession, it\u2019s just that when bond yields acted this way at the end of the 1960s, in the mid-1970s, the early 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, and before the GFC, a recession followed every time.\nBut hey, I\u2019m sure Donald Trump will respond in a calm and well-thought-out way.\nAnd while we remain more dependent upon China than the US, it too is showing signs of concern. The Chinese government has responded to the ructions of the trade war with the US by injecting $83bn into its financial system to avoid a credit crunch. That our largest trading partner is having to inject a record amount of money into its financial system does not exactly bring Marie Kondo levels of joy.\nThe Commonwealth Bank\u2019s senior currency strategist, Joseph Capurso, suggests that \u201cChina\u2019s economic miracle is over\u201d and that its annual GDP growth will fall to around 4% over the next decade rather than the current average level of 6.5%.\nThis does not mean Australia is about to head into a recession \u2013 we are a very long way from such a thing. But it does serve as a reminder that projections of glorious revenue and growth that were found in the midyear economic and fiscal outlook over the next 10 years are rather hopeful.\nIt is now so long since the last recession that no one under 45 has really experienced it in their working life. Such a long stretch of time can lead to complacency and the type of dumb commentary that suggests \u201cwe need a recession to ...\u201d\nRecessions wreak destruction on families and lives. To measure them I prefer to focus on employment rather than GDP growth.\nIn the 1990s recession the percentage of the adult population employed fell 3.2% points in 18 months \u2013 the equivalent of 400,000 fewer people in work.\nIn recessions, masses of people in their 50s lose work and never return to the labour force. The overall unemployment rate rose from 6% at the start of 1990 to above 10% within two years; for men aged 55-64 it went from 6% to 14% in four years.\nIn the space of a year, real household disposable income fell on average by 2%.\nRecessions are horrific. And while we should not talk ourselves into such a negative condition, the chances are that whoever is in power for the next three to five years will likely have to deal with an international economic slowdown. That does focus the mind, and yet what should also be at the forefront of our brains is another issue high on the agenda in 2007 \u2013 climate change.\nBack in 2007 we were suffering from a drought, there was a push to reduce emissions and competing ways to do it as well as a desire from within the LNP to ignore international agreements.\nClimate change policy became an election issue in 2007 because it fit with the new versus old difference of Rudd and Howard, and people could feel the change in the drought and heatwaves. Now people feel it still and also see it in the dying fish and terrible water management of the federal and the New South Wales governments. And they can see it in the division and idiocy that the government displays on climate change.\nClimate change is now an issue that doesn\u2019t so much differentiate old versus new thinking as it does between parties that are able to think with those utterly incapable of doing so.\nAnd on this issue the ALP, like it did in 2007 with economics, should embrace its past.\nForget stale arguments over whether or not Rudd or the Greens did the right thing with the ETS. The Gillard government did introduce a carbon price \u2013 and it worked. It brought with it the long-term stability companies and their lobbyists such as the BCA now say they so desire. It reduces emissions.\nThe carbon price did not lose the election. It was lost because the ALP was a basket case of a party so riven with discord that the electorate voted for someone so disliked as was Tony Abbott to be prime minister.\nFor now, the ALP is adopting a measured approach to emissions \u2013 focusing on electricity but fearfully doing all it can not to utter carbon and price (let alone tax) in the same sentence. And maybe a copy of the Gillard carbon price is not achievable now, but they should not cower \u2013 because regardless what they do the Coalition will cry \u201ccarbon tax\u201d.\nNow, like 2007, is a time in which the electorate can feel the need for action. It needs to be grasped. And it is not a time to be fearful. Given the economic ructions accruing, the easy way is to play safe and seek caution, but that will achieve nothing except someone in a decade\u2019s time noting once again we\u2019re in an election year during a time of drought and a country without a decent climate change policy.\nOnly by then it will be far too late.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tax-australia", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/business-australia", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "On climate change, Labor should embrace its past rather than be overwhelmed by fear", "date_published": {"$date": 1547924422000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1547961471000}, "authors": ["Greg Jericho"], "article_section": "Global", "article_tags": ["Australian economy", "Climate change", "Tax", "Australia news", "Labor party", "Liberal party", "Australian politics", "Business (Australia)", "Climate change"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2019/jan/19/a-global-economic-slowdown-is-on-the-horizon-so-can-labor-put-principle-before-politics", "og:description": "On climate change, Labor should embrace its past rather than be overwhelmed by fear", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81a8ff4dc1690360515bff79411acd9b2d4b1691/0_342_5280_3167/master/5280.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=27c2298185dc4d6a207c25b5125a1e37", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "A global economic slowdown is on the horizon \u2013 so can Labor put principle before politics? | Greg Jericho"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81a8ff4dc1690360515bff79411acd9b2d4b1691/0_342_5280_3167/master/5280.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b5c27a91ea9b7d2cda8983d9eb22ab83", "width": "5280", "height": "3167", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81a8ff4dc1690360515bff79411acd9b2d4b1691/0_342_5280_3167/master/5280.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b2d2060b76a91fcece8b1ea62adddb7e", "description": "Adopting a measured approach to climate emissions: the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, while on his bus tour of Queensland.\nPhotograph: Dan Peled/AAP"}}], "date_comments_parsed": {"$date": 1556125395369}, "comments": [{"id": "124967970", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548167369000}, "author": "R_Ambrose_Raven", "author_id": "12554246", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "I feel sure, FelixKruell, that as a financial adviser you would continue to do well.

I agree that the backing bending the currency can be aggregated production (which includes stored wealth as well as new production) however disagree that this is solely a factor of available working citizens. Given currency is just a claim on wealth increases in investments can impact it. In addition available citizens arn\u2019t the only limiting factor as resources, capital and production facilities are also required. MMT is subject to all these real word factors. \nI haven\u2019t pointed out a block in production as a cause of inflation - merely the obvious fact that more money chasing same amount of goods and services will be inflationary. It doesn\u2019t matter if the spend is reckless or not (although made worse by reckless spending).\nTaxation doesn\u2019t reduce the money supply unless it is used as a form of quantitative tightening (so called) by removing currency from the system by shrinking central bank balance sheets. When the government just taxes money out of the private sector and then puts it straight back (just a transfer payment ultimately) it isn\u2019t even really reducing the velocity of money but just changing it\u2019s location.\nThere is no free lunch - and MMT will end up being inflationary if the money supply is increased faster than the productive economy is. Taxation in a deficit spending situation won\u2019t solve that problem. Whether or not the government is able to ensure that the economy grows faster than the money supply through a deficit spending MMT model is a different question - obviously I don\u2019t believe they can.\nAgree totally with your comment about governments inflating asset bubbles - my views on that are very clear.", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "124876035", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "124947804", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548117903000}, "author": "Peggy Sanders", "author_id": "15722162", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "https://www.enhancetv.com.au/video/national-press-club-address-brendan-o-connor/55321", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "124947308", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "124948022", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548119155000}, "author": "Peggy Sanders", "author_id": "15722162", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "CoralSeeNQ.

They tied up Turnbull. They will tie up Morrison and they will continue the dumb-arsed policies that the likes of Abbott, Dutton, Kelly and all those other right-wing numb nuts who tossed out Turnbull. They have stifled action on climate change. They have stifled action on reducing emissions. They want to build more coal fired power stations. They are happy to leave refugees locked up indefinitely in camps Australia built on neighbouring island nations. They favour mates with largess at the expense of the vulnerable and disadvantaged. And they would rather use slogans, stunts and demonization instead of having sensible discussions about what actually needs to be done. Instead they are arrogant, abusive and ignorant. They use fear and division and are aided and abetted by a compliant right wing media to maintain power. They have no respect for others, have no understanding, and the idea of compromise is totally alien to them. When deciding who to vote for, don't listen to Morrison, listen to what the likes of Dutton, Kelly, Joyce, Abbott and the other LNP right-wing numb nuts have said and done, because that is where the true heart of the modern LNP lies. A vote for them, means a vote for more of the same.\nAs for Labor, while many of its principles are sound and try to pursue them by giving priority to health, education, reducing emissions, building more renewable energy generating capacity, wanting to treat refugees humanely, wanting constructive conversations about what needs to be done, trying to treat vulnerable people fairly and respectfully, and be more inclusive rather than being divisive, preferring hope to the LNP's division and despair; Labor is defined by the LNP's hard right's nasty wedge politics which is designed to generate fear and division in the electorate rather than to actually propose something worthwhile. Labor has to spend more time trying to avoid being wedged than to clearly propose well defined policies based on its principles. Because Labor rarely gets power in its own right, Labor can also be wedged by the Greens in their effort to remain relevant. So the trouble with Labor is, its position can be compromised by the Greens and by the demonizing and deceptive politics of the LNP hard right. \nAs such Labor is the only true party of the centre. There is no centre-right of the LNP because the hard-right holds sway. As for the Greens, they often promote policies that while idealistic and may be needed, are not pragmatic nor realistic in their \"when do we want it, we want it now\" attitude with little idea of compromise and understanding of the immediate impacts upon ordinary people's lives and the gradual changes that are actually needed to ultimately realise what they want without adversely impacting others.\nAs for the fringe parties, One Nation is generally made up of disaffected right wing voters of the LNP or a few former right wing Labor voters for a party that is no longer relevant for them. They mostly from the extreme right and mainly focus only one or two negative issues related to race or migration due to their disaffection. They are motivated by all the negative bitches they have about the nation, because their prejudices lay the blame for their condition upon others of a different racial or cultural identity. They just don't get multiculturalism even though the nation has been multicultural since its founding considering the eternal indigenous community that has always lived here. On the other hand, Bob Katter, while being somewhat eccentric politically, is probably the ideal representative for his electorate, because in reality, he is one of them. He is someone, a larrikin, who they can identify with. The fact is, Bob gets them and their concerns.\nSuch is the political stuff up that is Australian politics at the moment. In any other nation the issues that divide us may have led to civil war. Fortunately, the issues that we have in common keep us from doing so. The LNP has to go. They have stifled the nation for too long. Time is needed for a Government that is more progressive, that will not harm us, and always has our best interests at heart so that we can best face the future. The LNP over the last 10 years have shown they are not up to the task. It is time to give another government a go. However, a right-wing fringe party or a left-wing mob of idealists are not it.

What a mixed field it is this year ! There have been mares going lame, horses being scratched, jockeys retiring from racing altogether, horses being retired from racing altogether, jockeys refusing to mount their nominated horses, and a few previously redundant horses and jockeys getting set for a comeback.\nCasting my binoculars over the field then.....what can we see.....\nWhere's Desperate Scotty? There he is over in a corner looking very underdone, underwhelmed and under-confident. No happy-clapping of his hooves, there....Nearby there's Julie's Questionmark standing close -but not toooo close to Desperate Scotty.She's looking in pretty good shapes -especially with her sparkling, bright red nail polish on her hooves. Wants to stand out in the crowd and make a statement, does our Julie.Just making his entrance back into the field is Bonzo Barnyard, hoping to make a big dash and splash at the finish line. One can always hope, Bonzo....Not to be outdone, there's Tony's Tantrum, flaring his nostrils, stamping his hooves, blowing smoke out of his ears and his backside as usual. Skittish and irritable is our Tony. He's not called Tony's Tantrum for nothing....And yes! There HE is....standing tall and rigid among the crowd, stony-faced, someone who can give the Easter Island statues a run for their money is none other than Duttons-Mutton.  The serious money is betting that Queensland's Mutton will crash out at the final run to the line.\nMeanwhile, in another area of the enclosure, Bill's Great Expectations is looking very solid. His jockey is sitting very calm and confident in the saddle. The serious money is backing him as the favourite in the big race...Standing next to him is Talented Tanya looking very trim and sharp and enthusiastic. \"It's Time\" she's snorting. \" IT'S TIME\" !Standing next to her is Albo's Reward, a gallant, courageous thoroughbred with stamina if ever you saw one. He looks match-fit and all ready to race.....\nAnd Hallelujah! Look who's back! Why it's none other than Quackie's Bambie, a mare you can NEVER ignore ! The unique and colourful mouth-from-the-south. Have no doubt, folks.....Quackie will make absolutely sure that she's both seen - AND heard....And....who would have BELIEVED it ! Also making his surprise return is that larger-than-life, mouth-from-the-north, Tricky Clive. He;s sure to have some tricks up his sleeve and a lot to say. (Whether anyone takes any notice of course, is another story)....\nAnd before the field is finalised with all the horses locked into their barriers and their stalls, there'll be some fresh faces from new places (we hope) to make this year's big race very lively....\nSo hold on to your horses folks and hold tight to your betting slips.

For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it \u2013 and\u00a0the elaborate system of badges\u00a0reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy.\nFor critics, \u201cDavos man\u201d is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all\u00a0a big waste of time.Who is there?\nMore than 2,500 people \u2013 business leaders, world leaders, diplomats and the odd celebrity, such as Matt Damon \u2013 will fly in for the 49th annual Davos meeting. Most delegates are men, and although the forum boasts delegates from more than 100 countries, most hail from western\u00a0Europe, followed by the US. Sir David Attenborough is one of the most notable attendees in 2019, while Donald Trump, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron all pulled out at short notice to focus on more pressing issues at home.\nThat stability allowed businesses to grow, nations to co-operate and people to share ideas, Attenborough explained, before warning sombrely: \u201cIn the space of my lifetime, all that has changed.\n\u201cThe Holocene has ended. The Garden of Eden is no more. We have changed the world so much that scientists say we are in a new geological age: the Anthropocene, the age of humans,\u201d he declared.\nIn a stark warning to the world leaders and business chiefs flocking to the WEF this week, Attenborough warned that the only conditions that humans have known are changing fast.\n\u201cWe need to move beyond guilt or blame, and get on with the practical tasks at hand.\u201d\nA survey conducted before the WEF found that environmental threats are now the biggest danger to the global economy, and concern is mounting that co-operation between countries on the issue is breaking down.\nAttenborough admitted that even he has been surprised by the speed of the damage caused to the environment during his career making TV programmes showing life on earth.\nIn response, Attenborough \u2013 recently voted Britain\u2019s most trustworthy celebrity \u2013 said humans must use their expert problem-solving skills. \u201cIf people can truly understand what is at stake, I believe they will give permission for business and governments to get on with the practical solutions,\u201d he told the WEF.\nGet it right, he argued, and humans can create a world with clean air and water, unlimited energy and sustainable fish stocks, but only if decisive action is taken now.\n\u201cOver the next two years there will be United Nations decisions on climate change, sustainable development and a new deal for nature. Together these will form our species\u2019 plan for a route through the Anthropocene.\n\u201cWhat we do now, and in the next few years, will profoundly affect the next few thousand years,\u201d he added.\nSpeaking to journalists after his speech, Attenborough warned that economic models needed to change. \u201cGrowth is going to come to an end, either suddenly or in a controlled way,\u201d he explained, citing the old joke that anyone who thinks you can have infinite growth in finite circumstances is \u201ceither a madman or an economist\u201d.\nHe is also hopeful that he can change hearts and minds during his trip to Davos, pointing out that some delegates have more power than a nation state. \u201cThe enormity of the problem has only just dawned on quite a lot of people ... Unless we sort ourselves out in the next decade or so we are dooming our children and our grandchildren to an appalling future.\u201d\nBefore he spoke, Attenborough received the Crystal award from the WEF for his work. Saudi Arabia\u2019s first female film-maker, Haifaa al-Mansour, and conductor Marin Alsop of the Baltimore Symphony were also honoured for their work.\nPrince William is due to appear with Attenborough to discuss environmental issues at the WEF on Tuesday.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos-2019", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Human activity has created a new era yet climate change can be stopped, says naturalist", "date_published": {"$date": 1548098399000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1551702791015}, "authors": ["Graeme Wearden"], "article_section": "Television & radio", "article_tags": ["David Attenborough", "Climate change", "Science", "UK news", "Climate change", "Environment", "Television & radio", "Business", "Davos 2019"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/21/david-attenborough-tells-davos-the-garden-of-eden-is-no-more", "og:description": "Human activity has created a new era yet climate change can be stopped, says naturalist", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c19771b52d5495f05958a5b1c9dd7303332a8f/114_152_3886_2332/master/3886.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=d5ac53a45bce85d9664b52a276bdf172", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "David Attenborough tells Davos: \u2018The Garden of Eden is no more\u2019"}, "headline": "l"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07aa3a2c3613145ed8d14"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/22/its-something-very-precious-painting-oceans-to-showcase-climate-change", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "When the American artist Danielle Eubank visited the Indian Ocean in Mozambique, she was taken back by the garbage. \u201cThere\u2019s pollution everywhere, in the water, on the beach, baby strollers and plastic mats, plastic bags, plastic bottles,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re everywhere.\u201d\nThe artist has painted roughly 200 bodies of water in 22 countries, from the Arctic to the Mediterranean, for her 20-year project One Artist Five Oceans. The goal is to raise awareness about ocean pollution and climate change.\n\u201cI have always been a huge environmentalist, I\u2019ve screamed at people and tried to get the message across in so many ways,\u201d said Eubank, on the phone from her Los Angeles studio. \u201cI prefer to show people, \u2018Hey look, this is our world, let\u2019s take care of it. Don\u2019t destroy it.\u2019 It\u2019s something very precious, something we all share.\u201d\nOn 28 February, Eubank embarks on a long journey south to the Antarctic Circle for the last leg of her ocean painting project. She will depart from Ushuaia, Argentina, to the Antarctic Peninsula to paint the Southern Ocean.\nIt all started 20 years ago when Eubank was visiting the Do\u00f1ana national park in Huelva, in the south of Spain, where she spent her days painting on the beach with her back to the water.\n\u201cComing from California, I abhorred water paintings,\u201d said Eubank. \u201cFor me, I could only see ideas other people had before me \u2013 crashing waves, dolphins and mermaids, I just couldn\u2019t get into it.\u201d\nBut that all changed when, after spending days painting the park, she turned to the Atlantic Ocean. \u201cI painted the dunes and got fed up and turned around at sunrise, in the morning,\u201d she said. \u201cI was faced with the water and nothing else. From that first point on, that\u2019s all I wanted to paint \u2013 water.\u201d\nShe painted the Arctic Ocean from Svalbard, Norway. \u201cWhat I noticed about the Arctic, is that the polar ice caps were melting in October,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rate the oceans are warming up is the most frightening thing I can think of. Oceans are getting warmer.\u201d\nWhen she painted the Indian Ocean, she noticed the illustrious hues. \u201cThe Indian Ocean is the most beautiful, it has the most difference in colors,\u201d said Eubank. \u201cIt has times when its more golden and aqua, at times. There\u2019s a lot of variations.\u201d\nThough her series started in Spain, Eubank considers the Pacific the ocean her \u201chome ocean. \u201cI grew up in northern California near the coast,\u201d she said.\nHaving sailed the seven seas and (so far) four oceans, Eubank has visited most of these bodies of water by sea. Not in any kind of boats, but by old-fashioned ships, including one called the Borobudur, a wooden replica of an eighth-century vessel. In a sense, Eubank is honoring a time-worn tradition.\n\u201cExplorers all had expedition artists; look at Captain Cook, he had William Hodges,\u201d she said. \u201cBack then, because people didn\u2019t have cameras, they would take artists or do sketches themselves to document what they saw.\u201d\nSailing by in a showy replica of an ancient boat does get a lot of attention. \u201cPrivate boats would wave as they passed by,\u201d said Eubank. \u201cWhen we would come into port, sometimes there would be lines of people along the quay.\u201d\nAs she packs for Antarctica, Eubank will be painting with oils, pencils and below-zero ink in her sketchbooks, which will be clipped to her jacket so they don\u2019t fly into the ocean. \u201cIt hopefully will help people look at things in a new way,\u201d she said.\nThe United Nations Environmental Program claims that 80% of all marine pollution is plastic, and that every year, over 8m tons of plastic ends up in the oceans. Apparently by 2050, oceans will carry more plastic than fish, just as the world\u2019s oceans keep getting warmer.\nUpon returning from Antarctica, Eubank will put together a book of all her ocean paintings and open an exhibition of selected paintings on 24 May at Kwan Fong Gallery in Thousand Oaks, California.\nInstead of painting piles of garbage, she also hopes her viewers will relish the beauty of these bodies of water, as well.\n\u201cOur own actions affect what goes into the oceans,\u201d said Eubank. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we can do; like if everyone ate less meat each week, rode a bike, walked and took public transit, it would make an impact. Hang dry your clothes. People are surprised how easy it is to help the oceans and help the climate.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/painting", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features"], "description": "As part of a 20-year-project, artist Danielle Eubank is travelling the world to paint every ocean to show the damaging effects humanity is having on the environment", "date_published": {"$date": 1548147613000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548172763000}, "authors": ["Nadja Sayej"], "article_section": "Art and design", "article_tags": ["Art", "Climate change", "Art and design", "Culture", "Environment", "Painting"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/22/its-something-very-precious-painting-oceans-to-showcase-climate-change", "og:description": "As part of a 20-year-project, artist Danielle Eubank is travelling the world to paint every ocean to show the damaging effects humanity is having on the environment", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d5395e24ddbcd33afa0fa9a8b4983d976fe20b8/0_54_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=cb9aa8626e179477de02e5b5bcfa26f5", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "'It's something very precious': painting oceans to showcase climate change"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d5395e24ddbcd33afa0fa9a8b4983d976fe20b8/0_54_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=984acc2be948c82aa02a58ef6aa7e8c5", "width": "1500", "height": "900", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d5395e24ddbcd33afa0fa9a8b4983d976fe20b8/0_54_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42dac8794afd07ec20cc69fc4b794827", "description": "Danielle Eubank in 2003.\nPhotograph: Courtesy of the artist"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95fd5721390fe4d3d53b3d274cd760f2d182fe3a/0_0_1500_1000/master/1500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b18db3d38c7fc20760873245e7517059", "width": "1500", "height": "1000", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95fd5721390fe4d3d53b3d274cd760f2d182fe3a/0_0_1500_1000/master/1500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7ac9ba8f0c2ca0117f4a2ad6a6c70d85", "description": "Danielle Eubank in 2014.

The 92-year-old broadcaster added that it was \u201cdifficult to overstate\u201d the urgency of the environmental crisis.\nDavos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it \u2013 and\u00a0the elaborate system of badges\u00a0reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy.\nFor critics, \u201cDavos man\u201d is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all\u00a0a big waste of time.Who is there?\nMore than 2,500 people \u2013 business leaders, world leaders, diplomats and the odd celebrity, such as Matt Damon \u2013 will fly in for the 49th annual Davos meeting. Most delegates are men, and although the forum boasts delegates from more than 100 countries, most hail from western\u00a0Europe, followed by the US. Sir David Attenborough is one of the most notable attendees in 2019, while Donald Trump, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron all pulled out at short notice to focus on more pressing issues at home.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now so numerous, so powerful, so all-pervasive, the mechanisms we have for destruction are so wholesale and so frightening, that we can actually exterminate whole ecosystems without even noticing it. We have to now be really aware of the dangers of what we\u2019re doing, and we already know that of course the plastic problem in the seas is wreaking appalling damage upon marine life, the extent of which we don\u2019t yet fully know.\u201d\nHe stressed that the natural world \u201cis not just a matter of beauty, interest and wonder\u201d but a coherent ecosystem on which we depend for \u201cevery breath we take, every mouthful of food we take.\u201d A healthy planet, Attenborough added, is an essential part of human life.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t recognise the kind of connections I\u2019ve been describing, then the whole planet comes in hazard, and we are destroying the natural world and with it ourselves.\u201d\nWilliam pressed Attenborough for a key message for the politicians and business leaders gathered in Davos this week.\n\u201cCare for the natural world. Not only care for the natural world but treat it with a degree of respect and reverence,\u201d Attenborough said, adding that there was a worrying tendency to waste resources.\n\u201cThe thing that I really care for in our ordinary daily lives is not to waste the riches of the natural world on which we depend. And it\u2019s not just energy ,which of course is very important, but it\u2019s also dealing with the natural world with a degree of respect. Not to throw away food, not to throw away power \u2013 just care for the natural world of which you\u2019re an essential part.\u201d\nThe Duke of Cambridge started and ended the session by congratulating Attenborough for winning the Crystal award, which recognises individuals who have helped make the world a better place, at the World Economic Forum on Monday night. William added it was a \u201cpersonal treat\u201d to be asking Attenborough questions, and quipped that it was a good change of pace from being the subject of interviews himself.\nAsking why global leaders have taken so long to react to climate change, William said: \u201c\u201cWhy do you think world leaders and those in key positions of leadership; why do think they\u2019ve taken so long \u2026 there have been quite a few faltering steps to act on environmental challenges?\u201d\nComparisons were also drawn between the broadcaster\u2019s burgeoning BBC career in the 1950s, compared with his latest project that sees him team up with Netflix and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) for an upcoming series called \u201cOur Planet\u201d to be released on the online TV streaming site.\nAttenborough said his early work in the mid-1950s involved himself, one camera and one cameraman, and it was relatively \u201ceasy\u201d to impress Britons simply by televising an armadillo. Now the systems are \u201cunbelievable\u201d, taking viewers to the sky and depths of the ocean in ways that 50 years ago, \u201cpeople couldn\u2019t imagine\u201d.\nPrince William noted Attenborough\u2019s late shift to environmental activism, noting that for many years the presenter \u201cheld back from speaking publicly about environmental issues\u201d.\nAttenborough said that at the start of his career, it was nearly inconceivable that the environment would be in such a state of crisis and even pockets of animal extinction seemed like the exception rather than the norm.\n\u201cTo be truthful I don\u2019t think there was anyone in the mid-50s who thought there was a danger that we would annihilate parts of the natural world. There were animals that were in danger, that\u2019s true and there were animals that we could see if we didn\u2019t do something they were going to become extinct.\n\u201cAnd the notion that human beings might exterminate a whole species \u2026 you just hadn\u2019t thought about it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNow of course we\u2019re only too well aware that the whole of the natural world is at our disposal, as it were. We can do things accidentally that exterminate a whole area of the natural world and species that live within it.\u201d\n", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/david-attenborough", "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-william", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos", "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/monarchy", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/endangeredspecies", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/deforestation"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Davos 2019: broadcaster tells prince that humans have power to exterminate whole ecosystems \u2018without even noticing\u2019", "date_published": {"$date": 1548177220000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1551702791015}, "authors": ["Kalyeena Makortoff"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Climate change", "David Attenborough", "Prince William", "Davos", "Business", "Environment", "Monarchy", "Science", "UK news", "World news", "Endangered species", "Deforestation", "Conservation", "Trees and forests", "Wildlife", "Davos 2019"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/22/david-attenborough-and-prince-william-take-world-leaders-to-task-on-environment", "og:description": "Davos 2019: broadcaster tells prince that humans have power to exterminate whole ecosystems \u2018without even noticing\u2019", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7937d835ad0f2935343892e33e495744fb52eabe/0_144_4334_2600/master/4334.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=82eda0e307bf0c675c19b797a648d3bd", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "David Attenborough and Prince William take world leaders to task on environment"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad76c7adb466740d2a1dadc563a1bafa046d2750/0_13_2246_1348/master/2246.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6fc92365e6164ced86bcc9c0ab4299ab", "width": "2246", "height": "1348", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad76c7adb466740d2a1dadc563a1bafa046d2750/0_13_2246_1348/master/2246.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f35f24d42070f96343078e2155a041cc", "description": "Prince William greets Sir David Attenborough on stage at Davos.

This is the highest level of concern since Yale starting polling the question in 2008.\nOverall, 73% of Americans accept that global warming is happening, outnumbering those who don\u2019t by five to one. This acceptance has strengthened in recent years, rising by 10% since March 2015. The proportion that grasps that humans are the primary cause of warming is smaller, with 62% understanding this to be the case.\nAbout two-thirds of Americans believe that global warming is influencing the weather, in the wake of a string of deadly extreme events in the US. About half say the disastrous wildfires in California and Hurricanes Florence and Michael, which flattened parts of North Carolina and Florida, were worsened because of rising global temperatures.\n\u201cGlobal warming used to be viewed as a problem distant in time and space,\u201d said report co-lead researcher Ed Maibach, a climate change and public health communications expert at George Mason University.\n\u201cBut Americans increasingly understand that global warming is here and now and are growing concerned about the threat to themselves, their communities and the nation.\u201d\nThe Yale polling, which was conducted in November and December, is backed by findings from separate new research by the University of Chicago and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\nThat poll found similarly wide acceptance that climate change is happening, among seven in 10 Americans. A stark political divide on the science still exists, however: while 86% of Democrats say climate change is happening, just 52% of Republicans concur.\nClimate change has become an increasingly animating cause for progressive Democrats, with campaigning by emerging grassroots groups and figures such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the newly elected congresswoman from New York, pushing for a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d.\nWhile this concept has yet to be fully fleshed out, its broad goal of transitioning to 100% renewable energy has energized younger activists and has gained a foothold among established Democrats.\nThe sense of urgency has been highlighted by a series of sobering reports released by scientists over the past year. A landmark United Nations report from last year warned that the world has little more than a decade to limit catastrophic climate change, which will involve millions of people displaced by sea level rise or subjected to deadly heatwaves, as well as the loss of almost all of the planet\u2019s coral reefs.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-weather", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Total of 72% polled now say global warming is personally important to them, Yale said, as 73% accept it is happening", "date_published": {"$date": 1548179148000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548180157000}, "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "article_section": "Environment", "article_tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "US weather", "US news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/22/climate-change-concern-americans-poll", "og:description": "Total of 72% polled now say global warming is personally important to them, Yale said, as 73% accept it is happening", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ca48803606987fbdde2b405107916faa816a22b/0_22_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=4dcd67177efe8696f429531a8fd7c3db", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Americans\u2019 climate change concerns surge to record levels, poll shows"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ca48803606987fbdde2b405107916faa816a22b/0_22_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ec9315a7dd1877aa7f7f5948ae0f2916", "width": "3000", "height": "1801", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ca48803606987fbdde2b405107916faa816a22b/0_22_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cf184a596f2e2048ae773be7cf75ed44", "description": "People in Atlantic Beach, North Carolina watch as Hurricane Florence threatens the Carolinas on 12 September 2018.\nPhotograph: Travis Long/TNS/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07aaea2c3613145ed8d19"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/22/the-guardian-view-on-rising-sea-levels-a-warning-from-greenland", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Dramatic increases in the rate at which ice on Greenland and East Antarctica is melting are, along with the heatwave gripping Australia, among the latest manifestations of the changes our planet and its atmosphere are undergoing.

Combined with recent analysis of retreating Antarctic glaciers that were previously thought to be stable, this new research makes unnerving reading. This is because of what it tells us about the extent of likely sea level rises, and warming seas linked to coral die-off and chaotic weather, but also because it highlights the difficulty of fully understanding the climate system.\nLast year the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change urged governments to work towards the most ambitious targets in the 2015 Paris agreement, and a global temperature rise not greater than 1.5C. Many experts fear that factors including the election of Donald Trump in the US and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil mean that even the more modest goal of sticking to current commitments, putting the world on course for a 3C rise, remains a huge challenge. Currently, global carbon emissions are still rising. But if people all over the world are getting used to the idea that higher temperatures and increased frequency of extreme weather events are the new normal \u2013 recent polling in the US suggests 72% of Americans believe global warming is important, the highest-ever figure \u2013 we are arguably less advanced in our understanding of warming oceans.\nThe sea level rises that scientists expect to accompany a temperature rise of 3C would submerge cities including Shanghai, Osaka and Miami along with parts of Rio de Janeiro and Alexandria \u2013 less than a century from now. Among nations, Bangladesh will be particularly severely affected, with one estimate suggesting that 250,000 people are already forced to move each year, making them environmental refugees. Such facts on the ground, as well as predictions, are why climate activists have long linked their cause to wider concerns around social justice. Just as carbon emissions must be limited to protect the livelihoods of people already struggling in areas vulnerable to drought and desertification, sea level rises must be restricted to protect the millions of people who live on coasts and in low-lying areas. The movement of peoples around the world, including but not limited to refugees, is in some cases a direct consequence of changes to the environment.\nWeather and climate systems are complex, and sea levels are hard to predict confidently. Already, ice sheets and glaciers are surprising scientists by behaving in unexpected ways. But while trying to limit future emissions remains the most pressing task, these ominous findings highlight the need to address the consequences of carbon already emitted. Sea level rises will continue long after emissions have peaked. We will have to adapt to our world\u2019s changing shape.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/sea-level", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/greenland", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/poles", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oceans", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Editorial: Ice sheets are melting faster and in different ways than scientists expected.

Both that are quite expensive and inefficient 19th century ideas in the first place. \nPS - to relocate food production may sound easy - but it so happens that vegetation respond to other things than mean annual temperature. They respond to seasonal amplitude of temperature - how precipitation is distributed over the year - how cold it gets, what soil there is, how much sun is available during summer and winter - during day and night. Many things. \nNow we can probably invent GMO solutions for that - but again - that costs a lot of money because Monsanto and other will of course claim a healthy profit that will trickle down to you.

It can't be both.\"\nWhere did I talk about the equilibrium climate sensitivity of this planet, that is the eventual temperature rise resulting from a doubling of atmospheric CO2, being a fact? You're the one doing that.\nEpistemology is the theory of knowledge, especially with regard to it methods, validity and scope, and the distinction between justified belief and opinion. Scientific knowledge is based on observation through experimentation which encompasses both direct and indirect measurement.\nLiving in the humid subtropics I find that some of the nearly 50 year old eucalypt wood steps in the front of our high set house have rotted at the edges causing them to slip from the risers. Using a steel tape I directly measured the old step at 833 mm in length, got a replacement cut at my local hardware store and knocked in the new step with my old fossil collecting dumpy hammer.\nNot all measures of reality in science are direct. Satellite temperature measures of the upper troposphere are one such example being derived from a range of measures of different atmospheric properties. Measures of equilibrium climate sensitivity to the greenhouse gas CO2 are also indirect measures being derived from measures of atmospheric CO2, global climate temperatures and the pattern of interaction of the ocean/atmosphere global climate system.\n Scientific knowledge is based on observations of reality which includes both direct and indirect measurements. I know that my front steps exist because I have observed them and tested their strength with my weight many times over the last 15 years. I know that the fungal wood-rot exists because I have observed it. I know the length of the step because I have measured it.\nI know that the temperature now in Brisbane is 29 degrees C because I have access to a reliable measure. We can similarly gain access to reliable measures of global climate temperature and global atmospheric CO2 levels and use those somewhat more direct measures, in conjunction with our observation and measurement based knowledge of how the oceans and atmosphere interact, to produce a measure of equilibrium climate sensitivity for Earth in response to atmospheric levels of the greenhouse gas CO2.\nYou have talked about facts. What are facts? Facts are what we can observe about the world and universe around us. It's a fact that my front steps exist because I can observe and measure them. It's a fact that the temperature in my city now is 29 degrees C because I have access to a reliable measure. It's a fact that global climate temperatures have increased because we have access to reliable measures of them. It's a fact that atmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased because we have access to reliable measures of them.

I can change temperature from 260 to 290. This sounds like not a big effect. But it is the same as changing mean annual temperature for Greenland from current conditions to the mean conditions of the French Riviera (approximately). That I gave numbers in Kelvin does not contradict that for the ice or anything alive on Greenland, such a \"small\" change could have some shocking effects. \nLook at UK. The islands have an annual temperature cycle of only 12 degrees. \nIt is fair to say that the UK is radically different as it shift from 280 to 292 K as in one state one risk snow and sleet and storms and in the other mean state one risk heatwaves and drought and all sorts of stuff - while having space enough for the 2 seasons of spring and fall to fit in as well. \nEven the seasons of England does not really behave very linear to a change of one degree. Good bathing temperatures for example lag by more than a month. And how you are going to plot flowering on a mean change of a degree is beyond me - because England has heated up by just about a degree and flowers and bees and birds and stuff is already getting confused. \nWhen you go from 1 degree to 2 degree you do more than step effect up by one. \nA diver will understand this. When you move from 10 to 20 to 30 depth in your dive - it is more than a linear increase of use of air and time spent getting rid of nitrogen on the way back up. One must calculate time spent at different depths and even consider if one has been flying recently and if one has dived before recently. 30 is more than a third more than 20. \nFor a British -minus one degree is not twice has hard as 15 degrees. That would be 7 degrees if you like to make Celsius your linear scale. Minus two would make reality worse than a black hole - because you would live in negative energy by existing in minus two. \nI hope I have clarified that a 1 degree change in anomaly from the zero of normal is not a linear scale. And that it should not be thought of as \"percentage\". We humans will still go to work with a fever of just 311 Kelvin. But we will be in hospital at 313. Even though the change is just 2. We will also be in hospital at 308. Because of hyptothermia. \nFever and hypothermia sounds a lot more impressive when we use C and F scales compared with Kelvin. If we used Kelvin we would say \"do not be a sissy - you are just off by 2 from mean of 311. Typical man-flu. Making a fuss about being just two away from a number well above 300. Being off mean way below a percent as measured in Kelvin. \nA local sea level change of 1 mm per year from a 20th century that had a median half degree warming over the observation record in question does not indicate that you should expect that sea-level will just be 8 mm per year with additional 2 degrees of median warming in the 21st century as global mean forcing.

Historical studies and mathematical correlations are used to examine the establishment and historical changes of tidal gauges and related bench markers as well as to establish the reliability of tidal records. In the past, some Chinese scientists proposed that sea-level has declined since 1950 while other foreign scientists attributed sea-level rise in the East China Sea to crustal and isostatic sinking. This study concludes that sea-level is rising at a rate about 1.0 mm a year, which is comparable to that of global sea- level rise. Meanwhile, it is found that the increase of the annual mean high tide level is remarkably greater, reflecting the estuarine morphological and hydro-dynamic effect on sea-level rise. The evidence suggests that the component of tectonic sinking accounts for only Vs or less of the relative sea level (RSL) rise. In contrast to the viewpoint of sea-level declining since 1950, this study shows a rising trend from 1951 to 1987, which is a continuation of sea-level rise since the beginning of this century. \nBQEND\nNow - let us take into account that this study was published almost 30 years ago - and that it does not agree with how you try to spin it.", "recommendation_count": "8", "in_reply_to": "125064187", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "125047585", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548336799000}, "author": "thebowsie", "author_id": "2484923", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nAgree that it will take 1,000s of years to melt central Antarctica\nBQEND\nI'm not aware that we have locked in the melting of Antarctica currently under any timeframe.

Most famously in China - but also on many an airport around the world (to affect fog). \nClimate engineering is also tested globally by natural events - such as explosive volcanic injection of ash into the stratosphere. They cause a time-limited period of up to 3 years of cooled global temperature. They also cause the UK to end up in a permanent state of positive NAO weather (very wet and mild and stormy) while southern Europe are fixed in drought. \nAll because of simple physics - even the first generation climate models had enough physics to explain why this happens. \nSo now you have to explain to the people in the UK that they will live permanently in the saddest weather you had in the 1990s - forever - to save the planet. Just like the Chinese stopped cloud-seeding - because it turned out that the already moisture stressed regions down-wind start to go desert on them. \nYou also must consider laws of warfare - because if Israel start to fix local rain - those located a bit further east may see it as an attack of own freshwater source. \nIn more general terms - climate science do not have good call on the regional effects and how fast they respond to CO2. So do you think it is a good idea to square the complexity by adding some radiative fix into the equations? \nIt could be a bit like pouring ice cold water into the petrol tank to help the engine from overheating. It may sound like a fantastic idea to draw ice cold water into the engine along with petrol. But some expert on car engines may advice against it. \nWe can learn this by trial and failure with engines - since we have many of them. But we have only one planet. Where do you think is the best place to engineer the radiative, conductive and convective heat?\nCarbon capture and storage is of course an engineering solution. But that makes all combustion energy instantly too expensive. So it is cheaper to just forbid it and instead transfer the generous subsidies for fossil energy to into nuclear. I like nuclear a lot - except from the direct and indirect cost. As such - the best engineering solution at present is to forbid subsidies to fossil carbon and move that generous tax generated subsidies to nuclear - while giving renewable energy that is on the brink of not needing subsidies at all some love with distributed grid understanding. \nThe trash from nuclear is after all contained until we learn a permanent solution for it. A much worse case than nuclear is that we power the planet with fossils for another century and end up in a situation with a climate crisis so bad that we are spending all the cash on fixing that rather than to care for the radioactive stockpiles we already caretake. \nBy making more nuclear waste we at least lower the much worse problem of AGW. This, of course, will increase the cost of energy a lot. Even with more cheap renewables to help out. But in the long run it is cheap. All self-contained energy is cheap. \nRemember - it is not the heat from a car engine or a coal plant that heats the world. It is the byproduct that heats the planet. As such we will embrace fusion. Because it is not the millions of degrees in the core that will stop us from heating up the planet. It is lack of emissions that does that. The problem with fusion is of course that even though the fuel is for free the cost of constructing the machine that sustain the heat and energy for so long that the output of energy is more than the input of energy is not cheap at all. \nI am go for nuclear. Because we are painted into a corner so tight that ideology lost decades ago. \nSadly, the president of USA and president of Russia and many other leaders have decided that nuclear power again is to be associated with nuclear weapon treaties as they are eager to pull out of treaties decades old. \nThat nuclear energy again is associated with weapon grade radioactivity and missiles is not helping the energy industry that has tried to detach itself from the war-games for a long time. \nIt seems like world leaders want to keep nuclear capacity as a military exclamation mark - and not as a civil safe source of energy - in a way that makes fossil energy to look good. Russia is a big player in fossil energy. USA is a big player in fossil energy. They do not want civil nuclear energy. It is still a weapon. And they do not want other nations to be allowed nuclear power plants.

Norway is beefing up its military presence in the high Arctic.\nLast October, Nato staged Trident Juncture with 40,000 troops, its biggest military exercise in Norway in more than a decade. A month earlier Britain announced a new \u201cDefence Arctic Strategy\u201d and promised a 10-year deployment of 800 commandos to Norway and four RAF Typhoons to patrol Icelandic skies. The US is also sending hundreds more marines to the region on long-term rotations and has threatened to send naval vessels through Arctic shipping lanes for the first time.\nWhile these strategic moves have echoes of the cold war, the modest buildup falls far short of that era, and there remains a strong spirit of cooperation in many areas. The current tensions are a result of a world warmed by industrial emissions. The Arctic is heating up twice as fast as the rest of the planet, shrinking sea ice and exposing more water and territory to exploitation and access.\n\u201cRight now, the reasons we are seeing more military activity is that countries are worried by the spectre of open water,\u201d one of the speakers, Klaus Dodds, a professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway, University of London, told the Guardian. \u201cThe unique Arctic security architecture has shape and form that come from natural extremities. If the Arctic becomes just another ocean, this breaks down. It\u2019s elemental.\u201d\nThe Arctic\u2019s unique characteristics are under attack from all sides. Below, the once-frozen ocean is now mixed with warmer, more saline Atlantic waters. In the skies above, the polar vortex above is weakening, allowing intrusions of balmy air currents from the south.\nSea ice is being lost at a rate of more than 10,000 tonnes per second, according to Tore Furevik, a professor at the Geophysical Institute at the University of Bergen. \u201cWe\u2019re heading for a new and uncertain Arctic with ramifications for nature and politics,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should strive to be less suspicious, less hostile and more open-minded if we are to deal with a problem that we have so recklessly created.\u201d\nBy 2035, the Arctic is forecast to be free of ice during summer, which will allow ships to sail across the north pole.\nBusiness interest is growing. For the first time, last summer, a Maersk container ship navigated the northern sea route from Asia to Europe carrying fish and electronic goods. Energy companies are exploring new oil and gas fields.\nOnce remote regions are becoming geopolitical hotspots. Troms\u00f8, in Norway, which hosted the conference, was once a tiny trading post. Today, it\u2019s a tourism hub and a gateway to the mineral-rich north. \u201cNow we have a historically strange situation with political and economic activity in the Arctic. So many people are knocking on our door, including business and state representatives from China, Pakistan, Singapore and Morocco,\u201d the mayor, Kristin R\u00f8ymo, told the Guardian. \u201cThere is also a very obvious increased naval presence.\u201d\nThis concerns many conference participants, who highlight the peaceful history of cross-border cooperation in the far north. Even during the cold war, there were agreements on fishing, scientific research and reindeer herding that continue today.\nNorwegian politicians were at pains to downplay the significance of the current military buildup. \u201cThere is no direct link between climate change and conflict,\u201d the former defence minister Espen Barth Eide said. \u201cIt\u2019s not because there is an immediate threat, it\u2019s that, as an area becomes more important, it\u2019s natural to have a heightened military presence.\u201d\nHe compared the situation to the South China Sea, where China, the US and other nations compete, not by firing weapons, but by demonstrating capacity and presence. \u201cTo some extent that is happening now in the Arctic,\u201d he said, although he stressed there were no territorial disputes to inflame passions.\nThe build-up is portrayed almost as a form of climate adaptation \u2013 strengthening the military presence along with infrastructure affected by melting permafrost.\nHowever, there are tensions. In a keynote speech, the Norwegian foreign minister, Ine Marie Eriksen S\u00f8reide, complained about communications interference by Russia in the far north. She plans to arrange a meeting with the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, to discuss the allegation. \u201cMost important is to open political dialogue and talk not just about what we agree on but what we do not agree on,\u201d she said.\nNorway is also contributing to the climate problem and the strategic tensions. It has just approved a raft of new oil exploration licenses in the Barents Sea and one of its citizens has been caught spying in Russia.\nRussia is uneasy about recent Nato exercises that have pushed deep into the north, according to Teimuraz Ramishvili, the ambassador to Norway. He told the Guardian the military modernisation on the Russian side was overdue after 20 years of neglect and its significance should not be overstated.\n\u201cIn Europe, you have military installations that are used for peaceful purposes. Why it that OK in Europe, but not in Russia?\u201d he asked. He said Moscow put a high priority on the northern region, where the potential was so great that some talk enthusiastically of an \u201cArctic age\u201d.\n\u201cFor us, this is a matter of sustainable development of Russian territory. This is not open water, it is Russian territory,\u201d said Ramishvili. \u201cThe Arctic isn\u2019t a nature resort. It\u2019s a place where Russians have lived for a long time.\u201d\nCurrently, cargo companies that use the northern shipping lanes need to pay Russia. But this will change as the sea ice recedes and Arctic routes open up in international waters. China, which has declared itself a \u201cnear-Arctic nation\u201d, is among the countries exploring this area. Last year, it launched a second Snow Dragon ice breaker and released an Arctic white paper that explored the potential for infrastructure investments in a Polar Silk Road.\nThe US, by comparison, is lagging behind. Although its nuclear submarines have operated under the ice for decades, its surface navy is ill-equipped for the Arctic. \u201cEveryone\u2019s up there but us,\u201d the navy secretary, Richard Spencer, complained last month.\n\u201cThe threat is back on. This is an area \u2026 we need to focus on,\u201d he said. Spencer has called for a strategic Arctic port in Alaska and US naval vessels to conduct navigation operations later this year in northern shipping lanes so they have the capacity to conduct emergency operations if necessary. \u201cCan you imagine a Carnival line cruise ship having a problem, and the Russians do the search and do the extraction?\u201d he said.\nThe prospect of a US warship sailing near Russia\u2019s vast northern border would certainly amplify unease, as well as highlighting the geopolitical challenges caused by global heating.\nLisa Murkowski, a US senator for Alaska, did not expect the US navy to enter Russian waters, but, considering everything else that is going on, she said any freedom of navigation mission in the region would raise sensitivity.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for the US to project military strength, but there should be no intention to be unduly provocative,\u201d she told the conference. The problem, she said, was that the White House had not updated its strategy to deal with a fast-changing region. \u201cUnder this administration, we are not assigning a significant priority to our role as an Arctic nation. There is a void,\u201d she said.\nEnvironmentalists at the conference highlighted the dual role of oil in worsening the tension: both as a driver of climate change and of the push for more resource extraction from the still largely pristine Arctic. Norway came under fire for approving 83 new exploration licenses last week, more than a dozen of which were in the Barents Sea.\n\u201cThe false narrative of this conference is that Arctic countries are doing sustainable development,\u201d said Martin Sommerkorn, head of conservation of the WWF Arctic Programme. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that just days after you grant 83 new licenses.

In many areas in the northern half of Australia, the average number of days above 35C could increase by two to three times.\nLate in the century, towns such as Darwin, Alice Springs and Broome\u00a0 may experience days with temperatures above 35C for about a third of the year.\nThese higher temperatures will also result in higher evaporation, which will continue to make drought conditions worse.\nMelbourne was forecast to reach 44C by mid-afternoon, approaching the all-time hottest day of 46.4C on 7 February 2009, when Australia\u2019s deadliest bushfires killed 173 people, burned through 450,000 hectares and destroyed more than 2,000 homes.\nA cool change was expected to bring relief by 4pm but gusty north and north-westerly winds were predicted to sweep across the western districts of the state, with a chance of dry lightning, before hitting the capital city in the afternoon.\nThe combination, coming after months of drought in northern areas, has created a very high fire risk.\nFirefighters in Victoria and Tasmania are on high alert and have warned campers and bushwalkers to rethink their plans to head out early for the long weekend. Large swaths of the Tasmanian wilderness are already burning.\nVictorian emergency management commissioner Andrew Crisp told ABC News Breakfast he had 500 firefighters in control centres across the state and 60 aircraft on standby.\n\u201cWe are ready,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I keep saying is are you, as the community of Victoria, ready? Have you downloaded your Vic Emergency app? Do you know who the emergency broadcaster is? Because if you\u2019re travelling around and you\u2019re enjoying the last of the holidays, you need to be able to access good information to make good decisions.\u201d\nCrisp urged people to be sensible in the heat and said that since December emergency services had received more than 300 callouts for people or animals who had been left in hot cars \u2014 averaging about 10 a day on really hot days.\nThere is a total fire ban in both states. The fire danger for parts of south-east Tasmania, around Hobart, has been set at severe.\nThe fire danger rating for the Mallee and Northern Country districts of Victoria is extreme on Friday, with a severe rating for the Wimmera, South West, Central and Western and Southern Gippsland areas.\nHeatwaves and prolonged drought have caused mass fish kills in western NSW as well as mass deaths of feral camels and horses in central Australia, renewing already loud calls for Australia to take serious action on climate change.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bushfires", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tasmania", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/natural-disasters", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/wildfires", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Victoria and Tasmania on alert for bushfires amid extreme weather forecast as generators fail at three coal-fired power stations", "date_published": {"$date": 1548367081000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548378416000}, "authors": ["Calla Wahlquist"], "article_section": "Australia news", "article_tags": ["Australia news", "Bushfires", "Tasmania", "Victoria", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Wildfires", "Climate change", "Energy", "Australia weather", "Extreme weather"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/25/melbourne-heatwave-city-expecting-44c-as-victoria-faces-hottest-day-since-black-saturday", "og:description": "Victoria and Tasmania on alert for bushfires amid extreme weather forecast as generators fail at three coal-fired power stations", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27a67c309deed31d9b2c6fddd60564c697d64aea/0_326_4924_2955/master/4924.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=c0ea326296f9a5ab11e1215127cd2876", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Melbourne heatwave: city expecting 44C as Victoria faces hottest day since Black Saturday"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27a67c309deed31d9b2c6fddd60564c697d64aea/0_326_4924_2955/master/4924.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=198102fe64c7b3c4802c4d5768de0fde", "width": "4924", "height": "2955", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27a67c309deed31d9b2c6fddd60564c697d64aea/0_326_4924_2955/master/4924.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7b5383fc159bd39a0fef0f287f4323d9", "description": "Children play in a fountain as they cool down from the heatwave at the Australian Open in Melbourne, Victoria.\nPhotograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images"}}]}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cc07ad9a2c3613145ed8d2b"}, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/25/our-house-is-on-fire-greta-thunberg16-urges-leaders-to-act-on-climate", "topic_seed_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "text": "Our house is on fire. I am here to say, our house is on fire.\nAccording to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), we are less than 12 years away from not being able to undo our mistakes. In that time, unprecedented changes in all aspects of society need to have taken place, including a reduction of our CO2 emissions by at least 50%.\nAnd please note that those numbers do not include the aspect of equity, which is absolutely necessary to make the Paris agreement work on a global scale. Nor does it include tipping points or feedback loops like the extremely powerful methane gas released from the thawing Arctic permafrost.\nAt places like Davos, people like to tell success stories. But their financial success has come with an unthinkable price tag. And on climate change, we have to acknowledge we have failed. All political movements in their present form have done so, and the media has failed to create broad public awareness.\nBut Homo sapiens have not yet failed. Yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around. We can still fix this. We still have everything in our own hands. But unless we recognise the overall failures of our current systems, we most probably don\u2019t stand a chance.\nWe are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people. And now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say. Now is the time to speak clearly.\nSolving the climate crisis is the greatest and most complex challenge that Homo sapiens have ever faced. The main solution, however, is so simple that even a small child can understand it. We have to stop our emissions of greenhouse gases.\nEither we do that or we don\u2019t.\nYou say nothing in life is black or white. But that is a lie. A very dangerous lie. Either we prevent 1.5C of warming or we don\u2019t. Either we avoid setting off that irreversible chain reaction beyond human control or we don\u2019t.\nEither we choose to go on as a civilisation or we don\u2019t. That is as black or white as it gets. There are no grey areas when it comes to survival.\nWe all have a choice. We can create transformational action that will safeguard the living conditions for future generations. Or we can continue with our business as usual and fail.\nThat is up to you and me.\nSome say we should not engage in activism. Instead we should leave everything to our politicians and just vote for a change instead. But what do we do when there is no political will? What do we do when the politics needed are nowhere in sight?\nHere in Davos \u2013 just like everywhere else \u2013 everyone is talking about money. It seems money and growth are our only main concerns.\nAnd since the climate crisis has never once been treated as a crisis, people are simply not aware of the full consequences on our everyday life. People are not aware that there is such a thing as a carbon budget, and just how incredibly small that remaining carbon budget is. That needs to change today.\nNo other current challenge can match the importance of establishing a wide, public awareness and understanding of our rapidly disappearing carbon budget, that should and must become our new global currency and the very heart of our future and present economics.\nWe are at a time in history where everyone with any insight of the climate crisis that threatens our civilisation \u2013 and the entire biosphere \u2013 must speak out in clear language, no matter how uncomfortable and unprofitable that may be.\nWe must change almost everything in our current societies. The bigger your carbon footprint, the bigger your moral duty. The bigger your platform, the bigger your responsibility.\nAdults keep saying: \u201cWe owe it to the young people to give them hope.\u201d But I don\u2019t want your hope. I don\u2019t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act.\nI want you to act as you would in a crisis.

One of its special commissions reported earlier this month that civilisation itself was at risk from the effects of the current food system on both human health and the Earth\u2019s ecosystems. This week comes the next instalment from another special Lancet commission which finds that pandemics of obesity and malnutrition are interacting with climate change in a feedback loop and represent an existential threat to humans and the planet. The modern western diet has become a highly damaging thing that needs a complete overhaul if we are to avoid potential ecological catastrophe. It concluded that we need to halve global meat consumption, and more than double the volume of whole grains, pulses, nuts, fruit and vegetables we eat.\nCue howls of indignation from big food and its cheerleaders, the libertarian right. Those nanny statists have gone nuts eating their own double dose of nuts! Cue cries of distress from champions of local, low-impact agriculture who include grass-fed animals, and their meat and manure, in their sustainable mix. These self-appointed experts don\u2019t understand farming! Cue grim food wheels with only a quarter of a rasher of bacon or a fifth of an egg a day. Those miserabilist medics want us all to go vegan!\nYet the evidence that our diets are the largest cause of climate change and biodiversity loss is now overwhelming. The global food system is responsible for up to 30% of total greenhouse gas emissions, the livestock sector on its own accounting for about half of that total or 14.5%. The modern western way of eating is also making very large numbers of people fat and sick as other parts of the world adopt it. Diet-related diseases now cause roughly 11 million deaths a year as preventable cancers, heart disease and strokes, obesity and diabetes have spread along with our way of eating. More than 800 million people are estimated to be chronically undernourished, and 2 billion suffer from micronutrient deficiencies, yet at the same time 2 billion are overweight or obese. In poorer counties you can even find obesity and stunting within the same family as calorie-heavy but nutrient-light processed industrialised foods are adopted.\nIn other words, something has gone horribly wrong and we don\u2019t have much time to fix it. The so-called \u201creference diet\u201d, published in the first Lancet report, has caused uproar in some quarters. This is a theoretical attempt to answer the Malthusian question: if the global population reaches 10 billion by 2050 (as is anticipated), will there be enough food to meet everyone\u2019s basic nutritional needs without cutting down more forest, polluting more water courses and generally destroying the planet? The answer it comes up with is yes, but only if we share things out differently, and stop feeding a quarter of the world\u2019s grain to animals.\nThe reference diet models each person globally having 14g of red meat a day, 29g of chicken, a fraction of an egg, 250g of dairy, a little fat or oil, very little sugar, and lots of grains and lentils, vegetables and nuts. And here\u2019s where the trouble begins, because calculated day by day and universally these allocations make for a pretty depressing plateful. They contain some odd judgments. Why favour industrialised chicken? Why palm oil? They are plain weird if you try to interpret them as daily instructions without thinking about the diet as a whole or what\u2019s available to people locally \u2013 hence the one-fifth of an egg, the quarter rasher of bacon. People don\u2019t shop and eat by numbers and fractions. And the fact that nutrition epidemiology \u2013 the study of patterns in diet and disease \u2013 has got it wrong before does not help. Remember when fears about dietary cholesterol were used to condemn eggs? These instructions sound top down and, worse, appear to throw responsibility back to the individual.\nMore than 800 million people are estimated to be chronically undernourished, yet 2 billion are overweight or obese\nBut that is to miss the point of these instructions. They are calculations that give a sense of the scale of the problem and a science-based framework for political action. Contrary to some claims, the Lancet commission that undertook the modelling, supported by the philanthropic EAT Foundation, received no funding from industry. And the uncomfortable truth is that meat, and specifically the meat from intensively-fed livestock, processed in the way it generally is in the western diet, is a hotspot when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions and ill health. Well-produced meat and dairy can have a place, but it will be a small one, and it is expensive.\nOur diets are out of kilter with what\u2019s good for both us and the planet because powerful vested interests and misplaced economic incentives have driven them in that direction, and this is the thesis underlying the commission\u2019s findings. The equivalent of $500bn in agricultural subsidies goes each year to the wrong sort of food \u2013 corn, soya, meat and dairy, as cheap raw materials for intensive livestock production and for highly processed foods. About $5tn a year goes in subsidies to the fossil fuels which industrialised agriculture uses so profligately. Big food has spent hundreds of millions advertising unhealthy food and lobbying to block the sort of measures that might help shift consumption.\nAlthough individuals can make a difference by modifying their diets, and send clear demands for action to politicians , we cannot redraw the food system on our own. That will require not just governments, but global agreement.\nThe Lancet says the problem is so big and so urgent that we need an intergovernmental convention to agree a way forward, in the way that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or the World Health Organization\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control have. Expect plenty of hysterical, dark-money opposition to that. The Lancet, founded in the 19th century, caused uproar back then by publishing the unwelcomenews that food was routinely adulterated. It has once again kickstarted a vital debate about how we eat. If it all sounds too gloomy, it\u2019s worth remembering that the modern western diet is a recent invention. The separation of livestock from the land only took off in the 1950s, thanks to cheap energy to keep animals housed, to synthetic fertilisers increasing grain production for feed, and to mass production of antibiotics to control disease. It\u2019s not so very long since most people ate in the way we now need to rediscover. \n\u2022 Felicity Lawrence is a special correspondent for the Guardian and author of Not on the Label and Eat Your Heart Out", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/society/food-poverty", "https://www.theguardian.com/society/poverty", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The global food system is causing an ecological and health catastrophe, says Guardian special correspondent Felicity Lawrence", "date_published": {"$date": 1548655254000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1548692112000}, "authors": ["Felicity Lawrence"], "article_section": "Opinion", "article_tags": ["Food", "Climate change", "Environment", "Food poverty", "Poverty", "Society", "World news"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/28/global-food-killing-humans-planet-climate-change-obesity", "og:description": "The global food system is causing an ecological and health catastrophe, says Guardian special correspondent Felicity Lawrence", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea3755bbd3bb4b47b126bb983a7fc91069bd7c0c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=04ae8f25be074e9a506d86ecc101c9f5", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "The way we eat is killing us \u2013 and the planet | Felicity Lawrence"}, "discussion_section_open": false, "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea3755bbd3bb4b47b126bb983a7fc91069bd7c0c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8a7de4d304d660323d4396219f9241f0", "width": "2560", "height": "1536", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea3755bbd3bb4b47b126bb983a7fc91069bd7c0c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a80e860d939fee461979b3b75ea7cea4", "description": "Illustration: Bill Bragg"}}], "comments": [{"id": "125176771", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548685270000}, "author": "Eoin Fitzpatrick", "author_id": "15227227", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "by not having any kids? or one or two at most?", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "125156458", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "125176766", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548685265000}, "author": "IndianVegan", "author_id": "4242390", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Do you have any links to that?", "recommendation_count": "2", "in_reply_to": "125176240", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "125176762", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548685258000}, "author": "chuunenbaka", "author_id": "3837420", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Sorry but I think we can still tell an unhealthy fat person from a less fat one.", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "125157568", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "125176714", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548685185000}, "author": "Quackersyard", "author_id": "4699911", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "BQSTART\nWhat is it with vegans projecting their morals onto others?\nBQEND\nWell, in general, don't you understand the idea that if you think a course of action is worth pursuing, you want to persuade others?", "recommendation_count": "1", "in_reply_to": "125173717", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "125176673", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548685148000}, "author": "Madasafish", "author_id": "2785111", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\"and soil is largely carbon\"\nNo it is NOT.

People seem to think that producing animals for food and the waste involved contributes to climate change primarily but they forget how much waste from food overall contributes to climate change-especially vegetable waste. No on ever wants to really look at the flip side of this because it's doesn't juice up the blog hit numbers.\n-Vegetarian and 'healthy' diets are more harmful to the environmenteating a vegetarian diet could contribute to climate change.\nIn fact, according to new research from Carnegie Mellon University, following the USDA recommendations to consume more fruits, vegetables, dairy and seafood is more harmful to the environment because those foods have relatively high resource uses and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per calorie. Published in Environment Systems and Decisions, the study measured the changes in energy use, blue water footprint and GHG emissions associated with U.S. food consumption patterns.\n\"Eating lettuce is over three times worse in greenhouse gas emissions than eating bacon,\" said Paul Fischbeck, professor of social and decisions sciences and engineering and public policy. \"Lots of common vegetables require more resources per calorie than you would think. Eggplant, celery and cucumbers look particularly bad when compared to pork or chicken.\"\n\"There's a complex relationship between diet and the environment,\" Tom said. \"What is good for us health-wise isn't always what's best for the environment. That's important for public officials to know and for them to be cognizant of these tradeoffs as they develop or continue to develop dietary guidelines in the future.\"reported in phys org.\nA posted asked how people can kill an animal how can people kill plants with the new data coming out that shows that plant life experiences pain. -New research on plant intelligence may forever change how you think about plants:Michael Pollan, author of such books as \"The Omnivore's Dilemma\" and \"The Botany of Desire,\" stated new research, he says, is in a field called plant neurobiology.\"They have analagous structures,\" Pollan explains. \"They (plants) have ways of taking all the sensory data they gather in their everyday lives ... integrate it and then behave in an appropriate way in response. And they do this without brains, which, in a way, is what's incredible about it, because we automatically assume you need a brain to process information.\" \nPlants don't have similar nervous systems as animals but they have something that is equal to animal intelligence. An example: Pollan, played a recording of a caterpillar munching on a leaf to plants \u2014 and the plants react. They begin to secrete defensive chemicals \u2014 even though the plant isn't really threatened, Pollan says. \"It is somehow hearing what is, to it, a terrifying sound of a caterpillar munching on its leaves.\" Another observation is when a plant is being eaten by an insect the plants next to it will actually began to lean away from the attacked plant which some researchers say is a fear reaction. Lots of research over the last decade on plant life intelligence. Just because you can't hear them scream doesn't mean they don't feel pain when they are chopped up or yanked from the ground. \nMy point. Stop judging other people. You don't want to eat meat that's fine-do your thang but stop thinking that make you a better person than those who do chose to eat meat. Your lifestyle choice contributes to climate change more than you want to believe if you read scientific articles that are based on studies & testing. Just think about all the articles on Halloween pumpkins last year and how they contribute to an increase in methane gas. Millions of pounds of pumpkins destined for landfills, adding to more than 254 million tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) produced in the United States every year that turn into methane gas. Landfills contribute nearly 20% of all methane emissions in the States and pumpkin carbon footprint estimated range from 139 g to 448 g.\nEveryone contributes to climate change and the data is out there that demonstrates it.", "recommendation_count": "2", "causal_relations": [{"cause": "just it 's in the lancet", "effect": "does n't make it jake as the saying goes"}, {"cause": "it 's", "effect": "to really look at the flip side of this"}, {"cause": "those foods have relatively high resource uses and greenhouse gas ghg emissions", "effect": "in fact according to new research from carnegie mellon university following the usda recommendations to consume more fruits is more harmful to the environment"}, {"cause": "we automatically assume you need a brain to process information", "effect": "and they do this without brains"}, {"cause": "just you ca n't hear them scream", "effect": "does n't mean they do n't feel pain when they are chopped up or yanked from the ground"}]}, {"id": "125176594", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548685054000}, "author": "James Walker", "author_id": "16237737", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Cool story bro.", "recommendation_count": "4", "in_reply_to": "125176443", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "125176583", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548685046000}, "author": "CforCynic", "author_id": "3949060", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "Next you'll be saying that N\u00e9stle isn't one of their \"engagement allies\". \nOh......", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "125175142", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "125176545", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548684998000}, "author": "Charmant_mais_fou", "author_id": "15011048", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "\"planet is finished.\"\n What a waster attitude! \nRecord numbers are turning to a vegetarian and vegan diet, so why not join them instead of bemoaning humankind's demise?", "recommendation_count": "3", "in_reply_to": "125175657", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "125176505", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548684945000}, "author": "wecanonlyhope", "author_id": "100712804", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "At long last someone has poined out the blindingly obvious - the way we eat and what we eat is complete folly and extremely harmful.

They simply don\u2019t care. No one they know or will get to know in their life will be affected by the problems caused by consumption. It is not a question of walls or barriers because businesses are allowed to buy things and use resources and profit from them. Countries rely on the revenue generated from businesses to pay for administering essential services and developing infrastructure. If they really crack down on the polluters, they won\u2019t have products and then there will be no more money to maintain things, and then the party ends for everyone. Such an eventuality will lead people to elect someone who allows the businesses to resume their crazy pillaging. It can\u2019t ever end because people around the world have chosen to be passive and buy everything. Do you want to hunt for food or do you want to get it from a supermarket? People won\u2019t go back to foraging, they won\u2019t go back to walking or using mules and horses for transport and neither will they stop using services/products that are conveniently delivered to your door to save you the trouble of doing the hard work. That is the problem, and there is no way of getting around it. People are making things at industrial levels, and shipping them around the globe. Even if you change some practices, you only slow down the depletion of resources, you don\u2019t end it. Sure, it would be great if the wprld\u2019s politicians could agree on slowing things down, but unless humans see that their actions are having an actual effect on their lives, they will continue, and governments will only stop them when they can already see a big hole in the sky. People have created systems of production, transportation and settlement to thrive in societies that rely upon packaged products that are made on an industrial scale. Half-assed poltical gestures introduced to treat the symptoms but not the cause of the problem are a way to deflect from the reality that people cannot change. Signing up to lower emissions is an insult to the planet because it is like saying, we can\u2019t really stop the destruction of the planet but we can ask some people to sign some papers in which they promise they will try to slow things down a little. How does that solve the problem? It doesn\u2019t really because nothing can change because of the way people have become accustomed to living. Walls or no walls, there are greedy, rich people everywhere and they will take advantage of what they can and governments will only play gestural politics to trick people into thinking that something is being done to help, when in reality whatever is being done is just for show. No one is going back to the caveman days and neither I am suggesting they do.

They are going to take our cars away from us, they are going to take our steaks from us, they are going to take all the things that make life nice away from us. So let\u2019s not go there.\u2019\n\u201cIt is a false contradiction. If we put our policies in the right order, we have a sustainable society without lowering but even increasing our levels of wellbeing. Is wellbeing only economic growth? Only salaries? Or is wellbeing also being able to breathe clean air and drink clean water?\u201d\nSpeaking before the publication on Wednesday of a \u201creflections paper\u201d on the EU\u2019s next steps in changing the way Europeans live and work in order to protect the environment, Timmermans said the challenge was to bring about reform in a way that was equitable.\n\u201cThe most important thing the gilets jaunes and others ask themselves is: is this fair, are people taking a fair share of the burden or are [the elites] unburdening all that on us? If you create the impression, rightly or wrongly, that this is just a burden on citizens unloaded by companies that don\u2019t do anything, then people will just block it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPolitically speaking, one of the most important tasks will be to show that this is something we are doing together in an equitable way, a fair way.\u201d\nOn Monday a second French gilets jaunes leader announced she was founding a political party. Its programme calls for removing privileges from elected representatives, developing \u201ccharity houses\u201d paid for by donations from chief executives, a reduction in VAT on essential products and higher taxes for higher earners.\nTimmermans said there were calls for the EU and member states to slow down in making major societal changes in favour of sustainability, but he warned: \u201cThe time is now.\u201d", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/france", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/gilets-jaunes-protests", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news"], "share_count": "0", "description": "Gilets jaunes\u2019 anger shows that companies must do their bit, says Frans Timmermans", "date_published": {"$date": 1548738022000}, "date_modified": {"$date": 1553092784000}, "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "article_section": "World news", "article_tags": ["European commission", "Climate change", "European Union", "Europe", "France", "World news", "Environment", "Gilets jaunes protests"], "og_fields": {"og:url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/29/elites-must-not-burden-gilets-jaunes-with-climate-change-says-eu-official", "og:description": "Gilets jaunes\u2019 anger shows that companies must do their bit, says Frans Timmermans", "og:image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f51de2c47dd52b2cdbc5a81c27f92a4bb955b6c7/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=3619989734d20ed14da307b6e53e22cd", "og:type": "article", "og:title": "Elites' response to climate change must be fair, says EU official"}, "headline": "l", "article_image": [{"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"representativeOfPage": "true", "url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f51de2c47dd52b2cdbc5a81c27f92a4bb955b6c7/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=777b90a22bffef7154b8b0380e6e7993", "width": "5568", "height": "3341", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f51de2c47dd52b2cdbc5a81c27f92a4bb955b6c7/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c07e1644aa2f9ea5fc3944de260752aa", "description": "Yellow vest protesters were confronted by their foulard rouge (red scarf) critics in Paris on Sunday.\nPhotograph: Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty Images"}}, {"type": "http://schema.org/ImageObject", "properties": {"url": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7f4d556f6be03a888a62f48ac4bfa4fe5ee9387/1171_60_1040_1300/master/1040.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5004194902ff9434e42a41b8fbc51c0f", "width": "1040", "height": "1300", "contentUrl": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7f4d556f6be03a888a62f48ac4bfa4fe5ee9387/1171_60_1040_1300/master/1040.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d1394072c9ba477fdbb0429ca862f567", "description": "Frans Timmermans.

Politics in Australia, as it currently operates, isn\u2019t something immediately appealing to anyone in their right mind. I\u2019ve had a successful business career; my kids are all but grown-up.\nBut the time has come when I\u2019m compelled to act as the situation we face is so dire, and the quality of the actors so poor, and the unwillingness of the Liberal party to reform is so evident that the right question is \u201chow can you just sit there and not stand?\u201d\nWe have to change the way politics is done in Australia so we can address climate change, restore political integrity and ensure business operates within society\u2019s expectations and not as an entity unto itself.\nUnfortunately, the current Liberal party has lost the plot. Its failure to deal with these issues threatens to sell out the future of all Australians. Without environmental and public assets and public confidence in our politics we\u2019re unable to deal with a warming climate, a growing and ageing population and an unequal economy.\nGrowing up, I learned what it takes to be elected to parliament, door-knocking Doveton to Kooweerup for my father, the Liberal member for Holt, the late Bill Yates.\nBut despite being a member for most of my life, I am done with this form of the Liberal party. Seeing the now prime minister, Scott Morrison, wave around a lump of coal in parliament, and witnessing a follow-up act with brown coal at a Victorian fundraiser made me angry. Environmentally it\u2019s like waving asbestos.\nIf this is the Liberal party, then it has no place for me. I can\u2019t quite explain what has happened but the Liberal party\u2019s culture is sick. Ten years of negative policy actions have created a black hole around the leadership, surrounding them in impenetrable darkness. They\u2019ve ignored or denied claims of bullying, which is evident to all. Now there\u2019s a flood of cabinet ministers rushing for the backdoor. Family reasons aside, the environment in Canberra within the Liberal party is toxic.\nWe need real people with real experience to sit in Canberra\nFaced with this, and when it is made clear that the \u201cbroad church\u201d in Kooyong won\u2019t extend to other Liberals with environmental concerns, the time comes to offer an alternative way so that the people of Kooyong can have a voice and be represented in Canberra.\nThe majority of them want action on climate, fair treatment for asylum seekers, businesses to consider people and the environment, and politicians to act with integrity. Currently they feel let down.\nThe Liberal government\u2019s blindness to the dangers of climate change is sickening. It\u2019s about 28 years since the first international report called on governments to act to reduce carbon emission as a known threat to the environment. Since then, global emissions have risen more than 60%. The current government is delaying action, and encouraging global inaction.\nWe can\u2019t afford that. How can Liberals not see this?\nThe Liberal party put the interests of the coal and fossil fuel industry ahead of just about every other industry, and source of employment, in Australia.\nOur beautiful reefs, right through to our southern wilderness, are being destroyed as you read this. Our rivers and everything that relies on them are dying. Communities are facing crippling droughts and fires. Meanwhile, the government continue to peddle dangerous nonsense that we need new coal-fired power stations, or talking up Adani.\nHaving run the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and as an investor in renewable projects, I understand the jobs, economic benefits and new industries that can emerge while we reduce pollution. I can\u2019t understand why the Liberal party, which prides itself on its economic credentials, fails to see the economic opportunities.\nThe treasurer Josh Frydenberg\u2019s recent speech to the Sydney Institute should mark another point of intense disappointment. It highlights how seriously the Liberal party has lost its way. Now its leadership can\u2019t even make moral sense of its own values and belief.\nFrydenberg said: \u201cFairness is achieved through equality of opportunity, not equality of outcomes\u201d, and \u201cintergenerational equity requires fiscal discipline as the next generation should not have to pick up the tab for the last\u201d.\nIf he seriously believes current Liberal policies reflect these two values, then he is totally deluded.\nThe government\u2019s policies are preventing individuals having \u201cequality of opportunity\u201d. Inequality of wealth is growing. Wealth has a direct relationship with the opportunities an individual has from birth. The outcome will not be fair if government policies fail to address the massive financial inequality individuals face.\nPolicies that constantly increase the benefits of those who can afford to pay versus those less well off layer this government\u2019s thinking. Poor suburbs have poor schools, hospitals and services in contrast to wealthy suburbs. I don\u2019t want an American-style split society. Menzies did not suggest it, and it grinds against the identity I thought we shared as Australians, which had pride in egalitarianism and mateship.\nSecondly, intergenerational equity applies to the climate and our natural resources not just the budget. Those retiring today are leaving oceans filled with plastic, mines that have not been rehabilitated, soil depleted, ecosystems destroyed and our climate in ruins. The tab is being left to the next generation without care or regard. How a Liberal government cannot see the scale of this is breathtaking.\nWe must return integrity to politics. We need real people with real experience to sit in Canberra. We can\u2019t afford another generation of party hacks who believe politics is a game of numbers, slogans and spin.\nThe public have lost trust in their political leaders. We need an integrity commission, proper political donations reforms and a bill of rights that enshrines what it means to be Australian. And we need to stop ignoring the concerns of Australia\u2019s first people before we can become a mature country.\nWe need a strong business sector that works with society. Currently there are deep cultural problems. Corporations and CEOs are there to act in the collective interests of people. They cannot continue to claim that their only job is to maximise profits. They need to understand that they must act in the same way we expect an individual to act as part of a heathy society that protects and cares for each other.\nGovernment and business love free trade. But it doesn\u2019t always benefit the people. My first public run-in with the Howard government was over the US-Australian free-trade agreement. The PM\u2019s office called my employer to suggest it was not in my employers\u2019 best interest that I continue to point out the deficiencies of the agreement.\nIt triggered my disbelief in our politicians, and highlighted our lack of individual rights to speak and debate views, as all citizens must do, if they care about their country. Our trade agreements need to be carefully considered to ensure the benefit for our economy and society. We shouldn\u2019t be signing up to deals that could harm Australia\u2019s economic interests or impose major social costs. I will fight to bring greater transparency to the negotiation of international trade deals and to ensure that the economic and social merits of all future deals are independently assessed by the Productivity Commission before the parliament is asked to vote on them.\nHaving said all that, winning this seat will not be easy. But then again, you never know \u2013 moderate Liberal, Greens and Labor electors might welcome the chance to have a member in Canberra that reports to them rather than someone who represents a party most of us cannot understand.", "keyword_urls": ["https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/josh-frydenberg", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/energy-australia", "https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment"], "share_count": "0", "description": "The environment in Canberra within the Liberal party is toxic.

Mr Yates stood up and loudly objected to the stunt before angrily leaving the $10,000-a-table event at Melbourne venue Glasshouse.\nMr Yates told Fairfax Media that climate change was \"not a laughing matter\" and the stunt was \"flagrantly immoral\".\n\"If we don't address climate change and start to reduce our emissions, then it's likely that billions of families could be forced to move home unnecessarily,\" Mr Yates said.\nHe \"cannot understand how Liberals would knowingly inflict damage on others when they have a perfectly workable economic cure in front of them\" \u2013 the adoption of clean energy.\nMr Yates lives in the inner-Melbourne electorate of Kooyong, held by Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg. A life-long member of the Liberal Party, he is the son of former federal Liberal MP William Yates and began campaigning for the party at the age of nine. He is the independent director of several emerging renewable energy companies.\nMr Yates said last week's stunt capped off a \"pattern of behaviour\" by the government. He cited a recent review of the national electricity market by Chief Scientist Alan Finkel, who was asked by the government to provide advice using emissions reduction calculations which Mr Yates said were at odds with the internationally agreed goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees.\nMr Yates lamented \"ignorance\" from the party's far right, which had \"hijacked\" the party.\n\"I'm saddened that the party has drifted so far away from core Liberal values,\" Mr Yates said, adding that many in the party shared his views.\n\"If the party will not reform itself from the inside then potentially it has to be reformed from the outside ... there is a meaningful option to create another party which does appear to better reflect Liberal views.\"", "recommendation_count": "0", "in_reply_to": "125276491", "causal_relations": null}, {"id": "125311361", "time_stamp": {"$date": 1548884468000}, "author": "youwillbenext", "author_id": "18539905", "schema_org_type": "http://schema.org/Comment", "text": "My suggestion is why bother.

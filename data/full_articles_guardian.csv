Yale’s environmental performance index ranks countries’ performance in protecting human health and ecosystems, and looks at nine areas including air quality, climate and energy, forests and water resources.
When Australia’s climate change policies were questioned in November, the environment minister relied on the index to defend its record. “The Yale environment performance index, the most credible, scientifically based, hard data-based analysis in the world, ranks Australia number three of 178 countries in terms of our environmental performance,” he told ABC’s 730.
The index’s report, released this week, shows Australia has dropped 10 places overall, leaving it at 13 out of 180 countries examined. 
 It performed worst in the climate and energy category. It was ranked 150th for its trend in carbon emissions each kilowatt hour, leaving only Saudi Arabia behind among wealthy nations. Overall in the climate and energy category, Australia was ranked 82nd.
While global CO2 emissions appear to have dropped in 2015 for the first time during a period of economic growth, Australia’s emissions have continued to grow. 
Mark Butler, Labor’s spokesman on the environment, told Fairfax Media: “The Yale report states that over the last decade ‘nearly every country has improved it’s [index] score’ – every country, that is, except Australia … The Turnbull government is taking Australia backwards at a shocking pace.”
Hunt’s office has been contacted for comment."

The standard would mark a turning point for efforts to regulate fast-growing emissions from airplanes, which are not covered by December’s much-hailed Paris climate agreement.
The milestone would apply to new models and existing aircraft put into production after 2020, but the EU’s preferred version would be less stringent than alternative US proposals, which the Guardian has also seen. Both blueprints have been filed with the UN’s civil aviation agency, Icao, ahead of talks in Montreal next month.
“The US proposal is definitely more ambitious,” said Joris Melkert, a former flight test engineer and senior aerospace lecturer at Delft University in the Netherlands. “It would save more emissions, and the difference is quite considerable.”
The gap between the two proposals is greater than the annual emissions of most medium-sized European countries, and privately confirmed by EU officials. 
Aviation is responsible for around 5% of the world’s global warming at present and the industry is growing so fast that, on current trends, it could make up 22% of global emissions by 2050, according to a recent European Parliament study.
The Icao talks are pursuing a twin track approach of making airlines pay a cost for their CO2 output under a market-based scheme, and greening aircraft with a new fuel efficiency standard.
 The debate on the standard began in 2007 and proposals agreed in Montreal will be sent on to an Icao council for approval next year. “After many years, decision time has finally come,” one EU official said. “I believe that we are going to have an ambitious standard and I hope we can secure it next month.”
Airplanes emit CO2 in the process of burning engine fuel to provide a lift force that can overcome the aerodynamic drag created by wind resistance. For this reason, the Icao proposals focus on measures to improve planes’ aerodynamics, lightness and engines.
Under the technical proposals, a stringency option of ‘9’ suggested by the US would reduce overall aircraft emissions by 37.5%, while the ‘7’ setting favoured by the EU would imply a 33% cut. The 4.5% gap is equal to 350m tonnes of CO2, or slightly more than Spain emits every year.
EU officials privately concede that their proposal is “the second most ambitious of the positions put on the table”. But they insist that it is still “quite close to the US one” and that the agreement’s small print on cargo aircraft and categorisations should not be overlooked. 
Environmentalists argue that the involvement of the Environmental Protection Agency and an unshackled president Obama in the US has contributed to the relative weakness of the EU’s position.
But insiders in Brussels say that the sheer variety of complex issues still to be agreed – and the amount of aircraft manufacturing countries involved, from Brazil and Ukraine to India and China – make like-for-like comparisons unwise, and stringency factors of ‘10’ impossible.
“There are so many parameters to be decided that it creates a lot of pieces you can move around on a chessboard,” one EU source told the Guardian.
Europe has proposed a 60 tonne threshold for classifying aircraft, as this could cover 90% of emissions and apply to aircraft of the size of a Boeing 737 or Airbus 320 and above.
But the classification would be further sub-divided between new model types and those in production; jets ferrying 19 people or less, and planes carrying freight instead of passengers. Alternate starting dates of 2020 and 2023 for the benchmark are other options under discussion.
An EU source said: “We need a standard that reflects the state of art of the technology, that is as close as possible to what engineers are capable of doing, without going so high that a number of 60-tonne aircraft types would be put out of the market as that would be environmentally unhelpful, economically detrimental and also quite unfair, as lead-in times for aircraft take about 10 years.”"

Last year it emerged that Volkswagen had cheated on tests for emissions of nitrogen oxides (chemical name NOx), the name for the toxic gases nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (chemical name NO2), both of which are found in diesel fumes. Paul Willis, managing director of VW UK, told MPs on Wednesday that tackling NO2 emissions could come at the expense of cutting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from cars – the greenhouse gas seen as a major contributor to climate change.
NO2 is responsible for nearly 6,000 annual premature deaths in London, parts of which breached annual limits last week.
“I would say that unless we have a significant diesel mix in Europe, within our fleet, we will miss that target, not VW, the industry will miss that [CO2] target,” said Willis, referring to the EU target of an average new car emitting 95g CO2 per kilometre by 2021, compared to an average of 123.4g CO2 per km in 2014.
Transport is responsible for around a quarter of European Union greenhouse gas emissions, so moves to cut them are seen as vital to climate change efforts.
During an often heated exchange with environment, food and rural affairs committee MPs, Willis defended VW’s environmental record but conceded the company had to win back consumer trust after the revelations last year that 12m of its cars were equipped with “defeat devices” to cheat NOx emissions tests.
“For almost everyone in our company to learn what we learned in September [when the scandal emerged] was very difficult for us to swallow and very difficult for us to understand. I think you heard the apologies I made at that time and I’m still really sorry for that.” He said the company would redouble efforts to win back trust.
But owners of the 1.2m VW cars in the UK affected by the diesel emissions testing scandal should not receive any compensation because they have not suffered any loss, he argued. “To pay compensation, there has to be a loss. At this stage I see no reason for there to be a loss. The adjustment of the software, our engineers are telling us, there will be no difference in in fuel consumption as a result of this fix. 
“The other area is on the question of residual values, I have seen no clear evidence there has been any adverse impact on residual values.”
A survey last year found that nine out of 10 VW drivers in Britain affected by the scandal believed they should receive compensation, in addition to the software fix that VW is rolling out to customers.
Asked whether consumers would begin to factor health into their purchasing decisions, Willis said that pollution emissions were not a priority for most car-buyers.
“I’m sorry to tell you but look at the data and look at what customers’ priorities are when they’re buying vehicles, they don’t talk about NOx,” he said.
He said the scandal had had some effect on its sales in November and December but noted that retail orders in December 2015 were actually higher than orders in December 2014. “I think people know there was an error in the testing regime, and they understand in the real world there was no difference at all,” he said.
Asked how much more NO2 had been emitted as a result of his company cheating on the tests, Willis repeated previous assertions that it was impossible to say because there is no agreed standard for “real world” emissions.
Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, sitting next to Willis, said the technology for testing real world emissions had only been available for two to three years.
Separately on Wednesday, VW’s chief executive Matthias Müller is meeting regulators in Washington to attempt to reach agreement with US authorities on a solution for the affected cars. On Sunday he appeared to downplay the idea the company had cheated tests, telling NPR it was simply a “technical problem” not an “ethical problem”."

The new data is good news for the fight against climate change but bad for the struggling global coal industry.
China saw a huge increase in coal-burning for power and industry in the last two decades but has suffered serious air pollution as a result. However in recent years there has been a surge in low-carbon energy and a slowdown in the economy - GDP growth fell in 2015 to its lowest in 25 years - as China moves away from manufacturing.
The result is that global carbon emissions are set to continue the fall seen in 2015 for the first time outside of worldwide recessions, potentially for many years.
“This trend may continue for 3-5 years or even longer,” said Li Junfeng, director general at the National Climate Change Strategy Research and International Cooperation Centre, a thinktank close to China’s government. “Today’s figures are sending the strong signal of the clear acceleration of China’s energy transition. I think thermal [coal] power generation will continue to drop with an annual speed of 2-4% and the non-fossil power generation will stay in a high growth rate of 20%.”
Tim Buckley, at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said: “The implications of these changes are huge. China’s total emissions are on track to peak potentially a decade earlier than their official target of no later than 2030.
“This comes at the same time that the US has confirmed a 10% year-on-year decline in coal consumption in 2015, plus a three-year moratorium of new federal coal mine leases. That the largest economies globally are moving rapidly in concert to exceed the Paris [climate change] agreement sets a very positive scene for 2016.”
China’s coal use has fallen in 2015 across a wide range of measures and its national carbon emissions are likely to have fallen by about 3% as a result. There was a 3.5% drop in coal production, coal-fired electricity generation fell 2.8% and overall power generation dropped 0.2%, the first fall in 50 years. There were similar decreases in coal-intensive heavy industry such as iron, steel and cement. 
Other recent developments were coal imports to China plummeting by 35% year-on-year in December 2015 and the government’s ban on new coal mines for three years.
In contrast, renewables investment in China hit an all-time high in 2015 at $110bn. Overall low-carbon electricity generation - hydro, wind, nuclear and solar - increased more than 20% in 2015.
“The growth of non-fossil-fuel power generation in China in the past few years is the largest deployment of renewable energy in history,” said Greenpeace’s Lauri Myllyvirta. “This has enabled China to cover a 20% increase in power demand from 2011 to 2015 with clean energy while reducing coal use in the power sector, an astounding achievement.”
Benjamin Sporton, chief executive at the World Coal Association, said: “The cyclical slowdown in economic growth in China is affecting all energy and commodity markets, including coal. Long-term forecasts however show that coal will remain the backbone of the Chinese electricity mix for decades to come and that China will remain the world’s largest producer and consumer of coal.”
He said the International Energy Agency expects coal demand in south-east Asia to grow at 4.6% a year through to 2040.
“Rather than focussing on short-term fluctuations and wishing coal away, it is important to focus on making sure coal is used in the cleanest way possible with high-efficiency low-emission plants using modern emission control technologies and working to develop carbon capture and storage,” Sporton said.
But Li said: “Coal production and consumption [in China] has entered into a turning point since 2014. Even if it bounces back in the future, it will not be big bounce.”
A series of major coal companies have gone bankrupt in recent years, as the international coal price fell by 60% since 2011. The second biggest coal miner in the US, Arch Coal, filed for bankruptcy last week. Investment bank Goldman Sachs declared in January 2015 that the fuel had reached “retirement age”."

For the environment, though, it should at least mean that more fossil fuels stay in the ground";"A decade ago, British civil servants were packed off on a training day about, in a then-fashionable phrase, future-proofing UK plc. The idea was to game the mid-century economy on a range of feasible assumptions, one of which concerned the oil price. There was an “expected case” for 2050 of $45 a barrel, a “best case” of $35 and a “worst case” of $55. So much for the bureaucratic imagination. Over the short years since, the price has twice been more than double the so-called worst case, and then twice also come skidding down by two-thirds.
We are currently in the midst of a great oil collapse, with prices sinking to within touching distance of $30 on Tuesday afternoon, 73% down on 18 months ago. As with every climb up and every slip down the greasy price pole, analysts are scrambling around to figure out whether the change will endure. Nobody can know, but when financial sentiment swings, some always conclude that it will soon swing even harder. The RBS note for investors which this week unleashed a note of panic by advising them to “sell everything” mentioned the possibility of $16 a barrel, a number with little obvious basis apart from being half the current price.
But there are solid reasons why the world has now convinced itself that oil is worth much less than before. On one side of the ledger there is supply, not only of oil itself, but also of the other fossil fuels which can often substitute for it, notably gas, which is more abundant than anyone would have imagined a few years ago, courtesy of the fracking boom. On the demand side, things have been developing even more rapidly, with a serious slowdown in the resource-intensive emerging economies, above all debt-laden China. The fracking revolution will not be reversed, and it increasingly looks like the Chinese flu will be hard to shake. All of which suggests that low oil prices could be here for a while.
So is this a good thing or not? The potentially profound geopolitical consequences are considered in today’s other editorial. Economically, the standard western assumption is that cheap oil is a boon. Certainly, price spikes have arrived shortly before recessions, as in 1973, 1979-80 and 1990. But cheap oil can be a consequence as well as a cause of economic weakness, as it was in 2008, when it became a mere symptom of the great recession. The best that can be said of cheap oil today is that the global slowdown would be sharper without it.
What of the environmental effect? Here, although the story is complex, there is more reason for optimism. Start with the premise of the Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign, that the only way to avoid catastrophic climate change is to leave the bulk of the world’s remaining fossil fuels where they are. Cheap oil encourages waste; worse, it discourages investment in a more efficient “energy infrastructure”. Renewables, as well as upgrades to clean up fossil fuel power stations, yield less return. Drivers feel less pressed to trade in their SUV for a G-Wiz, and car manufacturers are less inclined to concentrate R&amp;D on fuel economy.
But cheap oil also discourages investment in fossil fuel extraction. Already, this week has seen BP scale back its North Sea operation. Indeed, one reason why the Saudis are prepared to endure $30 a barrel is because they hope it will discourage American frackers from switching their focus from gas to oil, and making investments that – once the capital is sunk – become too costly to abandon. If “keeping it in the ground” is indeed the priority, this is the worst outcome of all; by discouraging it, cheap oil is a force to the good.
Bargain-basement energy should also be the spur for far-sighted politicians to act on carbon pricing and other regulations and taxes that can’t be done when prices are high. In Paris last month, world leaders wrote post-dated cheques to the planet. Cheap oil is the opportunity to make a down payment."

The annual assessment of risks conducted by the WEF before its annual meeting in Davos on 20-23 January showed that global warming had catapulted its way to the top of the list of concerns.
A failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation was seen as likely to have a bigger impact than the spread of weapons of mass destruction, water crises, mass involuntary migration and a severe energy price shock – the first time in the 11 years of the Global Risks report that the environment has been in first place. 
The report, prepared by the WEF in collaboration with risk specialists Marsh &amp; McLennan and Zurich Insurance Group, comes a month after the deal signed in Paris to reduce carbon emissions. The WEF said evidence was mounting that inter-connections between risks were becoming stronger. It cited links between climate change and involuntary migration or international security, noting that these often had “major and unpredictable impacts”.
Espen Barth Eide, the WEF’s head of geopolitical affairs, said there was a risk of Europe fragmenting as a result of “people on the move”.
Speaking at a press conference in London to launch the report, Eide said: “I am concerned about the continued support in national politics for keeping Europe together.”
Eide added that if enough countries decided to pursue a non-integrated approach to coping with migration it would have “profound effects on Europe’s politics and its economy”, and would have a knock-on impact on the rest of the world. “If things unravel at the core, what does it mean in other parts of the world?”
Cecilia Reyes, Zurich’s chief risk officer, said: “Climate change is exacerbating more risks than ever before in terms of water crises, food shortages, constrained economic growth, weaker societal cohesion and increased security risks. 
“Meanwhile, geopolitical instability is exposing businesses to cancelled projects, revoked licences, interrupted production, damaged assets and restricted movement of funds across borders. These political conflicts are in turn making the challenge of climate change all the more insurmountable – reducing the potential for political cooperation, as well as diverting resource, innovation and time away from climate change resilience and prevention.” 
The WEF said the broad range of risks – from environmental to geopolitical and economic – was unprecedented. 
It added that risks appeared to be rising, with global average surface temperatures increasing by more than 1C over pre-industrial levels for the first time, and the number of forcibly displaced people at 59.5 million – almost 50% more than in 1940, when the second world war was being fought. “Data from the report appears to support the increased likelihood of risks across the board, with all 24 of the risks continuously measured since 2014 having increased their likelihood scores in the past three years,” the WEF said.
When asked which risk was most likely to materialise in 2016, respondents chose large-scale involuntary migration. This follows last year’s refugee crisis, in which hundreds of thousands of people arrived in Europe fleeing conflicts in the Middle East and north Africa.
This was followed by extreme weather events, climate change, interstate conflict with regional consequences, and major natural catastrophes.
“Events such as Europe’s refugee crisis and terrorist attacks have raised global political instability to its highest level since the cold war,” said John Drzik, president of Marsh Global Risk and Specialties. 
“This is widening the backdrop of uncertainty against which international firms will increasingly be forced to make their strategic decisions. The need for business leaders to consider the implications of these risks on their firm’s footprint, reputation and supply chain has never been more pressing.”
Drzik said at the press conference: “Most risks are rising. It’s a riskier world right now.”"

The eighth-grader argues that the candidates are talking about money, religion and immigration, but rarely mentioning the science challenges impacting her future. Singroy says,
If they talk about the big science issues, maybe they’ll actually do something about them.
Her point is well taken. The Republican and Democratic candidates for president both held debates just days after the Paris climate summit, yet the debate moderators didn’t ask a single question about climate science—remarkable considering that climate change has emerged as a major global science, economic, environmental, tech, civil infrastructure, and foreign policy challenge. US journalists have similarly avoided asking the candidates about other major science, health, tech, and environmental issues.
So Susan, who wants to be a scientist, decided to volunteer with other kids to create what may be the most memorable political ad you’ll see all year:
I’m chair of sciencedebate.org, the volunteer-run nonprofit that produced the ad. We’re working with Susanlyn and other kids elevate these issues in the US political dialogue, because they disproportionately affect the next generation. 
Candidates for president attend debates dedicated to economics and foreign policy, but science issues now have an equal or greater impact. Voters—and their kids—deserve a nationally televised discussion dedicated to science, health, tech and the environment.
The public seems to agree. ScienceDebate.org and Research!America, a nonprofit that advocates for medical research, recently commissioned a national poll. We found that 87% of likely voters think the candidates for president ought to be well versed on science issues. 91% of Democrats, 88% of Republicans and 78% of Independents also said the presidential candidates should participate in a debate to discuss key science-based challenges facing the US. 
What would such a debate look like? The possibilities for questions are fascinating, and could fill hours of discussion. Here’s a small sample:
Americans deserve answers to these questions, and thinking about them now will make the candidates better qualified for the job they seek in November.

Activists caught in legal showdown";"‘Delta Five’ blocked oil train in Washington but say their actions were moral as judge gives them a ‘Hail Mary pass’ to argue a ‘necessity defense’";"A jury in Washington state is hearing evidence on whether the threat of climate change is a justifiable defense for criminal acts, the first time such a defense has been allowed in an American court.
On Thursday, in a tiny municipal courtroom amid the strip malls and ranch houses of this suburban community north of Seattle, defense attorneys for five climate activists will call the final witnesses in their “Hail Mary pass” that has set up a historic legal showdown.
The five activists – Michael LaPointe, Patrick Mazza, Jackie Minchew, Elizabeth Spoerri and Abigail Brockway – face misdemeanor charges of criminal trespass and obstructing a train for a September 2014 protest. The group erected an 18ft metal tripod over railway tracks in Everett, Washington, in order to block train shipments of crude oil and coal. 
The defendants – who have been dubbed the “Delta Five” by their supporters – admit they knowingly broke the law in stopping the train. Their unique legal argument, known as a “necessity defense”, is that their actions were a moral imperative because not breaking the law would result in catastrophic harm to the planet.
Though the necessity defense was used successfully by climate change activists in England in 2008, it has yet to be allowed and tested in a trial in the United States. 
That changed last Thursday when Snohomish County judge Anthony E Howard reversed his own ruling to permit the activists’ lawyers to present the necessity defense after hearing oral arguments from MJ McCallum and Evelyn Chuang. 
Arguing for the necessity defense was a “Hail Mary pass”, said McCallum, and one that, improbably, met its mark.
Whether the jury is allowed to consider that evidence in their deliberations remains uncertain. After the defense testimony concludes on Thursday, the judge will determine how to instruct the jury. It’s then that he will decide whether he’s heard a strong enough case to allow the six-member jury to take the threat of climate change into account in rendering their verdict.

Outside the courtroom on Wednesday, sheriff’s deputies pushed through the narrow corridor, escorting handcuffed men in variations on the Pacific north-west uniform of jeans, flannel, and rain gear, past the crowd of supporters, journalists, and documentary film-makers jockeying for seats inside.
Inside the courtroom, the counsel table in Judge Howard’s six-sided courtroom was excessively crowded with five defendants, four defense attorneys, and prosecutor Adam Sturdivant, who was pushed to the far left end with little space to rest his yellow legal pad and copies of the 2016 Washington Court Rules and Courtroom Handbook on Washington Evidence.
It’s an apt metaphor for the trial itself, in which the everyday machinery of the municipal criminal justice system has been shoved aside for loftier arguments about justice and democracy.
Having opened the door to testimony from climate scientists, Judge Howard also appeared inclined to allow expansive testimony from the defendants. He has permitted each defendant to testify to their personal history as activists, mapping their development from idealistic voters to frustrated believers in the necessity of civil disobedience.
“It felt like projects were being rubber-stamped no matter what we did,” Brockway said of her years spent writing letters to officials and testifying at hearings on environmental issues. “Before I switched to direct action, I felt I worked within the system as much as I could.”
That the defendants exhausted all the legal means of political persuasion available to US citizens in order to achieve their goals is a key factor of the necessity defense, McCallum explained. The defendants must show that they reasonably believed their actions were necessary, that the harm they sought to prevent was greater than the harm of breaking the law, that they didn’t create the laws they broke, and that they had no reasonable legal alternative. 
By eliciting testimony that the activists had no reasonable legal alternative to prevent the catastrophic effects of climate change, the defense team is building a depressing but compelling argument against the efficacy of American democracy and government. 
“The reality of climate urgency will force judges and juries to rethink what is ‘reasonable’, because the process of law is so slow,” said Mary Wood, a professor of environmental law at the University of Oregon. “As scientists urge immediate action to slash carbon emissions, many drawn-out political and legal processes that may have been ‘reasonable’ to pursue two decades ago now extend beyond the short window of time left available to act.”
In the face of these lofty arguments, the prosecutor was stuck on the defensive. In the cross examination, Sturdivant (who declined to speak with the Guardian) asked Gammon whether there was any scientific evidence that illegal protest was more effective than legal protest and asked Brockway whether her arrest had succeeded in drawing a response from Washington’s governor, Jay Inslee. Both Gammon and Brockway answered no. 
As for Millar, who testified at length to the threat of trains carrying crude oil that are “too long, too heavy, and going too fast”, Sturdivant had no questions at all. 
Tim DeChristopher, a 34-year-old climate activist and the closest thing the Snohomish County south district court has had to a celebrity this week, views this trial as “the culmination of seven years of his life”. When DeChristopher enters into a conversation, other activists drift in his direction, just to listen to what he is saying.
Standing outside the court room during a lunch recess, DeChristopher recalls reading about the successful necessity defense in England. In 2008, a jury acquitted six Greenpeace protesters who argued their occupation and damage to a Kingsnorth coal-fired power station in Kent was justified by the threat of climate change. 
Inspired by that case, DeChristopher decided to test his own luck. In December 2008, he infiltrated a Bureau of Land Management auction, bidding on and winning the right to drill on land with no intention of following through with the $1.8m payment. But a judge refused to allow DeChristopher to mount a necessity defense. He was found guilty of defrauding the government in 2011 and eventually served 21 months in jail.
In 2013, DeChristopher helped organize another protest designed to test the necessity defense – this time with two activists using their lobster boat to block the delivery of coal to a New England power plant. The judge in the case decided to allow the defense, but at the last minute, the prosecutor decided to drop the charges, stating that he agreed with the defendants and could not argue against the urgency of climate change. 
DeChristopher says that the Delta Five train protest was designed to bring about a trial such as this one, and he hopes the third time is the charm. He compares the climate movement’s legal strategy to the civil rights and women’s suffrage movements. 
“The legal structure was not designed to address the rights of those people,” he says, until it was forced to change through acts of civil disobedience. “I believe we’re in the same situation. Our legal system was not designed to protect the rights of future generations.”

Worse than the dead birds, though, are the birds seen swimming in the rare pockets of open water along the fast-flowing Susitna and Yentna rivers. These are starving animals still struggling to live, and yet doomed to die prematurely.
Wildlife scientists say the dead and dying birds – 18in tall common murres – are only a few among what might be as many as 100,000 or more of their species losing the battle to survive in the storm-pounded North Pacific Ocean.
Since late summer, thousands of murres have washed up dead on beaches along the Gulf of Alaska after apparently dying at sea. Others were strong enough to get airborne in fall or winter only to be swept inland as seasonal storms roiled the offshore waters.
An estimated 8,000 dead murres showed up on the beaches near Whittier, an isolated community of only about 220 people 60 miles south-east of here. Thousands more were found dead near Homer, a popular summer tourist destination 125 miles to the south that is home to about 5,000 year-round residents.
As yet, no has any clue as to exactly how many carcasses litter the remote and little visited beaches along the hundreds of miles of undeveloped coast that rims the Alaska gulf, according to John Piatt at the Alaska Science Center of the US Geological Survey. The full death count might never be known.
Piatt has spent almost 30 years studying Alaska murres and other seabirds. He has seen big die-offs before. He and other researchers estimated 120,000 murres died of starvation in the winter of 1993. About 185,000 were calculated to have perished after being smeared with a mousse-like emulsion of water and oil that spewed out of Prince William Sound and rampaged north across the gulf after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spilled 11m gallons of crude oil in1989.
What has been different this time is the number of dying murres pushed inland by an oscillating jet stream that has played havoc with Alaska weather for the past two winters. Some blame climate change, but climate experts say it is hard determine whether Alaska is witnessing a long-term shift or only a strange, short-term anomaly in a region where the weather is notoriously unpredictable.
Whichever the case, winds that normally blow west to east across the Pacific have been eddying into a south to north pattern as the atmosphere swirls like a whirlpool in a river. Starving murres still strong enough to get airborne have found themselves caught in warm, moist winds of up to 100mph roaring north out of the gulf into the heart of the 49th state.
Thousands, possibly tens of thousands, of the birds rode these winds until they faded only to find themselves stranded and awaiting death far from their natural habitat. Some birds were pushed over the towering Alaska Range mountains into the bitterly cold Alaska interior hundreds of miles from the sea.
Most, however, came to earth near this city or just to the north in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley. Urban Alaskans rallied to save those found on or adjacent to the state’s few roadways. 
The Bird Treatment and Learning Center here has taken in 411 murres since October, said director Guy Runco. In a normal year, the center handles 600 to 700 birds of all species. One or two of them might be murres. “It’s really strange,’’ Runco said.
Rehabilitating malnourished murres has taxed the center’s finance and its staff of volunteers, and there’s no telling if saving the murres has had any environmental value. Released back into the wild fat and well fed, they could just end up starving again.
Murres need to eat about a fiftieth of their body weight in small fish per day to survive. Piatt and other scientists said the birds are obviously having problems finding enough food. The causes could be a decline in forage fish or simply a shift in where the forage fish feed.
Some have pondered climate change there, too. The forage fish thrive in cold water, and the water in the gulf has been unusually warm this year. It could be the fish declined because of this – or that they moved away from the normal feeding grounds of the murre as they sought cooler waters.
The murre die-off, though dramatic, is not thought to be any threat to the species as a whole given that there are an estimated 2.8 million breeding murres in 230 nesting colonies in Alaska. There are also animals that have benefited from the tragedy of the murres.
“The eagles are eating well,’’ Runco said. Alaska’s bald eagles are notoriously efficient scavengers. So, too, the state’s ravens, magpies, coyotes, foxes, mink, weasels and other animals.
Jean Gabryszak, whose family runs the remote Yentna Station Roadhouse, said: “The ravens are all fat and happy.’’"

“Greenhouse gas emissions are loading the weather dice towards these warmer, wetter winters,” said Friederike Otto, scientific coordinator of the climateprediction.net project, which harnessed the collective power of roughly 70,000 home computers to run thousands of climate models extremely quickly. 
The results, which were analysed at the University of Oxford and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, showed natural variation was equally influential in stocking the storms with rain and hurling them at northern Britain.
“Chance still played a large role in December’s weather,” said Otto, pointing to an abnormally large difference in water temperature in the east and west Atlantic. She said the possible contribution of the massive Pacific El Niño was still uncertain.
Throughout the last month of 2015, a succession of brutal storms - Desmond, Eva and Frank - struck the UK. Farmland and towns in Cumbria, Lancashire, Yorkshire and Scotland were submerged in deadly and heartbreaking floods.
It was the wettest December since records began 105 years before. At the same time, the UK average temperature was 8C, 4.1C above normal. The previous warmest December was in 1934 and was 6C on average.
Some of the rainfall can be explained by what is known as the thermodynamic effect. Warm air can carry more water, which means precipitation events become larger and more frequent in a warmed climate. But this had only increased the risk of such a wet December by around 7%.
The study, which was released publicly before being submitted to a scientific journal, simulated a world in which the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had not occurred and found that in the real world Britain was 50-70% more likely to receive the catastrophic rainfall levels of last month. 
Otto postulated that disturbances of atmospheric pressure systems, caused by warming, was responsible for much of the increased risk. But this analysis had not yet been conducted.
The Met Office’s Peter Stott, who was not involved in the study, said it added further credence to the long-held prediction that climate change would bring wetter conditions to some parts of the globe and could be seen as broadly indicative of the role of climate change in the December floods.
“That is robust,” he said. He said the use of home computers to simultaneously run thousands of experiments dramatically increased the turn around of research, but he cautioned they were not powerful enough to run the most up to date global climate models.
“I think the uncertainty is potentially larger than the 50-75% [indicated in the study],” he said. “We are looking at very extreme parts of the calculations and it’s hard to be precise when we are talking about rare events like this.”
Nick Reynard, lead natural hazard scientist at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said the picture was further complicated trying to link increased rainfall to flooding.
He said rainfall was known to be generally increasing in the UK, but at the same time “there is little compelling evidence for any upward trend in long records of flood magnitude or frequency”. This counter-intuitive finding was due to the differing ways particular catchments respond to heavy rain; some are known to be highly resistant to large events.
The links between extreme weather and climate change are now widely reported in academic papers. So perhaps more remarkable than the findings themselves, is the speed at which scientists are able to draw links between events. In the past, this work has taken months, even years. Thursday’s preliminary study has been released before the waters have even receded and is one of the fastest such analyses ever conducted.
Scientists told the Age newspaper in Australia last year that they were trying to adapt their responses to events in order to fit with the media cycle. Stott said the inclination to release preliminary results was understandable. 
“The media, and people generally, are asking these questions as the flooding is happening or in the immediate aftermath. But we shouldn’t forget that as we seek to have the right policies and advise government about how best to protect ourselves from flooding, for that we need a carefully considered scientific analysis. You’ve got to be careful of over-interpreting very rapid studies,” he said.
Richard Black, the director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank said the emergence of attribution science - our ability to find the fingerprints of climate change in individual weather events - was “one of the most exciting developments in the climate change field”.
“Only a few years ago scientists had to make do with saying things like ’this or that weather event is consistent with what we’d expect’ - but now, increasingly, it’s possible to determine whether climate change is increasing the risks of particular weather events, and by how much,” he said.
“That in turn gives policymakers the economic rationale they need to justify emission reduction programmes, as well as increasing the chances of legal action in future if decision-makers don’t act on the science.”"

Hurricane Alex’s maximum sustained winds were near 85mph (140kmh) and residents of Portugal’s mid-Atlantic Azores islands were warned to expect waves up to 60ft (18 metres) high and wind gusts up to 100mph.
The islands’ Civil Protection Service issued a weather red alert, the highest of four warnings that indicates extreme risk, for five of the archipelago’s nine islands. 
The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami said in a Facebook post there hadn’t been a hurricane present during the month of January since 1955, when Alice formed in late December 1954 and continued into the next month.
The hurricane was centred about 350 miles south of Faial Island in the central Azores and was moving north-north-east at about 22mph. Alex was expected to move near or over parts of the Azores on Friday, the NHC said.
The Azores government on Thursday advised kindergartens to stay closed and told residents to ensure drainage systems were not blocked.
The archipelago, which has a population of about 250,000, has been threatened by hurricanes before, but they usually lose their strength as they move into colder northern water.
Alex formed only days after a rare event in the Pacific. An El Niño-related tropical storm formed south-west of Hawaii last week. Tropical Storm Pali, only the third such system to develop in January in more than 40 years, had weakened to a depression by Thursday and was expected to dissipate in the next day or so. It never made landfall.
Alex’s formation, however, had nothing to do with El Niño, said Mike Halpert, the deputy director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center in the US. 
The NOAA researcher Jim Kossin said the water in which Alex formed was about 1.7C to 2.2C (3F to 4F) warmer than normal, but still barely warm enough for a storm to form."

Speaking at a Guardian Sustainable Business debate on the role of business in tackling climate change, Garrett-Cox, herself an outspoken advocate on the issue, said: “Within the last 12 months, I’ve had conversations with CEOs of major corporates in Europe and they just say, ‘It’s not real, it’s not something I should be bothered about’.” It is “scary” how little discussion there is at boardroom level about whether climate change is a risk at all, she added.
One month on from a landmark climate change deal at UN talks in Paris, Garrett-Cox hopes this will be the tipping point for businesses waking up to climate change. Ikea’s sustainability chief Steve Howard agreed, saying 2016 presents the corporate world with “an unprecedented opportunity” to reinvent its business models in line with the challenge.
However, speaking at the event, the UK’s only Green party MP Caroline Lucas said the government was making this transition more difficult: “This is a government that doesn’t like scrutiny ... and that’s part of the whole way it’s going about its green policies.” 
The UK government has been widely criticised since its election in May for making a series of changes to environmental policy such as scrapping subsidies for onshore wind, ending the green deal scheme that helps homeowners insulate their homes and cutting support for the solar industry, which has since seen a number of firms going into liquidation.
“What this government is doing in the name of being business friendly is constantly moving the goalposts so that no one knows where it’s going to be safe to invest,” she said. “The green economy is actually one of the best places to invest for jobs, to enable us to get out of the economic crisis we face as well as to keep emissions down.”
And moving to a green economy means rethinking consumption patterns, especially in the west, according to Howard . “If we look on a global basis, in the west we have probably hit peak stuff. We talk about peak oil. I’d say we’ve hit peak red meat, peak sugar, peak stuff … peak home furnishings. If you look on a global basis, most people are still poor and most people actually haven’t got to sufficiency yet. There is a global growth opportunity ... but it’s a distribution issue.”
Ikea has hit the headlines for introducing a raft of environmental policies in the last year. It has pledged to invest €1bn (£755m) in renewable energy and measures to help poorer communities deal with the impacts of climate change; announced that 100% of the energy used to power its shops and factories will come from clean sources by 2020; and phased out all non-LED lightbulbs from its stores.
Leading climate change scientist Kevin Anderson, from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Research, was more sceptical and said the idea that the green economy would enable people in the west to consume more was irreconcilable with international climate change commitments.
“At a global level – if you want to see any level of equity around the globe – the idea that people like us can consume and see improvements in material wellbeing is to me not compatible with what the science is telling us about climate change … there are real problems if we try to tell people that, actually, if we’re really clever in the wealthy parts of the world that we can have our cake and eat it. That misunderstands the severity of the challenge we’re facing.”
Anderson said that in the future it could be necessary to introduce a shorter working week, he added.
“Under the current model you need growth because there is a pursuit of productivity, which people always say is a good thing. If we have an increase in productivity that means you have fewer people producing the same number of goods. If you want to then maintain employment you have to maintain growth to have the same number of people employed,” he said.
“So you have to start unpicking all these pieces and saying, ‘Well what would that mean for our society?’ There are different reasons why we might be looking at a world where we have to work fewer hours. We consume fewer goods but we have a higher quality of life in that time that we have available.”

Politicians need to spell out how science will inform their decisions";"Musician Billy Bragg and President Barack Obama would probably enjoy a beer together. “Cynicism is our great enemy,” said Bragg in a 2010 interview. “If we, coming together, can’t overcome our cynicism, then there really is no hope. We just might as well pack up and go home.”
Tuesday night, in his final State of the Union address, Obama spent the majority of his time detailing his legacy and his vision for the nation. The clarion call came towards the end:
It’s easier to be cynical; to accept that change isn’t possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don’t matter. But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future. Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure. As frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don’t look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background. 
They’re both right. Cynicism creates a toxic environment that makes change and community less possible. We hear it from elected officials who say we can’t grow the economy while protecting the environment. We hear it from those who base their decisions regarding refugees on fear, not data. 
The biggest danger, however, comes from our own resignation. We see the deck stacked against us and we give up. We begin to see all government officials and business leaders as part of the same rigged game. We disengage. Nobody wants to be a chump.
So how do we avoid a descent into cynicism? The President’s address offers a few more clues: 
Most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn’t matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some narrow interest.
Obama alluded several times to reducing money in politics. Money doesn’t necessarily buy votes, but it does buy outsized access to shape the agenda. And as more and more dollars flow into the political system, it has become considerably harder to track where the money is coming from. 
Campaign finance reform, however, is not the sole provenance of Congress. There is a step that the President can take right now to create more transparency and accountability: issue an executive order to require federal contractors to disclose their political spending. This move is supported by scores of Democratic legislators. Why won’t he act? 
Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn’t deny Sputnik was up there. We didn’t argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget. We built a space program almost overnight, and twelve years later, we were walking on the moon.
In the wake of the historic Paris climate agreement The Guardian’s Fiona Harvey called “the world’s greatest diplomatic success,” governments and companies worldwide are moving forward with plans to cut carbon emissions and move toward more sustainable energy sources. 
Unfortunately, Congress seems to be moving in the opposite direction. House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith recently attacked the integrity of government climate change scientists, suggesting their research on the surface temperature record was fraudulent. The chairman subpoenaed scientists’ deliberative correspondence, and suggested that the journal Science had some kind of hidden agenda for publishing the peer-reviewed research. He has since temporarily suspended some of his demands. People within Chairman Smith’s party should push back against this behavior, and the Obama administration should continue implement its Climate Action Plan. 
Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise; or when even basic facts are contested, and we listen only to those who agree with us.
We need presidential candidates to talk more about how science will inform their decisions, and whom they will trust for information. Recently, a group of kids filmed a public service announcement detailing the science-based issues that they want the candidates to address: drinking water, vaccinations, honeybees, the war on drugs.
The organization that sponsored that announcement, Science Debate, is trying to get the candidates to address these kinds of issues, and the chair of Science Debate, Shawn Otto, has blogged about the initiative at the Guardian Environment blog. The video is worth a watch. And then it’s worth heading over to Science Debate’s website to endorse their effort. 
Much of what President Obama said concerns the relationship between evidence and democracy. Societies function better when they can unite around a common knowledge base. We should all reject the path of cynicism and the notion that we should stop using our voices to restore science to its rightful place in society.

On Friday, the campaigners were convicted in a court in suburban Seattle of misdemeanor trespassing relating to a September 2014 protest in which they blocked railway tracks used by crude oil trains in Everett, Washington. 
They were acquitted of a second count of misdemeanor obstructing a train.
The so-called “Delta 5” – Michael LaPointe, Patrick Mazza, Jackie Minchew, Elizabeth Spoerri and Abigail Brockway – had hoped that their trial would mark the first time that a US jury was allowed to consider the “necessity defense” in a case of climate activism. 
The defendants intended to argue that their acts, though illegal, were necessary to prevent the greater harm of catastrophic climate change.
But after allowing two days of expert testimony on topics ranging from the Paris climate talks to railway safety standards and the health impacts of particulate matter, Judge Anthony E Howard ruled that the defense had failed to present sufficient evidence to show that the defendants had “no reasonable legal alternative” to trespassing on a private rail yard and blocking trains.
The case is a blow to environmental campaigners but marks the furthest defendants have managed to go in an American courtroom using the so-called “necessity” defense that argues such actions are justified to combat catastrophic climate change. 
The activists progressed unusually far because Howard allowed them to call expert witnesses to testify to the harms of climate change, even though he later felt compelled to instruct the jury to disregard their evidence. The judge appeared to do so reluctantly, expressing some sympathy for the activists in a court on Thursday.
“Frankly the court is convinced that the defendants are far from the problem and are part of the solution to the problem of climate change,” Howard said from the bench. But, he added: “I am bound by legal precedent, no matter what my personal beliefs might be.”
That precedent, including a per se ban on necessity defenses in cases of indirect civil disobedience by the ninth circuit court of appeals, is overwhelmingly against the idea that such an argument should be available to defendants. After his ruling, the judge directed the jury to disregard the expert testimony on climate change, public health, and the dangers of transporting crude oil by train.
In an act of judicial consolation, Howard added that he hoped the defendants, whom he described as “tireless advocates of the kind that we need more of in this society”, would find “some value in having been able to present their beliefs in a public forum”. He also allowed an extra 10 minutes for lunch on Thursday, in recognition of the fact that he had “just crushed your hopes and dreams”. 
Though the necessity defense dominated the proceedings in the courtroom, it is something of a legal oddity that MJ McCallum, Bridge Joyce and Evelyn Chuang – three of the four lawyers on the defense team – recalled learning about in law school through a case of sailors lost at sea who resorted to cannibalism when one of their fellow castaways died of natural causes. (The defendants in Regina v Dudley and Stephens were found guilty when they admitted that they actually murdered the child they ate, but trust a defense team to put a different spin on it.) 
Robert Goldsmith was the sole attorney on the defense team to have argued for necessity, which he did successfully, once, in the 1979 case of 20 protesters who blocked the entrance to the Zion nuclear power plant in Waukegan, Illinois.
Despite the odds, however, the necessity defense remains the holy grail for some climate activists.
“We’re going to keep working with folks to keep pushing these defenses,” said Tim DeChristopher, a climate activist who served 21 months behind bars for a civil disobedience action after a judge refused his attempt to employ the necessity defense. 
DeChristopher’s organization, Climate Disobedience Center, is supporting the efforts of another group that was arrested attempting to block a fracked natural gas pipeline in Westchester County, New York. According to DeChristopher, the protesters will try the necessity defense during a bench trial today, 15 January, in New York. 
The defense has been used successfully in the UK, where a jury acquitted six Greenpeace protesters in 2008 after they argued their occupation and damage to a Kingsnorth coal-fired power station in Kent was justified by the threat of climate change.
Beyond the necessity defense, some climate activists are looking at other strategies in the US to challenge the limitations of statutory law and push for urgent governmental action to limit climate change.
“Our legal principles have to account for the clear, imminent danger perpetrated by the fossil fuel industry,” said Mary Wood, a professor of environmental law at the University of Oregon.
Wood is an advocate for applying “public trust doctrine” to climate change, arguing that a government has a fundamental responsibility to preserve crucial resources like the land, water, and air that “predates statutory law”.
Michael Foster, who attended the Delta Five trial each day, works with Seattle youth who adopted Wood’s theory and sued the Washington state government for failing to adequately protect the environment for their generation.
“The system is broken enough that we have to pursue every other avenue,” Foster said.
In December, a judge issued a ruling in the case, which Foster described as “kickass poetry about the constitutional rights of these kids to air, land, and water”.
Though the loss of the necessity defense in this case was a disappointment, DeChristopher remains hopeful that the law will be pushed to take a different view of climate change civil disobedience. 
“We understand that precedent is not in our favor,” he said, “but we also understand that people’s consciences are hard to oppress.” "

Countries can deliver on the promises of the historic Paris climate change agreement by rapid scaling up wind and solar power to 36% of the global energy mix by 2030, an international energy gathering will be told on Saturday.
The International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) meeting in Abu Dhabi – the first major global gathering since Paris – is seen as an important test of countries’ readiness to put those plans into action.
Nearly 200 countries agreed to keep warming below 2C, and work towards a 1.5C limit, during the Paris climate negotiations last month. Some 187 put forward plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
Now comes the hard part, government officials admit: making good on those promises by translating emissions cutting targets into policies, and expanding access to clean energy technologies.
Irena said those goals were within reach – if countries move fast. Scaling up renewable energy to 36% of the global energy mix by 2030 would provide about half of the emissions reductions needed to hold warming to 2C. Energy efficiency could make up the rest.
“The Paris agreement set a long-term vision for the deep reduction of global emissions and the need to decarbonise the energy sector,” Adnan Amin, Irena’s director general said in a prepared statement. “The Irena assembly must now take the next steps and establish a blueprint for action to meet our climate goals and set the world on a path to a sustainable energy future.”
In an effort to spur countries to action, an Irena report released on Saturday found doubling the share of renewables by 2030 would increase global GDP by up to 1.1% or about $1.3tn, and provide jobs for more than 24 million in the renewable sector.
The United Nations climate chief, Christiana Figueres, has said repeatedly she was looking to the Paris agreement to send a clear signal to the business community of a shift away from a fossil-fuel driven economy.
Some of those changes are already underway. Global clean energy investment attracted a record $329bn last year, according to a report released on Thursday by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. 
The report noted the rise in clean energy investment came despite the drop in oil prices.
Irena officials said they hoped that the Paris climate accord would add momentum to the shift.
“We are not seeing climate change action as a cost, but starting to see it in terms of opportunities,” said Angela Kallhauge, Irena’s climate change officer. "

In her first public reflections on the climate accord signed in December, Christiana Figueres, the UN climate change official, said that after two decades of meandering negotiations, countries had at last discovered their “higher purpose” and risen to the challenge of dealing with global warming.
The Paris agreement, in which 195 countries committed to limiting the temperature increase to well below 2C, set a new standard for dealing with complex global problems, she said.
“Climate change is a very, very good example of how we are moving to a completely new social contract from the last century,” Figueres told the Guardian at a conference hosted by the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) in Abu Dhabi. “The social contract that is going to underpin the 21st century has at least five very, very different ways of dealing with challenges and very different ways of delivering solutions.
 “To have Paris is a huge flame of hope. We can really take some confidence from there that if we decide we want to do something, then we can,” said Figueres, who will step down this summer after guiding the negotiations for six years. “We are not bound by situations we are confronted with. We can rise above them. It’s fantastic.”
A number of key players in the Paris climate deal attended the annual Irena conference at the weekend. 
More than 80 countries committed in their climate plans in Paris to expand their use of solar and wind power as a way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These countries are now looking for financing and technological assistance to make the switch to cleaner energy sources.
Figueres said countries had overcome multiple faultlines to arrive at a deal in Paris – the divide between rich and poor countries, between the public and private sector, between different regions. 
Unlike other negotiations, the Paris climate talks involved governments, business leaders and campaign groups. A number of foreign policy experts have held up Paris as a new model for diplomacy, and commentators have praised the French hosts for skilfully guiding the talks to a successful resolution. “It is the way that we are going to operate increasingly in the 21st century,” Figueres said.
The agreement abandoned the idea of a traditional international treaty with clear rules and fixed obligations, in recognition that the US would never sign on to an agreement that needed approval from a Republican-controlled Senate.
Instead, the agreement relied on countries to come forward with plans for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and then to review those plans at regular intervals to make even deeper cuts. 
Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former US Department of State official and president of the New America Foundation, wrote of the deal in December: “By the standards of a traditional treaty, it falls woefully short. Yet its deficits in this regard are its greatest strengths as a model for effective global governance in the 21st century. The Paris agreement is a sprawling, rolling, overlapping set of national commitments brought about by a broad conglomeration of parties and stakeholders. It is not law. It is a bold move toward public problem-solving on a global scale. And it is the only approach that could work.”
But there have also been a number of high-profile critics of the Paris agreement. James Hansen, the climate scientist, dismissed the agreement as a fraud. Bernie Sanders, the Democratic presidential contender, said the deal went nowhere near far enough. 
Figueres said the 31-page agreement had exceeded her expectations. “The surprise for me was actually the clarity of the text and the way in which governments worked with each other to get to common ideas,” she said. “In previous negotiations, people have got so caught up with the wording itself – this comma, that comma, that verb – that they tripped over themselves and were not able to reach for the stars. In this case they first reached for the stars and then thought: how do we express that?”
She said Paris was the first time in six such climate meetings that she never had a moment when she feared it would all end in a collapse. 
 “At every other one there was at least one moment in which I thought we are going to lose this whole thing,” she said. “This was the first time in which it was so evident that there was overwhelming, not just political will, but political determination to actually come to an agreement.”
And not just an agreement for the sake of it, she said. “The overriding current was getting to an agreement that they could all be proud of. It wasn’t just for a photo.”

Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) and his fellow climate contrarians love the satellite data, but as Carl Mears of the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) satellite dataset and Ben Santer recently wrote,
 they are not thermometers in space. The satellite [temperature] data ... were obtained from so-called Microwave Sounding Units (MSUs), which measure the microwave emissions of oxygen molecules from broad atmospheric layers. Converting this information to estimates of temperature trends has substantial uncertainties.
Scientists process the raw microwave data, applying a model to make numerous adjustments in order to come up with a synthetic estimate of the atmospheric temperature. Climate scientists have identified many errors in the model, and so it’s undergone several major revisions. It’s a complicated process for many reasons discussed in greater detail in this new Skeptical Science myth rebuttal, and by Mears and Santer. 
For example, satellites have a limited lifetime and are replaced (so far there have been 10 different satellites with MSUs); the MSU instruments change - they now use advanced MSUs (AMSUs); their orbits drift and decay due to friction; clouds get in the way; they have to isolate the data from the different layers of the atmosphere, etc.
In a recent Senate hearing, Ted Cruz and one of his witnesses, Judith Curry, claimed “the satellite data are the best data we have.” Most experts disagree.
At first blush the claim sounds plausible. After all, satellites are high tech! But how do we decide which data are “the best”? That’s a subjective question, but we can apply some objective criteria to answer it.
For example, as humans, we might consider the temperature where we live (at the Earth’s surface) the most important. Satellites estimate the temperature of the atmosphere, most of which is above us. In fact, as John Christy, who runs the University of Alabama at Huntsville (UAH) satellite dataset recently said, 
the main product we use now for greenhouse model validation is the temperature of the Mid-Troposphere
The mid-troposphere is the atmospheric layer from about 25,000–50,000 feet, or about 8–15km in altitude. For perspective, the highest point on the Earth’s surface is on Mount Everest at 29,000 feet (8.8km), and the highest elevation city in the world is La Rinconada, Peru at 16,700 feet (5.1km). So, by this criterion, surface temperature data would be “the best;” better than satellite data because they’re more relevant to people.
Maybe we value the data with the least uncertainty. Because of all the processing, adjustments, and modeling involved in creating the synthetic temperature data, satellite trends have far greater uncertainty than the surface temperature datasets. By this criterion, surface temperature data would again be “the best;” about five times better than satellite data.
Or perhaps we think it’s important that different groups processing the same raw data in different ways arrive at consistent final temperature estimates. This is true for surface temperature data, which are analyzed by NASA, NOAA, the Met Office, Berkeley Earth, Cowtan &amp; Way, the Japan Meteorological Agency, and others. These groups all arrive at consistent end results.
On the other hand, different groups processing the same raw satellite data arrive at very different estimates of the warming trend in the atmosphere. By this criterion, again, surface temperatures beat satellites. As Carl Mears has said,
I consider [surface temperature datasets] to be more reliable than satellite datasets (they certainly agree with each other better than the various satellite datasets do!). 
Maybe we consider it important to measure how much humans are warming the entire planet. Only about 2% of the heat trapped by increased greenhouse effect goes into warming the atmosphere; over 90% goes into warming the oceans. By that criterion, ocean heat content data would be “the best;” far better than satellite data.
One benefit noted by proponents of the satellite data is that it’s validated by weather balloons directly measuring the temperature of the atmosphere. The problem is, the weather balloons indicate that the lower atmosphere has continued to warm in recent years, diverging from the satellite synthetic temperature estimates. That’s not much of an argument in favor of the satellite data.
 In fact, the weather balloon data debunks the “no significant warming since 1998” myth that motivates contrarians like Cruz to cherry pick the satellite data in the first place. It’s also worth noting this myth is based on über cherry picking.
So, the surface temperature data are “best” if you value the least uncertain temperature measurements, of the part of the planet where people live, with consistent results among different groups. The ocean heat data content are “best” if you want the most comprehensive measurement of the warming of the Earth.
The satellite data are best … if you want the data that show the least warming.
As Carl Mears notes starting at the 7:35 mark in the above video, 
Look at all the different datasets. You don’t want to trust only the satellite temperatures, you want to look at the surface temperatures and that sort of thing.
Every other data source paints a consistent picture of global warming – surface thermometers, weather balloons, ocean buoys, and even natural thermometers like rising sea levels, melting land and sea ice, and shifting seasons and species habitats. Even the satellites show a long-term warming trend in the atmosphere.
There is a great irony here. Climate contrarians decry necessary adjustments to raw surface temperature data (even though the adjustments reduce the warming trend), and have even launched inquiries, accusing scientists of conspiring to manipulate the surface temperature data. Yet they have no qualms with the more numerous and complex adjustments made the satellite data. Contrarians claim that models are worthless, and yet unwaveringly trust the models used to turn microwave detections into synthetic temperature estimates. 
There’s excessive “skepticism” applied to the surface temperature data and a serious lack of skepticism of the satellite data. There’s a term that describes this behavior: ‘confirmation bias.’ The data that conflict with contrarian worldviews are rejected, while those that conform to their preconceived biases are accepted. 
In the end, Ted Cruz’s claim is rated false by every objective measure."

Does it offer viable solutions to the widening gap between humanitarian needs and available resources? Is the “grand bargain” it offers enough to transform a struggling aid system?
All eyes are on humanitarian financing in 2016. The World Humanitarian Summit in May is fast approaching and the launch of the report comes against a backdrop of the displacement of millions of people in Syria, Yemen, South Sudan, Iraq and other disaster and conflict-affected countries. Their suffering reminds us of the need to get this right fast.
The report contains many good ideas; the strongest and most exciting are those that speak to audiences beyond the usual humanitarian crowd. For example, giving middle-income countries access to grants and low-income loans to finance large-scale refugee hosting, working with the insurance industry to adapt its risk-financing strategies to humanitarian situations, and tapping into the billions of dollars generated each year through Islamic social finance.
Few of the initiatives suggested are new – nor does the panel claim they are. Many have been discussed at length by other groups, and already piloted and reviewed in some cases. But seen together for the first time, and presented as compellingly as they are in the report, they have the potential to expand the responsibility to act beyond the narrow confines of the humanitarian community. The recommendations use finance as a driving force to enrich the aid ecosystem and push for institutional changes to bridge the humanitarian and development divide. This challenge is more pertinent than ever today given the increasingly protracted nature of crises around the world.
 The “grand bargain” comes at the end of the report and may leave many readers asking whether the deal is radical enough. It proposes that the major donors and largest humanitarian organisations commit to make their spending more flexible, efficient, transparent and effective. The bargain is aimed in particular at the five largest government donors of humanitarian assistance, those that supplied over 60% of the international humanitarian resources in 2014; and the six UN agencies that spent nearly half of it.
The logic is that if the giants can get it right, other donors and aid organisations will follow. But starting here does risk establishing the terms of the bargain in favour of these powerful few and thereby entrenching the concentration of funds even further, rather than encouraging a more diverse and equitable distribution of resources as recommended elsewhere in the report. 
There is also the question of those without a seat at the bargaining table. The Gulf states and other emerging donors are clearly a central part of the financing solution. The choice of Dubai for the report launch yesterday reminds us of how important they are. The report is unclear however whether Gulf states are invited to negotiate the terms of the bargain, or to be bound by it. The same goes for international, national and local NGOs – vital links in the chain between UN agencies and crisis-affected populations – who are already asking what their role is in the bargaining process.
The specific components of the bargain also appear to fall short of the panel’s ambition to ensure that resources are found to meet the needs of those most likely to be left behind. We don’t just need more joint assessments between a few big humanitarian agencies, we need a radical rethink of what we know about what makes people vulnerable to crisis in the first place and how to match their needs with the right resources. On transparency, the grand bargain may do something to improve reporting of international humanitarian assistance by a few, but we should aim for more. A bigger vision is required, in which all resources, beyond just international humanitarian resources can be counted. 
Turning the grand bargain into a big deal will clearly be a challenge. Vested interests, competition for scarce resources, and the humanitarian-development divide are as old as aid itself. What’s different now, perhaps, is the window of opportunity that the World Humanitarian Summit has created. Responsibility for taking the panel’s recommendations forward now passes from the hands of technical experts to those of the political and financial decision-makers who will be represented en masse in Istanbul in May. This combined with the scale of the problem, and the reputation and clout of the panel members themselves as they go out and canvass support, may be the tipping point that we’ve all been waiting for. 
The grand bargain will be a central topic of numerous global-level humanitarian meetings in the coming months. Even more interesting will be to see whether the panel’s recommendations get picked up outside of the humanitarian calendar. Will other actors agree that this is too important to ignore, and that they too have a stake in addressing the humanitarian financing gap? If the answer is yes, then the grand bargain may turn out to be a big deal after all.

The ensuing four days of debate will focus on the following themes:
The relentless rise of automation and ever more intelligent machines will be a key issue at the WEF.
The official theme of the 2016 meeting is “mastering the fourth industrial revolution”. That, in WEF-speak, means the “fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital and biological spheres”.
For some Davos attendees, this means business opportunities. Top executives such as Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg will debate how the new industrial revolution could improve industry and society.
But Davos will also look at the threat to white collar jobs, asking if the changes are “failing the middle classes”. Another question is whether we are heading towards “a world without work” – a serious issue given that some experts reckon one in two jobs could eventually be taken by intelligent automation.
More than 7m jobs are at risk in the world’s largest economies over the next five years, according to a WEF report published on Monday, with women losing out more than men as they are less likely to be working in areas where the adoption of new technology will create jobs.
And if the daily trudge through icy Davos does not provide enough shivers, attendees will be told the implications of smart machines going to war. Sir Roger Carr, the chairman of defence giant BAE Systems, will discuss whether robots will become soldiers and generals, along with experts such as Prof Alan Winfield of the University of the West of England.
World leaders and the heads of humanitarian agencies will debate how to address the growing migration crisis and better integrate refugees into the communities who shelter them.
Queen Rania of Jordon will discuss the Middle East turmoil driving millions overseas, as desperate people continue to risk the winter cold and storms by crossing the Mediterranean. The leaders of Iraq and Tunisia are also attending.
The EU foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, and the French minister Emmanuel Macron are to consider whether Europe has been pushed to a tipping point by the crisis and discuss recent terrorist attacks.
John Kerry, the US secretary of state, is giving a keynote speech. Last year, he delivered an electrifying talk on the need to tackle violent extremism and the “monsters” of Islamic State.
But it is not just talk. Delegates can choose to be jolted out of their comfortable existence by spending an hour experiencing a day in the life of a refugee. This has become a regular event at Davos, with some people being moved to tears by a taste of the trauma felt by displaced people. Some former refugees are also on hand to share their stories.
Angela Merkel won’t be signing up, though. With criticism over her refugee policies rising by the day, the chancellor is skipping this year’s event. So Germany’s president, Joachim Gauck, will be carrying the black, red and gold flag instead. 
The stock market rout of 2016 has already made a small dent in the large fortunes of the Davos elite. So there will be plenty of nervous chatter about whether we are heading into a new crash – and whether it can be fended off.
The big worry, of course, is China, with its slowing economy and swelling credit levels. One of the Chinese government’s top market regulators, Fang Xinghai, will update the global elite on wherethe economy is heading, alongside the IMF chief, Christine Lagarde.
Jack Ma, the head of Chinese online retailer Alibaba, could also be in demand for his insights.
With crude prices falling below $30 per barrel, the energy ministers of the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait will talk publicly about how Arab economies can reform to handle cheap oil.
Argentina’s new president, Mauricio Macri, is to discuss how emerging economies could suffer from the turmoil. Macri has just experienced his own painful shock; he is nursing a cracked rib after an incident playing with his daughter. 
No fewer than 10 central bank governors are descending on the ski resort, a chance to consider whether they will need to do more to help the global economy this year.
The WEF hopes to build on the Paris climate deal, agreed in December, by examining how governments and businesses can work together to cut carbon emissions. 
Its annual risk survey found that failing to deal with and prepare for climate change is the biggest single threat facing the world economy. This is the first time in more than a decade that environmental issues have topped the list of worries.
A string of top scientists will be providing technical expertise on how to tackle global warming and create cleaner energy. This includes the Solar Impulse team, which broke the world record for the longest solo flight in an un-refuelled vehicle last summer.
DiCaprio will also be pushing for action; his foundation helps protect threatened ecosystems and funds projects to shield wildlife from the impact of climate change.
Turmoil in the Middle East and in the markets has pushed the eurozone debt problems down the agenda.
But it still provides hope of a verbal punch-up, when the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, and the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, discuss the future of Europe. Memories of last summer’s crisis, where Tsipras was forced into a painful third bailout deal, are still fresh. 
Tsipras is also expected to meet with Lagarde. On the agenda: debt relief and pension reforms. 
The European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, will be giving his own assessment of the eurozone economy on Friday morning, fresh from a governing council meeting the day before.
David Cameron is also attending; Davos could give him an opportunity to push for EU reform ahead of Britain’s referendum on membership. But he could also have his ear bent by business leaders who fear a UK exit.
This annual gathering of the global elite is a perfect opportunity to remind them about wealth inequality.
Oxfam already got the ball rolling before some Davos attendees had even reached the ski resort, with a new report warning that wealth is becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small group of billionaires. 
Save the Children will warn that the fourth industrial revolution risks deepening the gap between rich and poor. That is because automation can destroy job opportunities for those with few educational qualifications, hollowing out labour markets in the developing world. 
The US vice-president, Joe Biden, is heading to Davos to push his “moonshot” initiative to find a cure for cancer.
Biden, leading a heavyweight US delegation, will meet with top scientists, doctors and data researchers in an attempt to speed up the fight against the disease which claimed his son Beau in May 2015.
Last week, Biden said “cancer politics” were holding back progress and called for more data sharing about patient information and treatment outcomes. Davos is an opportunity to push that message.
Ebola will also be on the agenda. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance is expected to announce an agreement with pharmaceuticals company Merck to help prepare for the next outbreak. Last summer, tests showed that Merck’s experimental ebola vaccine was 100% effective in providing immunity to a disease that killed more than 11,000 people last year.
But the world will always face new threats: Bill Gates is to lead a discussion on how to prepare for the next pandemic. 
Davos will see a clash between the authorities, which want closer control of our digital communications, and campaigners, who fear privacy is being eroded.
The US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, and Jürgen Stock, the head of Interpol, will be pushing for closer partnerships with companies and new laws to catch cybercriminals across the globe.
Salil Shetty, the secretary general of Amnesty International, is due to talk about how privacy and secrecy has changed in a world of digital communication and new terrorist threats."

And as he prepares to leave the job on Friday, Ian Chubb has some unflinching parting advice – Australia will inevitably have to adopt tougher greenhouse gas reduction targets.
Chubb is also on the board of the independent Climate Change Authority, which the Abbott government unsuccessfully sought to abolish, and he is convinced Australia will eventually have to adopt targets similar to those advocated by the CCA. 
The CCA found Australia should be cutting emissions by between 40 and 60% by 2030, measured against 2000 levels. Measured the same way the target announced by Tony Abbott and then adopted by Malcolm Turnbull equates to a cut of between 19 and 22%.
“That was solid work and I stand by those recommended targets,” Chubb said in an interview with Guardian Australia.
He said the continuing process set up under the Paris international climate agreement, struck late last year, and Australia’s particular susceptibility to the effects of global warming, meant “we will have to reconsider our target, I cannot see how we could possibly not”.
The Turnbull government has not ruled out increasing its targets as a result of the five-yearly reviews required under the Paris deal but has said it has no plans to do so.
Chubb recalls that he had “a lot of pushback” during the first few months of the Abbott government, “the emails from the usual suspects, people like Maurice Newman [who headed Abbott’s business advisory committee] who continue to believe [climate change] is all some vast conspiracy involving thousands of scientists around the world”.
In 2014 Chubb suggested Newman should “stick to economics rather than “trawl the internet” for papers questioning the overwhelming scientific opinion on global warming.
But Chubb said his conversations with the former prime minister himself had always been “rational and reasonable.”
“I was surprised at some of Tony Abbott’s public comments about climate change and some of his government’s initial responses and policies ... because [Abbott] and I talked about climate change quite rationally and reasonably,” Chubb said.
“He didn’t necessarily agree with me, we tried to persuade one another, but his questions were primarily about the modelling and the sensitivity of the climate to CO2 and how to build policy around the range of the projections.”
He also referred to a controversy over claims of threats against climate scientists at the Australian National University, where he had been chancellor.
“I was also questioned in the early stages because there was a suggestion that some scientists at the ANU had received death threats,” Chubb said. 
“I never said there had [been] death threats but their offices were open to the street and I thought it sensible to move them to offices accessed with a swipe card. The Australian newspaper spent a long time running FOIs [freedom of information requests] on that. I think they wanted to prove that I’d somehow timed the release of the information for a particular purpose, which was of course ludicrous.”
But Chubb says the antagonism towards climate science was easing.
“The debate here and overseas is much more sensible now, the sheer weight of scientific evidence is having a bearing,” he said.
He said he had also been deeply disappointed by the science funding cuts announced in Abbott’s first budget but was happy that the last budget and the recent innovation statement had seen some “selective reinvestment”.
Chubb will be succeeded by Dr Alan Finkel, an engineer and former neuroscience research fellow who has served as the chancellor of Monash University since 2008. Chubb has been chief scientist since 2011.
Catriona Jackson, the chief executive officer of Science and Technology Australia, thanked Chubb for his advocacy.
“There have been some difficult times for science and scientists in the past decade from virulent well-organised climate scepticism to a lack of interest in science,” she said. “The fact that that has turned around in Australia is very significantly attributable to Ian Chubb and his relentless energy.” 
The industry minister, Christopher Pyne, congratulated him on his “excellent term”.

As they work to reduce emissions, governments and public agencies – which often lack the resources to tackle the weighty global warming problem alone – are increasingly looking to the private sector for help, says Robert Puentes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program thinktank. 
“Tackling climate change – particularly from a transportation perspective – will require these kinds of partnerships largely because traditional governments and public agencies are underperforming,” Puentes said. “The public sector often does not have the capacity or expertise to design, finance, execute and sustain policies that work, so these partnerships are helping fill the vacuum with a new kind of problem solving.”
In one of the most recent examples, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, a consortium of the world’s largest cities, has enlisted an unusual partner to help reduce tailpipe emissions: MasterCard. It’s one of the largest public-private partnerships aimed at fighting climate change so far.
The consortium – which includes more than 80 cities around the world, including London, Bangkok, Cape Town, New York and San Francisco – says its members collectively emit over 300m tons of carbon dioxide per year from transportation alone, or close to Poland’s total emissions from fossil fuels.
The partnership, announced last month, will set up what’s called a mobility management network, which will connect city staff members to each other and to experts to come up with ideas to nudge people to use public transportation more often. 
“These types of measures are all relatively low-cost, compared to investing in a new transport infrastructure, and are therefore of interest to a number of cities,” says Gunjan Parik, director of C40’s Transportation Initiative. “They also allow money to flow back into city coffers to deliver further improvements to public transit.”
Through face-to-face workshops and other events, as well as virtually through webinars, phone calls and a private online forum, cities and transportation experts will have ample opportunities to share their knowledge and brainstorm for answers on topics including parking, ticketing, congestion and integrating different modes of transportation.
MasterCard is working with cities to enable commuters to pay for bus and subway fares more easily, instead of needing to buy tickets in a separate step or having to carry cash or exact change. In London, for example, the company has helped create a system in which riders can use contactless bank cards or mobile phones to pay for fares. 
“Around 85% of the world’s transactions are still done in cash, which not only weighs as an inconvenience and a cost on our economies, but also facilitates crime,” says Hany Fam, president of MasterCard Enterprise Partnerships. A study by Tuft University found that using cash costs American society about $200bn per year, from fees paid for using ATMs to lost tax revenues from unreported transactions. 
C40 officials said their approach to solving transportation problems has achieved success in other initiatives. San Francisco created SFpark programme, which adjusts meter and garage pricing according to demand, helps drivers find available parking spaces quickly and reduces air pollution and congestion in the process. Milan’s Area C programme, which requires each vehicle that enters the city center on weekdays to pay a roughly €5 ($5.46) congestion charge, reduced the number of cars entering the restricted area by nearly one third this year compared to 2011, before the program was launched.
According to Fam, the success of the initiative with MasterCard will be measured over the next three years by looking at the number of lessons shared and adopted between cities and assessing how much these sustainable transportation projects contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions in cities. 
“The biggest thing we can do to truly make a difference in terms of emissions is to get people out of single occupancy vehicles and using whatever combination of bike sharing, walking, shuttles and so on,” said Sharon Feigon, executive director of the Shared Use Mobility Center, a national, public interest organization which advocates for car- and bike-sharing. “All of these modes together are enormously more efficient than the private automobile.”
While new payment systems can greatly improve the public transportation system, they alone aren’t enough to nudge people to forego driving or owning cars. Finding the right strategies to encourage people to take buses and trains is a big challenge. It remains to be seen whether simpler payments and better communication will make a significant difference.
“Information and technology transfer is very important in the adoption of shared mobility concepts,” said Susan Shaheen, adjunct professor and co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley. 
“It’s going to take many different strategies to accomplish these goals, and we need a vast set of transportation options.”"

Despite concerns about its impact on extreme weather events, such as recent flooding in the UK, climate change failed to register near the top of the list of business threats, according to a survey of 1,400 CEOs from around the world compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and published at Davos this week. 
Instead, over-regulation was listed as the biggest threat to business (by 79% of CEOs), followed by geopolitical uncertainty (74%) and other key threats including cyber attacks (61%). 
In contrast, climate change and environmental damage was mentioned as a threat to business growth by just 50% of CEOs.
The findings were similar to a separate survey of 13,000 business leaders produced by the World Economic Forum (WEF). It also found a relative absence of concern about climate change and environmental risk amongst business leaders.
Business leaders from developed countries listed fiscal crisis and cyber-attacks as their biggest concerns, while in emerging and developing economies the biggest concern was unemployment, underemployment and energy price shocks. “No executive considers failure of climate mitigation and adaptation as the number one risk for doing business in his/her country,” states the report.
By contrast, a wider survey of economists, academics and civil society also produced by the WEF listed climate change as the biggest potential threat to the global economy in 2016. A failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation was seen as likely to have a bigger impact than the spread of weapons of mass destruction, water crises, mass involuntary migration and a severe energy price shock.
PwC suggested that contrary to its findings CEOs were concerned about the impact of climate change. “We don’t believe a low score in one question reflects overall thinking and action on it,” a spokesperson told the Guardian. “A quarter of all CEOs included ‘reduced environmental impacts’ in the three outcomes that should be joint government and business priorities in the countries in which they are based... and they are showing greater understanding of environmental impacts in their business and supply chain.” 
PwC said the results from this year’s survey also revealed a higher level of concern of climate change amongst CEOs than they did after the UN summit on climate change in Copenhagen in 2009 (50% vs 37%)."

But to me, these people are heroes. The 13 women and men on trial this week for cutting through the perimeter fence around Heathrow airport and chaining themselves together on a runway were excoriated by police, passengers and politicians. (One of the defendants in the case is a member of the cooperative society that rents my house.) If convicted, they all face a possible prison sentence. But there are two trials here: the legal proceedings in a local magistrates court, and a test of something much bigger.
Aviation enjoys some astonishing exemptions from the civilising rules that constrain other sectors. Other industries must limit the noise they make; but aircraft, thanks to an obscure clause in the 1949 Civil Aviation Act, are exempt. Other industries pay duty on the fuel they use; but even when air passenger duty is subtracted, aviation’s various tax holidays amount to a subsidy of some £7bn a year, forgone by the Treasury. Some industries must limit the air pollution they produce; but while in principle airports are subject to pollution laws, in practice they have been allowed to breach them routinely for years. (In this case the legal immunity also seems to extend to motor traffic.)
Most importantly, international flights are free from all climate constraints. They are covered by neither domestic legislation nor international agreements. There are no targets, no timetables, no limits. Airlines operate in a legislative vacuum, a transnational, extralegal limbo, accountable nowhere and to no one. As a result they threaten everything that was agreed at December’s climate talks in Paris.
Aviation accounts for roughly 6% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions, and 2% of the carbon dioxide produced by people globally. But as this industry expands while emissions from other sectors are cut, a study commissioned by the European parliament expects it to produce 22% of the world’s CO2 emissions by 2050, unless there is a sharp change in policy. That’s enough to push us past the thresholds our governments promised to avoid.
At one point the draft Paris agreement contained a paragraph about aviation and shipping (another unregulated industry). By December this paragraph had disappeared, without public explanation or debate. The final agreement simply fails to mention either industry.
Governments left the issue instead to the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation, a body whose apparent purpose is not to make progress but to impede it. Dominated by the industry it is supposed to regulate, its work is an exercise in finely calibrated uselessness: it makes just enough noise to create the impression of something being done, without actually changing anything.
It has three main policies. The first is to offset the greenhouse gases planes release by encouraging other sectors to make bigger cuts, in lieu of those that aviation refuses to accept. It’s not just that this policy is likely to be unachievable, as the targets agreed for other sectors in Paris will be tough enough to reach. It is also unjust. Why should this sector, used mostly by the world’s richer people, be allowed to dump its responsibilities on the rest of the economy?
The second is replacing mineral jet fuel with biofuel. Already road fuels made from plants have helped to destroy the forests of Indonesia and west Africa, strip soil off the land, evict local farmers and spread starvation, as plantations of palm oil, maize, sugar cane and other crops grown to feed cars have replaced those grown to feed people. Already, governments envisage covering great tracts of the planet’s surface with energy crops to burn in power stations: a plan that’s as fanciful as it is destructive. Now they want to power planes this way as well? Will any corners of the planet be reserved for food production and wildlife?
The organisation’s third policy is promoting speculative and often unfeasible aviation technologies, that are highly unlikely to materialise. Perhaps we could call them mumbo-jumbo jets.
Because of the physical and technological constraints, the only way in which we can realistically reduce aviation’s greenhouse gases is to fly less. You might not have imagined, in the 21st century, that we would still need to hoist 180lb of human flesh 30,000 feet into the air every time we want a conversation. I’ve been limiting my own flights to one return ticket every three years. Yes, it has sometimes cost me opportunities and income, but this restraint has made me no less happy or fulfilled. If we can only challenge our sense of entitlement, I believe we inflict no damage on our lives by taking to the air less often.
But rather than seeking to manage demand, our government, like most others, aims only to meet its own inflated forecasts. It claims that the 219m passenger journeys through the UK’s airports in 2011 will rise to 445m by 2050, and it hopes to build enough capacity to accommodate them. In doing so, it vitiates every promise it has made about preventing climate breakdown.
Last month the government delayed its decision on a third runway at Heathrow, ostensibly because of concerns about local pollution (though the real reason was to avoid sabotaging the Conservative candidate’s campaign to become London mayor). But this represents no change in policy: Cameron intends to build the new capacity somewhere, even if it’s not in west London.
Each of aviation’s exemptions is a democratic deficit: a failure to hold the industry responsible for the harms it causes. So what are citizens to do, where the writ of government does not run? Sit back and watch? By doing so, we commit a disservice to democracy. A breach of the contract between state and citizens becomes normalised and ratified by our inaction.
Two verdicts will emerge from this trial. One will concern the legal status of what the protesters did, and there is no way of knowing what it will be. The other will concern the moral status. I suspect that if they are locked up then history will pass the same verdict upon them as it has passed upon suffragettes, Chartists, the pioneers of trade unionism, and civil and gay rights activists. Vilified, prosecuted, but – in the court of public opinion – ultimately vindicated: this is what happens to the heroes of democracy."

DiCaprio used an awards ceremony to demand more action on climate change, decrying those who deny it is a problem. And he insisted fossil fuels must be kept in the ground – backing a campaign launched by the Guardian last year.
After picking up a crystal award for his work on environmentalism, the actor explained he had seen the devastation caused by climate change firsthand, from melting glaciers in the Arctic to farmers whose crops had been washed away.
DiCaprio is tipped for Oscar success this year for his role in the bleak and gritty drama The Revenant. And he gave energy bosses a similar savaging.
In front of world leaders, business chiefs and campaigners, DiCaprio said:
We simply cannot afford to allow the corporate greed of the coal, oil and gas industries to determine the future of humanity. Those entities with a financial interest in preserving this destructive system have denied, and even covered up the evidence of our changing climate.
Enough is enough. You know better. The world knows better. History will place the blame for this devastation squarely at their feet.”
The solution to limiting global warming, he added, is to leave oil, gas and coal reserves alone:
Our planet cannot be saved unless we leave fossil fuels in the ground where they belong. Twenty years ago, we described this problem as an addiction. Today, we possess the means to end this reliance.”
DiCaprio also announced that his foundation was making $15m of fresh grants to support environmental protection. That includes funding to protect 6.5 million acres of rainforest on Sumatra from the “invasive and destructive practices” of the palm oil industry.
DiCaprio was one of four winners of a Crystal award at WEF this year. The fund also recognised Chinese actor Yao Chen for her work raising public awareness of the refugee, artist Olafur Eliasson, and musician will.i.am for his i.am angel Foundation, which tries to keep young underprivileged young people in education, and out of trouble.
Accepting his award, will.i.am joked he had grown up near gangs, but had kept out of them as he was more scared of his mother than the gang leaders. His dream is that a child in one of America’s poorest regions could become the next tech pioneer."

The contrarian scientists that were invited to testify are members of a shrinking tribe that every year has to work harder to deny the clear evidence of a human-caused warming world.
Those scientists were William Happer, Judith Curry, and John Christy. They argued that the Earth isn’t warming (or has slowed its warming) or that satellite temperature measurements are the best way to measure the Earth’s temperatures. In fact, satellites don’t measure temperature at all, but these witnesses didn’t mention that fact. 
Additionally, the satellite measurements that they showed are from the middle of the troposphere, high in the atmosphere (not at the surface). Finally, the contrarians declined to emphasize that the synthetic satellite temperature data have been wrong for years. The upper part of the atmosphere (stratosphere) is cooling as a result of the increased greenhouse gases while the lower layer (the troposphere) is warming. If any measurements of the stratosphere bleed into the measurements of the troposphere, it can cause a cooling bias.
I had the (dis)pleasure of testifying at a hearing in Minnesota where William Happer also testified. He, Roy Spencer, and Richard Lindzen all made errors in their testimony that were repeated at the Cruz congressional hearing. At the Minnesota hearing, these contrarians were representing Peabody Energy – the world’s largest private sector coal company.
They focused on high-altitude temperatures in the tropical part of the globe (near the equator) rather than temperatures at the surface or in the oceans. But it gets even worse – they combined two sets of satellite data into a single curve when in reality, satellite temperature measurements differ by as much as a factor of four depending on whose data you use! 
The figure below is nearly identical to Figure 9 Exhibit 2 in Richard Lindzen’s direct testimony, and similar to Figure 3 in Exhibit 2 to Roy Spencer’s Direct Testimony. You can see the schedule for the testimony here and access the filed court documents. My rebuttal testimony is available here and my surrebuttal is here. Climate scientist Andrew Dessler also testified at the hearing and his reports can be found here and here.
As I wrote last year and submitted in my court filings, the table below shows the huge spread amongst various satellite measurements. Why didn’t the contrarians point this out? Why do they only use the coldest two datasets? Why didn’t Roy Spencer tell the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission that his work has been found to be wrong multiple times? 
Why does this Peabody Coal case in Minnesota matter? Well, the same arguments were made by Ted Cruz and his contrarian witnesses in December in Washington DC. You can watch the video here. You can read John Christy’s testimony here. You can read Judith Curry’s written testimony here. The similarity between this group of contrarian documents is shocking. It is almost as if portions of their testimony were cut and paste. 
I am not really surprised the Ted Cruz would question climate science. And I am not surprised the well-known contrarians Judith Curry, John Christy, William Happer, Roy Spencer, and Richard Lindzen continue to question the mainstream expert consensus. I am not really surprised that some of these scientists are representing fossil fuel companies in litigation or hearings. What I am surprised about is that they are being so selective in presenting data and not telling the full story.
For instance, why don’t Roy Spencer and John Christy tell these judges and panels that they have had to revise their own temperature estimates several times over the past two decades when other scientists identified errors in their model? They originally claimed that the atmosphere was cooling, and now their data shows it is warming.
Why do these contrarians mislead by only showing some groups’ satellite temperature estimates while omitting others? Why do they neglect temperature measurements in the oceans and Earth’s surface where the warming is clear? Why do they falsely claim that there has been a halt or even a slowdown in overall global warming when no such halt or even slowdown has occurred, and in fact the warming is accelerating?
Why do some of these witnesses refer to their own publications after they were shown to be hugely in error, containing undergraduate-level math errors? Why don’t these contrarians and Ted Cruz tell us that the referenced satellite temperature recording team (Remote Sensing Systems) disagree with the way their dataset is being used?
I invite readers to view this great video created by Peter Sinclair which includes interviews from many real experts who discuss this very issue in a clear and understandable way. 
It will be interesting to see what the next contrarian argument is. They have retreated to higher and higher elevations in the atmosphere to run away from the reality of global warming. At some point, you’d expect they will reach escape velocity."

The group of Plane Stupid supporters are accused of cutting a hole in a fence and chaining themselves to railings on the north runway in July 2015. 
Labour MP McDonnell was due to be called as a defence witness in the case but his evidence was deemed irrelevant by the judge. McDonnell, whose Hayes and Harlington constituency includes the UK’s largest airport, is strongly opposed to the proposed third runway at Heathrow. 
District judge Deborah Wright said: “It (his witness statement) gives an opinion about the debate around the expansion of Heathrow and talks about the benefits of direct action, which he says may cause short term inconvenience.
“In order to allow his evidence to be given I have to be able to say that it is relevant. I am therefore not going to allow Mr McDonnell to give live evidence.” 
The activists are on trial at Willesden Magistrates Court charged with aggravated trespass and entering a security restricted area of an aerodrome. 
They admit being on the runway but claim their actions were necessary to stop people dying from the effects of pollution and climate change. 
One of the campaigners, Kara Moses, an environmental journalist, said they were wearing nappies in case they needed to go to the toilet during the protest. She said the group planned to block the runway all day and stop “hundreds” of planes from taking off. 
Wright asked: “If you thought you were going to be there all day, how were you going to address basic needs such as going to the toilet?” 
There was laughter from some of the defendants in the dock as Moses replied: “We were wearing nappies, madam.” 
The demonstration at around 3.30am on July 13 2015 caused delays for passengers around the world and 25 flights were cancelled. It came after a long-awaited report recommended a new runway should be built at Heathrow rather than Gatwick. 
Another protester Edward Thacker, a community worker and teaching assistant, said it was a “social justice” issue and he felt “compelled” to blockade the runway.
Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, who joined protesters outside court on the first day of the trial, was a character witness for one of the defendants, Melanie Strickland. In a statement read to the court she said Strickland was a “passionate, committed and knowledgeable” advocate of human rights issues and has written to her a number of times about climate change. 
Green party London mayoral candidate Sian Berry was also due to be a defence witness but her evidence was also ruled inadmissible.
It is alleged that on 13 July 2015 the defendants entered the northern runway at London Heathrow Airport, having trespassed on the land, and in relation to a lawful activity, namely the operations of landing and departing of aircraft which persons were engaged in on that land, did an act, namely erected a temporary structure and locked themselves to it, or within it, with the intent of disrupting that activity. 
The second charge alleges that they entered a security restricted area of an aerodrome without permission. 
The trial will resume at 10am on Monday when Wright is due to return verdicts in the case."

Data released on Wednesday by the UK Met Office shows the average global temperature in 2015 was 0.75C higher than the long-term average between 1961 and 1990, much higher than the 0.57C in 2014, which itself was a record. The Met Office also expects 2016 to set a new record, meaning the global temperature records will have been broken for three years running.
Temperature data released in the US on Wednesday by Nasa and by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) also showed 2015 shattered previous records.
Experts warned that the record-breaking heat shows global warming is driving the world’s climate into “uncharted territory” and that it showed the urgency of implementing the carbon-cutting pledges made by the world’s governments in Paris in December.
Heatwaves have scorched China, Russia, Australia, the Middle East and parts of South America in the last two years, while climate change made the UK’s record December rainfall, which caused devastating floods, 50-75% more likely.
The Paris agreement commits the world’s nations to limit warming to below 2C compared to pre-industrial times, or 1.5C if possible, to avoid widespread and dangerous impacts. But the Met Office data, when compared to global temperatures before fossil fuel burning took off, shows that 2015 was already 1C higher.
A strong El Niño event is peaking at the moment, putting the “icing on the cake” of high global temperatures. El Niño is a natural cycle of warming in the Pacific Ocean which has a global impact on weather. But scientists are clear that the vast majority of the warming seen in 2015 was due to the emissions from human activity.
“Even without an El Niño, this would have been the warmest year on record,” said Prof Gavin Schmidt, director at Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. He said he expected the long trend of rising global temperatures to continue because its principal cause – fossil fuel burning – was also continuing.
“It is clear that human influence is driving our climate into uncharted territory,” said Prof Phil Jones, from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit, which produces the temperature record – called HadCRUT4 – with the Met Office. Peter Stott, at the Met Office’s Hadley Centre, said 2015 was the first year global average temperature was more than 1C above pre-industrial levels.
Noaa’s global temperature records stretch back to 1880 and it also found 2015 was the hottest year yet, beating the previous high by a record margin. The agency also found December was warmer than any other month in the record, when compared to long-term averages. Ten of the 12 months in 2015 had record high temperatures for their respective months, according to Noaa.
Nasa’s new data for 2015 also shattered its previous record and showed 15 of the 16 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001.
“Climate change is the challenge of our generation,” said Nasa head Charles Bolden. “Today’s announcement is a key data point that should make policymakers stand up and take notice - now is the time to act.”
 The Nasa, Noaa and HadCRUT4 temperature records all use independent methods to calculate the global average. They use many thousands of temperature measurements taken across the globe, on land and at sea, each day.
There are uncertainties in the measurements, partly due to fewer measurements in the polar regions, and these are included in the calculations. Stott said: “Remaining uncertainties are clearly much smaller than the overall warming seen since pre-industrial times.” Another independent temperature record, from the Japan Meteorological Agency, indicates 2015 was by far the hottest year on record.
Bob Ward, at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said: “This [record heat] should put pressure on governments to urgently implement their commitments to act against climate change, and to increase their planned cuts of greenhouse gases. The warming is already affecting the climate around the world, including dangerous shifts in extreme weather events. Those who claim that climate change is either not happening, or is not dangerous, have been conclusively proven wrong by the meteorological evidence around the world.”
Despite constantly rising greenhouse gas emissions trapping ever more heat on Earth, the last decade has seen relatively slow warming of air temperatures, dubbed a “pause” in climate change by some. In fact, global warming had not paused at all.
Instead, natural climate cycles led to more of the trapped heat being stored in the oceans (which already absorbed most the heat), some of which El Niño is now releasing. Scientists usually assess changes in climate over decades, rather than years, and the each of the last four decades has been warmer than any decade on record before. 
“It’s the long term warming trend we need to worry about rather than one hot year,” said Prof Piers Forster, at the University of Leeds in the UK. “So we shouldn’t get too excited - but it is certainly a sign of things to come.”"

Through the contributions of 188 countries, as well as thousands of additional commitments from states and cities, companies, foundations and international organisations, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change has given the world an ambitious goal for climate action.
The UN climate talks in Paris created important political momentum to get something meaningful done on climate change – momentum that is vital to spur aggressive emissions reduction and to cement a “clean” development dimension to the new sustainable development goals (SDGs) agreed in September.
The agenda for delivering this development now rightly intertwines inclusive economic growth, ambitious improvements in our social infrastructure for education, gender parity and improved health, as well as lower emissions.
The question now arises: how do we actually deliver this?
The challenge is enormous. The Paris Agreement recognises that the sum of countries’ Intended Nationally Determined Commitments (INDCs) for climate action, as it stands, will not be enough to keep within the agreed goal of staying below a 2°C rise.
The extra climate commitments made at Paris by countries and “non-state actors” – businesses, investors, cities, provinces and various action alliances – can provide a strong additional contribution to the INDCs, but these actors face daunting challenges because many of these commitments are interdependent. Industry often benefits from and needs policy reform to help transform to zero-emissions systems, governments usually need private and public finance these days, and financiers need well-structured projects, championed by the public and the private sector, to invest in.
In many cases success will be possible only through bold collaborations with diverse actors – public and private, incumbent and innovator, domestic and international. Think about the scale of new policies, projects and finance that will be required to move the world’s major cities towards becoming clean, sustainable urban systems by 2030. That’s the scale of the challenge the sustainable development goals and Paris Agreement have set us.
This ambitious new landscape requires innovative and to some extent unprecedented collaboration. Even those within the United Nations and other global organisations such as the World Bank recognise it will take more than the efforts of, for example, UNEP, the UNDP, and the UNFCCC to meet the new combined environment, development and climate goals.
Likewise, the CEOs of even the largest companies committed to climate action acknowledge the important role of governments (at city, state, national and international levels) to help them accelerate action. The Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition is a good example of this new environment. Through interaction between international organisations, governments and companies, about 40 countries and 23 regions, states and cities now have mechanisms to put a price on carbon, representing about 12% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This alliance would have been unthinkable even five years ago.
Talk about the potential of such public-private partnerships and alliances abounds. To mobilise the resources, innovation and actors required to start delivering a clean, sustainable development agenda as soon as possible it is generally accepted that we require a new kind of operating system for development. Indeed, goal 17 promotes a new global partnership agenda for action to meet all the other goals. 
We will need a community of action to create new public-private networks and platforms in order to identify and deliver specific, large-scale partnerships across a number of key global economic sectors and geographies, particularly in emerging economies. There is no longer a “long-term” development agenda. Rather, the international community has constructed a “time-to-goal” global initiative – a decade-long delivery imperative for the public and private sectors to carry out together to meet both climate and development goals.
At the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos this week, numerous meetings will bring together public, private and civil society leaders to forge and advance these new alliances. These are not abstract activities. The platforms for public-private cooperation provided by the World Economic Forum Global Challenge Initiatives have achieved many things over the past year, such as the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), the Tropical Forest Alliance, and Grow Africa and Grow Asia addressing food security. 
All these initiatives will meet in Davos this week to help activate a new global delivery agenda. The overarching theme – Mastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution – will explore the sweeping changes created by digitisation and new technologies, including for delivery of the SDGs. Davos will be a meeting where the desire among global business leaders and investors to accelerate these new models into new markets, intersects with the desires of governments and the international community to start work on the new climate and sustainable development goals.
The common ground is new models for delivery. Will history look back on Davos 2016 as the dawn of a new delivery decade? Let’s hope so.

 “We don’t have the facts yet, but I think that there is enough that has been revealed that it’s totally appropriate that (California) be conducting this investigation,” Steyer told the Guardian. “Anybody who puts out intentionally misleading information I think should be answering to us.”
 Steyer’s comments came hours after the Los Angeles Times reported that California’s attorney general, Kamala Harris, is looking into what ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest oil company, knew about climate change going as far back as the early 1980s. 
 Harris’s office declined to comment on the report, writing in an email: “We can’t comment on any ongoing or potential investigation,” according to press secretary Rachele Huennekens.
 Previously published reports suggest ExxonMobil may have spent millions over 27 years to publicly promote opposition to climate change science while privately basing strategies and business models around it.
 The Guardian reported in July on a company email from Exxon’s in-house climate expert that provided evidence that the company was aware, over a generation ago, of the connection between fossil fuels and climate change, and the potential for carbon-cutting regulations that could hurt its bottom line. It may have factored that knowledge into its decision about a large gas field in southeast Asia. The field, off the coast of Indonesia, would have been the single largest source of global warming pollution at the time.
New York’s attorney general is also conducting a similar probe into ExxonMobil based on previously published reports by the Los Angeles Times and the Columbia University Energy and Environmental Reporting Fellowship.
 But, Steyer said, California, as the “largest and most populous state” offers a “particularly strong platform” to increase the reach of any investigation. 
 “I’m not a lawyer but I believe the laws in California are different and give our attorney general a lot of leeway in terms of how she approaches it,” he said. 
 RL Miller, chair of the California Democratic party’s environmental caucus, added that the Los Angeles and Ventura Democratic party recently passed a resolution she wrote calling on Harris to investigate ExxonMobil. Harris is currently running for US Senate and will seek the party’s endorsement during its February convention.
 “I wanted to bring it up with Democrats because if she wants the Democrats’ endorsements, she needs to listen to Democrats,” said Miller of her outreach to Harris. 
 Like other climate change activists, Steyer also linked ExxonMobil’s alleged cover-up to similar scandals in the tobacco industry, which for many years fought to deny the negative health effects of smoking. 
 With climate change, “there is obviously a gigantic impact on the entire world and all the people of the world”, said Steyer. “It’s a society being misled.”"

Two winters with little rain, followed by completely dry springs and summers have left livestock producers in the west Wimmera and southern Grampians with record low levels of water storage, Tim Leeming, a farmer and regional chair of the Southern Australia Meat Research Council told Guardian Australia.
The region has the highest concentration of red meat production in the country, and produces 40% of Australia’s lamb, Leeming said. 
“If there is a mild winter and another failed spring this year, there will be hell to pay. It will be mega serious,” he said. “Producers will be forced into another agricultural enterprise like cropping – and that’s out of their skill set and not really supported by the landscape.
“You hesitate to mention climate change but we all know that in the last decade we’ve experienced the latest-breaking season in 40 years, we’ve experienced the wettest season in 65 years and two failed springs in a row – that has never occurred before.”
Leeming is calling for councils and the state government to build a pipeline to the nearby Rocklands reservoir, currently used to provide water for regions further north.
Jonathan Pollock, a climatologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, confirmed that the region had broken several records for dry weather and said it was most likely a result of climate change. 
“Rainfall in Victoria’s south-west was average to below average in December, but it also happened to be the warmest on record for most or all of that area, too,” he said. Record dry weather was also seen there in winter and spring of 2015, Pollock said. “Looking further back, parts of south-west Victoria are the driest on record at 18-month and 39-month time spans.”
The Bureau of Meteorology said in its most recent drought statement the dry weather was unlikely to be a result of natural changes and is probably due to climate change. 
“This suggests the tendency for recurrent dry conditions is less related to variations such as El Niño, and more due to other changes in the climate system,” it said. “Research suggests that long-term drying trends over southern Australia cannot be explained by natural variability alone.”"

What is more, it thwarts Brussels’ strategy to develop the clean technology in Europe.
That was the message from industry experts to lawmakers at a parliamentary committee hearing in London on Wednesday.
“There is a strategic risk for the UK in not developing capability in this area,” warned Luke Warren, head of the CCS Association.
Reeling from the unexpected cancellation of a £1bn (US$1.4bn) competition in November’s spending review, he pleaded for coherent policy.
That money had been destined to develop up to two projects at commercial scale. In the running were a coal-fired and a gas-fired plant, known as White Rose and Peterhead respectively.
White Rose had also won €300m (US$330m) from the European commission’s NER300 programme, which has repeatedly tried to back CCS without success. That money will be returned to the pot now UK funding has collapsed, according to finance director Richard Simon-Lewis.
While the demonstration projects were undeniably expensive, it was argued they were essential to bring costs down and meet climate goals in the long run.
The UK has a legally binding target to cut greenhouse gas emissions at least 80% from 1990 levels by 2050.
Prime minister David Cameron previously described the technology as “absolutely crucial” to meet that target. Earlier this month, he defended the U-turn, saying: “The economics at the moment really aren’t working.”
In a tight budget, CCS was judged to represent poor value compared to other infrastructure plans.
“There seems to be a view in government that we can afford to wait and buy CCS from other countries,” said Chris Littlecott of thinktank E3G. “It misses the point completely, of CCS as strategic infrastructure.”
The UK could buy in technology to capture CO2, he said, but the pipeline network to pump it under the North Sea required national planning.
On top of the £1bn upfront cash, the axed projects were in line for power generation subsidies. Known as “contracts for difference”, these were set up to support a range of low carbon technologies, including nuclear and renewables.
As a significant market intervention, it needed “state aid” approval from Brussels. This was duly awarded in 2014, on the basis that different technologies would be competing for cash, minimising market distortions.
Since then, however, the Conservative government has barred onshore windfarms and solar power from the mix, on the grounds of consumer cost.
Now CCS is also out of the picture, Littlecott told Climate Home “there are big questions” over the validity of that state aid clearance.
Controversially, Hinkley Point new nuclear plant is still in line for 35 years of subsidy. French state-owned company EDF is expected to make a final investment decision next week, Reuters reports.
Along with offshore wind, nuclear has enjoyed the most consistent support from Conservative ministers of any power source. Even so, the flagship atomic venture has been repeatedly delayed and is not certain to go ahead.
Accused of double standards in parliament earlier this week, energy minister Andrea Leadsom pinned the blame for high consumer bills squarely on renewables.
She said: “I find it extraordinary that Labour members seem to equate the deployment of renewables with decarbonisation. That is simply not the case.
“They fail to recognise that fuel poverty and endless renewables subsidies go hand in hand.”
The argument met with weary frustration from the renewables sector, which is facing job losses under the hostile policy shift.
Maf Smith, deputy chief executive of industry group RenewableUK, said: “Onshore wind is now one of the cheapest of all sources of power, which means that not supporting wind means higher bills for consumers.
“The government’s own advisors, the committee on climate change, says onshore wind is cost competitive with new gas and subsidy-free, and that offshore wind will become cheaper than gas during the next decade.”"

It’s an increasingly urgent question as the services proliferate, but the answer is currently unclear .
The companies have held their data close and are only now beginning to share, making it hard to assess critical questions like how people would have gotten to their destinations if Uber and Lyft did not exist.
A few researchers are making headway. A team at the University of California, Berkeley, is looking into the climate impacts of Uber and Lyft, with results due out in the fall. Unusually, the researchers will get access to data from both companies and, just as importantly, from their members (AKA riders).
Susan Shaheen, a Berkeley adjunct professor whose team is working on the project in partnership with the Natural Resources Defense Council, says: “With the companies, one of the most important things is to gain access to those members.”
Key questions for the Berkeley study include how long the trips are (as well as the time driving to pick up a passenger); whether the rider would otherwise have driven alone, taken public transportation or not have taken the trip at all; and the fuel efficiency of the vehicles involved.
The researchers will not look at congestion or at conventional air pollutants (such as nitrogen oxides or fine particles) generated by the vehicles. “There’s a lot of different angles that we could be studying here,” Shaheen says.
Everyone has an opinion on Uber and Lyft, but research results can be surprising. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration feared that Uber was worsening traffic congestion in New York. But a report released by the city this month found that on-demand ride services like Uber and Lyft “did not drive the recent increase in congestion” in parts of Manhattan. The displacement of taxis was an important effect of the services.
In terms of the environment, early research suggests that companies like Lyft and Uber may have a positive impact, according to Juan Matute, a transportation expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. That’s partly because people may take public transit more often if they are certain they can later use a ride service. For example, someone might take a commuter train to work rather than drive because they know they can get home even if they miss the last train.
Some people also use Uber and Lyft to get to or from public transportation. “In some cases 25% of trips in a region (or more) start or end near transit, including such places as New York City, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Philadelphia,” an Uber spokesperson said in an emailed comment.
However, some people take trips with Uber or Lyft when they might have stayed home, which is bad for the environment. In 2014, Shaheen and other Berkeley researchers found that 8% of 380 passengers surveyed in San Francisco used on-demand ride services to take trips they would not have taken otherwise. On the other hand, half of all ride-service trips in the survey carried more than one passenger – that’s a far higher rate than for taxis. (However, the 2014 Berkeley survey was carried out before carpooling services like UberPool and Lyft Line launched in San Francisco. Those services, which bring together strangers in a shared ride, may be the services’ most effective tool for cutting emissions.)
The environmental calculus could change in the future, according to Matute. Currently, he said, it’s more expensive to use Uber or Lyft than to drive one’s own car. If the ride services became dramatically cheaper – which could happen if the vehicles contained advertising or eventually became self-driving – trips with the ride companies would become even more popular than they otherwise would have been.
Right now, “it’s still very expensive for somebody to exclusively rely on these services in any market”, Matute said.
Another factor is the type of car used by Uber and Lyft drivers. Some people hypothesize that since Lyft and Uber require cars to be relatively new – with the oldest models being from 2004 or 2005 – they may be less polluting than the vehicles owned by the general population, since cars in the United States are more than 11 years old on average. (The owners of Uber and Lyft cars also have an incentive for fuel-efficiency, since they must pay for gas.) 
The car companies, unsurprisingly, are bullish on their environmental impact. “By using Lyft to share rides, passengers are helping to reduce the carbon footprint left by our country’s dominant mode of transportation – driving alone,” said Tommy Hayes, the transportation policy manager at Lyft, in an emailed statement. Lyft will also help accelerate the uptake of green technologies like electrification and vehicle automation, he said.
Uber emphasizes that it is helping to reduce the need for personal car ownership. “Uber helps use today’s existing infrastructure more efficiently at no extra cost by getting more butts into the backseats of fewer cars,” a company spokesperson says.
What is clear is that the on-demand ride market is evolving so rapidly that studies will become outdated almost as soon as they are produced. When Uber or Lyft first comes to a city, riders use those services differently from how they use them in the second or third year, says Shaheen of Berkeley. With the advent of UberPool and Lyft Line, as well as the eventual potential of self-driving cars, the future is anyone’s guess.

The high level panel on water will find ways to coordinate the often piecemeal political decisions made by the plethora of regulators, governments, companies and individuals who draw from dwindling water reserves. It will also raise a widely-neglected problem to the highest level of political discourse.
“Water is a precious resource, crucial to realising the sustainable development goals, which at their heart aim to eradicate poverty,” said Ban, who announced the formation of the panel alongside the president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, at a special session of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos this morning.
“The new panel can help motivate the action we need to turn ideas into reality,” he said, adding that countries needed to take the lead on tackling the problem.
The panel will meet regularly between now and 2018 and will be chaired by the presidents of Mexico and Mauritius, Enrique Peña Nieto and Ameenah Gurib-Fakim. The two presidents were chosen for their countries’ diverse and representative water challenges. Mexico faces large scale water shortages associated with its booming developing economy, and as a small island state, Mauritius is especially vulnerable to climate change and the many water issues that come with a warming world and rising sea levels.
A further eight heads of state from the developed and developing world will be invited by Ban to join the panel. It is intended they will develop an agenda focused on tangible changes. One example given was the sway the heads of state will have over the operations of the World Bank. As shareholders and clients, heads of state are in a unique position to advise the bank on problems with the way water projects are funded.
“Achieving the water global goal would have multiple benefits, including laying the foundations for food and energy security, sustainable urbanisation, and ultimately climate security,” said Kim. “My hope is that this panel accelerates action in many countries so that we can make water more accessible to all.”
The politics of water can be divisive, and competition for the resource has become a serious threat to stability in water-scarce regions in parts of Africa, the Middle East and south Asia. 
“We are already seeing elements of water scarcity coming through - not just because of climate change, but [because of] over-abstraction. We are seeing stress points - social tensions or conflicts over a lack of access to water,” said Dominic Waughray, head of public-private partnerships at the World Economic Forum.
According to the UN, 90% of all disasters are water related and by 2050 the world will have just 60% of the water it needs. At last year’s announcement of the SDGs, the UN set its sights on delivering “water and sanitation for all” by 2030, but the issue is rarely discussed by those with the power to address it, said Waughray.
“There has never been a coordinated political momentum. Even when it gets to water ministers, they are sometimes not the most influential ministers in a cabinet. The water community might have done a very good job of analysing the problem and coming up with solutions, but it has never broken through politically at the highest level, at scale, in developed and developing countries,” he said.
The session in Davos was chaired by the former prime minister of Australia, Kevin Rudd. Rudd told the Guardian that water had not reached the top level of political discourse because there were “too many other pressing challenges”.
“But time is now right,” he said. “Climate change has now focused on the unfolding water crisis. As well as its impact on national security arising from water scarcity. We are now seeking to translate the sustainable development goals on water into reality.”
Rudd said the heads of state could build partnerships with the private sector and ensure investment in infrastructure could be found.
Attending the session, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman of Nestlé and chair of the 2030 Water Resources Group, said: “The mark of success for the panel will be practical action and tangible impact. Let this be an opportunity to break down silos at the highest level and collaborate with private sector and others.”

The conservative magnate’s departure from one of the US’s pre-eminent science museums was cheered by climate scientists and activists who have campaigned for the museum to cut ties with fossil fuel companies and those who head them.
A spokesperson for the museum, Roberto Lebron, told the Guardian that Koch’s term on the board ended on 9 December, at the trustees’ annual meeting. 
“This change was one of several that took effect at the meeting as part of the normal course of business,” Lebron said.
Cristyne Nicholas, a spokeswoman for Koch, said the billionaire was “honored to have served on the board” and to have helped make possible the museum’s dinosaur halls, which bear his name. She added that Koch plans to prioritize contributions to cancer research, and noted some $250m in donations to New York hospitals.
Elsewhere, Nicholas denied that Koch was at all moved by calls for his resignation.
Activists and some scientists nonetheless hailed a victory for their cause, which won national attention last year when dozens of scientists signed an open letter that singled out Koch. The scientists – including climatologist James Hansen, ecologist George Woodwell, and three Nobel laureates – called for science institutions to sever relations with fossil-fuel interests. 
“I think his name is still associated with the dinosaur hall, which with his political opinions is in some ways appropriate,” said Judith Weis, a signatory and marine biologist at Rutgers University. 
“This is one little chink out” of the divestment campaign, Weis said. “There’s a lot more still going on, a lot more museums.”
Beka Economopoulos, a campaign organizer and director of the mobile and politically minded Natural History Museum, said: “Regardless of the reason for his decision, it’s a step in the right direction.”
“We think the letter provoked some sector-wide soul searching, so we’re kind of happy that the American Museum of Natural History no longer has this figure there.”
Citing a petition that has received more than 200,000 signatures, Economopoulos added: “I’m not attributing the decision to [activists], but I think it’s safe to say he stepped down in the context of a lot of public pressure.”
A 2013 Drexel University study found that Charles and David Koch, along with ExxonMobil and a network of donor foundations, poured hundreds of millions into efforts to deny the reality of climate change, which the overwhelming majority of American and international scientists agree threatens life around the planet. 
The brothers also back a conservative group that recently declared its only climate change “hero” to be senator Ted Cruz of Texas, an opponent of environmental regulation who recently asked whether climate science was based on “data or dogma”. 
The Kochs’s conservative contributions, including $122m for Republican campaigns in the 2012 election and an $889m budget for 2016, have largely overshadowed their support for reforming immigration and the criminal justice system.
David Koch remains on the advisory board of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, where his name adorns the Hall of Human Origins. 
In response to scientists’ calls to cut ties with its rightwing donor last year, the Smithsonian released a statement that said: “Donors and supporters have no influence on the content or presentation of Smithsonian exhibitions, regardless of their private interests.”
The institution also repeated its official statement on climate change, that says “many decades of scientific research [point] to human activities as a cause of global warming”.
Koch is also a major funder for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where his donations have occasionally provoked protests."

Beetles dine on bird carcasses and gulls fight for scraps under a glaring sun in what marshes remain.
Lake Poopó was officially declared evaporated in December. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people have lost their livelihoods and gone.
High on Bolivia’s semi-arid Andean plains at 3,700 metres (more than 12,000 feet) and long subject to climatic whims, the shallow saline lake has essentially dried up before only to rebound to twice the area of Los Angeles.
But recovery may no longer be possible, scientists say.
“This is a picture of the future of climate change,” says Dirk Hoffman, a German glaciologist who studies how rising temperatures from the burning of fossil fuels has accelerated glacial melting in Bolivia.
As Andean glaciers disappear, so do the sources of Poopó’s water. But other factors are in play in the demise of Bolivia’s second-largest body of water behind Lake Titicaca.
Drought caused by the recurrent El Niño meteorological phenomenon is considered the main driver. Authorities say another factor is the diversion of water from Poopó’s tributaries, mostly for mining but also for agriculture.
More than 100 families have sold their sheep, llamas and alpaca, set aside their fishing nets and quit the former lakeside village of Untavi over the past three years, draining it of well over half its population. Only the elderly remain.
“There’s no future here,” says 29-year-old Juvenal Gutierrez, who moved to a nearby town where he has taken a job as a motorcycle taxi driver.
Record-keeping on the lake’s history goes back only a century, and there is no good tally of the people displaced by its disappearance. At least 3,250 people have received humanitarian aid, the governor’s office says.
Poopó is now down to 2% of its former water level, regional governor Victor Hugo Vasquez calculates. Its maximum depth once reached five metres (16ft). Field biologists say 75 species of birds are gone from the lake.
While Poopó has suffered El Niño-fuelled droughts for millennia, its fragile ecosystem has experienced unprecedented stress in the past three decades. Temperatures have risen by about 1 degree Celsius while mining activity has pinched the flow of tributaries, increasing sediment.
Florida Institute of Technology biologist Mark B. Bush says the long-term trend of warming and drying threatens the entire Andean highlands.
A 2010 study he co-wrote for the journal Global Change Biology said Bolivia’s capital, La Paz, could face catastrophic drought this century. It predicted “inhospitable arid climates” would lessen available food and water this century for the more than 3 million inhabitants of Bolivia’s highlands.
A study by the German consortium Gitec-Cobodes determined that Poopó received 161bn fewer litres of water in 2013 than required to maintain equilibrium.
“Irreversible changes in ecosystems could occur, causing massive emigration and greater conflicts,” said the study commissioned by Bolivia’s government.
The head of a local citizens’ group that tried to save Poopó, Angel Flores, says authorities ignored warnings. “Something could have been done to prevent the disaster. Mining companies have been diverting water since 1982,” he says.
President Evo Morales has sought to deflect criticism he bears some responsibility, suggesting Poopó could come back.
“My father told me about crossing the lake on a bicycle once when it dried up,” he said in December after returning from the UN-sponsored climate conference in Paris.
Environmentalists and local activists say the government mismanaged fragile water resources and ignored rampant pollution from mining, Bolivia’s second export earner after natural gas. More than 100 mines are upstream and Huanuni, Bolivia’s biggest state-owned tin mine, was among those dumping untreated tailings into Poopó’s tributaries.
After thousands of fish died in late 2014, the Universidad Tecnica in the nearby state capital of Oruro found Poopó had unsafe levels of heavy metals, including cadmium and lead.
The president of Bolivia’s National Chamber of Mining, Saturnino Ramos, said any blame by the industry was “insignificant compared to climate change.” He said most of the sediment shallowing Poopo’s tributaries was natural, not from mining.
In hopes of bringing it back, Morales’ government has asked the European Union for $140m for water treatment plants for the Poopó watershed and to dredge tributaries led by the Desaguadero, which flows from Lake Titicaca.
But critics say it may be too late.
“I don’t think we’ll be seeing the azure mirror of Poopó again,” said Milton Perez, a Universidad Tecnica researcher. “I think we’ve lost it.”"

A scant covering, on unfrozen soil, but enough for the children to tumble out into snowballs, snowman building and careering down north facing slopes on a variety of contraptions; that is until they rub the snow away.
Harper’s Brook is a significant tributary of the Nene, winding south-east from Corby, down a shallow valley, past Brigstock, Sudborough and Lowick, before jagging north and joining the Nene at Aldwincle. Between Sudborough and Lowick the valley floor is mostly still grazing land. One field contains a couple of dozen young Suffolk rams, thick set, black legs and head, and characteristically long and droopy black ears. They loaf about in little squads, watching us with mock disinterest.
At Lowick the valley is dominated by the pale yellow stone of the substantial and elegant St Peter’s church tower. It has an octagonal “lantern” top storey, like the better known Fotheringhay church, but this structure is surrounded and braced by four large, pencil sharp turrets, one on each corner of the penultimate tower storey.
A new agricultural enterprise nestles next to Lowick – row upon row of straight, tensioned wires, over which are draped the crooked and curled brown stems of grape vines. This is perhaps not as unusual as it at first feels; vine pollen has been found in Roman deposits at Wollaston, a site just a few miles upstream on the Nene. While wine production in the UK more or less ceased in the first half of the 20th century, there is now a scatter of midland vineyards that stretches north, even into Yorkshire. Some of the vineyards have been operational for 15 years or more, including one just three miles away from the Roman vineyard site at Wollaston.
Humans will adapt to a climate change by replacing crops that get harder to grow with others that are better adapted to the new conditions. Time will tell if vines and wines become a major part of Northamptonshire agriculture, but it is good that people are venturing and skills are being developed."

Laurent Fabius, who steered December’s UN talks, wants heads of state to ratify the accord at a meeting in April in New York, so that it can be enshrined in international law. Nations accounting for more than 55% of global emissions must formally sign up before the Paris agreement can be made official. 
He told the Guardian he had discussed the plans with UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon a few days ago, gaining his support, and was “pretty confident” that heads of government would attend what would be the third leaders’ climate summit in a little over six months.  “We should have the leaders there, to give a new impulse [to the implementation of the accord],” he said of the New York meeting, which he will preside over. “At the first day of Paris [which leaders attended] there was a tremendous push. It’s time for a new push in April.”  Fabius is acutely aware that, despite the success of the Paris negotiations, much more needs to be done before the future of the accord is secure. “There are many things which can go wrong,” he told the Guardian. “We have to avoid being lazy. We have to be calm, and to be hopeful. We have to talk to developing countries.” He pointed to the need to tackle emissions from aviation and maritime transport, which were omitted from the UN talks, and which he said are urgent.
 More work is needed on setting out clear rules on how to monitor emissions in a “transparent” fashion, he said. African countries must be assured that they are receiving the support that was promised to them at Paris. Businesses must also receive cooperation from governments to develop new clean technologies that will be “decisive” in bringing down emissions.  Fabius also called for a renewed focus on the possibility of putting a price on carbon, pointing to a Chinese plan to institute a national system of carbon trading from next year. This would be a major step forward, he said. At Paris, 196 countries agreed to limit greenhouse gases in line with scientific advice, to avoid temperature rises of more than 2C, and to review their commitments and progress on meeting them every five years. This framework is legally binding, and most countries - including all the biggest emitters - also set out national targets for emissions, to 2025 or 2030.  Fabius addressed the European parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday, asking MEPs for their continued support for plans for the EU to meet its obligations on greenhouse gas emissions. He set out “four Ps” which he said are needed to implement the Paris agreement: the process of ratification of the accord, including the April meeting; clarifying the principles underlying the agreement, such as a precise definition of climate change financing, rules on the conduct of the five-year reviews and the transparency of monitoring emissions; the pre-2020 period, during which countries must make progress on their existing emissions goals; and preparing for this November’s UN climate conference, ‘COP22’. The success of the Paris conference was a rare bright moment in a dark end to 2015 for France, scarred by the terrorist attacks in November that left 130 people dead and scores more wounded. Fabius hailed the agreement as a triumph for international cooperation. “This is about security and peace,” he said. “There are massive risks to global warming, which could lead to widespread conflict. We have to stop that risk from becoming reality. That means this agreement was actually about peace for future generations, and current generations. This is a chaotic world, and a dangerous one. The Paris agreement is making the world safer.” Relaxed in a fashionably high-collared brown leather jacket as he travelled by French government plane to a snow-covered Strasbourg, Fabius reflected that the signing of the Paris accord had been just a beginning, though a very important one. 
“We need to look for concrete measures now,” he said. “I think that will arrive. The shift [to tackling climate change] has been made now, and there will be no turning back.”  For the year ahead, Fabius has a punishing schedule of climate meetings as part of his role as president of the COP, which under UN convention continues until COP22 in November. After the summit in April there will be a meeting in Germany in May to discuss some of the details of the accord, then a further conference in Washington DC in May or June hosted by the US, followed by a meeting of local authorities from around the world in Nantes, France, in September, as well as meetings held with the IMF and World Bank, and the UN general assembly in September. During that time, it is widely expected that Fabius will leave his post as foreign minister, perhaps to be succeeded by his long-time rival Ségolène Royal. He has been tipped in France as a potential future candidate for UN secretary-general, with his steering of the Paris conference having burnished his credentials.
Though he declined to speculate on his future, Fabius noted that he could remain COP president without being French foreign minister."

He said that because Trump was operating so “far outside” the political campaigns to which the company’s guidelines usually applied, and because he was saying things so obviously false, or overtly anti-Muslim, it was quite factual for reporters to call him, for example, a “mendacious racist” even though they wouldn’t normally use those kinds of terms about a candidate.
Using the same logic, it seems quite reasonable to say Clive Palmer – our own allegedly mega-rich and megalomaniac anti-politician – has taken the entire political system for a ride.
The latest example of how we are all being played for fools is the fact that his Palmer United Party sucked $21m in political donations from his 100% owned Queensland Yabulu nickel refinery before going into administration. The federal government has offered $500,000 to help 237 workers have been sacked but if the company cannot trade out of its problems and goes into liquidation then the rest of the workforce would almost certainly be able to access the federal government’s fair entitlements guarantee program and cost the government millions more. Oh, and he didn’t have to provide a bond for rehabilitating the polluted tailing dams and that could cost the Queensland government many more millions. This equation really doesn’t work out so well for us taxpayers.
Which shouldn’t be surprisingly really since the whole Palmer juggernaut has always been about Clive.
He effectively bought the balance of power in the Senate, spending $28.9m on the 2013 election and the Western Australian Senate rerun, most of which went on saturation advertising which in some cases promised things he would never have had the power to deliver, like getting WA voters more revenue from the GST. And despite poor polling though the campaign, those ads, in the final weeks, made the difference. He won his lower house seat and three spots in the Senate. 
As well as promising things he couldn’t do, he didn’t do some of the few things he had coherently promised. His election platform, for example, said he opposed offshore processing of asylum seekers. But he (and the two senators he had at a time) provided the deciding votes to pass a bill that dramatically increased the powers of the government to implement its offshore processing policy while avoiding the reach of the UN convention on refugees.
He was the anti-politician who would protect the “little guy”. Which is hard to reconcile with his party’s support for things like axing the government contribution of $500 a year to the superannuation accounts of the lowest income earners, from 2017.
And his position and rationale on other things changed according to political convenience. 
His senators provided the necessary votes for the abolition of the carbon and mining taxes, an obvious conflict of interest for a would-be miner and owner of a high-emitting nickel refinery that for a long time had an outstanding $8m carbon tax debt. He also provided the votes to pass the Coalition’s alternative Direct Action scheme, which as it stands is demonstrably inadequate to meet Australia’s greenhouse gas reduction promises while imposing no restrictions or costs on polluting industries, like, say, his Yabulu nickel refinery.
At the time, he also claimed he was some kind of born-again climate crusader – memorably appearing beside Al Gore – by “forcing” the government to ask the Climate Change Authority (a body it wanted to abolish) to prepare a report on alternative emissions reductions schemes, which it will deliver this year. To be fair, he did make tangible contributions, from an environmental point of view, by refusing to abolish the CCA and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which did at least preserve some institutional common sense.
But for the most part, in those days before his Senate voting bloc fell apart and all but one of the senators he had bankrolled went their own way, he engaged in last minute, high drama, chaotic negotiations, which maximised his publicity but mostly delivered “concessions” that were bad public policy or contradictory to the message he had given voters. I called it the Palmer pattern.
And as for representing the voters of his Queensland seat of Fairfax, for his own part in the lower house he hardly voted at all. He cast a vote in just 6.8% of divisions according to the OpenAustralia Foundation.
His whole tactic was to play the media, and the system, in a similar but slightly less spectacular way to Trump – luring journalists with all manner of publicity seeking stunts and then attacking them as part of the biased Canberra elite when they tried to hold him to account or point out the many things about his campaign that made no sense. And then, holding the Senate votes that could make or break legislation, the government and the opposition were also forced to pay due deference to the will of the electorate, as expressed through Palmer’s semi-coherent positions.
And – as well as many reports of his publicity seeking antics – there were also many attempts to hold him to account. Hedley Thomas in the Australian, in particular wrote numerous articles about his business interests and other questionable claims. Many journalists, myself included, called out his conflicts of interest, his inconsistent behaviour and his confused policy pronouncements, after he entered politics.
And while he never quite stooped to Trump’s treatment of the media, Palmer used the same tactics of attacking critics in order to ignore them. In the case of the Australian, he alleged a campaign motivated by things he had said about Rupert Murdoch’s former wife Wendy Deng. In the case of other interviewers he famously stormed out when the questioning got too hard, including from a 7.30 interview with Sarah Ferguson and another with Lateline’s Emma Alberici. In my own case he became belligerent and declared that I was a “naive girl” when I pressed him on a policy.
Palmer is by no means Australia’s first populist politician. And he didn’t go nearly as far as Trump in mocking the idea of accountability and truthfulness and threatening and abusing critics, which is forcing media and politicians in the US into the kind of assessments in the Buzzfeed memo.
US academic Jay Rosen, in this thought provoking blog on the topic, argues part of the answer is for political journalism to reconsider its sense of purpose and focus, which could reduce the coverage of the entertainingly outrageous that kickstarts the populist politician.
David Roberts in Vox argues that Trump is causing such consternation because he has broken the “accepted rules of lying” which have for a while condoned, or reported as a he said/she said story the really big policy lies, while calling out smaller, personal or trivial untruths.
That would fit with the Australian experience of the Coalition’s anti-carbon tax campaign or its reasoning that its 2014 budget broke no election promises – both arguments replete with obvious falsehoods. 
Australia now has a prime minister who says he wants to respect the electorate’s intelligence and Palmer’s influence is on the wane, so maybe our election year won’t be like the US primary season.
But if we don’t give some thought to the consequences of allowing political discourse to drift away even from the expectation that it is grounded in fact, and the reasons that might be happening, we really are mugs."

But it’s not often they publish a scientific paper tearing a politician’s comments to shreds. 
Sophie Lewis, from the Australian Research Council’s centre for excellence in climate science, has done exactly that, dissecting statements about climate records made by the former prime minister Tony Abbott in 2013.
Last week, temperature figures showed 2015 was officially the hottest year on record. Before that, 2014 was the hottest year on record. And scientists are expecting 2016 to once again win the dubious honour.
Heat records are being broken with wild abandon. Last year, 10 months broke temperature records.
Climate scientists say a rise in the average temperature caused by greenhouse gas emissions makes extreme heat records more likely.
In 2013, the UN’s top climate official, Christiana Figueres, linked bushfires in Australia to climate change. Abbott called such claims “complete hogwash” and said drawing links between broken records and climate change was a sign of desperation.
It drives me mental that these sorts of statements go unaddressed
He went on: “The thing is that at some point in the future, every record will be broken, but that doesn’t prove anything about climate change. It just proves that the longer the period of time, the more possibility of extreme events.”
Superficially it seems to make sense: if you wait long enough, you’re bound to see records fall. Lewis suspected many people shared Abbott’s interpretation, and set out to show it was wrong.
Lewis says she was frustrated by the gap she saw between what the science showed and what some politicians said was happening.
In a peer-reviewed paper published in the journal Weather and Climate Extremes, Lewis pulls Abbot’s comments apart, shred by shred. 
The first way to understand Abbott’s claim is that in any system, the longer you wait, the more often you will see records fall. But Lewis points out that the exact opposite is true. In a system without any sort of trend, such as a random string of temperatures, the first one will be a record-breaker, by default. The second one will have a 50% chance of being a record-breaker. The third has a one in three chance of being a record breaker … and so on. In a very long temperature series, you should see very few records being broken, and they will break less often over time.
Unless, of course, there is a warming or cooling trend.
Alternatively, Abbott might simply have meant there was no connection between extreme heat records and climate change. Instead, natural variability might be to blame: natural variability includes things such as the El Niño phenomenon, which push temperature around year-to-year.
To test if that might be the case, Lewis ran a series of climate models in which the greenhouse effect was removed – so all that was left was natural variability. Unsurprisingly, in those models, high temperature records were less common than they are in reality. In other words, the record-breaking that we have seen cannot be explained by natural variation.
“It drives me mental that these sorts of statements go unaddressed,” Lewis says. She says scientific literature generally tries to simply explain what is happening, ignoring misunderstandings in the public sphere. 
“This was an attempt to bridge that gap.”"

His own battle, however, is against all this ‘climate-change nonsense’…";"When Jeremy Corbyn won the leadership of the Labour party in September he celebrated in a pub up the road from the Houses of Parliament with a thank you to supporters and a rousing rendition of the Red Flag. On the edge of the impromptu stage that day, beside Len McCluskey of Unite and John McDonnell the future shadow chancellor, was a singular figure singing with particular pride: Piers Corbyn, the new leader’s elder brother, who has, you could say, led a parallel career of stubborn principle to his younger sibling. I was in the euphoric crowd that day, and since then I’ve wondered a bit about the relationship between the brothers, what they have learned from each other. With some of this in mind I called Piers recently and asked if he might like to talk about some of that. He agreed, but typically on the basis that he would happily talk about any subject under the sun – apart from his relationship with Jeremy and the vexed question of how his leadership is going. He shares much of his brother’s mistrust of the press; recently, he suggests, the Independent published an account of an exchange that had taken place over a family Christmas dinner. That wasn’t on. What he will talk about, though, is the thing he has talked about for just about as long as he can remember: the weather.
On this very British basis we met last week in a cafe over the road from his office on Borough High Street in south London. You don’t have to speak to Piers for very long to realise that at least a couple of Corbyn family traits are indelible: the first is that intransigent rasp of a voice with faint traces of west country burr; the second is the sense that life, like politics, is best played as a long game.
Piers Corbyn has a faith, even at 68, that if he states his beliefs often enough – though it might seem no one is listening – his day will surely come. He takes comfort in this not only from the recent elevation of his brother, but also from the example of Galileo, and of John Harrison and his measurement of longitude. “It is unfortunately not the case that the truth always prevails in the short term,” he tells me, with some conspiratorial conviction, “there are often vested interests to prevent it.”
The particular “truth” that Corbyn has in mind is perhaps the least fashionable proposal currently available in enlightened debate: it is the belief that changes in the Earth’s climate and its weather are dictated primarily by cyclical activity on the surface of the sun (and not, pointedly, by the effects of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere). It is a cause even more thankless than the return of 1980s socialism to British parliamentary politics seemed (until very recently). Corbyns have little fear of pariah status, though. What of the “settled opinion” of climate scientists and governments around the world, sealed in the recent Paris accord? “For one thing science doesn’t do settled opinions,” Corbyn says. “And for another they are all wrong.”
Thatcher probably knew climate change was nonsense. She was a scientist. But she was also a politician
This contrarian spirit began in Piers Corbyn at the age of five when his father, an electrical engineer, encouraged him to investigate the efficacy of a Victorian dew pond (he found it to be limited); it continued with his construction of all manner of meteorological equipment in the family garden in Shropshire; then through the study of tiny anomalies in the true orbit of the Earth (based, aged 17, on weekly measurements of the elevation of the sun, with findings published in the journal of the Royal Geographical Society) and into academic degrees in solid state physics and astrophysics at Imperial College London. The culmination of this obsession was a personal epiphany: “I was thinking of using the weather to discover what the sun had been doing in the past,” Corbyn says. “But then I thought, that’s just stupid: why not use the sun to predict what the weather will do in the future?” In his mind, the only thing that has got in the way of him making his fortune from that ambition, is politics.
To begin with, he says, his solar-based forecasts and calculations were way off, and he had as good as given up, but in 1984 a singular event changed the course of his working life. At the time, Corbyn says, of the year after his brother had first been elected a Labour MP, his own political loyalties were in a certain state of flux. He had been a radical student union president in London and sometime revolutionary socialist (a past that he believes would have prevented him working at the Met Office, still part of the Ministry of Defence, even had he wanted to). In the early 1980s he had been affiliated to the International Marxist Group, after a brief flirtation with the “quasi-Trotsky anarchist group, The Big Flame, for the 11 days it existed”. At the beginning of 1984, knowing his meteorological background, the IMG asked him to forecast what the winter was going to be like at the end of that year. The miners were planning a strike and “they wanted to know whether it was going to be cold enough for the strike to be effective, to bring Britain to its knees,” Corbyn recalls.
He said no, but under pressure from his comrades he went back to the data, “looked at a lot of new relationships and correlations” and came to the conclusion that, yes, it was going to be a very cold winter. He presented his evidence to the Miners’ Educational Support Committee (“I think it was called that. We had a lot of committees…”) And it was passed on up to the NUM. As the strike unfolded Corbyn’s prediction proved correct, the winter of 1984-85 was unusually cold.
Was the NUM grateful?
“Very,” he says. He had phone calls from head office, “not [Arthur] Scargill personally but one of his senior assistants”, asking how long the cold weather would last. He told him he thought it could possibly last long enough to bring down the Thatcher government, but by March the strike had collapsed and he never got the chance to be proved right.
All the while Corbyn was assessing the proximity of revolution by monitoring the electricity output at Goldsmith’s college where he was a lecturer in the physics department. “The voltages were below the legal minimum all that winter,” he says. “It is supposed to be 240v, it was below 210v and for safety they are legally bound to turn it off. The government were desperately doing everything they could to conserve power. I called to say I had measured the voltages at the University of London and they were below that minimum. They said, ‘Well, Mr Corbyn you must have faulty equipment,’ and put down the phone.”
It was in those weeks and months, Corbyn suggests, that Margaret Thatcher came up with her most devious plan to deindustrialise Britain and defeat the miners once and for all: she would popularise and endorse the science of man-made climate change, as a way of converting Britain from coal to nuclear power. The Hadley Centre, the world’s first dedicated research institution became her pet project. Thatcher, who later recanted her doom-mongering, “probably knew climate change was nonsense,” Corbyn suggests, “she was a scientist. But she was also a politician. The rest is history.”
Corbyn sees that moment as the one in which politicians first saw the political capital to be made from prophesying the coming apocalypse. Worse though, in his mind, the most vehement expression of that prophesy was not on the right but on the left. Climate change became a progressive cause.
For Corbyn, it answered the crisis on the left created by the fall of the Berlin Wall. “The left needed a new totem pole. Something for the young to dance around and feel good about,” he says, somewhat bitterly. “Revolutions had failed. Russia had failed. Socialism wasn’t dead but it needed a cause. The Red-Green alliance became that cause. It needed massive state spending, which they equated with socialism. In my view the left stopped thinking in 1989. It is only my brother who has started to change the agenda of privatisation and so on.”
It is hard to imagine that Piers has not bent his brother’s ear with elements of this analysis at family gatherings for about 25 years. Does he show signs of wavering?
“I don’t speak for my brother on any of this,” he says. “I don’t give advice to him where it is not appropriate.”
Did Jeremy share his obsession with the weather as a kid?
“Not really,” he says. “We were all different. Our eldest brother was into cars. He became a flight test engineer for Concorde. The next brother is a mining engineer, went to Imperial college. Then there is me, scientist. Then Jeremy, who was always politics. I think we all took after different aspects of our dad; while my mother encouraged us to make things all the time. The house was rundown and we boys had to do repairs. Jeremy and I learned how to repoint brickwork and so on. We became pretty good builders.”
The left stopped thinking in 1989. It is only my brother who has started to change the agenda
Piers has had perhaps less convincing success with the construction project that has occupied most of his adult life. After the relative triumph of his forecast for the miners he worked pretty much full-time on his long-range models. By 1989, the first year he heard of the idea of man-made climate change, he was ready to sell his formula to the world.
Ignoring the traditional model of publication and peer review, ostensibly to prevent others stealing his ideas, he engaged the bookmaker William Hill to construct some weather bets for him with the help of the Met Office. “That went on for 12 years,” he says. “I had 30 bets at £20 each on long-range aspects of the weather each month; betting the average temperature would be below normal, that kind of thing. We made a lot of money that way.”
How much is a lot of money?
“I made about 40% profits on stake, overall,” he claims. “I would bet £600; I would get an extra £200 back. It would pay the rent basically.” He and his girlfriend at the time no doubt spent a lot of time looking anxiously at the sky.
After this marginal success, a little better than putting a wet finger in the wind, some commercial clients came calling. For a while, Corbyn exclusively told the clothes store Etam the optimum time to sell its T-shirts or its hats and scarves. Some farmers were seduced by his predictions of storm and drought. And then the scientific consensus around carbon dioxide as principal climate-changer hardened, and Corbyn’s company, WeatherAction, which floated on the stock exchange in 1997, went back into private ownership after two years.
Adversity has only stiffened Corbyn’s resolve, however. Despite his marginal status he is fighting global opinion on all fronts. These days he does the odd presentation for Texan oil companies, or Russian climate sceptics. And he has not given up on a shift of opinion closer to home.
“Whatever you think of it all, the net result of these beliefs has been a deindustrialising of the west and the shift of carbon dioxide production from Britain to India and China,” he says. “Labour under Jeremy are now saying we have got to make a special case for steel and various industries that have to pay all these significant taxations on energy costs, which is the reason a lot of them are closing down.”
Piers is whispering in the ear of any MP who will listen: “Graham Stringer, of Labour, is sympathetic,” he says, “Sammy Wilson DUP, a number of Tories, Boris is very sympathetic [Johnson tends to use Corbyn, in an unlikely alliance, as his climate guru]. Now I think we have George Galloway which is significant, because he can be very persuasive…”
Inevitably, Corbyn has arrived for coffee armed with graphs and charts; so before I go I try to get him to explain how his calculations work. He talks 10 to the dozen about solar magnetic fields and lunar modulation and stratospheric winds. He outlines his database of 200-year-old German weather maps and solar observation from American satellites. “The principle is that all weather that happens has happened before, all storm systems, the question is finding the closest match…”
If the results are as good as he claims, I suggest, why haven’t other people picked up on his system?
“We haven’t told them how it’s done!” he says. “We had the Solar Weather Technique, ‘SWT zero’. We now have now got the Solar Lunar Action Technique, ‘SLAT’, and we are on version 12CS – s is for special. We have gone through 20 improvements and understandings on this…”
As he talks I have the impression of an army of researchers tracking and calculating, poring over maps in order to compete with the Met Office’s supercomputer.
When you say “we…” I ask.
“I mean me,” he says.
“OK” I say. “And what does the system suggest we can look forward to?
“It will get much, much colder,” Corbyn asserts (he has lately suggested that in the longer term we are on the verge of a great cooling cycle, which will vindicate him once and for all). “Next month we have a displaced polar vortex situation. Plenty of snow coming.”
We both glance out at the spring-like day on Borough High Street.
“It’s got a chance, I guess,” I say. Corbyn grins. As he knows only too well, stranger things have happened."

But can it last?";"Traditionally the Sahel – a semi-arid strip of land, south of the Sahara Desert – is one of Africa’s most productive crop regions. But during the 1980s this region, which stretches from the Atlantic to the Red Sea, became better known for drought and famine. Thankfully the region has become wetter again, and now new research indicates that the return of the rains is most likely a beneficial side-effect of global warming.
Rainfall statistics show that between the 1950s and 1980s summer rainfall fell by around 40% across the Sahel, bringing the region to its knees. At the time scientists speculated that the drought was linked to poor land management, and a rapidly growing population. But newer data indicates that it may have been sulphate aerosols, produced by fossil fuel burning in Europe and North America, which slowed evaporation from the North Atlantic and cut off the Sahel’s moisture source.
Since then we’ve cleaned up our skies, but in the meantime sea surface temperatures have risen and greenhouse gas concentrations have climbed. By modelling these changes, and studying the impact of each change individually, Buwen Dong and Rowan Sutton, from the University of Reading, have found strong evidence that the rise in greenhouse gases was the dominant driver of the recovery of Sahel rainfall. But wWhether these increases will continue into the future isn’t clear, and the scientists also caution that increased rainfall isn’t always beneficial. “If more of the rain falls in short intense events then it may cause flooding and could run-off very quickly rather than penetrate the soil,” says Sutton."

While the overall coverage in the Guardian, Independent and Mirror titles tends to reflect the mainstream scientific, economic and political consensus about climate change, the Mail, Express, Times, Sun and Telegraph titles all continue to use their opinion columns and leaders to try to cast doubt on the risks. This was plainly shown by the contrasting reports last month of the link between climate change and this winter’s flooding.  However, not all of the naysayers are the same, with some science and environment correspondents valiantly battling to serve the best interests of their readers with fact-based reporting about climate change. Sadly, it appears that some of these newspapers are now carrying out a cull of writers who choose not to reflect the uninformed prejudices of their editors and proprietors. Last summer, the environment editor of the Sun, Ben Jackson, left the newspaper and was not replaced. This was the culmination of a slow slide in the newspaper’s coverage of climate change and other environmental problems since James Murdoch left its parent company, News International (now News UK), in the wake of the phone hacking scandal.
Murdoch junior, unlike his father, is acquainted with the scientific evidence for climate change, and had persuaded his stable of newspapers to recognise the importance to their readers of being better informed about environmental issues.  Since his departure, however, the editors of the Times and the Sun have fully embraced unscientific denial of climate change. Soon after losing its environment specialist, the Sun published an article from “climate expert”, James Delingpole, a notorious rightwing polemicist whose lack of scientific knowledge was cruelly exposed on national television by the president of the Royal Society. And the Times has been providing Viscount Ridley, the former chair of Northern Rock bank, with a regular column to downplay the risks of climate change.  Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph also decided last summer to make redundant Geoffrey Lean, one of the UK media’s most experienced voices on the environment. Lean wrote on his blog: “In the British press... there [are], in my estimation, some 10 columnists who reject or underplay the dangers of global warming, with precious few columnar voices on the other side”.  Fortunately, the Daily Telegraph still retains an environment correspondent, and at least occasionally publishes well-informed contributions to “balance” the babbling nonsense on climate change that appears in its columns by famous non-scientists such as Boris Johnson and Charles Moore.  But it is readers of the Mail on Sunday and the Daily Express who suffer the most, with drivel appearing on both their news and comment pages. The Mail on Sunday has published a series of articles by David Rose, under the campaign banner of “The Great Green Con”, which attempt to undermine confidence in climate science in a very clumsy and unconvincing way, including stories that have been based on a fake magazine cover he found on the internet and a typographic error on a website.  Nevertheless, it is the Daily Express which has the worst track record, mixing ideological propaganda and inaccurate journalism. For instance, on 20 January, the United States National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, Nasa and the UK Met Office all announced that they had independently found 2015 to be the warmest year globally since records began in the 19th century.  The online report by the Daily Express, under the headline “What Global Warming? USA temperatures DOWN as climatologists claim 2015 was hottest year,” reflected the talking points handed out by climate change sceptics. Written by Jon Austin, who describes himself on Twitter as “Science &amp; Paranormal Correspondent”, it stated: “Todays [sic] announcement that a major developed nation like the US did not experience its hottest year ever is likely to fuel the argument put forward by many US-based climate sceptics that human activities simply do not have the level of impact being claimed by the climate change lobby.”  This is bunkum. The contiguous United States, not including Alaska and Hawaii, covers less than 2% of the Earth’s surface and recorded its second highest annual average temperature in 2015, just behind 2012. The United States is warming, just like the rest of the world.  It should be noted that the Daily Express struggles with its coverage of weather as well as climate. On 10 January, the newspaper’s website reported the impending arrival of a few days of seasonal weather under the headline: “Arctic SNOWBOMB to smash into Britain: Coldest winter in 58 YEARS now just days away.”  In fact, the meteorological winter (December, January and February) of 1957-58 was not particularly cold, and 22 of the UK’s winters since then have recorded lower average temperatures. Given that last month was the warmest December on record in the UK by a considerable margin, and that the first half of January was also mild, this prediction by the Daily Express appears to be little more than uninformed speculation.  When will editors of the Daily Express and other British newspapers abandon their daft crusade to promote climate change denial, and instead put the best interests of their readers first by reporting the real causes and potential consequences?

Thirteen of the 15 hottest years in the 150-year-long record occurred between 2000-14 and the researchers found there is a just a 0.01% chance that this happened due to natural variations in the planet’s climate.
2015 was revealed to have smashed all earlier records on Wednesday, after the new study had been completed, meaning the odds that the record run of heat is a fluke are now even lower.
“Natural climate variations just can’t explain the observed recent global heat records, but manmade global warming can,” said Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and one of the research team.
He said the record heat brought substantial impacts: “It has led to unprecedented local heatwaves across the world, sadly resulting in loss of life and aggravating droughts and wildfires. The risk of heat extremes has been multiplied due to our interference with the Earth system, as our analysis shows.”
The UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed on Monday that the global average surface temperature in 2015 shattered all previous records and said 15 of the 16 hottest years on record have all occurred since 2000. “We have reached for the first time the threshold of 1C above pre-industrial temperatures. It is a sobering moment in the history of our planet,” said WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas. 
The new research by Rahmstorf and colleagues, published in the journal Scientific Reports, is based on a statistical analysis that combines real-world measurements with comprehensive computer simulations of the climate system. This allowed natural climate variability to be better separated from human-caused climate change. The results did not vary significantly when UK Met Office temperature data was used instead of Nasa data.
The research was prompted by earlier claims that the run of record-breaking years was vanishing unlikely, a one in 650m shot, according to one report.
However, the average global surface temperature of the planet each year is influenced by the warmth of the previous year, meaning that a record broken one year is not independent of the year before. The UK Met Office expects 2016 to break the record set in 2015, partly because of the continuing El Niño weather phenomenon.
“Natural climate variability causes temperatures to wax and wane over a period of several years, rather than varying erratically from one year to the next,” said Prof Michael Mann at Penn State university in the US, who led the new study. “That makes it more challenging to accurately assess the likelihood of temperature records. Given the press interest, it seemed important to do this right, and address the interesting and worthwhile question of how unlikely it is that the recent run of record temperatures might have arisen by chance alone.”
The study concludes: “While considerably greater than cited in some media reports, the odds are low enough to suggest that recent observed runs of record temperatures are extremely unlikely to have occurred in the absence of human-caused global warming.”
In 2013, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded with 95% certainty that humans are the main cause of global warming."

Milton Keynes and Derby will copy similar measures in Norway and allow the cars to drive in miles of bus lanes, while owners in Hackney will be able to plug in at street lights. York drivers will be able to recharge their batteries at a solar-powered park-and-ride and electric car owners in Bristol and Milton Keynes will be allowed to park for free.
The schemes were announced by the Department for Transport on Monday as part of a £40m pot shared out among eight towns and cities. Nottingham, Bristol, Milton Keynes and London are the main beneficiaries, but Dundee, Oxford, York, Derby have also won funding.
Electric cars are seen as a key way for the UK to meet its carbon budgets and cut the illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution that blight many British cities. While still relatively niche compared to combustion engine cars, the number of 100% electric cars registered in 2015 nearly doubled on the year before, to 9,934.
In Norway, incentives including generous tax breaks and allowing electric cars in bus lanes have spurred uptake of the cars which now account for nearly one in five of all new cars sold.
London, which suffers the worst air pollution in the UK, gets the lion’s share of the funding. The Go Ultra Low fund will give the capital £13m for “neighbourhoods of the future” in several boroughs, where electric cars will be prioritised over other vehicles.
The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said: “I want to see thousands more greener vehicles on our roads and I am proud to back this ambition with £40m to help the UK become international pioneers of emission-cutting technology.”
Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, gave the initiatives a cautious welcome but said ultimately it was up to industry to drive take-up.
“We are all in favour of encouraging drivers to go ultra-green, but the risk of relying on perks such as access to bus lanes, free parking and exemption from London’s congestion charge is that they can be at odds with other policies such as promoting public transport and easing congestion,” he said.
The government has pledged to continue a long-running electric car grant, but it will decrease in April from the maximum £5,000 currently available to between £2,500 and 4,500, depending on which models buyers choose."

To put that into perspective, the previous two hottest years (2014 and 2010) only broke the prior records by 0.002°C, according to Berkeley Earth data. The only time the temperature record was shattered by such a large margin was in the monster El Niño year of 1998.
While the current El Niño event is also becoming monstrously strong, it’s only now reaching its peak intensity, and there’s an approximately 4-month lag before changes in El Niño are reflected in global surface temperature changes. Thus, the El Niño of 1998 had a greater warming influence than its 2015 counterpart. 2015 was nevertheless more than 0.2°C hotter than 1998, due to human-caused global warming. 
As the graphic below shows (animated version here), there’s a consistent warming trend among El Niño years, La Niña years, and neutral years. Over the past 50 years, there’s a 0.16°C per decade trend among each category, and individual years fall close to those trend lines. That underlying human-caused global warming trend is what’s causing annual temperatures to so frequently break records, with 4 new record-hot years in the past decade.
As NASA GISS director Gavin Schmidt said,
The El Niño that we’re seeing is starting at the end of 2015, and so there hasn’t been enough time for that to really have an impact on the annual mean temperatures. So 2015 was warm even though there was an El Niño, and it would’ve been a record year even if you abstract out the El Niño affect, 2015 would’ve been a record warm year by a long chalk.
And due to the aforementioned lag, 2016 could be even hotter yet. Prof Adam Scaife, head of long-range forecasting at the Met Office, said in an interview with Carbon Brief,
Given the strength of the current El Niño, we expect 2016 to be even warmer globally than 2015. The lagged effects of El Niño are already starting to appear in the monthly temperature observations, which are registering more than 0.8 degrees above norm in recent months. This is consistent with our forecast for unprecedented warmth in the coming year. Overall, we expect El Niño to contribute around 25% to what will most likely be a new record global temperature in 2016. Much of the rest is down to climate change.
If 2016 breaks the temperature record yet again, it will be the first time in the past 150+ years that three consecutive years set a new annual global temperature record.
Contrarians have responded to the news of record-shattering 2015 temperatures by noting that in the satellite data, it was only the third-hottest year on record in the lower atmosphere. There are two main reasons for this. First, atmospheric temperatures are more sensitive to changes in El Niño than surface temperatures. As a result, satellites still have 1998 as the hottest year on record, 0.14°C hotter than the second-hottest year of 2010, even though surface temperatures were about 0.07°C hotter in 2010 than 1998, and more than 0.2°C hotter in 2015.
Second, there’s an even bigger lag between changes in El Niño and changes in atmospheric temperatures, where it’s about 6–7 months. Thus the peak temperature influence of the current monster El Niño won’t be reflected in the satellite temperature record until summer 2016. As a result, 2016 is likely to become the hottest year in the satellite record.
However, the surface temperature data are more relevant to humans because they reflect temperatures where we live, and are less uncertain and more reliable than indirect satellite temperature estimates.
Over 90% of the energy trapped by the increased greenhouse effect goes into warming he oceans. A recent paper led by Peter Gleckler at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory estimated that the oceans have been building up heat at a rate equivalent to 4 Hiroshima atomic bomb detonations per second since 1998. That’s over 2.3 billion atomic bomb detonations worth of heat building up in the oceans over the past 17 years.
During that time, the oceans accumulated as much heat as they did during the previous 130 years, with 2015 reaching record levels.
In fact, research by Kevin Trenberth and colleagues suggests even this is an underestimate, and that from 1992 to 2005 the oceans built up heat at a rate of 6 atomic bomb detonations per second. Trenberth believes many other studies have underestimated the rate at which the southern hemisphere oceans are warming.
Previous estimates of ocean heat content change have been too conservative in the changes in the southern hemisphere. The absence of data does not mean absence of warming. Several estimates then use zero change in those regions. By better assessing what changes are likely in the no-data regions, based upon the regions where there are data, the ocean heat content changes increase. 
Encouragingly, on average, climate models are nailing the increase in ocean heat content quite accurately.
As the above ocean heat content chart shows, the overall heating of the planet never paused or even slowed down. The warming of surface temperatures did briefly slow, due to a period with more La Niña than El Niño events since the turn of the century. However, with the apparent return of more El Niño events, global surface temperatures are surging, and it’s hard to even see the slowdown anymore.
This argument is now relegated to the satellite temperature data, which have greater uncertainty, are more influenced by El Niño events, and diverge from direct weather balloon atmospheric temperature measurements.
For the global climate as a whole, there wasn’t even a warming slowdown (in fact it’s accelerated, as the Gleckler paper shows), and surface warming only temporarily slowed and is now speeding up again.
As Trenberth wrote, the record heat that we’re seeing now will soon become the norm.
What we have seen this past year will likely be routine in about 15 years, although regionally the details will vary considerably. Indeed, we have had a glimpse of the future under global warming.
2014 broke the temperature record without an El Niño, and 2015 would have broken it without an El Niño as well. Human-caused global warming is taking over.
That long-term global warming trend will continue, making the 2015 Paris climate accords all the more crucial in limiting the damages we experience as a result of climate change. As Michael Mann noted in a commentary on new research he published with colleagues on the record heat,
The next time you hear someone call into question the threat of human-caused climate change, you might explain to them that the likelihood we would be witnessing the recent record warmth in the absence of human-caused climate change is somewhere between one-in-a-thousand and one-in-a-million. You might ask them: Would you really gamble away the future of our planet with those sorts of odds?"

But no single item on the list seems any more horrible than the emerging news from South America about the newly prominent Zika disease.
Spread by mosquitoes whose range inexorably expands as the climate warms, Zika causes mild flu-like symptoms. But pregnant women bitten by the wrong mosquito are liable to give birth to babies with shrunken heads. Brazil last year recorded 4,000 cases of this “microcephaly”. As of today, authorities in Brazil, Colombia, Jamaica, El Salvador and Venezuela were urging women to avoid getting pregnant. 
Think about that. Women should avoid the most essential and beautiful of human tasks. It is unthinkable. Or rather, it is something out of a science fiction story, the absolute core of a dystopian future. “It is recommended that women postpone – to the extent possible – the decision to become pregnant until the country can move out of the epidemic phase of the Zika virus,” the Colombian health authorities said, adding that those living in low altitude areas should move higher if possible, out of the easy range of mosquitoes.
Now think about the women who are already pregnant, and who will spend the next months in a quiet panic about whether their lives will be turned upside down. Try to imagine what that feels like – the anger, the guilt, the pervasive anxiety at the moment when you most want to be calm and serene. 
And now think about the larger, less intimate consequences: this is one more step in the division of the world into relative safe and dangerous zones, an emerging epidemiological apartheid. The CDC has already told those Americans thinking of becoming pregnant to avoid travel to 20 Latin American and Caribbean nations. 
Eventually, of course, the disease will reach these shores – at least 10 Americans have come back from overseas with the infection, and one microcephalic baby has already been born in Hawaii to a mother exposed in Brazil early in her pregnancy. But America is rich enough to avoid the worst of the mess its fossil fuel habits have helped create. 
As usual, it’s the most poor and most vulnerable who bear the brunt. In Brazil army troops are going door to door draining puddles and flowerpots of stagnant water where mosquitoes might breed; in Jamaica the minister of health said plaintively “I’m going to be very frank, we don’t have enough fogging machines to fog every single community in Jamaica” with the pesticides that might help control the outbreak. 
And so the residents of the rich world will, inevitably, travel less frequently to the places just beginning to emerge from poverty. The links that speed development will start to wither; even the Olympics, theoretically our showcase of international solidarity, is likely to be a fearful fortnight in Rio this August.
 Zika’s not the only force tending in that direction, of course. It’s hard to imagine who’s going to visit Burkina Faso or Mali any time soon, after al-Qaida and Isis have blown up the major western hotels. Expats are starting to desert Beijing and New Delhi because who wants to raise their kids in smog so bad that a facemask is a fashion accessory.
Obviously we need to extend every possible aid to people across the Americas – we need to make sure they have fogging machines and testing equipment and teams of doctors who can help. But even more obviously we need to face up to the fact that pushing the limits of the planet’s ecology has become dangerous in novel ways. The Paris climate accords already seem dated and timid in the face of this news. We’re in an emergency, one whose face morphs each week into some new and hideous calamity.
A civilization where one can’t safely have a baby is barely a civilization. "

Depending on your point of view, the chief executive of Unilever, one of the biggest companies in the world, is either a gloomy pessimist or a unique figure in international business who believes his company has a duty to help the world tackle its big issues.
Being a pessimist certainly has its advantages as a chief executive. If you talk down the markets you operate in then no one expects much from you. If you also promote your own social conscience then it can help boost how customers view your company, particularly important for a business such as Unilever that produces everyday consumer brands from the washing powder Persil to Magnum, the ice-cream on a stick. 
Polman is a regular on the global summit circuit, visiting Davos for the World Economic Forum last week and Paris for the climate change summit in November.
However, if you spend any time in his presence, it is clear the Dutchman’s views are at the heart of how he runs Unilever. With a workforce of more than 170,000 and a market value of almost £90bn, he believes Unilever has a duty to lead on key topics.
“The global economy has many factors coming together at the same time that people probably struggle with, more than in previous times,” he says.
“You have the geopolitical situation, we have a hard time getting economies growing in the US and Europe, and the emerging markets are clearly slowing down.
“So there is pressure all around the world on an economic growth basis. Then there are the geopolitical tensions that you are well aware of – and we have added Saudi Arabia and Iran to this now. And the issues of climate change are really showing up as well – this year’s El Niño will probably be one of the more severe, we have just had the flooding [in Britain] and we have had significant flooding in Latin America.”
Polman, who will turn 60 this year, believes it is important that businesses intervene in the challenges facing the world because it is not clear who will step in otherwise.
“Actually, that is one of the key issues in the world right now – the lack of global governance in a world that has become far more interdependent,” he says.
“Some countries have played their role historically, but seem to be falling back to their home base; others have not been able to step up to the plate, claiming developing market status. But increasingly the issues that we are facing – climate change, unemployment, social cohesion, food security – these are issues of global proportions. We are often trapped in short-termism … or other things. 
“Many of the institutions that were designed have served us very well, but they were designed in 1948 at the time of Bretton Woods [the conference held in 1944]. It is not surprising that you have now got an Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and other alternatives because the world has moved on.”
Since Polman took charge of Unilever in January 2009 he has tried to back his words with actions. Unilever has stopped updating the stock market on its performance every quarter to encourage a long-term perspective, and it has launched a sustainable living plan that includes a commitment to cut calories in its ice-cream products. The company has pledged to eliminate coal from its energy usage within five years, and derive all of its energy solely from renewable sources by 2030. In Paris, Polman was part of a group of business leaders calling for a price on carbon.
However, is a business like Unilever really committed to long-term global issues such as climate change when it must also meet the demands of shareholders and pay out hundreds of millions of pounds in dividends each year?
Polman insists that the dividend is part of “balancing the choices to multiple stakeholders” and that the financial markets are increasingly coming round to his way of thinking. 
“Businesses are also discovering that the costs of not doing things are becoming higher than doing things,” he says. 
“The age of transparency should also not be underestimated. There are many people now that don’t want to invest in companies that create a worse future for their grandchildren. They are able to see it by going to the internet and they vote increasingly with their wallet.”
He adds that investors are aware of companies that behave responsibly and those that do not, noting that nearly half of Volkswagen’s market capitalisation has been wiped out in the wake of the emissions scandal. 
Polman accepts that there are also still significant numbers of investors looking for the biggest possible short-term returns who do not care too much how companies achieve their dividends. But he is optimistic that a growing number are taking a longer-term view. 
“Companies in the US now spend more money on share buybacks or special dividends than they do reinvesting in their companies and protecting their futures. Many in the financial community are starting to be concerned about that,” he says.
“We are fortunate in Unilever that we have about 70% of our shareholder base that has now been with us as long as I have been here. We have deliberately sought longer-term shareholders.”
However, for all the long-term issues on Polman’s mind, there are also short-term challenges that must be addressed, including the referendum on whether Britain should remain part of the European Union.
The Unilever boss is against Brexit, believing that the UK and the EU will be stronger together. However, Polman also believes that Europe needs reform if it wants to stay competitive.
“Europe is very occupied with itself in the short-term,” he says. “The fundamental issues of how to make Europe more competitive, how to grow Europe for the longer term, are not being addressed. That is why you don’t see any growth in Europe, there is still deflation in many markets. The real issues that started the euro crisis have not been addressed, either.”
As for Unilever itself, Polman wants to continue to show that its personal and homecare products, food and refreshments can remain popular no matter what shape the economy is in.
Even though he is moving into his 60s and his tenure as chief executive is longer than average, Polman has no plans to retire: “I am 100% concentrated as if it is my first day. I still have that same energy.”
“For us, it is very important that we can continue to show to everybody that in hell or high water, whatever the economic situation, we can continuously give competitive topline growth, improve our profitability, and do that in a responsible way. We can show that there is a different business model out there. We can hopefully start to address some of these major problems out there whilst at the same time satisfying the need of our shareholders.”"

The findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a peer-reviewed US journal, suggest that increasingly severe storm surges could be anticipated as a result.
Sea level can mount due to two factors – melting ice and the thermal expansion of water as it warms.
Until now, researchers have believed the oceans rose between 0.7 to 1mm per year due to thermal expansion.
But a fresh look at the latest satellite data from 2002 to 2014 shows the seas are expanding about 1.4mm a year, said the study. 
“To date, we have underestimated how much the heat-related expansion of the water mass in the oceans contributes to a global rise in sea level,” said co-author Jurgen Kusche, a professor at the University of Bonn.
The overall sea level rise rate is about 2.74mm per year, combining both thermal expansion and melting ice.
Sea level rise was also found to vary substantially from place to place, with the rate around the Philippines “five times the global rate.”
Meanwhile, sea level on the US west coast is largely stable because there is hardly any ocean warming in that area, said the findings.

Singapore-headquartered Wilmar says it has made “significant progress” on a commitment it made two years ago to eliminate deforestation, exploitation and peatland development from its supply chain. This includes publishing a list of crude palm oil mill sources that supply its refineries, enabling greater transparency along the company’s supply chain.
However, campaigners and industry experts say the company is yet to prove that its suppliers are not responsible for clearing forests or abusing human rights.
Glenn Hurowitz, senior fellow at the Centre for International Policy, who wrote an introductory commentary for Wilmar’s progress report, told the Guardian that being able to measure progress is key: “Among the large agribusiness companies, Wilmar is leading the way in many areas, from supplier engagement to transparency to rapidly responding to grievances filed by civil society ... But no company is providing comprehensive information about whether [its suppliers] are clearing forests or abusing human rights – the metrics that really matter.” 
Even Wilmar’s chief sustainability officer Jeremy Goon points out that “much remains to be done, including the development of a clear means to measure and track the progress of sustainability commitments to assess its effectiveness in reducing actual deforestation”.
The key sticking point according to NGOs such as Greenpeace and the Forest Peoples Programme is that Wilmar, which controls 45% of global palm oil trade, cannot prove that its suppliers are not responsible for ongoing deforestation. The palm oil supply chain is notoriously complex and lacking in transparency, but Greenpeace Indonesia campaigner Annisa Rahmawati believes the company should be making better progress on its commitments.
“Wilmar promised that by the end of 2015 it would be able to show its palm oil suppliers were not destroying forests, developing on peatlands and were respecting human rights of communities and workers. This was the cornerstone of its policy, but now the company talks only of ‘aspirations’. That is simply not good enough,” says Rahmawati. 
Wilmar’s 2013 commitment was a bold move but it didn’t happen without considerable pressure from what environment author and journalist Fred Pearce describes as “strenuous NGO campaigns” and an announcement by Unilever – one of Wilmar’s customers and the world’s largest purchaser of palm oil in 2012 – that it would be tracking its entire supply chain to ensure it met its promise to end its role in deforestation. 
It’s this same pressure that environmental non-profit CDP believes will help companies realise their no deforestation pledges. In its latest report CDP points out that suppliers and buyers of key agricultural forest-risk commodities, including palm oil and soy, are coming under growing pressure to ensure their supply chains do not destroy forests. “That pressure is building from their consumers and their investors,” says CDP. In 2015, 298 investors with $19tn (£13.3tn) in assets under management requested that companies report data about forest risks through CDP, a 24% jump from the previous year.
Hurowitz adds that Wilmar and other companies need to be absolutely clear to their suppliers that if they engage in deforestation or human rights abuses, they will lose access to global markets. “There’s been altogether too much ambiguity about consequences, which has only encouraged some rogue actors to think they can deforest first and apologise later,” he says.
So what will help end the ongoing land grab claims and forest fires that engulfed south-east Asia towards the end of last year? Hurowitz believes that governments must step up and take deforestation seriously, although this doesn’t give companies carte blanche to carry on business as usual.
“For the sake of their own commercial interests, the leading companies need to do more to make clear to governments that effective law enforcement is essential if the palm oil industry is to restore its damaged reputation. To accelerate progress and prevent another haze crisis, companies should join with civil society to support government efforts to hold anyone who destroys forests and peatlands legally accountable.”
Both Hurowitz and Rahmawati cite the example of the soy moratorium in Brazil, which brought companies, government and NGOs together to prevent deforestation of the Amazon. “By working together, traders like Wilmar were able to help eradicate forest destruction for soya in the Brazilian Amazon,” says Rahmawati.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, the group which created the clock in 1947, said it was keeping the clock hands set at three minutes to midnight – the closest the clock has come to destruction since the throes of the cold war in 1984.
“The clock ticks now at just three minutes to midnight because international leaders are failing to perform their most important duty,” the scientists said.
The ominous forecast was imposed despite two major diplomatic accomplishments last year: the Iranian nuclear deal and the historic Paris agreement to fight climate change.
“The decision not to move the hands of the clock in 2016 is not good news,” Lawrence Krauss, who chairs the Bulletin’s board of sponsors, said in announcing the new clock setting.
The scientists, reinforced by former US cabinet secretaries William Perry and George Shultz, based their dire symbolic forecast on challenges of a global scale such as nuclear war and climate change. 
They also acknowledged the gathering threats posed to world order over the last year by Islamic State and cyberwarfare.
The scientists noted that the 11.57pm setting was one of the worst since the clock’s inception. In 1991, when the threat of nuclear annihilation receded with the end of the cold war, the clock stood at 17 minutes to midnight.
Barack Obama’s election was another occasion for the scientists to lower the danger setting, based on his campaign promise to abolish nuclear weapons. 
With the Iranian nuclear agreement reached last year, the Obama administration made important progress in lowering tensions. But the Bulletin said US domestic political constraints had blocked Obama from doing more.
In addition, the scientists said such progress was undermined by high tensions between the US and Russia that are reminiscent of the cold war. The US, India, China and Russia were spending $350bn modernising their nuclear arsenals, and North Korea remained a nuclear risk.
In many ways, the world was a more dangerous place since the end of the cold war, said Shultz, who served as Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state in the 1980s during the height of the superpower rivalry between the US and former Soviet Union.
“We have a world awash in change. There is nowhere you can look and say it’s a world of stable prosperity,” Shultz said in a webcast from Stanford University. “It’s a terrible mess.”
Regarding the other great global challenge, climate change, the scientists and political leaders noted that 2015 was the hottest year on record – smashing through the previous record, set just one year before.
The Paris climate agreement – though supported by more than 190 countries – on its own was not enough to limit warming below 2C, the goal for preventing a climate catastrophe.
Leaders needed to focus on the big challenges of the age, said Jerry Brown, California’s governor. 
“Climate change is moving slowly but tipping points are around the corner and you don’t know when you are going to reach one,” he said."

(Bowie died on 10 January, in case you’re just now waking up from a very long nap. If so: good job!) In Five Years, the first song on his most famous album, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, he imagines what it would be like to learn that the world was ending.
It’s one my favorite songs of his, and I’ve listened to it often these past weeks. But I can’t relate to the sentiment, exactly, because Tuesday, the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists announced, using the “Doomsday Clock” as an indicator, that as far as they can tell, the world is no closer to ending than it was last year – though it’s also no farther away.
The SSBBAS was started in 1945 by scientists involved with the Manhattan Project with the express intent of gauging, and reporting, just how close mankind was to wiping itself out with nuclear weapons (and has since added “the changing energy landscape, climate change and emerging technologies,” to its list of concerns). Midnight on the Doomsday Clock, as you might have guessed, means the end of the world. We were three minutes to midnight last year and that’s where we remain. It’s not as close as we’ve ever been – the clock struck two back in 1953, when the US and Russia were both testing Hydrogen bombs – but certainly too close for comfort.
There’s a big part of me, though, that says, Who cares? (Likely a reaction that many of you are having to reading this very article!)
All those years after taking a first philosophy class and reading Nietzsche and having it blow your mind and then finding out that he really wasn’t so terrific after all, and all that listening to the Doors and later learning the same about them, the nihilist argument carries. So what if the world is ending? Is that really so bad? 
The world disappoints us in so many ways. People are stupid and cruel and life is full of pain and misery. We kill each other and we’re killing the planet we live on. Would it really be a net negative for everything to come to a full, abrupt stop? 
This week I stepped into a puddle of slush that was deeper than it looked, and I felt the icy slush-water crest the top of my boot and thought, No, that wouldn’t be bad at all. In fact, it would preferable to the alternative. As the cold, wet liquid seeped down and soaked my sock, it occurred to me that it might even be something to celebrate. But other days, I focus on how good it feels to put a nice warm new sock after peeling off a wet, cold one. Everything changes, and sometimes for the better. What else is there to do with our time except to try our best to enjoy it? 
That points towards hedonism when you’re young: have a second helping of pie and a third refill of your drink. But then when you get older, when you have a kid or kids, if you do that, it becomes something different. I did that and it became different for me, at least. Now the end of the world seems a little sadder. And my attitude about it is more one of, Let me not let this life-sustaining environment end on my watch.
Did you ever read Cormac McCarthy’s novel The Road? It’s really good. I often think it’s the best novel written this century. (It came out in 2006.) If you have not read it, and you still plan to do so, click this silly article off your screen now and go pick up the book instead, because I’m about to talk about the end. (Of the book, I mean. I realize we’re already talking about the end of everything else.)
The Road is a post-apocalyptic novel that tells the story of a father wandering the remains of the American east coast, trying to keep his son alive while most of society has descended into rape and cannibalism and human farming. The language is extremely terse in describing an ash-blanketed black-and-white world. I don’t think there’s any mention of color at all through the first 286 pages of the book. (Someone can surely check me and correct me on that, but I’ve looked and not found any.) The dad dies in the end, but the kid is found by another family of survivors and then the story zooms backwards in time, centuries, eons, who knows how far back? And we find this:
Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains. You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens were they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.
Those are the last words in the book. People often say The Road is super-depressing, but I find great joy in it. I’m flooded with a sense of peace when I read those last words. Because to me it doesn’t seem like we’re zooming backwards in time; we may well be zooming forward. 
Who knows what will come as we come closer and closer to destroying ourselves and rendering our planet uninhabitable? Who knows what will happen after the clock ticks midnight? Maybe time will go on. Maybe people will have moved on to space stations by then. Or Mars. Who knows what they’ll grow there? Who knows what they’ll find. Maybe brook trout. That would be a treat."

Although just between us, I may have lost a bet to climate seer Joe Romm because he correctly predicted 2015 would blow 2014 out of the water. Instead, this is a post about the probability that temperature records keep getting broken if climate change is natural. 
A paper just published in Nature Scientific Reports by Michael Mann and Stefan Rahmstorf and their colleagues considered this question. In particular, they wanted to know how likely recent temperature records and the string of records would be if the climate was completely driven by natural variations. Not even including the crazy-hot 2015, what did the authors find?
Well it depended on the “record” they looked at. For instance, the likelihood that 13 of the hottest 15 years would be in the past 15 years is 1 in 10,000. The likelihood that 9 of the 10 hottest years occur in the past decade is 1 in 770. The results are similar regardless of whose temperature dataset is used.
Some media stories reported that the temperature records were even more unlikely. The reason this study arrived at different results is that they took into consideration the fact that temperature records are not like coin-flips. Each year is not independent of another year or the prevailing situation. 
For instance, there are natural events that alter the temperature such as volcanoes, variations in the solar output, or even internal variability such as the La Niña/El Niño cycle. If climate change were all natural, you could get these natural events to align just by chance, and this could give a naturally-occurring record. So, while it’s very unlikely that this could occur, it is much more likely than if we just treated each year as a coin flip.
The authors then asked how likely it would be to have a string of records given the reality of human-caused warming. They found that it’s 83% likely that 9 of the last 10 years would be the hottest on record and 76% likely that 13 of the past 15 years were hottest on record. They also found that the odds of 2014 being the hottest year on record was 40%. Without human influences, that chances 2014 would have been the hottest year is approximately 1 in a million. Mann said:
The press reports last year about the unlikely nature of recent global temperature records raised some very interesting questions, but the scientists quoted hadn’t done a rigorous calculation. As a result, the probabilities reported for observing the recent runs of record temperature by chance alone were far lower than what we suspected the true probabilities are.
Although the new odds of producing recent runs of record temperatures by chance are greater than the odds previously reported in the news (between 1 in 27 million and 1 in 650 million), they’re still incredibly slim at between 1 in 5,000 and 1 in 170,000. Including the data for 2015, which came in after the study was completed, makes the odds even slimmer. 
In calculating the odds, the previous reports did not take into account that the data did not end simply because December 31 occurred, but that trends overlap into previous and subsequent years. This needs to be taken into account to determine the real probabilities of chance causing the warming events. As Mann noted,
We provided a method for doing this based on combining information from state-of-the-art climate model simulations with the observational temperature record, and we used this method to estimate the probabilities correctly.
 Rahmstorf added:
2015 is again the warmest year on record, which adds even more weight to our findings. What is more, the anomalous warmth has led to unprecedented local heat waves across the world - sadly resulting in loss of life and aggravating droughts and wildfires. The risk of heat extremes has been multiplied due to human greenhouse-gas emissions, as our data analysis shows."

I love books and I love going to book festivals, both as an author and a reader. So it might come as a surprise to learn that I’ve got together with book blogger Zoe Toft to organise the Think Twice Campaign that encourages authors and illustrators to think twice about appearing at a book festival.
Before you think we’ve lost our minds, I should say that we’re only asking authors and illustrators to think twice about going to a particular festival – the Emirates Airline Festival of Literature that is held every year in Dubai. Lots of authors and illustrators we admire and respect attend the festival each year and it seems to be well organised and very enjoyable for everyone involved. So why are we kicking up a fuss about it? Our objection is to the festival’s sponsor, Emirates Airline, part of an environmentally irresponsible industry and owned by a very oppressive government.
Generally speaking, we are in favour of companies sponsoring book festivals to help them cover their costs. However it’s important to recognise that both sides benefit from a sponsorship deal. By associating themselves with high-profile, respectable authors and illustrators, Emirates Airline are able to raise their own profile and make themselves appear more respectable. Zoe and I don’t think that a company like Emirates Airline should be regarded as respectable. We think they are quite the opposite. And we’ve given authors and illustrators three good reasons to think that too.
One reason is climate change. While governments are making other industries reduce their CO2 emissions, the aviation industry’s carbon footprint gets bigger and bigger every year. It looked like aviation was finally going to be brought under control at last year’s Climate Change summit in Paris, but at the last minute, they were let off the hook again. Environmental groups have said that the absence of both aviation and shipping from the Paris agreement will make it “close to impossible” to keep global warming beneath the 2ºC level needed to avert climate catastrophe. As the airline that flies the highest number of international kilometres, Emirates Airline’s international flights already generate more CO2 than any other airline and instead of reducing their emissions they have just announced plans to double in size. Does that sound respectable?
A second reason is free speech. The airline is owned by the family of Sheikh Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai and the book festival’s patron. Dubai is part of a country called the United Arab Emirates or the UAE. Sheikh Mohammed is also the UAE’s Vice President and Prime Minister. The UAE government is very different from the UK’s and the Sheikh is more like a king than a UK prime minister. The UAE is not a democratic country, so the Sheikh cannot be voted out in an election, no matter how unpopular he is with his people. Many UAE citizens are very unhappy with the way the country is run. Unfortunately, citizens that dare to criticise the country’s government are arrested and imprisoned for doing so (find out more in this link from Amnesty International). There are currently 67 prisoners serving long sentences just for speaking out in favour of democracy. Does that sound respectable?
The third reason is human rights. If you’re not a rich heterosexual man, you may be treated as a second class citizen – or, worse still, a criminal – by Sheikh Mohammed’s government. Attacks against women are not taken as seriously as they are in the UK and often the victim, rather than the man attacking her, ends up being arrested and imprisoned. Homosexuality is illegal and people can be imprisoned for up to 10 years simply for being gay. People of both sexes working in low paid jobs are not protected by the law in the same way that rich people are. Low paid women are especially badly treated, with many being forced to work long hours with little to eat and no days off. Does that sound respectable?
Zoe and I do have a lot of sympathy for children that might miss out on meeting an author or illustrator as a result of this campaign. However we have more sympathy for the people – children and adults – in the groups whose interests the Think Twice campaign are trying to champion: the women, migrant workers and gay UAE citizens whose human rights are being abused, or the future generations who will have to contend with the life-threatening consequences of climate change. 
If authors and illustrators are thinking of cancelling, but are worried about disappointing a young audience, they could offer to Skype with UAE schools. There are lots of tips for authors and illustrators who are new to Skype at virtualauthors.co.uk. 
Emirates Airline is an extremely rich company. They use their money to sponsor many other high-profile events and organisations, from football clubs to symphony orchestras. This all helps to create a smokescreen of respectability around a company and a government that is anything but respectable. I hope that the Think Twice Campaign will help many authors and illustrators to see through that smokescreen and think twice about going to this particular book festival.

One month after the Paris climate agreement, Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, told business leaders they needed to act decisively to hasten the transition away from the fossil fuel economy – or they would put the historic accord in jeopardy.
“I call on the investor community to build on the strong momentum from Paris and seize the opportunities for clean energy growth,” Ban told a UN investors’ meeting in prepared remarks. “I challenge investors to double – at a minimum – their clean energy investments by 2020.”
Global clean energy investment attracted a record $329bn last year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
But Ban told the New York meeting that was still not fast enough to build the new green infrastructure that would enable countries to meet the Paris goal of limiting warming to below 2C. He said it was time for investors and fund managers to move from “aspiration to action”. 
The gathering today of about 500 investors, organised by the Ceres sustainable business network, was the third stop for Ban and other UN officials this month on an itinerary designed to get business leaders firmly behind the Paris climate agreement, after meetings in Abu Dhabi and Davos.
Under the agreement, 196 governments agreed on the 2C goal, an aspirational goal of 1.5C, and to build a net-zero carbon economy in the second half of the century. Rich countries committed to providing climate finance, and all countries committed to revisiting and strengthening their national climate goals, starting as early as 2018.
But the commitments made at Paris would at best cap warming to 2.7C.
Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief, who will also address investors on Wednesday, and other leaders, have acknowledged that governments cannot finance the economic transformation, and that mobilising support from business leaders was a critical component of the Paris agreement.
The message to those business leaders underlined at the Davos and Abu Dhabi gatherings and again in New York on Wednesday was that, left unchecked, climate change posed a dangerous risk, and that there were business opportunities in the transition to a clean energy economy. 
In Davos, some 750 experts gathering for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum declared a climate catastrophe to be the single biggest threat to the global economy in 2016.
A few days earlier, the annual meeting of the International Renewable Energy Agency in Abu Dhabi was told that doubling renewable energy to 36% of the global energy mix by 2030 would take countries halfway to the Paris goal of limiting warming to 2C, and increase global GDP by up to $1.3tn. 
“We had this extraordinary agreement in Paris, we have got points on the horizon,” Rachel Kyte, the UN special envoy for sustainable energy, who will also address investors, said on the sidelines of the Abu Dhabi meetings. “Now we have got to get down to the nitty gritty of long term development of the low carbon economy and that is a lot less sexy in some respects than things negotiated last year.” 
The International Energy Agency estimated it will cost the global energy industry $16.5tn by 2030 to make the switch from high-polluting power plants to wind and solar electricity generation, required by governments’ commitments at Paris.
But a number of experts, including those of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, say the prices on new wind and solar projects are coming down - and could come down even further if there is a dramatic increase in investment.
Ceres said business leaders needed to start moving now to take advantage of those new greener markets. 
“Ultimately, global investment portfolios need to shift far more capital to low-carbon business activity and away from risky high-carbon sectors that may perform poorly in the years ahead,” Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, said in prepared remarks."

Lord Krebs, the government’s statutory adviser on adapting to the effects of global warming, told an influential committee of MPs on Wednesday that although recent flooding has caused houses and other buildings to be inundated, property could continue to be constructed on flood plains. He said that the attendant risks and the possible devastation would have to be made clear to households, local government and developers.
The wettest ever December in the UK at the end of last year saw 16,000 properties hit by flooding, while more than 75,000 lost electricity and most northern and western parts of the UK registered more than double the average rainfall. Some uplands registered three times their average.
The committee on climate change was set up under the Climate Change Act to advise governments on meeting targets on greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the effects of global warming.
Flood plains are often more attractive to developers because they tend to be flat and therefore easy to build on and close to other amenities such as transport and utilities networks. The UK is facing an acute housing crisis with hundreds of thousands of new dwellings needed each year to keep pace with the nation’s housing needs.
But while previous reports by the committee have warned of the dangers of building on flood plains, Krebs said that it should be possible to do so as long as property owners were made aware of the risks.
It is not known the effect such a policy would have on insurance, as most of the UK’s properties are supposed to be automatically protected from flood risk under a system known as Flood Re, an arrangement between the government and the insurance industry. This replaced a previous and unwritten agreement whereby all homes were guaranteed flood insurance by the industry.
Flooding is likely to become more common in the UK, the committee said, even if efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are effective, because of the effects of climate change. The average national rainfall is no longer a good guide to the likely effects because instances of localised but more intense rainfall are becoming more common – an effect of climate change that has been predicted by researchers including the Met Office.
On Wednesday MPs on the environmental audit committee also asked whether the Environment Agency’s responsibilities for overseeing flooding risk in the UK should be devolved to a new body. However, the complexities of devolving such responsibility – along with problems such as drought and the environmental protection of waterways – mean it is unlikely to be discussed in the short term.
Separately, a group of former high-ranking officials from UK governmental environment bodies said that a UK exit from the EU would lead to a much worse situation in terms of environmental protection in the UK."

So how do managers balance their climate change fears and the reality of the business world?";"Earlier this week Tim Sanderson, a former executive of the fossil fuel giant BP, wrote about the pride he felt for his daughter after her involvement in a climate change protest at Heathrow airport. With 12 others from climate activist group Plane Stupid, Rebecca Sanderson had occupied a runway to highlight the conflict between airport expansion and escalating carbon emissions.
Having spent most of his working life in oil exploration, Sanderson said he was an “unlikely apologist” for his daughter’s actions. However, climate change had become a galvanising issue for his family. When his daughter and her colleagues were convicted for aggravated trespass – and face a likely jail term – the former oil executive stood with other protesters loudly chanting: “No ifs, no buts, no new runways”. As with a growing number of business people, Sanderson’s story demonstrates how climate change has become an increasingly personal business.
In our book, Climate Change, Capitalism and Corporations, Daniel Nyberg and I explore how businesses and the managers who run them are responding to the climate crisis. A key finding of our research is that climate change poses a fundamental challenge to business as usual. While corporations frame climate change through the optimistic prism of innovation, technology and “green” products and services, the unpleasant reality is that our existing economic system fundamentally undermines a habitable climate.
For a number of managers, awareness of the environmental destruction that our economic system is exacting poses deep moral and emotional questions. Some chief executives have spoken candidly about their concerns for the future of humanity and their desire to change our trajectory. Often such epiphanies are cast from the personal and emotional realisation of the world they are leaving to their children. As the Californian venture capitalist John Doerr confided in a tearful TED talk about climate change and his teenage daughter: “I’m scared. I don’t think we’re going to make it.”
The emotional engagement with climate change is particularly relevant for those whose task is to make their companies more “sustainable”. Here, personal concerns about the environment run directly up against the competing logic of short-term profitability and shareholder value. This was highlighted with stark candour early on in our research by a sustainability adviser in a large Australian consulting firm who told us:
 “I would say that most businesses’ efforts, probably with a genuine intent, are more about appearing to be environmental and reducing impact where possible where there’s a business case for doing so ... because the best thing a business could do for the environment would be to shut down … But that’s clearly not a viable option.”
Many environmentally concerned managers thus operate in a conflicted space: they can advocate for greater corporate environmental sustainability but this must not threaten business growth. 
Responding to the inevitable gap between corporate rhetoric and action requires significant emotional labour, although ironically the outcome may be that emotions need to be deliberately left aside. For example, a sustainability manager at a major Australian property developer explained how he often downplayed his environmental concerns and framed his appeals for renewable energy to the company’s chief financial officer around cost improvements: “There’s nothing [in the discussion] about climate change. You can’t talk about drought and floods. We looked at this stuff, but they can’t get hold of it.” 
Many of those we spoke to also often compartmentalised their feelings about climate change between work and home. They might voice strong environmental values at home or among like-minded colleagues, but would moderate their views in the presence of more senior colleagues. As the sustainability manager at a national insurer admitted: “That’s the other challenge: how do you have passion without being seen as too passionate?” Essentially, fervour for the environment often needed to be tempered in the corporate space by fervour for the market.
However, many managers noted the need to sometimes stand strong and challenge business assumptions. Here the personal became the political by stepping outside convention and opposing proposals entailing environmental harm. As a manager in a major global food company told us: “We have to be the voice of the environment ... so sometimes decisions are made and those considerations aren’t there, and we’ve got to be the ones who stand up and say no.” For some of the managers we interviewed, these were pivotal events for them that involved putting their jobs on the line, or even leaving their companies to pursue alternative careers.
Of course personal responses are not sufficient to change an economic system hard-wired for environmental destruction. However, they demonstrate the potential for an individual’s emotional engagement to begin the process of corporate and political change. 
Future visions of a climate-shocked world prompt strong emotional responses, whether our concerns focus on the extinction of animal species, humanitarian disasters, or the wellbeing of our society or our children. Rather than denying our emotional responses to the climate crisis, we need to use them to champion alternative narratives to business as usual. 
Christopher Wright and Daniel Nyberg’s book, Climate Change, Capitalism and Corporations: Processes of Creative Self-Destruction, explores the role of business in the climate crisis

Campaigners said a letter published on Thursday from the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) to energy and climate secretary, Amber Rudd, was “desperately disappointing” for failing to increase the ambition of the so-called fifth carbon budget in light of the Paris climate deal.
Nearly 200 governments in Paris agreed to work towards keeping global temperature rises below 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, a more exacting target than the 2C previously agreed on by leaders, and which the UK carbon budgets are based on. It also required a longterm reduction to net zero emissions, which is more ambitious than the UK’s Climate Change Act.
The proposed fifth carbon budget’s 57% cut in emissions by 2032 was laid out before Paris by the committee, and has yet to be legislated on. In today’s letter, it said the budget’s demands were the minimum necessary to meet the UK’s international responsibilities under the Paris accord.
New government policies would be needed to reach this target, the committee wrote in its letter, because current policies would not be enough. 
The current Conservative government has rowed back on a variety of carbon-cutting strategies, for instance by slashing the subsidies available for onshore wind and solar power; abandoning the green deal scheme for encouraging home insulation, without a replacement policy; and scrapping the target for zero-carbon homes.
Craig Bennett, Friends of the Earth’s CEO, said: “This is desperately disappointing advice from the government’s climate advisor. Last month the international community agreed to ‘pursue efforts’ to keep global temperature rises to 1.5C – the Committee on Climate Change should have provided comprehensive advice and guidance on what measures the UK needs to take to help achieve this.”
Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a UK-based thinktank, said it was sensible the committee had reviewed the carbon budget after Paris but added: “The committee also pointed out that we currently have little idea how this government intends to reduce emissions, let alone ensure energy security. Having spent its first six months emptying the energy policy cupboard, it has yet to re-stock and thereby give investors the confidence they need to get us back on track.”
The CCC also issued a stern warning on the future of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. 
Last year, the government scrapped a long-standing competition offering at least £1bn in funding for CCS. The future of the fledgling technology in the UK is now in doubt.
But the CCC said that research suggested the cost of meeting the UK’s carbon goals by 2050 would be twice as high without CCS technology. “CCS has a crucial role to play in cost-effective decarbonisation technology,” the committee wrote in the letter to Rudd.
Professor Stuart Haszeldine, director of the Scottish Carbon Capture and Storage group, said: “To stay on track in the ‘high ambition coalition’ of leading nations agreed in Paris climate talks, the UK needs to do a lot more on UK electricity, and a lot more on UK low-carbon industry and low-carbon heat. 
“But now this government is doing a lot less. There is no sign yet that facts, unbiased scientific evidence and rationality are regarded as more important than lobbying by corporations and colleagues wishing to take the UK back to the 1960s energy mix.”

The announcement comes one month after the Paris climate agreement, where nearly 200 countries agreed to dramatically cut emissions. This week UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon urged business leaders to act decisively to hasten the transition away from the fossil fuel economy – or they would put the historic accord in jeopardy.
But even if business leaders do reach this ambitious target, it only marks the start of the investment needed to meet the agreed 1.5 degree target. The International Energy Agency has estimated that to hit this taget the world will need to spend more than $16trn (£10.55trn) over the next 15 years, to cover the costs of replacing coal and gas-fired power stations with emissions-free sources of energy such as wind, solar and nuclear as well as the costs for improving existing energy efficiency in homes and businesses.
So who’s going to foot the bill? What can developing countries do to help ensure we reach the 1.5 degree target? How can markets be used to promote private-sector solutions to climate change? And what can be done to create effective alliances to deliver the ambition of the Paris agreement?

Greenland, which is almost the size of Europe but with a population of less than 60,000 people, is a self-governing territory of Denmark.
However, it is seeking full independence from Denmark and will only be able to survive on its own by exploiting its proven oil, gas and mineral reserves, which could take its emissions to some of the highest per capita on Earth.
“The economic situation gives us no choice but to develop mining and oil. We would most likely [seek] a territorial reservation. It would be very costly if we were to submit to a binding agreement,” the administration’s foreign minister, Vittus Qujaukitsoq, told the Guardian at a meeting of Arctic countries in Tromsø, Norway.
The deputy foreign minister, Kai Holst Andersen, said Greenland would likely seek a territorial opt-out from the Paris deal, agreed by nearly 200 countries last month. “If we sign it will cost us hundreds of millions of dollars and we would never be independent,” he said. While Greenland is not a party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which shepherded the Paris deal, Denmark is.
Greenland receives a block grant of nearly $1bn a year from Denmark, around half its income. If it chose independence this would be lost, said Andersen.
New emissions restrictions on Greenland would be almost impossible to honour, said Andersen. “If we want to make a living we cannot afford to make an agreement that will bind us [to cutting emissions]. We are not an independent state. Independence is cancelled if we sign [Paris].”
Under the previous Kyoto climate agreement, which applied to Denmark and other rich countries, Greenland had an emission quota of 650,000 tonnes of CO2 a year - less than is emitted by a single coal-fired power station. The Paris deal covers emissions curbs post-2020.
Greenland’s position will not affect the ratification of the Paris agreement, which will come into force when signed by 55 countries that produce at least 55% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. This is due to take place at a ceremony in New York in April.
But it gives a clear signal to rich countries that they will have to urgently find ways to help poorer countries and regions to finance emission cuts. Many developing countries have said that they will be unable to fulfil their pledges without considerable help. How this money is raised has not been decided, but is likely to be with a mix of carbon trading, taxes and development assistance. 
Climate change in the Arctic is believed to be taking place faster than anywhere else with Greenland seeing rapid changes in farming, fishing and development. Mining has become easier as ice retreats and new species of fish enter Greenland waters, but the traditional way of life has been severely disrupted and the melting of the Greenland ice cap is taking place faster than anticipated, giving rise to fears of sea level rise. 
“We are seeing the effect of climate change much more clearly now. We must address it in any way we can to make the rest of the world understand how it is affecting all life and livelihoods,” said Qujaukitsok.
“It is is a blessing and a curse for us. We must address it in any way we can. It is affecting our life and ecosystems. It is posing threats but also offering new opportunities,” he said.
Climate change in Greenland was highlighted in the Paris talks when tonnes of ice from one of its fjords were placed in front of the Pantheon to show rapid melting and to inspire negotiators to come up with an ambitious global deal. "

Since 1986, mean summer temperatures have been about 1.3C hotter than they were two millennia ago, while heatwaves have been longer, more frequent and more persistent, the study says.
The paper was compiled by 40 prominent academics, using tree-ring analysis, climate modelling and historical documentary evidence from the notes of doctors, priests and monks.
“This degree of warming is unprecedented in the last two thousand years,” Professor Jürg Luterbacher, the report’s coordinator, told the Guardian. “It is exceptionally high and cannot be explained by natural variability, tropical volcanoes or solar changes. It is because of anthropogenic [manmade] climate change.”
While the paper offers new insights into the effects that volcanic eruptions, solar variability and land use change can have on climate, its range is limited to periods between June and August. 
Much of the data for the period before 755 comes from analysis of tree rings and density information from three pine tree species in Finland, Austria and Sweden. These trees grow in warm weather but are dormant in the cold, meaning that their rings, density – and the outside temperatures – can only be measured in summer. 
After 755, more pine trees in countries such as Switzerland, France and eventually Spain become accessible to the scientists, allowing spatial variations – or regional differences – to be more accurately recorded, and comparisons to be drawn.
“The anomalous recent warmth is particularly clear in southern Europe, where variability is generally smaller, and where the signal of anthropogenic climate change is expected to emerge earlier,” the report says.
The report finds evidence that past swings in summer temperatures were larger than previously thought. It says that summers were warmer between Roman times and the third century, before cooling until the 7th century.
A warmer medieval interlude was then punctured by a ‘Little Ice Age’ that lasted from the 14th to the 19th centuries. As the 20th century dawned, the effects of climate change became progressively more pronounced.
“Summer temperatures during the last 30 years have been anomalously high and we find no evidence of any period in the last 2,000 years that has been so warm,” the paper says. "

Over the next 15 hours, six twin-engine planes took off from an airfield in Al Ain, on the eastern edge of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and flew repeatedly into the clouds, firing off 162 flares loaded with tiny particles of potassium chloride and sodium chloride – table salt. By the end of Farrah’s shift at the National Centre of Meteorology and Seismology, a light drizzle was falling across much of the UAE. Farrah had made it rain.
 With the Gulf region confronting an even hotter, drier future under climate change – potentially testing the limits of human endurance – the UAE’s leadership is hoping to secure the country’s water supply by wringing more moisture out of the clouds. 
 The UAE this month launched an international research prize for weather modification, awarding a first tranche of $5m to researchers from Germany, Japan and the UAE. 
 “There are many techniques to secure water resources,” said Masataka Murakami, of Nagoya University’s Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, who will lead one of the research teams. “But only precipitation enhancement can produce a lot of water for industrial use, irrigation etc cheaply.”
Such claims hold a lot of promise for the UAE. The country receives less than 100mm rainfall a year, and much of that is lost to evaporation because of extreme heat. Winter rains, like the one Farrah was involved with, are especially rare.
But the country – despite having such natural scarcity – is also one of the world’s biggest per capita consumers of water.
Farmers still rely on flood irrigation, pumping out so much water the ground is sinking in some parts of the country.
An expanding urban population with a taste for water parks, golf courses, and lush green landscaping is also rapidly draining groundwater reserves. 
Over the next three years, Murakami’s team will deploy sensors and algorithms to identify the most promising clouds. A German team, led by Professor Volker Wulfmeyer of the University of Hohenheim, will study how winds and topography affect cloud formation and movement. Linda Zou will lead a team of researchers from the UAE’s Masdar Institute of Science and Technology using nanotechnology to increase water condensation within the cloud.
Other options under consideration by a water-strapped government include boosting the efficiency of the desalination plants that produce fresh water from the sea, importing icebergs and water trading. But weather modification historically has been the favoured course.
Since the 1990s, the UAE has invested heavily in weather modification operations, working with Nasa and private US companies to try to boost rainfall and replenish dwindling groundwater supplies.
 On good days, the cloud-busting operations manage to squeeze an extra 15% of rainfall out of the clouds, Farrah said. The country’s record was 35% above the expected rainfall, he said. 
“It is expensive but compared to desalination plants it is very, very cheap,” Farrah said.
However, those numbers could not be independently verified and are much higher than those recorded by scientists engaged in weather modification operations elsewhere.
Murakami said that with additional research such operations could prove even more productive.
“The work we do today isn’t like the old cloud seeding. This is more advanced, and more involved in finding solutions in the way that nature works,” he said.
But water experts remain unconvinced. In the 60 years governments and private companies around the world have been trying to alter the weather, it is still impossible to conjure clouds from a clear blue sky. And there is no reliable way to gauge the effectiveness of their operations – since those clouds might have produced rain anyway, scientists said.
“Weather modification is a pretty sketchy option anywhere but it is really hard to wring moisture out of the atmosphere when it isn’t even there,” said Peter Gleick, a US water scientist and founder of Pacific Institute in California, who was invited by the royal family to deliver a lecture in Abu Dhabi in 2011. 
The UAE poses its own particular challenges, said Roelof Bruintjes, a weather modification expert at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Colorado.
Bruintjes spent four years trying to increase the rain potential of the UAE in the early 1990s, using radar and aircraft. But researchers found that the clouds were to some extent already being artificially stimulated by dust from the surrounding desert, and pollution from the oil industry. As the researchers soon discovered, there was little more moisture to be wrung from the clouds. “One of the things that we found was that, in general, it’s hard to modify those clouds,” he said. “It’s already being seeded naturally.”
Bruintjes said he was “doubtful” that a new generation of researchers would be able to crack open the clouds. But he added: “let the science take its course. Maybe they will find something we didn’t.” And he went on, the UAE does not have a lot of options. 
By mid-century, the country will be desperately short of water, and the costs of running the desalination plants to secure its supply are already prohibitively expensive. 
The plants, powered by fossil fuels, suck up huge amounts of sea water and energy, accounting for about 20% of the country’s entire electricity supply.
With oil prices below $30 a barrel, and the UAE reduced to a net importer of gas because of rising domestic use, the authorities acknowledge dependence on desalination plants is a luxury even oil-rich Gulf countries can no longer afford. 
 “Our arid climate makes us dependent on energy-intensive desalination,” Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, the UAE special envoy for energy and climate change, said in announcing the award. “This is not sustainable nor is it desirable.”
The country is building six desalination plants including a pilot project at Ghantoot that will seek to cut electricity use by 25%. Masdar, the state-owned renewable energy company that owns the Ghantoot project, is looking at powering the plant with solar energy, instead of oil and gas. 
Such energy-saving moves are critical to an increasingly water-stressed future, said Dr Nawal Al-Hosany, Masdar’s director of sustainability. “When it comes to desalination it is a very expensive exercise,” she said. “We are trying to work with our partners to find innovative ways to improve the efficiency of our desalination plants.”
The UAE is also moving – slowly – towards conservation. Abu Dhabi this month for the first time began charging Emirati households for water use, and raised fees on expatriates.
A number of hotels have began reusing water for flushing toilets and landscaping. There are plans to expand water reuse.
But it would take a lot more than some some fat rain clouds and the sporadic embrace of water conservation to guarantee the UAE’s water security, Gleick said. 
“They have very little water. They can make as much as they want from the Gulf – but that’s at a high cost,” he said. 
It was time, he said, for the UAE to have a “serious conversation” about what they were really using their limited water for. “They are in a really tough spot.”"

If his proposal is approved at a finance committee meeting next Tuesday, as expected, the Danish capital will become the country’s first investment fund to sell its stocks and bonds in fossil fuels.
“Copenhagen is at the forefront of world cities in the green transition, and we are working hard to become the world’s first CO2 neutral capital in 2025. Therefore it seems totally wrong for the municipality to still be investing in oil, coal and gas. We must change that,” the city’s mayor, Frank Jensen, told the Danish newspaper, Information, which first reported the story.
“I think this move sits well with Copenhagen’s desire for a green profile for their city,” he added.
It is unclear exactly how much of the city’s money pot is currently tied up in equities and bonds in the dirty energy sector. 
A council spokesperson told the Guardian that no decision had yet been taken as to where exactly the withdrawn monies would be reinvested. 
The divestment initiative began with a small leftwing party on the Copenhagen council, before being taken up by Jensen, a social democrat.
Last year, Oslo became the first capital city to divest from fossil fuels, when it ditched $7m of coal investments, to join a growing movement of cities that have pledged to combat climate change. The world’s largest coal port, Newcastle in Australia, has also made a divestment commitment.
In a possible sign of Scandinavian rivalry, Jensen suggested that Copenhagen’s move might be more significant. “I am not aware of any other capitals, which have made decisions as clear as the one, we are making,” he said. “But I believe more will follow in the wake of the climate agreement in Paris. The development will be fast.”
Around 80% of the world’s known coal, 50% of its oil and 30% of its gas reserves will have to stay in the ground if dangerous global warming is to be avoided, climate scientists say. "

“Everyone is focused on what happens by 2100. But that’s only 2 generations from today. It’s like: If the world ends in 2100 we’re probably OK!” says Professor Richard Zeebe of the University of Hawai’i. “But It’s very clear that over a longer timescale there will be much bigger changes.”
If the next century seems impossibly far off, bear in mind that if you have a young child now, we’re talking about the world her or his grandchildren will be trying to raise their kids in.
Scientists who take the long view on climate change see parallels between global warming today and mass extinctions in Earth’s past: “Apart from the stupid space rock hitting the Earth, most mass extinctions were CO2-driven global warming things,” says Professor Andy Ridgwell of Bristol University in the UK.
It has been a consistent pattern throughout geological time: “If you screw with the climate enough, you have huge extinctions,” says Ridgwell.
So much of what you read and hear about climate change is heavily based on instrument records that only go back 160 years or so. But Richard Zeebe and Andy Ridgwell are among a few scientists who look millions of years into Earth’s past to learn how the Earth responded to big additions of CO2 into the atmosphere before. I had the opportunity to chat with each of them about their work during the American Geophysical Union conference in San Francisco at the end of last year.
It’s true that scientists can learn about the ice age climate going back 800,000 years from bubbles of air trapped in ancient ice drilled from Greenland and Antarctica. They reveal many swings from warm to cold to warm again, in a low-CO2 world mostly cooler than today. “We went from very cold and low sea level to a mild climate with normal sea level,” says Ridgwell. But it was a very different scenario than today - those cycles were mainly driven by Earth’s wobbles as it circles the Sun, and those same orbital wobbles mean we should be cooling, not warming, today.
So both Ridgwell and Zeebe have been studying the best equivalent to modern climate change they have found so far, a relatively rapid global warming event that occurred 56 million years ago, called the “Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum,” mercifully shortened to “PETM.” For Ridgwell, it’s a better analog for the future: 
This is why I like the PETM, at least it’s a warming event. It had a peak global warming of about 5º or 6ºC, which is a little bit beyond the end-of-the-century worst case scenario.
For Zeebe it’s also about data quality: 
We are focusing on the PETM is because we have relatively good sediment records. We are able to constrain timescales and ages relatively accurately. If you go further back in time, these constrains become very, very difficult.
Scientists use a wide variety of data from rocks exposed and drilled at various locations around the globe. They look at geology, fossils, and the chemical makeup of sediments, particularly chemical isotopes - different atoms of the same element that differ minutely in their mass. As Zeebe says,
We have two isotope systems that we can look at. One of those are oxygen isotopes and they are essentially a thermometer, they tell us about climate change. And the other isotope system we’re looking at is carbon isotopes and they tell us something about carbon release.
Zeebe and colleagues compared isotope samples with computer models of the climate system. They stretched the models’ carbon emission timescale until they got a match with the isotope measurements. This showed that the carbon emissions which caused the PETM took about 4,000 years - remarkably similar to an estimate of about 3,000 years just published by Ridgwell and his colleague Sandy Kirtland Turner. They used a completely different approach from Zeebe, focusing on the differences in the carbon signal between marine and land sediments.
Narrowing the PETM emissions timeframe to around 3,000 to 4,000 years shows that, like today, the global warming back then was caused by geologically-fast carbon emissions. But our emissions have taken just a couple of centuries so, as Zeebe points out: 
What we’re doing with our emissions is unprecedented in the past 66 million years!
Even if the PETM isn’t a perfect equivalent of today’s climate (it was slower, and it happened in a world that was already warmer than today), it still tells us how the planet reacts to a sharp excess of carbon in the atmosphere. For example, the 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report says we can expect a warming of between 1.5°C and 4.5°C if we double atmospheric CO2 levels, but also acknowledges that the longer term warming (over centuries to millennia) “could be significantly higher” than that. The PETM tells us it is. Zeebe notes:
If we just try to explain the PETM with a climate sensitivity of 4.5°C, we only get maybe 60% of the warming. So my conclusion would be that long term sensitivity must be more than 4.5°C.
Ridgwell has also investigated global warming events going back deeper in geological time, including the big mass extinction events like the end-Permian and the end-Triassic, as well as so-called “Ocean Anoxic Events” in the Cretaceous. These involved profound and long-lived environmental disruption, with symptoms quite similar to today’s climate change, such as global warming, rainfall changes, and ocean acidification.
“Overall these are relatively slow events, on timescales of tens to hundreds of thousands of years,” says Ridgwell. But recent advances in rock dating, and in tracing Earth’s magnetic field frozen into ancient lava, suggests that within those slow events there may well have been intense, rapid episodes that came closer to today’s human emission rates.
You might have very short pulses of CO2 release within them. Some of these pulses of CO2 could look like what we’re doing now in terms of amount and rate. That’s an area of active research, because the estimates of individual pulses are getting better, but the estimates of how much CO2 would be released associated with an individual pulse are still uncertain.
Ridgwell is skeptical about ambitions to limit warming to 1.5°C: 
We have 1.5°C already programmed in, so even if we bring emissions right, right down, immediately, now, we already have 1.5 degrees! So how we’re keeping to a 1.5-degree threshold isn’t clear.
So a fun thing we’re doing now with our very fast warming is the ocean surface warms up and the deep ocean is still cold, which is partly why we have this programmed-in warming that we haven’t seen yet. The deep ocean hasn’t yet noticed that the planet at the surface is rather warmer. If we just sit here at current CO2 levels and let the system equilibrate, it’s 1.5°C anyway. Which comes back to COP21 - what is this 1.5°C target? We’ve emitted the CO2 to reach 1.5°C already, so I don’t know what they’re thinking of!
It seems as if everyone is assuming, without thinking about it, that there is massive carbon geoengineering going on.
Geoengineering is a word that covers a multitude of sins, but in this case it refers to sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere and burying it. Even the 2ºC target aimed at (but not reached) in Paris assumes quite a lot of active CO2 burial. The feasibility – or not – of that endeavor is an active debate, usefully summarized by Andy Skuce on SkepticalScience.com, but it may be crucial if we are to avoid the more extreme long term environmental effects and sea level rises that scientists see in the geological record.
Ridgewell again:
If the COP21 agreement works out even partly, then we probably won’t see 5 or 6°C. But the PETM took several thousand years, so marine and terrestrial ecosystems had thousands and thousands of generations to adapt and evolve, whereas we’re doing this on a decade-to-century scale. It’s a very, very different event in terms of rates, although you at least have a total magnitude maybe like the future.
For Zeebe the ability not only to reduce emissions, but to reverse them, is crucial.
The timescale over which ice sheets disintegrate depends on the duration of a temperature anomaly. If you warm the planet by 3 degrees [Note: that’s effectively what the COP21 Paris Agreement adds up to] over a few decades, and then you cool it down, you can probably keep large portions of Greenland and West Antarctica. But if temperatures remain elevated, this will melt big ice sheets. And then we’re not talking just of a sea level change of 1 meter by 2100, but rises of several meters for centuries.
But people tend to ignore this. The opinion seems to stop at 2100!

“We know that if we burn all the coal, oil and gas available, the Paris agreement cannot be fulfilled. Significant parts of the total fossil resources must remain, untouched,” said Karl Eirik Schjøtt-Pedersen, director of the Norwegian oil and gas association and a former minister of finance. 
Schjøtt-Pedersen argued that by exploiting its own fossil fuels Norway would help other countries, like Germany and Britain, to emit less because Norwegian gas was cleaner than coal.
“If Europe were to replace coal with Norwegian natural gas, this would result in a 50% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions for every unit of energy produced. We produce gas with low emissions, which can replace coal with high emissions,” he told a meeting this week of politicians, scientists and business people from Arctic nations in Tromsø, Norway.
Despite the Paris agreement to cut global emissions and oil prices falling to under $30 a barrel, Europe’s biggest oil and gas producer intends to expand production in some of the riskiest and most environmentally sensitive areas.
Earlier this month it issued 56 new licenses to allow 36 companies to explore near the picturesque Lofoten islands, which are home to some of the world’s richest cod stocks, as well as in the North and Barents seas. 
National oil company Statoil also plans to spend $6bn developing the Castberg field. This Arctic stretch of ocean north of Norway is estimated to hold up to 650m barrels of oil equivalent. 
According to the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, the current low oil prices will stimulate the global economy and the demand for Norway’s oil. “The oil and gas industry has been through major slumps before, but has kept growing. Although bad for Norway, low oil prices stimulate the global economy and the demand for oil,” she told the conference. 
She said Norway had no option but to exploit its oil. “Norway’s oceans cover a vast area. The seabed contains large resources of oil and gas. Our oceans provide vast opportunities for harvesting their bounty. Therefore, it is vital that we make every effort to ensure that the oceans are clean and productive,” she said.
Environmentalists said the prosperous country, with one of the highest GDPs per capita in the world, was acting as if Paris and the recent slump in oil prices had never happened. 
“The government is hypocritical and in denial over Paris. It does not think it is any brake on oil. They say our oil is cleaner and that the EU needs us. Meanwhile it is lobbying in Europe against stronger energy efficiency laws. There seem to be no limits on the Norwegian oil industry. They want to keep on expanding,” said Silje Lundberg, of Friends of the Earth Norway.
Norway intends to reduce emissions by 30% by 2020 and 40% by 2030. However, it is one of very few wealthy countries to have increased emissions since 1990. State statistics bureau SSB has stated that Norway’s oil industry accounted for 27% of all carbon emissions in Norway in 2013. Annual emissions from oil and gas production have increased by 91% since 1990.
The Norwegian oil and gas industry has been sharply hit by falling oil prices with many companies laying off staff and projects being mothballed. "

Aircraft emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are linked to lung damage, doubled since 1990 and are forecast to rise 43% by 2035.
The increase so far tracks a rise in the number of flights over the last 25 years, and a similar jump in the sector’s carbon dioxide emissions.
Airlines have reduced their planes’ NOx emissions in the last decade as the Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) has tightened standards. But the improvements are coming too slowly, the report says.
 “We expect that the increase in growth in the air transport sector is going to offset those technological and operational efficiencies, leading to an absolute increase in emissions,” an official with the European Aviation Safety Agency told the Guardian.
NOx is an indirect greenhouse gas created by fuel combustion, that can lead to the formation of health-damaging air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM).
Around 23,500 Britons die prematurely each year from exposure to NOx, according to provisional government figures. Another 29,000 people die early from the effects of PM pollution.
High NOx concentrations around airports are a particular public health concern with Heathrow airport breaching safety limits in several different locations and times in 2012, according to its own measurements.
The UK government has been in beach of EU air quality laws since 2010, but a cleanup plan published in December did not envisage cities such as London becoming compliant for another decade.
Campaigners say that increasing emissions standards during aircraft landings and take offs would have the double benefit of protecting people who live close to airports and cutting the cruise emissions of airplanes in the future, as better engines are developed.
“The doubling of NOx emissions from aviation since 1990 is having a huge impact on our health and climate,” said Andrew Murphy, the aviation and shipping officer for Transport and Environment. “EU and international policies need to be urgently strengthened to reverse this trend, and that must include tighter emissions standards.”
The EU’s transport commissioner, Violeta Bulc, said that the report was intended to feed into international discussions on reducing planes’ emissions.
“Aviation brings significant economic and social benefits to Europe, but also has an impact on the environment,” she said. “In 2016, the EU will reach out to its partners to take global and ambitious steps.”
That process will begin in earnest in Montreal next week when a committee of the UN International Civil Aviation Organization meets to discuss a new CO2 standard for planes, and market measures to drive emissions down."

Responding to a rare question about climate change in Thursday’s Republican debate in Des Moines, Iowa, Rubio denied that he ever supported a “cap and trade” system to lower emissions, despite his having called it “inevitable” in 2008. 
“I have never supported cap-and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea,” the Florida senator said. “And I do not believe it’s a good idea now. I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
“And especially what these programs are asking us to pass … will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy. When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any ‘cap and trade’ in the United States.”
On the campaign trail in Iowa this week, Rubio said policies being implemented by Barack Obama will harm the economy and cost “hundreds of thousands of jobs”.
Obama’s initial cap and trade plan was blocked by Congress. Instead, the Environmental Protection Agency will impose greenhouse gas limits on power plants, allowing a form of emissions trading between the states. 
Obama’s administration has pledged to cut US greenhouse emissions from all sectors by up to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. Research released this week by scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and the University of Colorado Boulder found that the US could slash emissions much further, cutting them by up to 78% below 1990 levels within 15 years, while meeting increased demand.
The market will work faster. There’s someone in a garage somewhere … that’s going to have a clue, to have an answer
These cuts, the Nature Climate Change study states, could be achieved “without an increase in the levelized cost of electricity”. It would be undertaken via a shift to a national energy system using existing renewable sources such as solar and wind and deploying the latest electricity storage technology.
Bush, once governor of Florida, has said he supports federal government support for “basic research” into low-carbon energy but, like Rubio, places his faith in the free market to deal with rising temperatures and the extreme weather events, drought and sea level rise they bring.
“What we shouldn’t try to do is pick winners and losers through the federal government,” he said at a gathering in New Hampshire on Saturday, in a newly emerged video. 
“The market will work faster. There’s someone in a garage somewhere, parochially I hope it’s in Miami, that’s going to have a clue, to have an answer to this. 
“There are people well-intended on climate change but they need to be careful to not paint the apocalypse. Because we are not there. But we should be adapting.”
Bush said he doubted sea level predictions for south Florida but, if they did come true, he has told his wife that they should move house. 
Last week, a group of 15 mayors in Florida, including Tomas Regalado, the mayor of Miami, wrote to Rubio to call upon him to “acknowledge the reality and urgency of climate change and to address the upcoming crisis it presents our communities”.
The letter states that sea levels rose by around 8in off the coast of south Florida during the 20th century and that a further rise of 1ft by 2050 will wipe out about $4bn of Florida real estate.
Florida is considered particularly vulnerable to sea level rises as it is low-lying and sits in parts on a base of limestone, which causes excess water to seep underground and inundate areas. Salt water intrusion is also a concern for the Everglades and the many species that rely upon the wetland ecosystem.
The League of Conservation Voters, which is backing Hillary Clinton, said Rubio had a “weak relationship with the facts” on the economic impact of tackling climate change.
“In 2016, the American people are making it increasingly clear they have little tolerance for candidates who willfully ignore the facts of climate change,” said Seth Stein, a spokesman for the lobby group.
Rubio’s views on climate action have gotten more dangerous as the threat to his home town has gotten more severe
 “The other news networks should follow Fox News’ lead, and finally ask the Republican candidates a question on climate change.”
Adam Beitman, a spokesman for environment group the Sierra Club, said: “Rubio’s views on climate action have gotten more dangerous as the threat to his home town has gotten more severe and the Koch brothers’ influence on his positions has gotten more pronounced.”Beitman said Bush’s comments showed that Republicans were paying “lip service” to action on climate change while opposing serious solutions to it.“When your plan is to wait around and hope that someone in their garage fixes the climate crisis, it’s clear you’re not taking the issue seriously at all – especially while seas are rising around your home state.”
Last year was the hottest year on record, according to Noaa and Nasa, beating the record set in 2014 by a “wide margin”. Of the 15 hottest years in the 150-year-old temperature record, 13 have occurred since 2000."

Why can’t we do it to solve climate change?";"We need an estimated $1tn per year to stay below a global temperature rise of 2C. Creating new money might be the only way to meet this financial challenge";"The international community has agreed on an ambitious agenda to curb climate change. Some 195 countries have decided to try and cut greenhouse gas emissions to a level that will limit the rise in average global temperatures to well below 2C. The question we now face is: how are we going to finance the changes needed to reach this goal? Quantitative easing – creating new money – might just be the answer.
To reach zero emissions by 2050 (and for a likely chance to stay below a rise of 1.5C), we need to scale up and accelerate the move towards 100% renewable energy, and replicate globally what is already being created in many communities, cities and regions: a fossil-free society based on a customer-centric and inclusive energy infrastructure.
The International Energy Agency has established that $1tn per year of renewable energy investment would be needed to stay under the 2C limit. To achieve the ambitious 1.5C limit agreed in Paris, substantially higher investment will be required. Our rough – and unofficial – estimate puts the figure between $1.5tn and $2tn.
The UN Green Climate Fund (GCF) – tasked with obtaining the “significant portion [of] new and additional” funds from developed countries, to $100bn per year until 2020 – currently stands at just $10.2bn. Previous experiences with getting financial commitments from taxes or semi-public funds – such as from emissions trading – also tell us that the sums provided regularly fall short of what’s promised.
Assuming that the GCF does manage to obtain a sum close to the promised $100bn a year, it is crucial that it receives the funding in the form of non-repayable grants. Only then will the GCF have the ability to make renewable energy and other projects attractive to private co-investors. If the only problem facing climate financing was a lack of credit, it would have been solved a long time ago.
A percentage of that spent to bail out private banks could pay for investments needed to stabilise the world’s climate
Since the beginning of the financial crisis, central banks have created trillions to stabilise the global financial system. First they bailed out private sector banks, and then they bailed out governments by buying up private and public bonds worth billions. The European Central Bank is currently buying assets with newly created money of €60bn a month to stimulate the economy in the eurozone and prevent deflation, for example. All this is possible because central banks can never become insolvent in their own currency as they alone issue the legal tender.
But an important side effect of these bailouts has been the realisation that central banks could play a more active role with their monetary policies; newly created money can be used to finance urgent global tasks that would otherwise not be undertaken. Just a percentage of that spent to bail out private banks could pay for investments needed to stabilise the world’s climate
To provide the necessary financial resources ( a big part of the $100bn promised to the GCF), central banks would carry on with what many of them are doing already: buying bonds with newly created money. But instead of buying existing private and public bonds, central banks would buy our proposed green climate bonds, which would be issued by the GCF, to finance climate change mitigation and adaptation projects. 
Under our proposals, these bonds would be for the long term (100 years or more) and would only bear small, if any, interest rates. They would become permanent assets of central banks and form the foundation of regular money creation, ensuring that the GCF is at the receiving end of new and non-repayable money. 
For developing countries, the advantages would be immediate access to the foreign exchange required for the construction of new sustainable infrastructure. If the central banks of developed countries purchased green climate bonds, they would benefit from an increase in demand for their goods and services. The purchase of such bonds would also finance new exports, which would revive domestic economies and lead to job creation.
Climate protection investments and the transition to 100% renewable energy are not only a moral obligation to future generations, but are also socially and economically beneficial today, as has already been shown in hundreds of communities around the world. 
As the Austro-British economist Friedrich Hayek once said, capitalism has one key advantage: the ability to respond to a sudden new demand with a spontaneous expansion of the relevant supply and – as long as there are idle economic resources – without risking inflation. 
If the GCF is given the financial power to expand demand for the renewable energy infrastructure required to reach the 1.5C goal, capitalism will have shown that it can meet the climate challenge.

Some Republican presidential candidates are beginning to peer out from behind the wall of climate denial that has defined the party as long as Barack Obama has been in the White House. Finally, it seems, the most open expressions of climate denial – such as dismissing long-established scientific fact – may be seen as a bit retrograde, and possibly embarrassing, even by some who are looking for votes from an increasingly rightwing Republican party.
In response to a rare question about climate change in Thursday night’s Republican debate, Marco Rubio offered up an answer that was rarer still in the 2016 campaign. He did not reduce climate change to a punchline or bash the science underlying climate change, as Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have been doing throughout the primary. 
Rubio spoke instead about policies for fighting climate change – in his case his opposition to cap and trade in his home state of Florida.
“When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any ‘cap and trade’ in the United States,” the Florida senator said.
Jeb Bush, Rubio’s fellow Floridian, also steered clear of open climate denial, telling a gathering in New Hampshire on Saturday that he opposed federal government policies to deal with global warming.
“The market will work faster. There’s someone in a garage somewhere, parochially I hope it’s in Miami, that’s going to have a clue, to have an answer to this,” Bush said.
The fact that both candidates were operating under the assumption that climate change even exists might seem like progress of a sort. As Obama noted last month, the Republican party is the only major party in the advanced world that denies climate change.
In many cases, they still are. In the undercard debate on Thursday night, Carly Fiorina dismissed climate change as a silly Democratic party distraction from real security threats. Rubio and Bush openly expressed doubt about the existence of manmade climate change earlier in the campaign. Bush butted heads with the pope. Rubio made his now infamous remark that “America is not a planet”.
But there are signs of a shift. The Republican-dominated Congress voted by significant margins in December to extend tax credits for wind and solar power, a decision expected to lead to a boom in renewable energy. This week Republicans and Democrats joined forces on an energy reform bill, the first such bipartisan measure in more than eight years.
The White House believes the combination of constant ridicule from Obama and other Democratic leaders and “facts on the ground”, in the form of the clean power plan and other policies enacted through the use of executive authority, will force the next president to deal with climate change, even if a Republican wins the November election. 
“The next president will not be inclined to be able to [scrap the plan] whether he or she wants to change it,” Denis McDonough, Obama’s chief of staff, told a forum celebrating the Pulitzer Prizes at the Washington Post on Friday.
But mere acknowledgement of the existence of climate change is not enough. Neither Rubio nor Bush came forward to say what they would do to fight climate change. Their response to a gathering danger acknowledged by the Pentagon, 196 world leaders at the Paris climate summit and, yes, scientists, was merely to express opposition to the Democratic policy prescriptions already out there. Do they have no policy ideas? Would they leave climate solutions entirely to the market? That’s a huge oversight.
And given the abundance of evidence all around us about the dangers of climate change – extreme sea level rise in the Bush and Rubio home state of Florida, the public health emergency of the Zika virus, the climate-fuelled drought in California and super-sized blizzards in the north-east, just to name a few examples – such oversight by candidates is really just another kind of denial."

The report was a follow-up and expansion of a similar survey conducted in 2009 by the same institute. The key finding: there’s a strong consensus among climate economics experts that we should put a price on carbon pollution to curb the expensive costs of climate change.
The survey participants included economists who have published papers related to climate change “in a highly ranked, peer-reviewed economics or environmental economics journal since 1994.” Overall, 365 participants completed the survey, which established the consensus of expert climate economists on a number of important questions.
In the 2009 version of the survey, the respondents were asked under what conditions the United States should commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 57% answered that the US should cut its emissions no matter what actions other countries take, while another 38% said that American emissions cuts would be warranted if many or all other countries commit to reducing theirs (as just happened in the Paris international negotiations). 
In the 2015 survey, the number of expert economists saying that the US should cut its emissions no matter what rose to 77%. A further 18% said that if other countries agree to cut their emissions, the US should follow suit. In other words, there is a 95% consensus among expert climate economists that the US should follow through with its pledges to cut carbon pollution in the wake of the Paris international climate negotiations, and more than three out of four agreed that the US should take action to curb global warming no matter what.
This expert consensus is in stark contrast to conservative political opposition to the Paris accord. For example, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio said of the agreement,
This kind of unilateral disarmament in our economy is reckless, and it is hurting the American Dream
Quite obviously an international agreement made by 195 nations around the world is the antithesis of unilateral action. However, 77% of expert economists agree that unilateral action would be appropriate in any case, directly contradicting Rubio’s comments. Additionally, 82% of the experts agreed that by implementing climate policies, the US could strategically induce other countries to cut their carbon pollution.
When asked at what date climate change will have a net negative impact on the global economy, the median survey response was 2025. In the recent past, climate change likely had a net positive impact on the global economy, due primarily to the effect of carbon fertilization on crops and other plant life. However, even contrarian economists agree, when accounting for the vulnerability of poorer countries to climate impacts, global warming has been hurting the global economy since about 1980. 
The NYU survey asked when the economic benefits we experienced up to 1980 would be completely wiped out; 41% of respondents said that’s already happened. Another 25% answered that it would happen within a decade, and 26% said we’d see net negative economic impacts by 2050. If we continue with business-as-usual pollution and warming, on average the experts predicted a GDP loss of about 10% by the end of the century, and that there would be a 20% chance of a “catastrophic” loss of one-quarter of global GDP.
Of course, ideally we would have stopped warming the planet in 1980 to preserve the economic benefits of global warming to that date. At this point it’s a question of just how much damage climate change will do to the global economy, and the economic experts are worried that the results could be catastrophic.
78% of the survey participants said that it’s likely (36%) or extremely likely (42%) that climate change will have a long-term negative impact on the growth rate of the global economy. That’s an important point, because most current integrated economic-climate assessment models assume that economic growth will continue regardless of climate change impacts. There’s been a growing body of research indicating that as you might expect, that won’t be the case. 
The results of this survey question show that most expert economists agree, climate change will hurt global economic growth. That also suggests that past model-based studies likely significantly underestimated the costs of climate change. Along the same lines, 51% of the experts answered that the US government’s estimate for the “social cost of carbon” ($37 per metric ton), which is largely based on estimates from these models, is too low. 18% of the experts said that value is about right, and just 8% said it’s too high.
The survey also asked the experts about the most economically efficient method of reducing carbon pollution. 81% said a market-based system (carbon tax or cap and trade system) would be most efficient, while 13% answered that coordinated performance standards and programs that prioritize cleaner fuels and energy efficiency would be most efficient.
In the US, President Obama’s Clean Power Plan is closer to the latter system of performance standards, although the president has said he would prefer the type of market-based system favored by 81% of economic experts. Implementing a carbon tax or cap and trade system would require bipartisan congressional action, but over the past several years, Republican Party leaders have shown scant interest in crafting the efficient climate policies favored by economic experts and by their own voters.
The NYU survey reveals a clear economic consensus on global warming. The experts agree: climate change is hurting the global economy, we should mitigate those costs by cutting carbon pollution, and the most efficient way to do that is with a market-based system like a carbon tax or cap and trade system.
This expert consensus clearly contradicts the arguments made by Republican Party leaders and other opponents of climate policies – that taking these actions will cripple the economy. In reality, economists are worried that if we fail to cut carbon pollution and instead continue with business-as-usual, it will badly stunt economic growth and may potentially lead to catastrophic economic consequences. 
However, we can still solve the problem while creating jobs and growing the economy, if our political leaders will listen to the economic experts and their voters. So far, convincing Republican Party leaders to listen to an expert climate consensus has been a fruitless task, but there are signs that the party is starting to move in the right direction."

Hydro- and thermo-electric (nuclear, fossil-fuelled, biomass-fuelled) power plants are vulnerable to dwindling rivers and reservoirs as the planet warms, a study published in Nature on Monday said.
These technologies, which provide 98% of global electricity supply, depend on abundant water to cool generators and pump power at dams.
Lower river levels and warmer water temperatures could reduce generating capacity by as much as 86% in thermo-electric- and 74% in hydro plants, according to researchers at Wageningen University and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis.
It comes as water demand for power generation is set to double within the next 40 years, the report said. Drought-stricken hydro producers have reverted to dirtier energy sources in the past to shore up tottering grids.
Global warming is set to boost river levels in Canada, India and central Africa as global weather patterns shift. Yet most hydroplants are in regions forecast to see shortages, like South America, which generates almost two-thirds of its electricity from hydro.
If those plants became 10% more efficient in producing electricity that could offset the constraints, the study said.
Converting to seawater and dry air cooling would achieve the same result for thermo-electric plants, but likely raise energy bills. Switching from coal to gas-fired power plants, whose cooling towers need less water, was preferable.
Non-hydro renewable sources are growing, but are unlikely to be the dominant sources of power generation over the course of the century, the study said.
Planners were urged to take heed of future constraints as they build new plants, which remain in operation for several decades.
“Considering the increase in impacts of water constraints on power generation and the long design lifetime of power plant infrastructure (∼30–60 years for thermoelectric power and 80 years for hydro power), adaptation options should be included in today’s planning to fulfil the growing electricity demands in the next decades.”"

Several voices were quick however to exploit underspending on flood defences to attack overseas aid commitments. Ironically, estimates of £5-£6bn flood damage costs are more than covered by UK subsidies to fossil fuels – providing a more obvious candidate to switch resources. 
Problematically, many clung to the idea that extreme events would trigger a change of mind on climate change. Yet policy seems untouched.
Unrelenting, bleak and disconnected is no way to start a new year. But what if there was a seasonal subject that could tell the climate story, explain how we might change and adapt and, at least if you live in the UK, provide a little pleasure too? 
Don’t put your glasses raised to new year down yet, the day of the champagne environmentalist may have arrived, in a good way.
The world of wine, and especially the sparkling kind, can seem frivolous. But shifting patterns of global production are becoming a bellwether for climate change. Rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns pose particular problems to an industry which is so sensitive to weather that even mild seasonal variations can be tasted in every glass of the final product. Some grapes, like pinot noir, prosper only in a temperature range of 14C-16C.
Increasing extreme weather events like the damaging European heatwave of 2003, revealed an acute vulnerability, for example, of traditional champagne-growing areas. Winemaking literally dried up. Last summer saw fears of a repeat. Wine reveals how a warming world challenges us to find new, more benign production methods and also to rethink our consumption habits.
The UK’s changing climate, with warmer summers and milder winters, has presided over a boom in the production of high-quality sparkling wines and a flourishing of small-scale producers, especially in the southwest, a part of the country hit badly by floods in 2014.
Breaky Bottom vineyard is one example, operating since 1974 at the end of a rough farm track near the town of Lewes and charming wine critics. That counts as well-established compared to its near neighbour the Bluebell vineyard which only began production in 2007 and started winning awards by 2011. 
Though still modest internationally, they are part of a surge of production which has seen the area under production in England double in seven years. A good year in 2014 saw the equivalent of 6.3m bottles produced, nearly 50% more than the previous year, and exports to 14 countries.
The high-quality, but small scale, non-industrial operation typical of wine making in the UK provides a lesson in sustainability according to Julia Stafford, founder of the Wine Pantry, a business set up to sell exclusively English wine. With a background in shipping, she saw the problems of industrial-scale production which is obsessed with cheapness, and the potential for a different approach in the emerging English market.
“People laughed at first. But long summers are good for us. We don’t have the problem of extreme heat. It’s a young industry in the UK, with small areas and experimental,” explains Stafford.
At Sharpham in Devon, award-winning wines are grown by the River Dart near Totnes. A study on whether the town could feed itself found that even with its current small-scale, high-quality production, the Sharpham vineyard produced enough to provide a bottle of wine each month to every one of the area’s 22,000 inhabitants. 
Internationally, says Stafford, “You have all this wine mass produced, an energy intensive industry. But here we tend to do hand picking, and use sheep and cows to graze instead of using herbicides. It’s a lighter footprint.” To get a more sustainable wine industry, she says: “Have one good bottle (that might be more expensive), not two (cheap) bad bottles.”
The UK has, for the moment, won the climate lottery for producing some wines. But success could be short-lived. As temperatures continue to rise, one projection suggests that by 2080 the south-west will only be good for growing raisins.
In the US, the wine industry already faces major challenges. California, for example has been hit by both protracted drought and extremes of rainfall. After a period of denial, growers there say climate change is becoming too obvious to ignore.
“I think that as human beings, until we experience something like real pain, we can generally find a way to rationalise things and pretty much defer tough decisions,” says Randall Grahm of the Bonny Doon Vineyard, a wine maker near Santa Cruz, celebrated for championing terroir and biodynamic growing techniques. “But, wells are running dry. The 2015 vintage is possibly the earliest harvest on record in California, and wild-fire flames are licking at the edge of Napa Valley.”
Rising temperatures are changing the characteristics of the grapes and the wine they produce, he says, and not in a good way. Alcohol content is going up and natural acidities are declining, eroding the wines’ finesse and elegance. In response, makers are trying to find new grape varieties or rootstocks, avoid local regulatory obstacles to planting new vineyards, and respond creatively to climate change.
“We are trying to plant a new vineyard in San Juan Bautista in such a way that will allow, at least for the red grapes, the possibility of dry-farming,” says Grahm, “We’re using more drought-tolerant rootstocks, wider plant spacing, smaller, head-trained vines, and most significantly, using biochar as a means of enhancing the water-holding capacity of the soil.”
Their ploughing technique is designed to avoid rain draining away. As well as adapting to climate change, Grahm is pioneering techniques to reduce the industry’s impact by reducing its more energy intensive infrastructure. He opts for a lower-impact plantation, progressively eschewing wires, end-posts, stakes, irrigation, in favour of a mixed plantation, ecological balance that might make spraying unnecessary and the use of biochar mixed with compost as a way to sequestering carbon in the soil. 
If you want to explain something, they say you should talk to people about what they care about. 
As public spending cuts were voted through in the last UK Coalition government, annual spending on champagne rose in the bars of Westminster to £35,000. Wine could be the ultimately safe subject to communicate climate change where even great deluges fail.
As some in the industry point to ways in which we can both adapt to and minimise warming, in the UK at least you can become a “champagne environmentalist” without it necessarily being an insult, as long as you don’t drink too much."

It's time to upgrade or be overtaken | Richard di Natale";"Businesses around the world are investing in low carbon technology. Political leaders can either seize the opportunity or get left behind";"2016 is promising to be a happy new year. The remarkable achievement of 196 nations signing up to the successor of the Kyoto protocol means the first ever year with a global agreement to end the old ways of pumping heat-trapping carbon pollution into our atmosphere and oceans.
Now the hard and exciting work begins.
Transitioning the economy to ensure a pollution-free future throws up enormous opportunities. Commercialising new technologies, improving our productivity by wasting less energy, building mass-transit networks and providing farmers with new income streams from carbon markets are just a taste. Entrepreneurs can see these opportunities and are already working hard to make these prospects a reality.
It became clear to me during the Paris climate talks that business, local governments and civil society are leading the transition and politicians are playing catch up. This century will belong to those nations whose political leaders display the courage and vision to transition to zero carbon economies. They will do this because they can see that far from simply posing a cost to their economy, it is a pathway to future prosperity.
Political leaders will either deploy the policy settings that unleash these opportunities in the new economy, or they will do nothing for fear of upsetting the dominant industries of today. Doing nothing is always the easiest political option, but it means saying farewell to many of the brightest ideas, jobs and investment that will leave our shores to more supportive commercial environments.
My home state of Victoria is a prime example of how if we choose to do nothing, we miss out on jobs and investment despite being perfectly placed to lead Australia’s transition to a clean economy.
Right now, 85% of Victoria’s homes and businesses are powered by brown coal, the dirtiest form of energy on earth. These power stations are old (their average age is 42 years), inefficient and operating well past their expected life. They are the old polluting Datsun Sunny on a highway of 21st century electric cars.
Victoria’s power stations are not just a drag on our environment, they are holding back jobs in the clean economy. For years governments have been told by the independent energy market experts that there is too much electricity in the system. Despite the assurances made when the Liberals and Labor joined together to slash the renewable energy target, clean energy construction is stagnant because the market is oversupplied with dirty power. Without a price on carbon pollution, brown coal will be the last to exit the market.
Through a staged timeline for Hazelwood’s closure we could remove a massive 13% of the state’s total pollution in one hit. This effect would be to open up space for new clean energy construction while injecting the skills and training that the new economy brings to Victoria’s workforce. If we set down a pipeline of clean tech projects and a detailed transition plan for workers in the coal industry, then much of the hard work is done.
The higher we set our clean energy and climate targets, the more investment and entrepreneurs we attract to help us reach them. It’s just another example of how the environment and the economy are moving in the same direction. The old false dichotomy of “jobs versus the environment” is well and truly redundant.
Attending the climate negotiations in Paris allowed me the opportunity to witness first-hand how this economic shift is unstoppable. The number of people, institutions and investors is huge and growing so the only question left is whether Australia wants to ride this wave or whether we’ll watch from the carpark.
There is a dawning realisation among Australians that responding to catastrophic global warming is no longer a brake on our economy. With the world acknowledging that there is no long-term future for coal and other fossil fuels a carefully planned transition that quarantines risk and protects workers will give us an unshakeable platform to build the jobs-rich clean economy that will define the 21st century. But we need to start now.
As the nation ponders the new year, our political leaders are faced with a momentous choice. If we choose to keep the settings on auto pilot, as we did with last month’s mid-year budget, then Australia will find itself with a 19th century economy bumbling along in a 21st century world. Alternatively we can embrace the change and set Australia up for greater prosperity and wellbeing than ever before. "

But what, if anything, will the landmark Paris agreement do for thousands of species already under threat from global warming?";"The word “biodiversity” is employed once in the Paris agreement’s 32 pages. “Forests” appears a few times, but “oceans”, like biodiversity, scores just a single appearance. There is no mention of extinction. Wildlife, coral reefs, birds, frogs, orchids, polar bears and pikas never show up anywhere in the document.
This is hardly surprising: the landmark agreement in Paris – the boldest yet to tackle climate change (which is saying something, but not nearly enough) – was contrived by one species for the benefit of one species. It was never meant to directly address the undeniable impacts of global warming on the world’s eight million or so other species – most of them still unnamed. But many experts say this doesn’t mean biodiversity won’t benefit from the agreement – especially if the 196 participants actually follow through on their plegdes and up their ambition quickly.
“[The agreement] is critical for people and it is critical for biodiversity,” said Edward Perry, Birdlife’s climate change policy coordinator, who dubbed the passage of the Paris agreement in December “monumental.”
Most biodiversity experts concurred that the Paris agreement was an important step forward, but none thought it would be enough to counter the vast risks posed to biodiversity by global warming. Indeed a recent study in Science found that more than 5% of the world’s species will likely go extinct even if we manage to keep temperatures from rising more than 2C, the uppermost target outlined in Paris. 
“[The Paris agreement] doesn’t go far enough, but that really misses the point,” said Nancy Knowlton, a coral reef expert with the Smithsonian Institution. “It moves us in the right direction, finally, and future efforts can be even more ambitious. To paraphrase Voltaire, we can’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.”
Scientists have identified thousands of species that have already been hit by global warming or will likely be in the near-future. For example, Edward Perry pointed to a recent scientific review by his organisation that found a quarter of the world’s most-researched birds have already been negatively impacted by climate impacts.
“According to climate projections, there will be more than twice as many losers than winners under climate change [for birds],” said Perry, who noted that, to date, scientist have pointed to 2,300 birds with traits that makes them “highly vulnerable” to global warming.
What is pushing them over the edge now, I believe, is a perfect storm of lethal conditions
Already, climate change has disrupted some bird’s food sources, messed with the timing of fledgling and migrations, and shrunk the range of cold-loving species.
Birds are a good example of how climate change is already impacting wildlife because they are the best studied group on the planet. Yet, they aren’t the only ones feeling the heat. Climate change is also likely playing a role in the current amphibian crisis, which has seen around 200 amphibians vanish for good in recent decades.
“Pathogens are always smaller than their hosts, with faster metabolisms, and should therefore be able to acclimate more quickly to temperature shifts,” explained Moore. “This is a phenomenon that will not just affect amphibians!”
Currently, habitat destruction remains the biggest threat to amphibians, making species more vulnerable to even slight climatic changes, according to Moore. 
“Amphibians have survived four mass extinctions associated with major climate disturbances. What is pushing them over the edge now, I believe, is a perfect storm of lethal conditions that we have created.”
Still, no one knows for certain how climate change will impact the majority of the world’s individual species, just as we don’t even know how many species share our planet (pegged at anywhere from 3 to 100 million, though a study in 2011 came up with an estimate of 8.7 million). But we can broaden our view. Just as there are some human communities living on the front lines of climate change – such as low-lying island states or drought-prone countries – there are also particular environments that scientists view as super vulnerable to climate change.
Coral reefs are considered one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, and the most species-rich in the oceans. Their counterpart on land may well be cloud forests, which are high-altitude forests often blanketed in clouds – and also ridiculously rich in biodiversity. Similarly, coral reefs and cloud forests occupy very small slices of the planet: cloud forests make up only around 1% of the world’s forests and coral reefs less than 1% of the ocean’s floor. And both are feeling the heat.
Coral reef expert, Joshua Cinner with James Cook University, said that climate change is delivering three separate punches to coral reefs: hotter oceans lead to higher incidences of coral bleaching, ocean acidification (which, like global warming, is caused by carbon dioxide emissions) makes it more difficult for corals to build and maintain their skeletons, while more powerful storms fueled by climate change can wreck reefs.
It is not like two degrees Celsius, or even 1.5 degrees Celsius, is a threshold whereby everything will be OK.
For reefs, Cinner said, the climate crisis “isn’t something off in the far-flung future. It has already happened, and will continue to happen.”
This year, record high temperatures driven by climate change – and exacerbated by El Niño – has led the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to declare only the third global coral reef bleaching event on record. The key here is global: usually bleaching events are regional or localised.
When it comes to coral reefs, Cinner called the Paris agreement “a step in the right direction,” but also pointed out that even keeping temperatures below rising 1.5C – an aspirational goal in the Paris agreement – would not be enough to avoid further damage to the world’s reefs.
“It is important to understand that it is not like 2C, or even 1.5C, is a threshold whereby everything will be OK...The point is that even with a 1.5 degree rise, we are looking at very serious problems for many coral reefs.”
Amphibian-expert Moore agreed that there was significant uncertainty about biodiversity even with the 1.5 degrees goal in the Paris Agreement.
“It’s impossible to know what a world with temperatures 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will look like...but just talking about it ad nauseam is like debating who should call the fire department whilst watching your house burn down.”
Instead, he said, it’s time for action.
Cloud forests, like coral reefs, have evolved to survive within certain temperature gradients. Already, scientists have documented cloud forests literally migrating upslope to escape warming. But, according to David Lutz, a forest ecologist with Dartmouth, cloud forest species “do not appear to be migrating as fast as they need to be to keep up” with steadily rising temperatures.
“As the world grows warmer – or as periodic heat waves become more fierce – these species literally have nowhere to go but heaven,” said William Laurance, a noted rainforest scientist with James Cook University. “I think we’ll lose more biodiversity from tropical mountains than anywhere else in the world.”
The situation becomes even more complicated by the fact that many of these forests won’t even be able to migrate as far as possible. Instead, as tree seedlings sprout upslope they will run into high-elevation cattle ranching, at least in the Andes.
“As trees attempt to migrate up into this grassland, they will be either eaten by cows, or burned when the pastures are intentionally burned to encourage grass growth,” said Lutz.
If strategies to allow cloud forest to migrate as far as possible aren’t developed many of them are likely to vanish, taking innumerable species found no-where else with them.
The Paris agreement noted “the importance of ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems, including oceans, and the protection of biodiversity,” but went into few details about how individual countries should, or even could, go about safeguarding imperiled species in the face of rising temperatures.
When social change happens it can happen very quickly – this is what gives me hope.
What the agreement did do, however, was acknowledge the importance of conservation in protecting carbon sinks, often referring specifically to forests.
Moore, who called this inclusion “particularly significant,” said “we cannot talk about addressing climate change without stemming the rampant loss of the world’s forests.”
Experts said they hoped the agreement would boost initiatives like REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation), a UN programme that proposes to use funding from rich nations to pay developing countries to keep forests standing. Under negotiation for the better part of a decade, REDD+ projects are just beginning to launch – and the initiative made a number of important appearances at the Paris talks.
Prior to the meeting, the UK, Germany and Norway put down $5bn to reduce deforestation in the tropics, while African nations pledged to restore 100 million hectares of forest across the continent over the next 15 years. If done correctly – and with involvement by locals and indigenous groups – such programmes could go a long way toward preserving biodiversity on land.
But, some experts have become concerned not just about direct impacts on biodiversity from climate change, but how a warmer future could increasingly pit humans against wildlife.
“We have anecdotal evidence that poaching increases when droughts or floods affect food production,” explained Nikhil Advani, WWF’s senior program officer of climate change adaptation, who also noted that when hydroelectric power plants fail during droughts people often turn to forests for fuel.
He added that many of the big mammals that WWF focuses on “will be more affected by these indirect impacts from people than any direct impact of climate change.”
The international group is launching a crowdsource data campaign, WWF Climate Crowd, in order to better understand such threats.
Climate change poses a unique difficulty to biologists as they have to cut through several layers of uncertainty to understand how biodiversity might respond in 10, 20 or even 100 years. But given the rising observable impacts on species – from Arctic ice melt to worsening forest fires to record droughts in the Amazon – the risks are impossible to ignore.
“I just can’t get past the nagging feeling that we’re putting off a lot of tough decisions,” said Laurance, who attended the talks in Paris and pointed to plans by India and China to keep building new coal-fired power plants despite the countries’ climate commitments.
“[We’re] essentially relying on our children and grandchildren to make even bigger sacrifices and bear heavier costs because we weren’t really willing to grapple with these issues ourselves.”
But Knowlton with the Smithsonian Institution is more optimistic.

As aspiring and early career environmental scientists, this was a dismaying welcome, for we are immensely disturbed and angered by the well-documented complicity of these companies in climate denial and disinformation. For example, recent investigative journalism has shed light on the fact that ExxonMobil, informed by their in-house scientists, has known about the devastating global warming effects of fossil fuel burning since the late 1970s, but spent the next decades funding disinformation campaigns to confuse the public, slander scientists, and sabotage science - the very science conducted by thousands of AGU members. Even today, ExxonMobil and Chevron continue to fund the American Legislative Exchange Council, a lobbying group that routinely misrepresents climate science to US state legislators and attempts to block pro-renewable energy policies. 
The impacts of Exxon’s tactics have been devastating. Thanks in part to Exxon, the American public remains confused and polarized about climate change. Thanks in part to Exxon, climate science-denying Republicans in Congress and lobby groups operating at the state level remain a major obstacle to U.S. efforts to mitigate climate change. 
And thanks in no small part to Exxon, climate action has been delayed at the global level; as the international community began to consider curbing greenhouse gas emissions with the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, Exxon orchestrated and funded anti-Kyoto campaigns, including participation in the Global Climate Coalition. The latter was so successful at shifting debate that the George W. Bush administration credited it with playing a key role in its rejection of the Kyoto Protocol.
Yet throughout the week-long conference of Earth scientists, Exxon was promoted as an excellent career option. The geoscience professionals showcase - an “opportunity to talk with featured employers” - proudly included Exxon. In a series of career advice workshops on transitioning beyond academia, our speaker more than once named Exxon as a potential employer in her hypothetical case studies, whereas cigarette company Benson &amp; Hedges was derisively put forward as an example recruiter we’d never dream of accepting.
As the week drew to an end, we were left to wonder why it is that at the largest convergence of Earth and climate scientists, the hosting organization would seemingly engage in a serious conflict of interest by enthusiastically accepting support from companies that actively undermine the work of many of its members. Or why, if it’s now taboo to work for tobacco companies because they deceived the public about the dangers of smoking, the next generation of Earth science scholars still finds encouragement in pursuing careers in the fossil fuel industry, which continues to twist truths about climate change. 
Some may argue that Exxon atones for its wrongdoings in other ways, but its actions are invariably in bad faith. For example, the company has never put its weight behind a carbon tax despite claims of support for the concept. It is the very disingenuousness of Exxon’s ways that makes their greenwashing efforts - like sponsoring AGU - so crucial to their survival. 
AGU states that its mission and core values are to “promote discovery in Earth science for the benefit of humanity” and for “a sustainable future.” But by allowing Exxon to appropriate AGU’s institutional social license to help legitimize the company’s climate disinformation, and by granting it the privilege to recruit from AGU’s own cohort of emerging scholars, AGU is undermining the work of its own members.
The issue of career paths also raises a deeper question that we as a community must address - however uncomfortable - as to why we are still promoting the training and recruitment of the next generation of scientists to develop future technologies and methods for discovering more oil and gas reserves, when science has told us that no more than one third of existing reserves can be burned to avoid dangerous climate change.
When it comes to Earth sciences, AGU has established a long history of scientific excellence with its peer-reviewed publications and conferences, and we’re proud to be included among its members. It is for this very reason we hope that, instead of thanking Exxon, AGU will now say, “No, thank you, Exxon.” This issue has been an elephant in the room for too long. It’s high time AGU protects the integrity of climate science and the message it sends to the public by cutting ties with a climate-denying corporation and by denouncing Exxon for its disinforming ways.

After global heat records were continually broken over the last decade, and as sea levels rose and scientists reported the accelerated melting of polar ice sheets, you might be forgiven for thinking the debate over climate change had shifted.
No more arguing over the science? It’s more about the policy now, right?
Well, wrong. At least according to a new study that has looked at 15 years worth of output from 19 conservative “thinktanks” in the United States.
“We find little support for the claim that ‘the era of science denial is over’ - instead, discussion of climate science has generally increased over the sample period,” the study concludes.
The conservative thinktanks under the microscope are the main cog in the machinery of climate science denial across the globe, pushing a constant stream of material into the public domain.
The study, published in the journal Global Environmental Change, analysed more than 16,000 documents published online between 1998 and 2013 by mainly US groups like the Heartland Institute, the Cato Institute and the American Enterprise Institute.
Contrary to some commentators, the study found attacks on science had increased in later years. At the same time, the thinktanks were focusing less on policy issues.
To come to that conclusion authors Dr Travis Coan, of the University of Exeter, and Dr Constantine Boussalis, of Trinity College Dublin, analysed 8300 articles, 3000 reports, 100 interview transcripts, 680 open letters and press releases and 3400 “scientific” reviews.
So did the result surprise them? Coan told me:
One the one hand, we were aware that many in both the media and academia believed that science denial was on the decline.
However, this didn’t fit with our casual reading of the skeptical literature and thus a major impetus of the paper was to put this idea to the test. 
Though, with that said, we were a bit surprised by the ‘rise’: my prior expectation was that the denial of science and policy, at least on average, has remained relatively constant. This does not appear to be the case.
Not only had the attacks on science increased but thinktanks had also ramped up their climate change output in recent years, the study found.
But was it possible the study’s clear declaration that “the era of climate science denial is not over” might no longer stand, given that the study period ended in August 2013?
After all, since then we have seen the record for the hottest year on record broken twice and, for the first time, more than 190 nations agreeing in Paris to keep global warming to “well below 2C”.
Coan agreed this was “certainly possible”, but “there are also reasons to speculate that the trend has continued.” He said:
We are currently working on a study with John Cook that looks at science and policy related themes (amongst other items) in the top 50 climate skeptic blogs through 2015. The topic structure (i.e. discourse) is very similar, and sometimes identical, to the conservative thinktanks and there is reason to think that these two time series move together. For the blogs, we find that the increase in science-related skepticism continues right through 2015. Again, these results are preliminary, but suggest that the ‘end of science denial’ - at least among these actors - might be wishful thinking.
The study explained these thinktanks “provide a multitude of services to the cause of climate change scepticism”. These included:
Many of the 19 thinktanks analysed in the study have in the past accepted funding from fossil fuel interests, such as oil giant Exxon and the billionaire Koch brothers.
In October 2015 a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) found thinktanks that had taken corporate funding from the likes of Exxon and the Kochs were more likely to produce material designed to polarise the climate change issue.
Exxon is currently facing an investigation from the New York attorney general into whether it lied to the public and investors about the risks of human-caused climate change.
Dr Justin Farrell, the author of the PNAS study, told me he was pleased to see more research into conservative thinktanks.
“We are still years away from fully understanding the extent of contrarian influence on climate change politics during the last 20 years,” he said.
The latest study seems to show that thinktanks began to concentrate more on attacking the science in around 2003 but it took until about 2010 for science attacks to overtake policy discussions. But why did this happen?
One possible reason, speculates Coan, is the effect of the 2009 illegal hacking of climate scientist’s emails from a server at the University of East Anglia.
While subsequent investigations found no wrongdoing, conservative thinktanks and commentators ran hard with the “scandal” – and some still do – claiming scientists were part of a grand conspiracy to deceive the world.
Dr Aaron McCright, of Michigan State University, who studies climate science denial, said the rising attacks on science appeared to have coincided with the election of Democrat Barack Obama as US president in late 2008. He said:
The Right no longer controlled the Executive Branch or Congress... at least for the first few years of the Obama Administration.. and thus no longer had as much power inside the government to block climate change policy as they did under George W. Bush. So, they - and a considerable part of industry - ramped up denial activism after 2008 to the high levels we have seen since.
McCright said the “denial machine” had since expanded from think tanks to include bloggers and fake grassroots campaigns and was now “more diverse and seemingly ubiquitous.”
He said conservative think tanks had influenced the public’s understanding of climate change and the way policymakers had reacted to it, in two ways. 
First, he said in recent decades US Republicans had used thinktank materials in committee meetings and hearings “to justify inaction on climate change”.
Second, thinktank materials had been taken up as the standard talking points for conservatives.
“Indeed, I would argue that anti-environmentalism - and climate change denial more specifically - has become a central tenet of the current conservative and Republican identity.”
Dr Riley Dunlap, of the Oklahoma State University, and who has partnered with McCright on several influential studies, told me:
While conservative thinktanks were involved in denial from the outset - 1989 at least - we have argued they really moved to the forefront in the late 90s when BP and then other companies pulled out of the industry-led Global Climate Coalition that had arguably been the most powerful force in denial. In fact, the conservative thinktanks were upset that oil companies were ‘caving in’ to the IPCC, and decided to take the lead. This also really shifted the basis of denial from economic self-interest to ideological opposition – the commitment to neoliberalism’s distaste for all government regulations.
McCright added that “knowing what is going on is one thing” but knowing what to do about it was more challenging. I’ll leave you with his thoughts.
Opposing policy is one thing. Undermining, denying, obfuscating, etc. science is another. I wish I had a powerful, simple solution to counter the climate change denial movement, but I don’t. Nevertheless, at the very least, we can continue to drag them from the shadows and into the bright light of day, vigilantly document their activities, and regularly call them out over what they are doing.

The average national temperature in 2015 was 54.4F (12.4C) – 2.4F (4.3C) above the 20th-century average – making it the second-warmest year since record-keeping began in 1895, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said.
Jake Crouch, a climate scientist with Noaa’s National Centers for Environmental Information, said that the temperature average across the contiguous US was more than six degrees above the previous century’s average. “No state was actually cooler than average during 2015,” Crouch said in a press conference. “Every state had an above-average temperature during the year.”
Last year was the 19th consecutive year where the annual average US temperature exceeded its 20th-century average – only 2012 was warmer, with an average temperature of 55.3F. Although 2.4F doesn’t sound like much, Noaa cautioned that it was an indicator of a global climate imbalance.
“Although on a day-to-day basis it may not be that big a deal, over time it is large, because part of the events that build that 2.4-degree difference are the kinds of things that we saw in the eastern United States this December,” said Deke Arndt, chief of the climate monitoring branch at Noaa’s National Centers for Environmental Information.
Noaa’s data also noted the extreme nature of weather-related natural disasters in 2015. “In 2015, there were 10 weather and climate disaster events in the US, each with losses exceeding $1bn,” said Adam Smith, an applied climatologist at Noaa. “Overall, these resulted in the deaths of 155 people and had significant economic effects.” Smith noted in particular a spree of tornadoes in Texas, record-setting rainfall and flooding in South Carolina, and a western wildfire season which burned more than 10m acres – “the largest area burned since record-keeping began in 1960”.
Released on the heels of a landmark global climate deal that aims to hold nearly 200 nations accountable for greenhouse gas emissions, as well as only weeks after anunseasonably warm holiday season, Noaa scientists cautioned against making any direct links between the record-nearing average temperature and global warming related to climate change.
“Climate is an outcome of many ingredients and many factors to give us the outcome that they do,” said Arndt, who also noted that the particularly strong El Niño weather phenomenon likely contributed to distinct weather events.
El Nino’s presence also contributed to one of the rainiest years in history. “The contiguous US also experienced its third-wettest year on record,” primarily related to the strong presence of El Niño, said Crouch. Not all states benefitted from the rain, however, with California suffering “an exceptional drought throughout all of the year, according to Crouch, making 2015 California’s 13th-driest in 121 years of record-keeping.
Noaa scientists also said that the organization’s September prediction that 2015 would likely shape up to be the world’s hottest on record was still expected to bear fruit. Those data are due for release 20 January."

From natural hazards to natural resources, and from climate change to planetary science, Earth and space scientists serve especially crucial roles. Providing them with the tools they need to effectively communicate the facts of their research so that policymakers, business leaders, and the public can make informed decisions is crucial. 
Despite the important role science plays, we scientists are often stereotyped as uninterested or incapable of translating our work into something the public can understand. To the contrary, many of us who would otherwise be interested in communicating our science to broad audiences often find ourselves lacking the necessary training. 
The absence of formal training opportunities is perplexing problem, as scientists have much to offer society as a whole. Where departments and institutions fall short in providing training, for Earth and space scientists at least, the American Geophysical Union’s (AGU) Sharing Science Program fills that gap. 
AGU is a society with nearly 60,000 members worldwide, devoted to promoting discovery in Earth and space science for the benefit of society. It hosts the world’s largest Earth science meeting, held each December in the USA. In addition to its core mission, AGU is dedicated to the promotion of science to a larger audience. To fill that role, AGU created the Sharing Science program. 
The Sharing Science network is composed of scientists from around the world who are passionate about sharing their science with broad audiences. Members range from undergraduates who are looking for advice on how fit science communication into their career path, to researchers who want to express the value of their work to lawmakers and legislators, to tenured professors who never received formal training in science communication but are now realizing the value of translating their work into plain English. 
The program encompasses all of the resources and opportunities needed to help scientists effectively communicate with broader audiences — including journalists, educators and students, policymakers, and the public — about Earth and space science and its importance. It includes interactive workshops, webinars, toolkits and more to help scientists understand their audience’s needs and to improve their communications skills. 
AGU also creates and facilitates opportunities for scientists to share their knowledge with a variety of audiences through social media, op-eds, connections with local community groups or legislators, public talks, and media interviews. And scientists are offered the opportunity to network with other science communicators, volunteer to serve as experts and resources to reporters, and have their voices heard through our blogging and social media platforms.
I asked Dr. Shane M. Hanlon with the Sharing Science Program at AGU how they help scientists become better communicators. He told me, 
AGU wants to help scientists convey the value of their work to diverse audiences by empowering them to be visible, authoritative, and accessible voices in their community and the world. 
Sharing Science seeks to break down barriers, whether it’s a barrier of not knowing how to find opportunities to engage their audiences, or a barrier imposed by the formalness of scientific training. One small example of such a barrier is the use of jargon. Because it acts as a barrier when communicating science, the program aims to teach scientists how to avoid jargon when speaking with diverse audiences. Non-scientist audience members shut down at the first mention of “geomorphology” or “hydrostatic equilibrium,” but when scientists talk about the origins of landscapes and fluids at rest, the picture is clearer. While jargon is a necessary part of science, reducing its usage is a core part of being a successful science communicator. 
It’s important for scientists to be clear, but also concise. Explaining research in plain English is one thing; not boring the audience to death in the process is another. That’s why AGU provides scientists with the tools to explain years of work in 30 seconds or less. If a scientist can sum up their work in 30 seconds, then giving a 5-minute radio interview, 10-minute talk at a conference, or 1-hour presentation to community group becomes less intimidating.
These are just a few examples of how the program works to eliminate those barriers to successful communication. Scientists don’t have to “dumb down” their research or lesson the intellectual merit or seriousness of their work, they just have to speak in ways that engage their audience’s attention and values.
So, what’s next for this endeavor? Illustrating the importance of science communication is getting easier but there is still a lot of work to do. “It feels like things are different now – that we’re past the point of having to convince people that there’s a need for better science communication, so now we can just get right to helping scientists hone their skills,” said Aaron Huertas, multi-year leader of a “Communicating Climate Science” workshop at the AGU annual meeting and Senior Washington Director with Cater Communications, a bipartisan strategic communications firm. 
The Sharing Science program is only in its third year, but AGU has seen an increase, not only in membership, but also in interest about the program and science communication as a whole. Every year at its annual meeting, AGU runs numerous workshops on science communication, and Sharing Science staff members travel all over the country to train eager scientists in communication techniques. AGU is also partnering with other organizations and societies to provide scientists with communication tools.
What scientists are also learning is that the value of communicating is now becoming acknowledged by their peers. And it isn’t just AGU that’s involved. Other organizations like the Union of Concerned Scientists, The American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Meteorological Society either acknowledge excellence in communication or support communication efforts of their members. 
There are also groups whose sole focus is on climate communication (Climate Communication and Climate Nexus are perhaps the best). Five years ago, my colleagues and I even set up a website whose goal is to connect reporters and elected officials with scientists to talk about current climate events (the Climate Science Rapid Response Team).
 Perhaps the most prestigious communication honor is the annual Climate Communication Prize. The past five winners are really the who’s-who among our community. I asked the most recent winner, Dr. Richard Somerville, about the importance of communication, particularly for young scientists. He told me, 
I encourage all scientists, including young scientists, to explore the opportunities for communicating their science and to seek help from professionals. Nobody is born a great communicator, but it involves skills that can be learned. Many universities and research institutions have helpful experts on staff whose job is to translate the science into everyday English for the media and other outlets. I have benefited by working for more than 20 years with a superb communications professional, Susan Joy Hassol. On the website climatecommunication.org, she and I and our colleagues have assembled many valuable resources for communicating climate science.
Young scientists also need to be mentored skillfully in the art of combining communications work with the other aspects of their job, such as research and teaching and service. A word of caution: Different employers will have different expectations, and it may be prudent for a young scientist to establish a strong record in research, for example, before spending much time on communication. I advise young scientists to learn from the senior colleagues who will assess them for promotions and tenure. Keep in mind that these people may judge quality by looking in a mirror.
At the end of the day, the goal is get science out there, from scientists to any audience. "

The huge flood will reverse the seaward flow of the river that feeds into the lake, submerge forests, make a perfect wetland for spawning fish and will replenish soils for a rich rice harvest.
Tonlé Sap is the most intensely-fished inland body of water in the world and as the annual flood subsides, many millions of fish will flow from it and back into the massive Mekong river where they will become the staple food of thousands of villages.
But this extraordinary annual cycle which has fed Cambodia’s 23 million people for centuries is fracturing as first China, and now neighbouring Laos and Thailand, prepare to build a series of great dams across the mighty Mekong and its tributaries to provide electricity for the region’s burgeoning cities. Eleven dams are planned to span the main river and nearly 100 more on its tributaries.
The dam builders and governments cite the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but what they don’t tell people is that the dams will slow the flow of the Mekong basin rivers and affect food supplies. 
The Tonlé Sap, known as the beating heart of Cambodia, is liable not to flood, says Mark Goichot, a hydro-geologist working with WWF. “Most of Cambodia’s fish spawn is in Tonlé Sap lake, that is fed by the Mekong river. If less water comes downstream because of the dams, the lake will not flood as usual and the fish will not be able to migrate upstream, affecting the food supplies of millions of people. It is an ecological timebomb that threatens the food security of millions.”
Now a paper in the journal Science  from 39 leading aquatic ecologists warns that the Mekong, Amazon and Congo – the world’s three greatest and most biodiverse tropical rivers – all stand to be heavily dammed, possibly resulting in the loss of up to one third of all the freshwater fish in the world.
Tropical rivers are traditionally less dammed than those in temperate regions partly because they are mostly far from large human populations and are in places hard to access. But now, as demand for electricity soars across Africa, Latin America and the south-east Asia, it is increasingly attractive to develop hydropower.
In total, say the authors, over 450 large dams are planned for the three river basins. The consequences for food production is unknown, but it has been calculated that if 11 of the 12 mainstream dams are constructed on the Mekong, the total loss in fish could be between 550,000 and 880,000 tons a year. According to International Rivers, an environmental NGO, more than 100 species of fish in the region could face extinction.
The paper takes as an example of the gap between official promises and reality the Three Gorges dam across the Yangtze river in China. This was finished in 2012 at a cost of around $20bn and was justified by the government as providing 10% of all China’s electricity. In fact it generates under 2%.
On the plus side, the biggest dam in the world has provided flood control, masses of electricity for cities like Shanghai and better river navigation. But on the debit side, it has had a devastating effect on fish populations, and led to increased erosion and landslides, and poorer water quality downstream. Moreover, it has forced over 1 million people to move and has spread disease. Now the Chinese authorities are having to spend up to $26bn over 10 years to mitigate some of the adverse environmental effects.
So are big dams worth it? The unprecedented building boom is widely justified as good for people because dams provide cheap electricity for development, and good for the environment because they are said to provide clean electricity and lower carbon emissions in a warming world. As such, they are likely to become more popular as countries try to meet the targets they set for themselves at the Paris climate summit in December.
The reality is that they are anything but climate-neutral and are responsible for large volumes of CO2 emissions from the concrete needed to build them, and for vast quantities of powerful methane gas emissions from the rotting of vegetation and soils flooded by their large reservoirs. By some calculations, the world’s 33,071 registered large dams may even produce 4% of all climate emissions.
The world is right to seek clean energy, but the unintended consequences of a rush to tropical hydropower may be as dangerous as climate change itself.

The “greening government commitments”, which began when David Cameron declared he would lead the “greenest government ever” in 2010, were intended to deliver big cuts in carbon emissions, domestic flights, waste and water usage. 
Efforts fell short on all counts, though the reductions that were achieved still saved taxpayers £185m in the last year.
Ministers have been heavily criticised for cuts to a swath of green policies, including renewable energy and energy efficiency, and a leaked letter in November revealed the government is not on track the meet the nation’s EU obligation for green energy in 2020.
“Ministers’ failure to hit almost all of these targets means a bigger bill for taxpayers and more damage to the environment,” said Lisa Nandy, Labour’s shadow energy and climate secretary. “If the government can’t even cut its own pollution footprint, how can anyone have confidence they will cut Britain’s?”
“The government has still managed to save £185m in energy, waste and water costs, showing that environmental protection makes economic sense too,” said Craig Bennett, head of Friends of the Earth. “The government must end its relentless attacks on green issues and make the reduction of the nation’s environmental footprint a top priority.”
Ministers had targeted a 25% cut in carbon emissions from government buildings and travel in 2014-15, compared to 2009-10, but achieved 22%. The failure was largely due to the Ministry of Defence, which accounts for half of all government emissions and cut its emissions by 19%.
Emission cuts came largely from improved energy efficiency and accounted for 90% of the money saved. But the government recently cut plans to improve energy efficiency in people’s homes by 80%. George Osborne’s Treasury, often blamed for the government’s anti-green moves, cut its own emissions by 56%, one of the largest savings.
More than 169,000 domestic flights were taken by government officials in 2014-15, unchanged from the year before. This represents an 18% cut compared to 2009-10, but falls short of the 20% target.
Just eight of 22 departments met the target, while domestic flights by environment department staff actually increased and those from the culture department more than doubled. Health department flights plummeted, however, by 62%.
Waste reductions also failed to improve last year, with the overall cut at 22% compared to the 25% target. The Department of Energy and Climate Change’s waste went up by 18%, while that at the Department for Education fell by 62%.
On water use, just six departments managed to meet the good practice benchmark set as a target and 12 of the 22 departments met a target on transparency on the steps they were taking to be greener. But the government slashed its paper use by 38% overall, far above the 10% target.
“While the headline achievements may fall slightly short of the targets set for 2014-15, the picture at department level shows that many departments are meeting and exceeding targets, while others are recording valiant reductions in face of significant operational challenges,” said ministers Oliver Letwin and Rory Stewart in a foreword to the report.
A spokesman for the environment department said: “Following this success we are developing a new set of greening government commitments to see how we can go further, making the UK even greener.”
But Bennett criticised the government for missing its targets. “This says everything about the incompetence of this government when it comes to protecting the environment,” he said. “For months ministers have been systematically undermining national efforts to tackle climate change, and now we learn that they’ve failed to meet a whole range of green targets for their own performance too.”"

Researchers examined 175 satellite photos of giant icebergs in the Southern Ocean which surrounds Antarctica and discovered green plumes stretching up to 1,000km behind them. The greener colour of the plumes is due to blooms of phytoplankton, which thrive on the iron and other nutrients shed by the icebergs.
When these tiny algae - or the many creatures that eat them - die, they fall to the bottom of the ocean. This takes the carbon dioxide they have absorbed from the ocean surface and buries it deep below, thereby curbing the CO2 in the atmosphere and the global warming it causes.
“If giant iceberg calving increases this century as expected, this negative feedback on the carbon cycle may become more important than we previously thought,” said Professor Grant Bigg at the University of Sheffield, who led the study published in the journal Nature Geoscience.
Giant icebergs, defined as greater than 18km in length, make up half the ice floating in the Southern Ocean, with dozens present at any one time. The researchers calculated that the fertilisation effect of the icebergs in the normally iron-poor waters contributes up to 20% of all the carbon buried in the Southern Ocean, which itself contributes about 10% of the global total.
“We detected substantially enhanced chlorophyll levels, typically over a radius of at least four to 10 times the iceberg’s length,” said Bigg. The chlorophyll levels remained 10 times higher than in the surrounding ocean for at least a month and up to 200km behind the iceberg. Some increase in phytoplankton was seen as much as 1,000km behind the iceberg in a few cases.
The discovery was a surprise as previous studies of small icebergs, or using ship-based measurements, has suggested a much smaller fertilisation effect. The largest iceberg analysed in the new study was more than 50km long. 
The impact of global warming on melting ice in Antarctica, much of which is far below 0C, has been widely studied. Biggs and his colleagues note that satellite gravity data show a 5% increase in ice discharge from the continent over the past two decades.
In 2014, two separate teams of scientists found that the collapse of the Western Antarctic ice sheet is already under way and is unstoppable. The loss of this entire ice sheet would cause up to 4m of sea-level rise in coming centuries. In 2015, researchers found the melting of floating ice shelves around Antarctica was faster than thought, potentially unlocking extra sea level rise from larger ice sheets jammed behind them.
Professor Andrew Shepherd, director of the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at the University of Leeds, said in 2015 that the rates of ice shelf loss were unsustainable and could cause a major collapse. This is already occurring at the massive Pine Island glacier, where ice loss has doubled in speed over the last 20 years as its blocking ice shelf has melted."

In a conference call with reporters, Steyer said the speech on Tuesday offered one of the last high-visibility moments for Obama to make his case to the American public for a transformation of the US energy and climate system.
The last year was a banner year for climate change – with the Paris climate agreement, the rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline, an effective ban on Arctic drilling, and the finalisation of rules cutting carbon pollution from power plants, Steyer told the call.
“This is a great opportunity to make that case and make sure that the moves we made are decisive and irrevocable,” Steyer said. “He is obviously not going to get specific climate legislation through by the end of his administration … This is a chance for him to really address Americans and explain to them what he has been doing, why it still needs to be done, and why it is so important.”
On Monday, Steyer’s NextGen Climate teamed up with fellow activists Van Jones, founder of Green for All and briefly green jobs adviser for Obama; Mona Mangat, board chair of Doctors for America; and Michael Breen, chief executive of the Truman national security project, for the release of a new report casting climate change as a threat to national security and public welfare.
“To truly address poverty, we must address climate change once and for all. The economic burden of climate change will not be shouldered by all families equally,” the report Threat Multiplier: Climate Change and the State of Our Union, said.
The report extends the idea first embraced by the Pentagon nearly a decade ago that global warming deepened existing risks to the international order. (By 2014, the Pentagon had elevated climate change as an “immediate risk” to national security and its infrastructure).
It points out the public health risks posed by air pollution, water shortages and drought – all of which will be exacerbated by climate change, and notes the Pentagon’s concerns about national security.
“It is in America’s best national security interest to take action on climate change,” the report said, noting that the Syrian conflict and refugee crisis were fueled in part by drought and climate change.
Steyer has spent millions from his own fortune backing candidates with strong environmental records in an attempt to elevate the issue of climate change in elections – with mixed results.
The billionaire’s NextGen Climate group is pressing candidates to back his call for powering the country with more than 50% clean energy by 2030 – a far more ambitious target than Obama’s – and 100% clean energy by 2050.
Among potential presidential candidates in 2016, only the struggling Democratic contender, Martin O’Malley, matches Steyer’s level of ambition."

Before his appearance before the liaison committee at 4pm on Tuesday, the prime minister was accused of double standards for abandoning a commitment to hold a competition to encourage the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS), which could lead to decarbonisation of coal and gas, at the same time as professing to be serious about tackling climate change.
Just a year ago, Cameron had told the same group of MPs, made up of select committee chairs, that CCS was “absolutely crucial” for the UK, before funding for a £1bn trial was later scrapped.
Angus MacNeil, the chair of the energy and climate change committee, and Huw Irranca-Davies, the chair of the environmental audit committee, plan to challenge Cameron about the government’s decision, arguing it undermines the commitment to tackling climate change.
“The prime minister said that carbon capture and storage was crucial to meet our climate change targets,” MacNeil said. “Yet the government’s long-promised carbon capture competition has become the latest low-carbon policy to be chucked on the scrapheap.
“The prime minister must acknowledge that building a new generation of gas plants means that we either have to fit power stations with carbon capture technology in the coming decade or potentially bust our carbon budgets.”
The government has said the CCS development competition was always subject to affordability.
Cameron is also likely to be questioned on issues such as the Syria crisis and flood protection."

Technology could share the load";"In the fight against climate change, trees are an ally. They suck in carbon dioxide, reducing the harmful greenhouse gases. But there’s a problem: we’re asking them to work overtime.
Trees can’t absorb enough of the carbon dioxide humanity is throwing at them unless we turn every inch of available land into a dense forest, according to Christophe Jospe, chief strategist at Arizona State’s Center for Negative Carbon Emissions.
But what if trees – or machines modelled after them – had superpowers? Artificial trees with otherworldly abilities are a great hope against climate change, since environmental experts say it’s not realistic to expect humanity to release significantly less carbon into the atmosphere. Our best bet might be to capture the excess carbon and store it or convert it into something useful, such as fuel.
Five years ago, a Boston group recruited two designers to develop artificial city trees. The trees they envisioned offered shade and would absorb carbon dioxide. The thinking was to place the trees where soil was too shallow to host traditional trees.
The group delivered great mock-ups, but little else has come from it so far. Finding funding is a challenge.
“You don’t want to be the first person to pay,” said Kimberly Poliquin, the director of ShiftBoston. “Scientists have figures, but you don’t know if that’s going to be the reality.”
Capturing and storing carbon isn’t yet the type of expense local governments and organisations can slide into their budgets. The cost of the technology is dropping, but not to a point where it’s affordable to install “forests” of these systems. Poliquin estimates an upfront cost of $350,000 for an artificial tree, but she expects prices to come down considerably. She hopes to develop a prototype of such a tree in one or two years.
There’s plenty of interest in removing carbon from the air. One method is to capture carbon directly from the smokestacks of power plants. Another method – which the Boston project targeted – is pulling carbon out of the open air, where it isn’t present in as much density. In theory, one square kilometre of artificial trees could remove 4m tons of carbon a year, according to the Center for Negative Carbon Emissions, which is developing a technology to work in open spaces.
Find me $100m, and I’ll tell you how to put it to a very aggressive research and development agenda
Seven large-scale projects to capture and store carbon at power plants will arrive in 2016 and 20-17. Most are in the US and Canada. But more growth is needed before carbon capture and storage makes an impact on climate change. According to the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute, the 15 large-scale projects operating around the world can capture 28m tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. To keep climate change in check, we’ll need to process 4bn tonnes in 2040 and 6bn in 2050.
The Center for Negative Carbon Emissions is developing technology that it says is 1,000 times as effective as trees, per unit of biomass. The group is located in the desert because its technology responds well to warm, dry air and requires less energy in that environment.
Operating in cooler climates, such as Boston, would add expenses.
Once the technology is fully built out, the group estimates it will be removing carbon dioxide for about $100 a tonne. As is, there’s no resemblance to a tree as scientists – including those at Arizona State – focus on making the carbon-removal process effective and affordable rather than beautiful to look at.
More developments are needed for it to be cost-effective and spread around the world. Since 2007, the Global CCS Institute says, the global investment in carbon capture and storage has been less than $20bn, about one-hundredth of the investment into renewable technologies.
“It needs the likes of Mike Bloomberg, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Tom Steyer to champion early technology efforts to bring the cost down,” Jospe said. “Find me $100m, and I’ll tell you how to put it to a very aggressive research and development agenda, and five years later you can see some exciting technologies that start to show on the market.”
Gates is one of the investors in Carbon Engineering, a Calgary, Alberta, company that is developing industrial-grade technology to capture carbon and make fuels. It’s a promising case, but not yet something ready to substitute for a tree in a city park.

But 2016 will see the president back in the trenches, fending off law suits and Republican attacks that could undo his climate plan, and scrambling to get to key items on his to-do list before exiting the White House.
In a sign of the battles yet to come, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said he had invited as his guest a Kentucky coalminer who lost his job when his mine shut down, a gesture intended as a rebuke to Obama.
Administration officials and campaign groups said Obama is unlikely to let up in his final year in the White House: pursuing new rules to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas industry and pressing Congress to increase funding to communities hit hard by flooding, drought and other extreme weather events fuelled by climate change.
2015 was Obama’s biggest year for climate change with the finalisation of the clean power plant rules, rejection of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, ban on Arctic drilling and, in December, the forging of an historic global agreement in Paris to limit warming below 2C – all of which are expected to get a mention in Obama’s speech.
“Under President Obama’s leadership, the United States has done more to combat climate change than ever before,” the White House said in a fact sheet prepared for the address. 
Administration officials said Obama planned to keep up the pace in the remaining months of his term. “2016 is not going to be a year we slow down. It’s a year we build on the momentum of the historic year that passed,” Gina McCarthy, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, told the Council on Foreign Relations last week. 
Officials said Obama will take centre stage in a signing ceremony for the Paris global warming agreement at the United Nations in April.
 “You can be sure that the United States will be doing what ever we can to get a lot of momentum into early entry into force of this agreement,” Paul Bodnar, senior energy and climate director at the National Security Council, said.
But the president will be racing to the finish line to roll out the remaining items on his climate agenda – which are critical to delivering on the emissions goals he promised in Paris.
In the weeks ahead, Obama is expected to roll out long-awaited rules to cut methane emissions from oil and gas wells and landfills, a rising source of climate pollution.
The White House has spent the last six months on a final review of proposed new rules cutting methane, more than 80 times as warming as carbon dioxide in the 20-year timeframe.
The administration is also expected to tighten curbs on heavy vehicle emissions.
Analysts said that Obama will need to double down to meet the target of cutting emissions 17% on 2005 levels by 2020 set at the start of his presidency in 2009, and even more ambitious goal of 26%-28% cut in emissions by 2025 pledged under the Paris climate agreement.
Some of those targets were based on assumptions that have not materialised - such as rapid growth of hybrid and electric vehicles. In 2011, Obama set a goal of 1m electric cars by 2015, but record low oil prices have sent consumers back to pick-up trucks and SUVs.
The administration said it can find other areas to cut. White House officials told a seminar at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies last week that they hoped to amend the Montreal protocol ozone treaty this year to ban hydrofluorocarbons, which are used in air conditioning and are 10,000 more warming than carbon dioxide. The EPA estimates a ban could shave off 0.5C of warming.
Obama was also counting on an international aviation agreement to help pare emissions. 
But Obama’s main focus will be ensuring that the rules cutting carbon emissions from power plants – the biggest single US climate pledge - survive a legal and political onslaught.
McCarthy told an event at the council on Foreign Relations last week the administration wanted to do all it could to ensure the power plant rules remain “cast in stone”.
She said the administration would spend its remaining months implementing the clean power plant rules, and defending the regulations from legal challenges.
The speech promises Obama one of the last big moments to elevate the climate cause. In his 2015 state of the union address, the president said: “No challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.”
Obama is unlikely to ease up on climate now.

At times it got rather tetchy, and Andrew Tyrie certainly delivered on his promise to deliver “robust questions”. (See 3.35pm.)
 I’m very happy to do that, I think if people make offers and the churches have made offers, we should try and take them on.
I suppose you could say that means Cameron wants to help more people be like Helen Pidd (a very good ambition for any government.)
You have to be incredibly careful with highly sensitive information, information that if revealed could result in somebody’s death. The source that gave you that information would be, could be, at risk. 
You are asking me should the government have no hold back on the intelligence it gives to the ISC? Instinctively I would be very worried about that because there might be a piece of intelligence so sensitive that its release in anyway could endanger the source of that intelligence. In that case, the government should keep that intelligence as tightly held as possible.
The failure to engage in nation building has created a breeding ground for Isil ([Isis].
Cameron said the Libyans did not want the West to “go in heavy handed with boots on the ground” to help them construct a government. He told Tyrie:
We were involved in nation building. We were there to help the Libyan people. We tried to do it in a way that was more remote than what had happened in Iraq. On this occasion, clearly it didn’t work.
They are not all the sort of people you would bump into at a Liberal Democrat party conference.
I totally disagree with anyone who says that on the one hand Britain has helped to pioneer this climate change agreement and on the other hand is somehow backsliding on its green commitments. It’s total and utter nonsense ...
Whether you look at solar or offshore wind - where we have the biggest offshore wind market anywhere in the world - whether you look at the Green Investment Bank, which is the first in the world, whether you look at the fact that we are reinvesting in our nuclear programme, whether you look at the fact that we are the first developed country to say that we are going to phase out coal-fired power stations, on any reasonable assessment, you would say that Britain is more than fulfilling its green commitments.
That’s all from me for today.
Thanks for the comments.
Andrew Tyrie goes next.
Q: A civil servant called Iain Mansfied wrote a prize-winning report on what Brexit might look like. But he is not allowed to give evidence to select committees about this. Will you let him do so, in a personal capacity?
Cameron says he did not know this case would come up. But civil servants are expected to support the government’s position, he says, implying the answer will be no.
And that’s it. The hearing is over. 
I will post a summary soon.
Crispin Blunt takes Cameron back to foreign affairs.
Q: Islamic State (Isis) need to be taken out of the part of Syria where they are in control. One soldier said, if the regional armies did not do this, we should. Isis could be rolled up in weeks, he said. Has planning for this started?
Cameron says he does not agree with that approach.
It would be counterproductive to deploy Western troops in this way, he says. 
He says the action taken in Syria has taken out 25% of their oil revenues, 10% of their revenues overall.
Cameron says he had a constituency case where farmers dredged a stream. They were being taken to court by the Environment Agency. The agency thought they were destroying the habitat for water voles. As they inspected the river, two water voles appeared - making the point that the water voles had not lost their homes.
Neil Parish, the Conservative chair of the environment committee, goes next.
Q: What is your long-term plan on flooding?
Cameron says one part is building capital schemes. Another part is getting partnership funding, so the private sector contributes to the cost of flood defences. 
He also wants all government departments to address flooding issues.
For example, after the Somerset floods, the government asked the Dutch for advice.
People says don’t build on a flood plain. But London is a flood plain, and we need to build there, he says. 
Q: Will farmers be encouraged to take on water and manage it? Farmers need a carrot to do this.
Cameron says that makes a lot of sense.
Q: Why did you scrap the carbon capture and storage investment despite promising to put £1bn into it?
Cameron says the last two governments have poured money into these new technologies.
But at the moment the CCS technology is not working. You could spend £1bn, but the technology would not be competitive in the market. 
The government hoped the costs would come down. But they did not.
The CCS would still cost £170 per megawatt hour. That compares with nuclear energy costing £90, or onshore wind costing £70.
Q: But you are cutting subsidies for onshore wind too.
Cameron says the cost of energy from onshore wind is coming down.
Angus MacNeil, the SNP chair of the energy committee, goes next.
Q: There are claims that RAF airstrikes have resulted in the death of about 80 civilians in Iraq. Are these claims being investiagated?
Cameron says, at the time of the Syria debate, the government’s information was that there had not been any civilian deaths as a result of RAF attacks in Iraq.
Q: Independent monitoring groups think there have been between 72 and 81 deaths.
Cameron says if that is what is being claimed, the government can investigate.
Cameron says the governnment needs to do more. We have seen three “one in 100 year” events since 2007.
We need to get better at everything, he says.
But this time the military got involved more quickly, and money was dispersed more rapidly.
In the past the Environment Agency used to balance protecting homes against protecting the environment. That has changed. Now they have been told to prioritise protecting homes.
Q: You have faced criticism for not pursuing a green agenda in the UK, even though you pushed it in the Paris talks.
Cameron says he totally disagrees.
Let’s take solar, he says.
Q: What about international investment in renewables. On the Ernst &amp; Young analysis, we have tumbled down the ratings.
Cameron says he does not accept that.
98% of solar panels installed in the UK have been installed since he became prime minister.
We are the first developed country to say we will phase out coal-fired power stations.
He says greenhouse gases fell by 8% last year.
Q: There was good British and EU leadership on this. Has this made you rethink your views on an in/out EU referendum?
Cameron says this shows what can be achieved when Britain works with its European partners.
They are now switching to climate change, and Huw Irranca-Davies, the Labour chair of the environmental audit committee, goes next.
Q: What was your verdict on the Paris talks?
Cameron says he thought the outcome was pretty good. At one point it had looked as if 2 degrees would be lost as a target, that there would be no review mechanism, and that the call for progressively increasing ambitions would be taken out.
He says he always knew there would be some deal. But it turned out to be better than it might have been. He praises the role played by Amber Rudd, the energy secretary.
Clive Betts, the Labour chair of the communities committee, goes next.
Q: How are the extra costs on services generated by taking in Syrian refugees going to be paid for?
Cameron says we have a well-funded health service and well-funded education system. It was considerations like this that made him decide taking in 20,000 Syrians would be right.
He says he wanted local authorities to come forward and offer to take refugees, and they did.
Q: In the case of Siddhartha Dhar, he was asked to give up his passport. But it was 36 days before the police followed that up. Mark Rowley, the Met head of counter-terrorism, told my committee this afternoon that bail powers were toothless. He said that there should be immediate handover of passports, and that breach of bail should be a criminal offence.
Cameron says he is happy to look at this. He knew Rowley was going to make these points.
Cameron says for years it was impossible to get information about passengers travelling in the EU. He says Vaz’s committee has done good work on this.
The hearing has resumed. Keith Vaz is asking questions again.
David Cameron says he thinks EU border controls are getting better. But there is a desire to do more. Within the last month there has been a breakthrough on passenger records, he says.
There is a vote in the Commons now, so the sitting has been suspended for 15 minutes.
Cameron says he will be back. Although, judging by his exchange with Andrew Tyrie (see 4.46pm), it wouldn’t be surprising if he decides he has had enough.
(My transcript write-up probably does not do justice to quite how tetchy and bad-tempered this got. Cameron and Tyrie were repeatedly talking over each other, and at some points Cameron’s usual bonhomie vanished. There were moments when it seemed he was losing his temper.)
Keith Vaz, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, goes next.
Q: Congratulations for reaching the target of taking 1,000 Syrian refugees by Christmas. Why did the numbers go up so quickly just before Christmas?
Cameron says he would like to say it was having an activist prime minister. The government has kept the pressure up on this, he says.
Q: Will you look again at taking up offers from individuals and churches offering to take refugees?
Cameron says he is happy to look at this. But it was right to focus on what local authorities could do first.
Q: Will all relevant information held by ministers be released to the ISC?
Cameron says he will look at this, but his instinctive answer would be no.
Q: We have a committee (the ISC) there to do this job. They are full of intelligent people.
Cameron says you have to be “incredibly careful” with “highly sensitive information”. People’s lives could be at risk, he says. There may be occasions when it is not safe to release information because a source may be at risk.
Cameron says it is his job to be sceptical of requests like this. He could say yes, but he might find he was not able to keep the country safe."

The prime minister also told the liaison committee, made up of MPs who chair select committees, that the government needs to do “more of everything” to deal with the flooding that has repeatedly hit the UK in recent years.
Cameron, who pledged in 2010 to lead the “greenest government ever”, has faced concerted criticism over a series of reversals to green policies, including cuts to renewable energy subsidies and energy efficiency programmes. In November, the government cancelled its £1bn competition for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, despite the project being in the Conservative party’s election manifesto.
Cameron said that spending on low-carbon energy was set to double to £11bn in this parliament and that there had been an “absolute revolution in renewable energy” during his premiership, with 98% of solar energy installed since 2010. Subsidies for solar power will be slashed this week, but Cameron said: “You do have to think as prime minister that every penny you put in is a penny on energy bills.”
The SNP’s Angus MacNeil, chair of the energy and climate committee, challenged this, saying onshore wind was the cheapest clean energy, but was being drastically restricted by the government. 
Cameron told the liaison committee in December 2014 that CCS, which traps CO2 from coal and gas power plants and buries it, was “absolutely crucial if we are going to decarbonise effectively”. But he defended the scrapping of the £1bn policy, which was designed to help develop commercial-scale CCS, saying, “The economics are not working at the moment.” This was contradicted by US energy secretary Ernest Moniz, on 7 January, who tweeted: “Carbon capture is critical for solving climate change. And it’s working.”
The prime minister highlighted the UK’s pioneering Climate Change Act and the carbon budgets it sets for the nation, and said: “We are more than meeting the targets.” However, a leaked letter in November revealed that the UK was not on track to meet an EU target for green energy in 2020. Furthermore, experts have argued, the government’s renewed dash for gas, including fracking, without CCS will make meeting future carbon targets extremely difficult.
Tidal power has been promoted by chancellor George Osborne, who signalled support for a project in Swansea Bay. But Cameron poured cold water on the technology, saying that the current proposals were too expensive: “We have not seen any proposals coming forward that would would beat the [subsidy] strike price.”
Friends of the Earth chief executive Craig Bennett said: “If dismantling a dozen green policies and putting 19,000 solar workers on notice isn’t ‘backsliding on green commitments’, I don’t know what is.”
Cameron was challenged on flooding by Huw Irranca-Davies, chair of the environment audit committee, who quoted one expert stating that the UK’s “current approach to flooding was not only inadequate, but has no likelihood of ever being adequate”. Cameron cut flood defence spending in 2010, only raising it after floods hit later, and has been repeatedly warned of the UK’s rising risk of floods.
“On flooding, there is no doubt we need to do more,” Cameron said. “We’ve seen what are called one-in-100-year events, or one-in-200-year events, and they happened in 2007, 2013, 2015, and the country wants us to do more, and we will do more.”
The controversial issue of river dredging was raised by Neil Parish, chair of the environment, food and rural affairs committee, who praised Cameron for restarting dredging on the Somerset Levels. 
The government is going to allow farmers to dredge ditches without securing permission from the Environment Agency, but experts have warned of the risk of faster-flowing rivers rising more quickly and increasing the risk of flood to towns and villages downstream.
Mark Lloyd, chief executive of the Angling Trust, said recently: “It is scandalous that the government has hidden from public view the advice of its own experts on the dangers of unregulated dredging and ignored the findings of the study into the pilot dredging projects. The evidence shows that the best way to reduce the risk of flooding is to manage land upstream to reduce the flow of water and soil off fields.”
Cameron said a suggestion from Parish that farmers were given more incentive to store water on their land during periods of high rainfall made “very good sense”.
The prime minister recounted an anecdote from the village of Kelmscott in his constituency when he visited a site where farmers were being sued by the EA for dredging without permission. Cameron said the EA was worried that some of the habitat of the water vole might have been destroyed. “At that moment, two water voles appeared on the river bank, almost in conversation, and in my mind, at that moment, the argument was settled,” he said."

In his final State of the Union address, the US president said he would push for changes to the leasing of public lands for oil, coal and gas leases at cut-rate prices, saying: “Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future.”
The move follows a listening tour last year by Sally Jewell, the interior secretary, during which she explored leasing programmes on public lands and the collapse of the coal mining industry due to low prices.
Environmental groups had planned major campaigns around the government’s leasing programme for 2016, arguing that continued fossil fuel extraction on public lands was undermining Obama’s efforts to fight climate change.
After insisting in his first term on an “all of the above” energy policy that promoted expansion of oil, gas and coal, Obama now appears to agree with scientists who say catastrophic climate change cannot be avoided without strict limits on fossil fuel extraction.
“I’m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet,” he said in the speech.
The overhaul comes amid collapsing global prices for coal – which have had a big impact on the government’s lease programme. The government had to put off lease sales involving some 2bn tonnes of coal over the last year because companies were unwilling to buy.
The White House said in an email it would provide further details in the coming weeks, adding: “The President underscored the need to accelerate our transition to low-carbon economy by changing how we manage our oil and coal resources.”
Campaign groups have long accused Obama of having a blind spot when it came to the mining of fossil fuels on public lands.
A report by the Center for American Progress found that oil, coal and gas produced on public lands were responsible for more than 20% of all greenhouse gas emissions.
Half of those emissions were from coal – which increasingly is mined in the vast deposits of the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming.
Up until last year, Jewell, the interior secretary, had acknowledged that there was no concrete strategy to address the climate impact of mining for fossil fuel on public lands, saying: “It’s something we need to think about.”
Campaign groups said the move was an encouraging first step – but argued that Obama should really ban all fossil fuel production on public lands to have maximum impact on climate change.
“The issue of fossil fuel extraction on public lands is going to be a key fight over the coming months. Our government needs to get out of the business of climate destruction,” May Boeve, the director of 350.org said.
As expected, Obama did not come with a list of promises for his last year in office – and did not even mention important initiatives that are already in the works, such as new rules for plugging methane leaks from oil and gas wells.
The White House has been sitting on the rules for six months.
But it was significant that, as during other high-visibility moments during the second half of his presidency, Obama took care to thread mention of climate change throughout the State of the Union address.
Once again, he mocked Republicans who continue to reject the science behind climate change, saying: “You’ll be pretty lonely, because you’ll be debating our military, most of America’s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it’s a problem and intend to solve it.”
Obama also embraced climate change as an issue of national security and global concern – saying it was “one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world”."

Led by the Woodland Trust, 48 conservation and cultural groups have launched a campaign for a new charter in 2017, the 800-year anniversary of the signing of the original Charter of the Forest by Henry III. This protected and restored the right of people to access and use the royal forests - crucial at the time for grazing livestock, collecting firewood and foraging for food.
The coalition says it is time for a new charter, as woods come under “unprecedented threat” from development, pests and disease and climate change and trees risk being “neglected, undervalued and forgotten”. 
Community groups, clubs, councils and committees are being encouraged to feed into the building of the charter. To kickstart the campaign, people across the UK are being urged to share their “tree stories” of treasured or significant moments that would not have been possible without trees.
A new, broader charter would recognise the importance of trees in 21st-century British society, celebrate their enormous contribution to public life, and ensure future generations could benefit from them by ensuring access to nature and protection of ancient woodland and other habitats, its backers argue.
It would also cover forestry, the value of trees and woods in terms of finance and other benefits to people, the importance of new planting and making sure landscapes are resilient to the threats they face, they say. 
Beccy Speight, chief executive of the Woodland Trust, said: “Our collective ambition is for a charter that puts trees back at the heart of our lives, communities and decision-making - where they belong. The charter will provide guidance and inspiration to allow us all to appreciate, preserve and celebrate our trees and woods for what they do for us in so many different ways. 
“Inspired by something that happened 800 years ago, there is no better time than now to shine the spotlight again on the benefits that trees and woods bring to us all today and to future generations.”
Research for the Woodland Trust by Europe Economics in March last year found the total value of woodland to the UK’s economy is around £270bn. Living near of having access to trees also provides invaluable health and wellbeing benefits, research shows. 
But the trust warns that valuable habitats are under threat, the area of new woodland created each year continues to fall and far too few trees are being planted to connect up the landscape. The impact of tree disease such as ash dieback and oak processionary moth will impact this further. 
Reductions in the number of people enrolling in forestry, land management and environmental courses compounds the problem as it means there are not enough skilled and informed people in the sector, the trust warns."

A charge of $30 a tonne on carbon dioxide embedded in international transport fuels could have raised $25 billion in 2014, the influential Washington DC-based body estimates.
In a report released after 195 countries struck a UN climate pact in Paris, it said carbon pricing should be “front and centre” in efforts to curb global warming.
Levies on so-called bunker fuels were “promising”, it said, and a possible source of climate finance – support for developing countries to go green and adapt to shifting weather patterns.
Emissions from planes and ships, around 4% of the global total and rising, were not directly addressed in the Paris agreement.
It is up to the UN-backed authorities, the International Civil Aviation Organization and International Maritime Organization respectively, to regulate the international sectors.
The IMF noted there were “challenges” to imposing a levy, including the need for international coordination and legal issues, “but the practicalities should be manageable”."

But now, protestors can explain themselves | Tim DeChristopher";"In a historic ruling, several environmental campaigners will be able to argue at criminal trial that their political motives are a defense to their illegal acts";"In the face of governmental failure in addressing climate change, the climate movement has seen a dramatic increase of civil disobedience. The threat of jail is real to activists who use these tactics – as I learned first hand. But now activists now have a powerful form of defense: necessity. 
For the very first time, US climate activists have been able to argue the necessity defense – which argues that so-called criminal acts were committed out of necessity – to a jury. The Delta 5, who blockaded an oil train at the Delta rail yard near Seattle in September of 2014, have been been allowed to use the defense in a historic climate change civil disobedience trial being heard this week. They said they acted to prevent the greater harm of climate change and oil train explosions.
Like all civil disobedience, this new wave of climate disobedience is an inherent critique of the moral authority of government. The necessity defense is an opportunity to elaborate that implicit critique into a fully developed legal argument for the responsibility of citizen action in the face of governmental failure. 
 In addition to gaining the permission to openly argue the necessity defense, the Delta 5 defendants have so far been winning the crucial legal maneuvers in the courtroom. The trial started with several motions from the prosecution to limit how the defense could present “sympathetic” evidence or anything related to their backgrounds. These motions were denied. 
The judge has shown himself to be committed to a fully open trial of all the factors that would drive people to risk their bodies to stop fossil fuel expansion. This kind of openness is distressingly rare for civil disobedience cases in American courts. Why this particular judge, Anthony Howard, is breaking ranks in this climate trial is unknown, but I suspect it may have something to do with the fact that he is young enough that he will still be alive in 2050.
 This willingness to weigh deep questions of justice in the courtroom is already paying off with a thought-provoking trial. The jury selection developed into an insightful conversation about civic engagement, protest and how to express one’s disagreement with the government. 
This work of arousing consciences is an essential feature of good civil disobedience. Just by participating in the selection process, 60 potential jurors were pushed into a thoughtful discussion about the role of protest and challenging unjust power. 
 One of the critical dynamics that emerged in the jurors’ discussion on the first day was the difference between protest that uses force to intimidate compared to protest that uses one’s own vulnerability to awaken a community. The Delta 5 clearly fall into the latter category, but the prosecution used references to the Ku Klux Klan and abortion clinic bombers to suggest that the activists were relying on intimidation. This crucial dynamic will probably continue to be developed as the trial progresses. 
 But even as the state tries to paint the defendants as nefarious, the activists are establishing their moral advantage. The prosecution can tell by the media attention and standing-room-only crowd that these activists have power, but like most government officials, this prosecutor seems to only understand coercive power. 
As he tries to put them in a box into which they don’t fit, the principled position of the activists demonstrates the potential of power rooted in love rather than force. The activists bring a vision of justice that shames the mere legalism of the state.
 Around the globe climate movements are trying to build power. Some of those are trying to build power based on an old model from a dying empire. Here, in the trial of the Delta 5, the climate movement is building a new kind of power, grounded in interdependency and wielded through vulnerability. Our rapidly evolving and unstable world demands no less. "

Showing that human activity, via climate change, can alter global processes like ice ages is compelling evidence that the planet has entered a new geological epoch, dubbed the Anthropocene, according to the scientists.
Other recent research listed evidence from plastic pollution to the mass extinction of wildlife to show that the Earth has entered the Anthropocene.
The new research also shows that a major ice age was narrowly missed just before the industrial revolution, probably because the development of agriculture had nudged the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere just above the tipping point.
“The bottom line is we are basically skipping a whole glacial cycle, which is unprecedented,” said Andrey Ganopolski, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany and who led the research. “It is mind-boggling that humankind is able to interfere with a mechanism that shaped the world as we know it.” 
The cycle of ice ages created today’s landscapes and much of the world’s fertile soils.
The new research, published in the journal Nature, examined the eight global ice ages over the past 800,000 years and used complex climate models to determine the critical factors that kickstarted the big freezes. 
The result was surprisingly simple. A particular combination of lower sunlight at a latitude of 65 deg N, where snow surviving through the summer leads to ice sheets, and low carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was the signal for a new ice age to dawn. The level of sunlight is very predictable as it varies with cyclical changes in the shape of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun and in the tilt of the Earth’s axis, called Milankovitch cycles.
But the level of CO2 has been drastically altered by human activity, rising from 280ppm at the start of the industrial revolution to 400ppm today. The researchers showed that even if carbon emissions are limited to the amount consistent with a 2C rise in temperatures - the internationally agreed goal - there will be enough CO2 in the atmosphere to avoid future ice ages that could have started 50,000 or 90,000 years from now. 
“This is in principle good news, as ice ages are a great challenge,” said Prof John Schellnhuber, PIK director and part of the research team. Sea levels rise and fall by more than 100 metres during global ice ages, and runaway global warming could add another 70m to that. 
“Like no other force on the planet, ice ages have shaped the global environment and thereby determined the development of human civilisation,” Schellnhuber said. “Now human interference is acting as a huge geological force, so this is a defining paper for the Anthropocene idea.” If carbon emissions are not restricted, he said, they could end the million-year-long period of ice age cycles altogether.
Michel Crucifix, at the Université catholique de Louvain in Belgium and not involved in the new research, said: “It reinforces previous assessments asserting that humanity’s collective footprint on Earth already extends beyond any imaginable future of our society.”
“Such long-term consequences may seem surprising, given that the emissions will occur over a few centuries at most,” he said. “In fact, the mean half-life of CO2 in the atmosphere is of the order of 35,000 years. Consequently, anthropogenic CO2 will still be in the atmosphere in 50,000 years’ time, and even 100,000 years, which is enough to prevent any glaciation.”
“The significance of the study is the definition of a tipping point for glaciation,” said Prof Tim Lenton, at the University of Exeter, UK, who was also not involved in the new study. “This elaborates the classical Milankovitch theory by adding the CO2 component.”
“It is convincing in showing the start of the next ice age will be delayed,” said Lenton. “But I was already expecting this result based on previous studies. What is interesting is how little anthropogenic CO2 is needed to prevent the next [ice age] – 500 gigatonnes of carbon – and we have already emitted that.”
Prof Eric Wolff, at the University of Cambridge, said the research goes much further than earlier work in quantifying the tipping point. “It conforms to what many of us would expect, but it’s always a big step forward when someone shows that one’s intuition is actually backed by solid calculations,” he said. 
“Humans now effectively control the climate of the planet,” said Prof Andrew Watson, at the University of Exeter. “If only we were wise enough to be able to use that power responsibly. Unfortunately, I don’t think we’ve reached that level of wisdom yet.”"

Time for a chief scientific adviser";"Boris Johnson appears to favour the views of friends and associates on issues such as pollution and climate change. The next mayor needs specialist advice";"One of the priorities for the next mayor of London should be to appoint a chief scientific adviser. The current mayor has a range of advisers, but has clearly lacked expert guidance on the scientific aspects of key issues such as local air pollution and climate change. The time has come to seek specialist advice to help deal with the wide variety of risks and opportunities facing those living and working in the capital.
Boris Johnson has, for instance, struggled to come to terms with the findings of researchers at King’s College London, who have estimated that more than 9,000 people die in London each year from dust and nitrogen dioxide in the air. 
 In 2014, Mr Johnson used Twitter to denounce as “B*ll*cks: ludicrous urban myth” a conference presentation by a scientist at King’s College who suggested that average annual levels of nitrogen dioxide measured in Oxford Street may be the highest in the world.
The mayor was later forced to defend his comments in a letter to a Parliamentary committee, admitting that he was “not disputing King’s College data”, but did not accept the scientists’ warnings. It is true that Johnson does have an environment adviser, Matthew Pencharz, but he is a former journalist, not a technical expert.
Throughout his terms as mayor, Mr Johnson has also demonstrated that he is in thrall to friends and associates who reject the evidence that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from human activities are driving climate change.
As part of the celebrations for the Olympics in 2012, Mr Johnson invited Matt Ridley, the former chairman of Northern Rock bank, rather than an expert, to deliver a lecture on the environment. Ridley dismissed the risks to lives and livelihoods from climate change that have been highlighted by scientists.
And in one of his columns for the Daily Telegraph last month, Johnson claimed that the mild weather in December had nothing to do with global warming, based, it seems, on a phone conversation with a friend, Piers Corbyn, a climate change sceptic who runs a tiny weather forecasting company. Johnson has written about global warming in his Telegraph column four times over the past few years, and on each occasion has referred solely to Piers Corbyn’s views as his source of authority.
In fact, Met Office data show unarguably that London, along with the rest of the UK and world, is warming. Seven of the ten warmest years in south-east England since records began in 1910 have occurred since 2000, and only one winter, in 1985, from the last 30 years ranks among the ten coldest on record. And the capital is facing higher risks of extreme weather events, including heatwaves and heavy downpours.
Although the mayor does not have complete control over all of the laws and policies for managing the risks to Londoners posed by local air pollution and climate change, it is troubling that he apparently ignores inputs about these issues from scientists, including world-class researchers based in the capital.
And while Mr Johnson energetically promotes the abundance of talent in London and its importance as an economic and cultural centre, he rarely mentions the city’s outstanding array of scientific minds and its unique place in the history of science.
The mayor is not alone in neglecting our capital city’s hugely important scientific heritage. It is difficult, for instance, to find statues or other commemorations of the achievements of Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin or any of the other scientific giants who have connections with the city.
Nevertheless, London now hosts some of the world’s most scientifically accomplished universities, including Imperial College and University College, as well as internationally renowned research centres, such as the new Francis Crick Institute.
It seems logical to propose that whoever is elected in May should appoint a chief scientific adviser to devise a strategy for London to retain its leadership as a global centre for science, at a time when many other cities around the world are already aiming to overtake it.
Most importantly, the holder of such a role should help ensure that decisions across a range of key economic, social and cultural issues affecting London are informed by the best knowledge and understanding, including from the city’s own wealth of bright minds.
Of course, an adviser could not guarantee that the new mayor would always take full account of the evidence, but it would undoubtedly be more difficult to ignore.
It’s why the national government and each of its departments have chief scientific advisers. It is surely an anomaly that the mayor of London, who is responsible for a wide range of issues affecting lives and livelihoods in the capital and who oversees an annual budget exceeding that of every national department apart from health, education and defence, does not directly receive expert, independent advice on scientific issues.
Whoever emerges victorious in May must show that the role of London’s mayor is important enough to require expert scientific advice.
Bob Ward is policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and sits on the London Climate Change Partnership."

Local MSPs praised the “huge community spirit” as residents of a sheltered housing complex in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, were evacuated to the village scout hut on Monday afternoon, while the local Asda supermarket supplied food to the makeshift emergency centre.
With a relentless downpour throughout the day adding to already swollen rivers, many threatened to burst their banks again, with the Met Office amber “be prepared” warnings for heavy rain in the Grampian, Central, Tayside and Fife areas extended to midnight on Monday.
Earlier in the day, police named the kayaker who died after getting into difficulties on the river Findhorn, near Inverness, last Wednesday, when Storm Frank first hit, as 54-year-old Laurence Henderson from Aberdeenshire.
The dead man is believed to have been with a group of experienced kayakers who raised the alarm after he fell into the river and his clothing became snagged on branches. A coastguard search had to be called off as weather conditions worsened and Henderson’s body was recovered from the river at 9am the following day.
Rail bosses confirmed on Monday that the west coast mainline between Carlisle and Glasgow would be closed until at least February while repairs to the Lamington viaduct, near Lockerbie, were carried out. Alternative routes will involve a replacement bus or diverted train via Dumfries.
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) had 35 flood warnings still in place on Monday evening, covering Tayside, Angus, Dundee, Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire. It has also issued four flood alerts, including one for the Scottish Borders.
Police warned that riverside homes in Aberdeen would be at risk on Monday night, when the Dee reaches high tide at about 9pm. West of the city, in the village of Ballater, which suffered some of the worst devastation last week, council workers and volunteers have built a huge sandbag barrier. Braemar, still further west into the Cairngorms, is partially cut off while the council liaises with the army to repair the badly damaged Invercauld Bridge.
Abergeldie castle, near Ballater and close to the Queen’s residence at Balmoral, has been left on the brink of collapse after intense flooding. The owner was forced to evacuate the 16th-century Grade A-listed tower house in Aberdeenshire on Sunday after the river Dee swept away about 60ft (18 metres) of land behind the property, leaving it only a few feet from the water.
As police urged drivers to follow warnings, a 47-year-old woman was charged with careless driving after emergency services were called to free her from her half-submerged vehicle when she allegedly attempted to drive through 4ft deep flood water in Stobo, near Peebles.
While the rain across Scotland is expected to ease through Tuesday, the Met Office forecast another weather front bringing rain from Thursday.
Meanwhile, David Cameron, ministers and the Environment Agency face questioning by MPs and communities in the coming days over their response to flooding across northern England during one of the wettest Decembers on record.
Campaigners said the political fallout of the floods would play out this week and next, as the Met Office warned of possible further flooding with more rainfall likely in many areas in the next 48 hours.
Next Tuesday, the prime minister is due to be questioned on Syria and climate change by the liaison committee, with flooding likely to be on the agenda along with the recent Paris climate agreement. Officials rank flooding as the UK’s number one threat from climate change and Cameron has been accused of ignoring flood warnings from his climate advisers.
The Environment Agency’s chief executive, James Bevan, and its chairman, Philip Dilley, will be questioned by the same committee this Wednesday. Dilley is likely to be asked about criticism that he was holidaying in Barbados while some of the worst flooding was occurring and the agency’s initial refusal to comment on his whereabouts.
A spokeswoman for Kerry McCarthy, the shadow environment secretary, said the government’s response so far had not been commensurate with the scale of the threat from climate change and flooding. She said: “It appears to be very piecemeal and reactive, rather than looking at the problem as a whole.”
Oliver Letwin is chairing a new flood resilience review, which is due to report in the summer, although the MP came under fire over the weekend for sitting on a previous report following the extraordinary floods of early 2014.
“This week will be a crucial test of whether Westminster really understands the flooding that’s devastated the country,” said Guy Shrubsole, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth.
“The prime minister has serious questions to answer about previous warnings that climate change will push up flood risk. He must realise that cuts to flood defence spending are a false economy.”
The Environment Agency has 30 flood warnings in place and 168 flood alerts across large swaths of England and Wales. The Met Office issued yellow “be aware” warnings on Monday for south-west and south-east England and warned people to be alert to the risk of surface flooding in those areas.
A spokesman said that on the western sides of Dartmoor and Exmoor, and possibly Bodmin moor, rainfall could be up to 40mm compared with an average of about 20mm across the south-west. He said the main problem in the south-west was that the ground was already saturated after prolonged rainfall, making the risk of surface flooding more likely.
On Thursday, campaigners at the National Flood Forum will meet with Rory Stewart, under secretary of state for environment and rural affairs, to discuss insurance along with other issues facing flood-hit communities."

 While the climate phenomenon known as El Niño reduced the development of hurricanes in the north Atlantic, storms and floods still caused billions of dollars worth of damage in Europe and North America, the world’s largest reinsurer said in an annual review.
 Munich Re said floods in the UK and Scandinavia caused by Storm Desmond last month may cause about €700m (£515m) in claims. It added that flooding from Storm Eva may cause overall damage of more than €1bn. Climate change may have played a role in the floods, according to the insurer.
 Two tornadoes and flooding also hit the US last month but Munich Re said damage estimates were not yet available.
 The insurance industry lobbied governments to take action to curb climate change in the run-up to the UN climate summit in Paris last year. It cited rising payouts in heavily insured rich country markets and a lack of affordable insurance in developing countries, where it is most needed.
 “The proportion of insured losses for catastrophes in developing and emerging countries remains very low,” said Torsten Jeworrek, a Munich Re board member.
 “The insurance industry is exploring new avenues to close this gap in cover and thus to help people better cope with material losses after a catastrophe,” Jeworrek added.
 
 Insurers and reinsurers may get a push from an  international effort unveiled by the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, to develop company disclosures so that investors can assess companies’ physical, liability and other risks from climate change.
 
The $27bn in insured damage last year was lower than the $31bn registered in 2014 and also below the 10-year average of $56bn, Munich Re said.
 Overall damage, including that not covered by insurance, was $90bn last year, the lowest level since 2009.
 In total, 23,000 people were killed in 2015, including many in the Nepal earthquake in April, compared with 7,700 the previous year, but was well below the 10-year average of 68,000.
 Lower claims payouts boost insurance industry profit but the downside for reinsurers is that their insurance company clients often then demand lower prices for reinsurers’ backing.
 
 Munich Re is due to report its own results on 4 February. "

Last month saw widespread flooding which continued into the new year, with 21 flood alerts in England and Wales and four in Scotland in force on Tuesday morning. 
The record for the warmest December in the UK was also smashed last month, with an average temperature of 7.9C, 4.1C higher than the long-term average.

Climate change has fundamentally changed the UK weather, said Prof Myles Allen, at the University of Oxford: “Normal weather, unchanged over generations, is a thing of the past. You are not meant to beat records by those margins and if you do so, just like in athletics, it is a sign something has changed.”
The Met Office records stretch back to 1910 and, while December saw a record downpour particularly affecting the north of England, Scotland and Wales, 2015 overall was only the sixth wettest year on record.
The high temperatures in December would normally be expected in April or May and there was an almost complete lack of air frost across much of England. The average from 1981-2010 was for 11 days of air frost in December, but last month there were just three days. Across 2015, the average UK temperature was lower than in 2014, though globally 2015 was the hottest year on record.
Allen said it has been predicted as far back as 1990 that global warming would mean warmer, wetter winters for the UK, with more intense rainstorms. The flooding caused by Storm Desmond, centred on Cumbria, is estimated to have been made 40% more likely by climate change.
“If an athlete starts popping pills, it does not guarantee they win every race, but it does change their chances,” he told the BBC. “The physics [of climate change] is relatively simple: as we warm the atmosphere, the weather systems that move in from the Atlantic contain more moisture, so they dump more rain.”
“We have known for a very long time that these signs were likely to be one of the earliest symptoms of climate change and now we are seeing them, it’s not very surprising,” Allen said.
“Temperature and rainfall records will inevitably tumble as climate change intensifies,” said Prof David Reay, at the University of Edinburgh. “It is the increasingly extreme rainfall events, storm surges, heatwaves and droughts that will truly test our resilience to climate change. On the evidence of the past month we are far from prepared.”
The government’s own scientists warned that increased flooding was the greatest risk for the UK from climate change, but annual flood defence budgets were cut in 2011-12 and only recovered to previous levels with emergency funding in 2014-15.
Clare Dinnis, flood risk manager at the Environment Agency, said: “Our work continues into the new year as we offer ongoing support to communities that have been affected by these terrible floods. With more wet weather due this week we are monitoring the situation across the country closely.”
On Tuesday morning there were 21 flood alerts - meaning flooding is expected - across England and Wales, including eight in north-east England. There were also 138 flood warnings, meaning flooding is possible. In Scotland, there were four flood alerts and 32 flood warnings."

The broken well at the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage site has released more than 77,000 metric tons of the powerful climate pollutant methane since the rupture was first detected on 23 October, according to a counter created by the Environmental Defense Fund. 
Methane is a fast-acting climate pollutant – more than 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame.
Experts believe the breach, which has forced the evacuation of hundreds of residents from the town of Porter Ranch, is the largest ever in the US.
Locals have complained of headaches, sore throats, nosebleeds and nausea, caused by the rotten-egg smell of the odorant added to the gas to aid leak detection by SoCalGas, the utility that operates the natural gas storage site.
About 1,000 people are suing the company. There are also concerns about the leak’s effect on smog and ozone. The company said it was monitoring air quality.
The leak is unlikely to be brought under control before late February – and even that timetable depends on work crews’ success in locating and plugging a 7-inch pipe deep underground.
Campaign groups said the release undercuts Barack Obama’s efforts to slow the rate of global warming to avoid a tipping point and live up to US commitments to a historic climate accord agreed in Paris last month. 
Obama is expected to tout his climate agenda during his State of the Union address on 12 January – one of his last big moments remaining to promote a key presidential priority.
Carbon dioxide is still the biggest driver of climate change. But because methane emissions are on the rise and exercise such a powerful effect in the short-term, they are a growing source of concern as governments try to avoid a climate tipping point.
A byproduct of the oil and gas industry and agriculture, methane accounts for about a quarter of the world’s warming.
The release of methane from the ruptured well has now slowed considerably since its peak in late November, according to Carb.
Back then, the climate impact was equivalent to the daily emissions from 7 million cars – or the equivalent of six coal-fired power plants, or three-quarters of the emissions from the state’s entire oil refining industry, according to EDF.
 But David Clegern, a spokesman for the agency, said the well remained a major source of climate pollution. “It is in California at this point the single largest source point of global warming,” Clegern said.
He also said it was to his knowledge the biggest such natural gas leak ever. “We haven’t been able to see anything anywhere near this size.”
The Aliso Canyon well failure was widely seen as the climate equivalent of the BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. The April 2010 blow-out of BP’s well killed 11 and caused vast damage to fisheries and the environment in the three months it took to get under control.
The Aliso Canyon leak is much less visible than BP’s oil disaster, but Mark Brownstein, who heads the climate and energy program at EDF, said it is a serious threat.
“For the planet it is a big deal because methane is a such a powerful greenhouse gas, and the huge amount of gas that is escaping,” he said. 
The rupture at the Aliso Canyon facility has refocused attention on America’s ageing and accident-prone oil and gas infrastructure. Many such leaks go undetected.
The Environmental Protection Agency is due to issue much-anticipated rules to control methane emissions from the oil and gas industry later this year. Gina McCarthy, who heads the EPA, said on Monday that the rules could avoid up to 400,000 metric tons of methane by 2025.
The Aliso Canyon storage site is one of the biggest such facilities in the country, and was originally built for the oil industry about 60 years ago. When the oil fields were exhausted, the well was repurposed as a storage site. 
R Rex Parris, who is suing the gas company on behalf of Porter Ranch residents, said the site should have been shut down long ago.
He faulted the company for removing a blow-out preventer at the bottom of the well in 1979. “They deliberately took the brakes off the car and continued to drive it. That’s the best metaphor I can come up with, he said. “They are saying it’s an accident that they ran into somebody. I’m saying: ‘no, it was inevitable’.”
A company spokeswoman said the well was in compliance with state regulations."

The shadow transport minister, Richard Burden, pledged to table parliamentary questions about the affair, saying that government backing for the project had been derisory. 
The Green Sky project was due to open in 2017 at an ex-oil refinery in Thurrock, Essex, where it would have turned into gas 575,000 tonnes of household waste otherwise destined for landfill sites or incinerators.
Enough green fuel would have been produced to power all BA’s yearly flights from London City airport twice over, with carbon savings equivalent to taking 150,000 cars off the road.
But BA told the Guardian that the project had now been mothballed because of low crude oil prices, jitters among investors, and a lack of policy engagement from 10 Downing Street.
 “The government needs to support innovative aviation biofuels projects such as this if they are to progress,” said Cathy West, a BA spokeswoman. “Aviation fuels are not eligible for incentives that road transport fuels receive, making it difficult to build a business case to invest in UK aviation fuels projects. This affects investor confidence.”
“British Airways’ decision to scrap their green fuels project is immensely disappointing,” Burden said. “The government has questions to answer on why it is not looking to support the industry’s innovative attempts to recycle waste to use as fuel.
 “At a time when the government has delayed a decision on Heathrow and Gatwick partly for environmental reasons, it is ludicrous that the government is not backing the industry’s attempts to deliver cleaner fuels.”
 BA wants jet biofuels brought under the government’s Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation, a move it believes could help trigger the building of a dozen green fuel plants by 2030.
 Without such guarantees, airlines may feel obliged to sign alternative fuel deals at market rates that become less attractive when oil prices suddenly drop.
“The UK is currently losing out to countries that have prioritised and incentivised developments in the sustainable aviation fuels market,” West said.
Some 150 workers were expected to staff the Solena Fuels plant, which BA had committed to pay £35m each year for a decade, in a bid to lower its carbon footprint.
But Solena, a US company, filed for bankruptcy three months ago and BA has now switched its attention to other waste-to-fuels firms where joint projects are thought to be at the due diligence stage.
Chris Malins, the fuels programme manager of the International Council for Clean Transportation, said that commercialising these projects was a challenging process, beset by a lack of EU policy certainty after 2020 and a “valley of death” between R&amp;D tests and market-scale production.
 “Things could have been done on the policy side here to help these plants get built which were not done,” he said. “Investments won’t go to alternative aviation fuels without policy certainty and access to the same incentives as road diesel.
“It is a shame as this project looked like a great opportunity to do something genuinely sustainable on a ground-breaking scale.”
Aviation is the fastest-growing source of carbon dioxide emissions, currently thought to be responsible for around 5% of global warming by scientists at the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
New market mechanisms to green the industry will be debated at an International Civil Aviation Organisation conference later this year. Use of second-generation biofuels to power jets is widely seen as one of the most promising technologies.
A recent study found that BA and Lufthansa were emitting 51% more carbon dioxide than the least polluting airlines. "

The recent effects of both ocean cycles are being amplified by climate change.
A 2014 flip was detected in the sluggish and elusive ocean cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, or PDO, which also goes by other names, including the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation. Despite uncertainty about the fundamental nature of the PDO, leading scientists link its 2014 phase change to a rapid rise in global surface temperatures.
The effects of the PDO on global warming can be likened to a staircase, with warming leveling off for periods, typically of more than a decade, and then bursting upward.
“It seems to me quite likely that we have taken the next step up to a new level,” said Kevin Trenberth, a scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
The 2014 flip from the cool PDO phase to the warm phase, which vaguely resembles a long and drawn out El Niño event, contributed to record-breaking surface temperatures across the planet in 2014.
The record warmth set in 2014 was surpassed again in 2015, when global temperatures surged to 1°C (1.8°F) above pre-industrial averages, worsening flooding, heatwaves and storms.
Trenberth is among an informal squadron of scientists that in recent years has toiled to understand the slowdown in surface warming rates that began in the late 1990s, which some nicknamed a global warming “pause” or “hiatus.”
A flurry of recent research papers has indicated that the slowdown was less pronounced than previously thought, leading some scientists to renew claims that those nicknames are inaccurate and should be abandoned.
“The slowdown was not statistically significant, I suppose, if you properly take into account natural variability, which includes the PDO,” Trenberth said. “That’s sort of the argument that people have been making; that even if it was a little bit of a slowdown, or pause, or call it what you will, it’s not out of bounds, and as a result we shouldn’t really put a label on it.”
The approximately 15-year warming slowdown was linked to the negative phase of the PDO, which is also called its cool phase. That phase whips up strong trade winds that bury more heat beneath sea surfaces, contributing to extraordinary levels of warming recorded in the oceans. A similar phase led to a slight cooling of the planet from the 1940s to the 1970s.
“Last time we went from a negative to a positive was in the mid-‘70s,” said Gerald Meehl, a National Center for Atmospheric Research scientist. “Then we had larger rates of global warming from the ‘70s to the late ‘90s, compared to the previous 30 years.”
“It’s not just an upward sloping line,” Meehl said. “Sometimes it’s steeper, sometimes it’s slower.”
The effects of the warm phase of the PDO and the current El Niño may be cumulative in terms of warming the planet. It also seems likely that changes in the ocean cycles are linked, with changes between El Niño and La Niña driving changes in the PDO cycle.
Or, perhaps the PDO doesn’t exist at all, other than as a tidy pile of data points, and it’s simply a manifestation of changes in the shorter-running cycle between El Niño and La Niña.
“There’s some debate about whether there is a low frequency oscillation — is there a distinct interdecadal oscillation?” said Penn State meteorology professor Michael Mann. “Or is what we call a low frequency oscillation just a change over time in the frequency and magnitude of individual El Niño and La Niña events?”
Regardless, “it seems pretty clear that we’ve transitioned from a time period where there was a prevalence for La Niña conditions,” Mann said. “Over the past several years we’ve been in the multi-year El Niño state, and it has culminated with an extremely large El Niño event.”
The future of PDO phases will not slow down or speed up the overall long-term rate of global warming. That will continue to rise with pollution levels. But scientists are expecting more intense heat during the months ahead, which should bring with it more wild weather.
“There are a lot of things in place that have locked us on course to have a really warm start to 2016,” said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientist Nate Mantua. “I have a hard time seeing how we’re not going to be looking at either record level or near-record level global mean surface temperatures for at least the first half of 2016.”"

Ten weeks after the 23 October breach was detected, Brown ordered state agencies to make sure Southern California Gas Company, which owns the stricken natural gas storage facility, plugs the leak.
“All necessary and viable actions will be taken to ensure Southern California Gas Company: maximizes daily withdrawals of natural gas from the Aliso Canyon Storage Facility for use or storage elsewhere; captures leaking gas and odorants while relief wells are being completed; and identifies how it will stop the gas leak if relief wells fail to seal the leaking well, or if the existing leak worsens,” the order said.
The breach had released “major amounts of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas” and caused widespread disruption to local people in the Porter Ranch area, the statement from Brown noted.
Experts said the break at the natural gas storage reservoir is the largest known occurrence of its kind. 
Methane is dozens of times more warming than carbon dioxide, and the storage facility, which draws on about 100 other wells, is one of the largest in the state. Campaign groups say the broken well has been pumping out the equivalent in carbon dioxide emissions of 7m cars a day.
Thousands of people, including schoolchildren, have been evacuated from Porter Ranch to escape the rotten egg smell of the chemicals added to the gas.
The declaration follows Brown’s visit to Porter Ranch earlier this week, during which he met residents who have suffered nose bleeds, headaches and nausea from the smells. Such chemicals are commonly used to aid in leak detection.
Brown directed his administration to take “all necessary and viable actions” to make sure SoCalGas captures leaking natural gas and odorants. He also asked the company to spell out how it planned to plug the well if its current effort failed.
The order bans SoCalGas from injecting more natural gas into the storage site, and it calls for independent monitoring of air quality. Brown also ordered daily inspections and regular testing of natural gas storage wells in the state for leaks.
Brown has come under intense criticism from campaign groups for his slow response to the leak. On Wednesday, some of those groups now expressed relief. 
“This is a hard-fought win for the residents of Porter Ranch and beyond affected by this noxious blowout,” Alexandra Nagy, an organiser for Food and Water Watch, said in an emailed statement. She called on Brown to shutter the storage facility for good."

The data shows the number of new cars eligible for the government Plug-in Car Grant scheme rose from 14,532 in to 28,188 last year, an increase of 94 per cent.
Zero and low emission vehicles still make up only a fraction of an overall market, with total new vehicle registrations reaching a record 2.6 million.
However, demand for alternative fuelled and low emission vehicles is outperforming the wider market across all categories. The auto market as a whole grew 6.3 per cent, but demand for pure electric vehicles rose 48 per cent to nearly 10,000 vehicles and demand for plug-in hybrids soared 133 per cent year-on-year to over 18,000 vehicles.
Since the Plug-in Car Grant scheme was launched with its promise of up to £5,000 off the cost of electric vehicles, 47,690 eligible cars have been registered.
Conventional hybrids enjoyed a similar strong performance last year with annual demand for petrol hybrids growing 18 per cent to 40,707 registrations and demand for diesel hybrids climbing 36 per cent to over 3,800.
Overall, the market for alternative fuelled vehicles rose 40 per cent to 72,775 units, increasing the sector’s market share from 2.1 per cent in 2014 to 2.8 per cent last year.
In contrast, demand for diesel vehicles rose just three per cent, as the fall-out from the VW scandal no doubt contributed to the technology’s market share slipping to 48.5 per cent."

London mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith has claimed they will soon make buses in the capital redundant, and the city has launched a £100m project to encourage more people to use electric cars. There is, presumably, a clear case for saying London would be transformed for the better by electric vehicles.
Alas, we struggled to find this case written down anywhere. So we sat down with a blank spreadsheet and tried to work it out from first principles. We began by listing the problems that motor vehicles currently bring to cities. Then, we asked what electricity could do to address each of these.
Perhaps the most obvious reason people get excited about electric vehicles is pollution. Conventional vehicles spew some very noxious stuff into our streets, killing many thousands each year (pdf), including several thousand in London alone. Electric vehicles offer a real advantage in reducing the dangerous nitrogen oxide and particulate matter in urban areas.
But as well as being cleaner, are electric vehicles also greener? That’s a different question – one to which the answer is entirely dependent on how the nation generates its electricity. In 2014, 19.1% of the UK’s electricity (pdf) was generated from renewables compared with 30% for gas and 30% for coal.
This heavy use of fossil fuels means the electric car is not as eco-friendly as it might initially appear. Electric vehicles basically move the fossil-fuel combustion from inside the car to another part of the country (safely outside the purview of any elected mayors). They don’t do much about how we’ll stop our nation emitting greenhouse gases.
The problems of today’s vehicles, however, go far beyond emissions. The hypermobility (pdf) they provide permits suburban sprawl (and thus extra greenhouse gas emissions) as it becomes possible for people to live, work and shop at places distant from one another. And there is another big space problem: a car used for 50 minutes a day is unused 96.5% of the time. Frequently cars are stored on roads and pavements, to the detriment of traffic flow, aesthetics, councils’ finances and the needs of vulnerable road users.
Simply swapping one engine for another does nothing to solve a raft of other problems. The UK has a billion-pound health crisis (pdf) arising from physical inactivity. Shifting shorter journeys – for example, those under two miles – from cars to active travel modes such as walking or cycling is one of the best things (pdf) any developed nation can do to tackle its health problems. Electric vehicles, at best, leave this problem untouched.
Perhaps what electric vehicle champions are really thinking of – especially when they suggest they will replace buses – is self-driving electric cars. Taking the driver out of the picture overcomes some issues, most obviously the problem of collisions – there is a high global and UK death toll from people crashing their vehicles. 
A switch to driverless vehicles gives us an opportunity to rethink our relationship with cars. We could move away from the old idea that everybody should own their own car and have a much smaller number of automated cars, each in frequent use and summoned when people need them.
Self-driving cars might overcome some genuine problems, such as the number of cars on the road and where we store all the unused cars. But this future requires car makers to sell few cars rather than many. This makes it unlikely any real change will happen – especially given the cosy relationship car manufacturers have enjoyed with governments. There is a lack of ambition and vision from the motoring industry which, for all its innovation, avoids addressing underlying issues. 
And even if we did shift to fewer shared vehicles, we are still left with the issues of urban sprawl, and questions about health and wellbeing. Even driverless cars do not address these fundamental problems. We need to stop building towns and cities on the self-fulfilling assumption people will travel by car. There is no future in which humans can sit down all day without paying an enormous health price. If driverless cars appear in streets anything like today’s, we risk falling into the most pathetic of robot uprisings, where they transport us helpfully from place to place while we remain inactive, growing fat and increasing our risk of cancer and diabetes. 
Electric vehicles should not be considered a panacea for sustainable transport but rather a possible part of the puzzle. We need to rethink the journeys we make. Many of our urban journeys are short and we should plan cities with that in mind. Perhaps in the future we will continue to drive to the city, but we won’t drive through the city. Let’s turn cities back into a place for human beings to make their short journeys in a physically active way."

 The Bahrain Royal family, 21st Century Fox America, the company chaired by Rupert Murdoch, and British construction vehicle manufacturers JCB have also been asked to pay up for flights to and from the UK.
The Environment Agency, which is responsible for enforcing the European Union’s emissions trading scheme (ETS) in the UK, has issued over £750,000 in fines to a total of 25 operators for “failure to surrender sufficient allowances to cover annual reportable emissions”.
The ETS requires polluters to surrender a carbon permit for every tonne of carbon pollution emitted, or pay a €100 (£75) per tonne fine. Permits are given to many air operators for free but can be bought if needed for about €8 currently.
Donald Trump faces a £1,610 penalty for a flight to the UK in a plane owned by DJT Operations I LLC, possibly the $100m Boeing 757 he uses as a private jet, complete with master bedroom and gold taps. The 757 is 54m long and usually carries 200-300 passengers. Trump opened his golf course in Aberdeenshire in 2012, the period covered by the fines published on 5 January.
The ETS is intended to limit carbon emissions and reduce climate change. This is unlikely to impress Trump, who has called climate change “bullshit” and a concept “created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”. Hope Hicks, Trump’s campaign communications manager, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Bahrain royal family have been hit with a heftier fine, £60,698, while 21st Century Fox America was fined £17,463.
The 25 operators fined include a series of private jet operators, insurance giant AIG, Air India and a “MIG Russian Aircraft”, which was not a military plane. JCB Ltd were hit with the biggest fine of £157,596.
“The EU Emissions Trading System is an important means of regulating emissions from aviation operators,” said Liz Parkes, Environment Agency deputy director of climate change and business services. “The Environment Agency’s enforcement activity is part of coordinated action across Europe.” Confidentiality rules mean the EA is unable to disclose whether fines have been paid or not.

Here’s the truth about TTIP”, Business). 
The independent UK Committee on Climate Change supports fracking in the UK, but its chair, Lord Deben, has also stated that his committee would not hesitate to ban fracking if the UK was unable to meet its climate change commitments.
So imagine a scenario in 2030, whereby several US or European-based companies are extracting shale gas and/or shale oil in the UK and Lord Deben’s committee announced that further extraction was incompatible with the Climate Change Act, which requires an 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050. I have no doubt that those companies would sue the government under the terms of TTIP, and the result would either be massive compensation or repeal of the Climate Change Act.
It needs to be remembered that the World Trade Organisation has the power to impose punitive fines on governments as well as other public institutions. In contrast, all the climate change agreements reached post-Paris are voluntary and there is no equivalent body to enforce environmental standards. Disputes will be held in secret without any environmental representation, so the planet will lose out every time. 
Dr Robin Russell-JonesStoke PogesBucks 
Contrary to your article, there is little prospect that European trade unions will support the proposed deal.
The GMB’s motion to oppose the TTIP was unanimously approved at the 2014 TUC Congress and the majority of national trade union federations in ETUC, the European-wide body, are also against it.
The reason for our implacable opposition to the TTIP and other similar trade agreements is that they are not really about trade at all, but, rather, a transfer of power and sovereignty from EU member states to unaccountable transnational corporations in whose interests these deals are made.
The figures quoted by your correspondent and used by the European Commission to justify the introduction of the TTIP have long since been discredited as little more than wishful thinking. The commission has since admitted that, in all probability, there would be thousands of job losses as a result of corporate restructuring.
It is simply not true that trade negotiators have “excluded provisions that would have allowed firms to sue governments for the loss of health and public service contracts”. Responding to public pressure, the commission ran a consultation exercise on the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement and received more than 150,000 replies, the vast majority opposing it, but, like its American counterparts, is still refusing to rule it out, thus also guaranteeing the opposition of unions grouped in the American TUC equivalent, the AFL-CIO.Bert SchouwenburgInternational officerGMBLondon NW1 
In their recent book, called TTIP, Ferdi De Ville and Gabriel Siles-Brugge supply further possible answers to the question: why TTIP? Their research shows that the exaggerated claims about growth and jobs are based on economic models that are no more than “an exercise in managing fictional expectations” and are politically motivated.
The motivation is primarily driven by US and EU fear of losing the dominant position in global power, in the face of competition from China and the other emerging economies. You might say it is the failing neoliberal experiment’s last desperate throw. There is one further fact that sheds some light on the corporate role in the negotiations. Of all the meetings held with the EU trade commissioners, 92% were with corporate lobbyists, leaving just 8% for small businesses, trade unions, NGOs and citizens. John Airs Liverpool"

I was so shocked I looked round for someone to receive the instantaneous and extraordinary tidings: a bumblebee at New Year!
What on Earth can such a sighting mean? I’ll add detail to justify any unease in that question. It was probably one of two common species, buff-tailed or early bumblebee. Based on its small size I might have suggested the latter, but I keep records of spring firsts and my earliest-ever early bumblebee is late March. My earliest-ever bumblebee of any species is 28 January 2012: a whole month later than this one.
In fact I wondered if it were not so much premature as a veteran of last autumn. Whichever is true, it was a bumblebee in a seasonal no-man’s-land, and my strangest record of this insect family in half a century.
I wonder what causal chain I have to invoke to account for such a maladapted vision? Must the moment draw in its wake, if only by implication, all the ecological fallout from 5bn tonnes of carbon, which our species propels, car journey by car journey, flicked switch by flicked switch, into the troposphere every year? Or is it something else?
Is my weird record connected to the weather anomalies generated by exceptional warm-water currents in the western Pacific? To think that there could be a link between that ocean’s habits and my garden’s wildlife is extraordinary enough, but at least a bumblebee because of El Niño is natural and, thus, admissible.
For much of recorded history, “unnatural” events at the point of the year’s renewal were often taken as ominous portents. I suspect little has changed. In our own ecologically informed age, when we understand how everything is linked to everything else, we may no longer resort to supernatural powers or the will of God to explain these freaks. Yet still, we sense instinctively that a midwinter bumblebee can neither be random nor without meaning."

The study from the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy at London School of Economics and Political Science argues that applying the tax to all fuels would increase UK consumer prices by up to just 0.9 per cent, assuming all costs were passed along supply chains fully.
However, the report, which was authored by David Grover, Ganga Shreedhar and Dimitri Zenghelis, argues that the true cost impact on consumers is likely to be even lower, given the manner in which the carbon tax would incentivise green behaviour change, drive business innovation, and provide the Treasury with revenues that it could recycle back into the economy.
“In reality [the] impact would likely be still smaller than these estimates suggest because our analysis has not allowed for any of the input substitution, innovation, production method change, or new investment behaviour that industries would exhibit to avoid the cost of carbon pricing,” the paper stated.
Opponents of carbon taxes argue they would impose costs on consumers and undermine the competitiveness of carbon intensive industries. Last year the government moved to ease these concerns, exempting a raft of energy intensive industries such as steel and concrete manufacturing from existing carbon taxes and ‘green levies’.
However, the new paper argues only a handful of industries that together account for around two per cent of UK GDP would face production cost increases that could result in their international competitive position being compromised.
“Carbon policies will provide incentives to increase energy efficiency and resource productivity which could afford UK producers a competitive advantage in the long term, in a world where fossil fuel prices could rise and carbon reduction policies are likely to become more widespread and ambitious,” the paper said.
It added that industries that are disproportionately impacted by carbon taxes should be provided with policy support to help them adapt to carbon pricing measures. “The correct policy response is not to resist this change but to identify vulnerable sectors and buffer labour market participants against its sharpest effects,” the paper said. “Countries and firms that resist enduring change and innovation may not be acting in their long-term interests.”"

But in the meantime, it’s faster and cheaper to save and regrow tropical trees";"There was already dramatic evidence that our planet is undeniably warming before 30 December 2015, when the world heard that the ice at the North Pole was melting. (The temperature on 30 December 2015 was, by some reports, 33ºF [0.7ºC], 50ºF above average).
And yet one immediate, effective way to fight climate change and save polar ice caps is half a world away, in the tropics. Tropical forest conservation and restoration could constitute half of the global warming solution, according to a recent peer reviewed commentary in Nature Climate Change. 
Reducing carbon emissions, as the nations of the world promised to do in Paris last month, is essential, but simultaneously pulling carbon out of the atmosphere (which is what rainforests do) would immediately and significantly reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) at a surprisingly low cost, providing a crucial bridge to a post-fossil fuel era. 
The potential of rainforest conservation to address global warming should be enough to galvanize massive worldwide rainforest conservation efforts. The natural regrowth and subsequent protection of hundreds of millions of acres of degraded rainforest would result in massive absorption of carbon as the trees grow. While it is crucial that we transition away from the use of fossil fuels, the reality is that rainforest protection can happen much more quickly.
But that is only part of the story.
Rainforest conservation is also incredibly economical. One acre of Amazon rainforest in Peru, which stores up to 180 metric tonnes of CO2, can be protected for just a few dollars; the same is true elsewhere in Latin America and Africa. The implications here are astounding and should give us pause: for the cost of a meal – or even a coffee – each of us could save an area of forest about the size of four football pitches and safely store about 725 metric tonnes of CO2. To put this in perspective, the annual emissions of a typical passenger vehicle in the United States is less than 4.5 metric tonnes of CO2. 
Carbon storage, however, is only one benefit of rainforest conservation. Not only do rainforests protect animals such as elephants, tigers and orangutans, they provide a refuge for hundreds and thousands of other lesser-known species. Among other benefits, the medicinal properties of undiscovered and unstudied plants may hold the key to successfully treating cancer and other deadly diseases. 
And rainforests provide the world with a disproportionately high percentage of its oxygen and fresh water – the Amazon River alone contains 20% of the world’s freshwater– and act as natural engines that keep the planet’s tropical ecosystems running smoothly. 
Although wholesale clear-cutting and selective logging have destroyed massive areas of rainforest, vast areas remain intact. And degraded rainforest, if allowed to regenerate, is amazingly resilient. In 10 years, seedlings can grow into 50-foot [15-meter] trees. Diverse wildlife can return and rebound within two to three years. 
Both the remaining pristine rainforest and degraded forest require the world’s attention: a vigorous, concerted effort is needed if we are going to react appropriately to the staggering demands being placed on our planet’s rainforest. 
Deforestation in the name of economic development has occurred routinely over many decades without regard to its devastating consequences. It is completely unsustainable for governments to continue to provide concessions, subsidies and tax breaks to business when logging, oil extraction, mining for minerals, fires, palm oil plantations, large scale commercial agriculture, cattle ranching and road construction continue to diminish the earth’s finite, invaluable rainforests.
The case for rainforest preservation – already overwhelmingly strong – can no longer be cast as a niche effort of conservationists and scientists; it needs to be everyone’s concern. For those wishing to tackle our planet’s greatest environmental challenge, there is no better place to begin than saving our tropical rainforests. "

Last year, Beijing issued two “red alerts” for pollution, the highest level warning which calls for emergency measures such as closing schools and restricting car use. Poor air quality is also having a significant knock-on effect on the country’s tourist trade. 
Some businesses are taking advantage of the air pollution – food delivery services that meet the needs of those staying indoors; bars which push their air purifiers as a marketing tool to get customers in; and beer that gets cheaper as the air quality decreases. But these are not long-term solutions.
According to Ma Jun, one of China’s most prominent environmental voices, China has reached its environmental tipping point. “I think its time to change and balance the environment and growth. If we don’t do that we’re going to suffer a hard landing one day very soon,” says Ma.
From top-down, engineering solutions providing wind turbines and solar panels, to NGOs and citizens forcing local government and industry to act, China’s next steps are going to be closely scrutinised. 
The comments on an article we published last September about Ellie, the machine that can detect depression, ranged widely, from “So CLEVER. My God. Amazing” to “creepy” to “Oh bloody hell, I’m not even fully qualified as a counsellor and already there’s a robot taking my job”.
Ellie is a virtual interviewer, a machine that has been developed to help diagnose depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Like apps for combatting low mood and online cognitive behavioural therapy, she’s an example of the ways that technology can be put to good use by helping improve people’s mental wellbeing.
“We hear a lot about how the rise of technology use, such as smartphones, is harming our mental health, but I believe the same technology can be a real safety net too,” says Sarah Bateup, clinical lead of Ieso Digital Health.
With at least 350 million people worldwide living with depression, the development and adoption of such technology is set to continue.
Industrial farming methods are increasingly coming under scrutiny, especially when it comes to the routine use of antibiotics. 
Although our growing resistance to them can in part be put down to poor prescribing and use, Dr David Wallinga points out that more than 70% of medically important antibiotics sold in the US are used for livestock to promote growth or for routine disease prevention in the “less-than-healthy conditions found on industrial farms”. This is exacerbating antibiotic resistance. 
As a recent Guardian editorial points out, “Antibiotic resistance may not seem as urgent as terrorism or the NHS funding shortfall. But it is actually a threat that could kill many more people and degrade the quality of civilised life much more”.
The Guardian’s investigation into the poultry industry, a key user of antibiotics, has uncovered a catalogue of other disturbing practices. From alleged hygiene failings leading to contaminated chicken to serious concerns about working conditions, the revelations show the heavy price some pay for cheap chicken.
Then there’s pesticide use. Numerous studies have suggested its links with a range of health impacts, including cancers and Parkinson’s disease. The French wine industry, where only 8.4% of vineyards are organic is one sector particularly enamoured with pesticides. However, experts predict that dozens of legal proceedings could be in the pipeline across France related to their health impacts.
Few things are as ridiculous as transporting water around the world in disposable plastic bottles. 
Globally, we now drink as much packaged water as we do milk. Over one fifth of the water in the UK is sourced from overseas, despite the country having abundant sources of water. There have also been trends for water from remote areas, such as Fiji Water, which is sourced from the Fiji Islands, 1,600 miles from the nearest continent.
In the context of a world that is struggling with acute water scarcity in some areas, there are serious questions to be answered about our role as stewards of the Earth. 
Climate change is funded in numerous, often opaque ways, from the issuing of bonds that support the relentless expansion of palm oil plantations to the lobby groups seeking to undermine government action on climate change. 
Some argue that climate change leaders should join forces with fossil fuel companies to put a price on carbon. According to Hunter Lovins and Felix Kramer, for example: “Fossil fuel companies receive $5.3tn [£3.6tn) in worldwide subsidies every year – that’s $10m a minute – exceeding global spending on health. Pricing carbon fuels to reflect their true social and environmental impacts will help to speed up the transition to renewable energy and more energy efficient living standards.”
Other ways to tackle climate change that have risen to prominence over the past year include scaling up the divestment movement and driving more investment into renewables. 
The divestment campaign has had some significant recent successes, including the Church of England divesting from tar sands oil and coal last April and Californian lawmakers passing a bill in September requiring the state’s two largest pension funds to divest from coal.
Last summer, Bill Gates announced that he would invest $2bn in renewable technologies, and in November it was announced that entrepreneurs including Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Richard Branson were to form the Breakthrough Energy Coalition to support early-stage clean energy companies. "

But when Rachel McCarthy isn’t walking the corridors of Whitehall, on secondment to the Department of Energy and Climate Change, she is to be found polishing her poems.
Despite achieving a double first in physics and chemistry, McCarthy always wanted to write. As the founder of Excite Poetry, the Devon wing of the Poetry Society, and the director of the sell-out Exeter poetry festival, her verse-writing skills are matched only by her ability to draw crowds to big events. 
Strolling through Exeter’s arty West Quarter, blinded by a low winter sun, McCarthy ducks into her favourite junk shop, Otto Retro. “I used to run this open-mic night here,” she says, eyeing up the curiosities that include an Austrian zoological chart and some Czech apothecary jars. “It was such a warm environment. We’d have poetry readings – and people could shop during the break.”
In 2015, the British poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy named McCarthy one of the country’s most exciting new voices, describing her work as bold and mesmerising. Last year also saw the publication of Element, under the Laureate’s Choice imprint, curated by Duffy.
Each of the 19 poems in the volume was inspired by elements from the periodic table, which McCarthy is adamant shouldn’t be dismissed as “a thing stuck on the wall in your GCSE class that you had to memorise”. Everything is made of elements, she says. “You and I. This table. It’s an alphabet of our existence.” 
The collection spans history and tackles subjects from bees (chromium) and butterflies (iridium) to love (yttrium), disaster (osmium) and art history (zinc), via unsung aircraft fitters such as her own father (titanium). Short notes at the end of the booklet explain the significance of each poem’s element. Copper in octopus blood, for example, carries oxygen more efficiently than iron in haemoglobin, helping the octopus survive deep under water. The poet Alice Oswald says of McCarthy’s writing: “strong interesting poems, full of tension and symmetry. They are alive.” 
As you might expect of a scientist, McCarthy did a great deal of research, not only reading “hardcore” chemistry books, but also biographies of Dmitri Mendeleev, who first published the periodic table in 1869, and histories of Russia from the same period. “I became fascinated,not with melting points and boiling points, but with the lives behind the elements. Why they were named as they were – after brothers, wives, stuff in the night sky – and what did they do?” There have even been fraudulent discoveries of fabricated elements.
This week, McCarthy will share this knowledge in Alphabet of Our Universe, part social history lecture, part poetry reading, at Oxford University’s Museum of the History of Science. She says her dual career is often met with surprise, but the two jobs have much in common. “They’re both searching for insight into laws and ideas through particulars. They’re focused on the minutiae.” 
In poetry, those particulars are “words, emotions, ideas and metaphors”, but the best poetry is universal, McCarthy says. “Artistic expression is a search for a truth that looks different on the outside. It’s more concerned with human emotions or experience, but they’re still searching.” Unlike poetry, however, science should be morally neutral, since “that sort of protects science from us as human beings”.
At school in Leyland, near Preston in Lancashire, McCarthy took six A-levels, including all the sciences, maths and English literature. “I had a fantastic English teacher and there was a point when I wondered, ‘Which road do I go down?’ Because that’s the choice you’re presented with now. We’ve lost the renaissance person.” In the end, she decided she could write in her own time, whereas moonlighting as a scientist was less realistic. 
McCarthy feels strongly that art, when tackling scientific subjects, should respect the facts. “If you are influencing the public about a scientific issue, there has to be some responsibility taken by the artist.” Equally, science has a responsibility to artists to properly communicate its findings. Scientific knowledge, McCarthy insists, needn’t dampen one’s wonder at the universe. If anything, it enhances it.
As an example, she riffs on a quote by the American scientist Richard P Feynman printed in the opening pages of Element: “Jupiter, as a mythological figure, to my mind is equally as important as Jupiter the planet. We must engage with both of them.”

If the Earth’s climate is relatively insensitive to rising carbon levels, then it’s somewhat less urgent that we stop burning massive quantities of fossil fuels. However, a new NASA study indicates that’s not the case.
There are a few different ways that climate scientists estimate the Earth’s sensitivity to rising carbon. When they look at climate changes in the distant past (paleoclimate), and at simulations from complex climate models, they get about the same result: if the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubles, temperatures will rise between 2°C and 4.5°C, most likely 3°C.
However, a few studies in recent years using a third method have yielded somewhat lower results. This method uses recent measurements of temperature and heat changes, combined with estimates of how “forcings” like the increased greenhouse effect have caused the Earth’s energy balance to change, all input into somewhat simpler climate models. 
These results caused the latest IPCC report to drop its lower estimate of the likely climate sensitivity to double carbon dioxide from 2°C to 1.5°C. Climate scientists were faced with the question, why did this third approach (known as the “energy budget approach”) yield somewhat lower results than others, and which estimate is right?
A new study by Kate Marvel, Gavin Schmidt, Ron Miller, and Larissa Nazarenko at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies appears to have found the answer. They drew upon previous research by Drew Shindell and Kummer &amp; Dessler, who identified a flaw in studies taking the energy budget approach. Those studies had assumed that the Earth’s climate is equally sensitive to all forcings. 
In reality, as world-renowned climate scientist James Hansen noted in a 1997 paper, some forcings are more efficient at causing the Earth’s surface temperature to change than others. Those in which the effects are focused in the northern hemisphere tend to be more efficient, for example. Andrew Dessler explains in the video below.
Drew Shindell first identified this deficiency with these low sensitivity studies in a 2014 paper. Shortly thereafter, Kummer &amp; Dessler published a paper noting that this issue could potentially bring the climate sensitivity estimates from the energy budget method in line with estimates from climate models and paleoclimate studies. This new NASA paper builds upon those previous studies by better quantifying the efficiencies of different forcings over the historical period and the effect this has on energy budget approach climate sensitivity estimates.
The NASA scientists ran climate models using just one forcing at a time – changes in greenhouse gases, aerosol pollution, land use changes, etc. – to see how efficient each is at changing the global surface temperature. As it turns out, forcings that have tended to cause cooling, like increased aerosol pollution, are particularly efficient.
The scientists then repeated the energy budget study approaches incorporating what they learned about the various forcing efficiencies, and found that the previous climate sensitivity estimates were indeed biased low. As the NASA study authors wrote,
Climate sensitivities estimated from recent observations will therefore be biased low in comparison with CO2-only simulations owing to an accident of history
The “accident of history” is that the more efficient forcings happen to be those that have had a cooling effect on temperatures in recent decades, while the less efficient forcings happen to be those that have caused warming. By assuming they were all equally efficient, the previous energy budget studies, for example by Nic Lewis and Judith Curry, biased their climate sensitivity estimates low. The new best estimate puts climate sensitivity right around 3°C warming in response to doubled carbon dioxide levels, in line with estimates from climate models and paleoclimate studies. 
Gavin Schmidt provides more detail at RealClimate. He also notes that conservative media outlets like the Daily Express and Daily Mail, and science denial blogs badly misrepresented their study results, as happens all too often.
It’s also important to note that relying solely on the previous energy budget model results is a clear-cut case of cherry picking. That method was the outlier, yielding lower climate sensitivity estimates than other approaches. In fact, there have been a number of recent studies using observed changes in cloud cover, finding that the climate models with the higher sensitivities are those that reproduce the cloud changes most accurately.
Moreover, it’s worth pointing out that even ‘low’ estimates are not that low. As climate scientist Chris Forest noted, if they were correct, “It might buy us five or ten years” to solve the problem. We’re so far behind the carbon pollution cuts needed to avoid dangerous climate change, that extra decade wouldn’t even be enough. Even if the contrarians were right, we would still need to cut carbon pollution rapidly.
However, the NASA study shows that the previous estimates were indeed biased low, and correcting for that bias brings them into agreement with estimates using other approaches. This result makes it all the more urgent that we ratchet down carbon pollution emissions as quickly as possible to curb the risks associated with rapid climate change."

Addressing executives in Texas, Saudi oil minister Ali Al-Naimi said the industry had to shed its “Dark Side” image and show it was a “force for good”.
“As an industry, we should be celebrating that fact, and better explaining the vital importance of these precious natural resources,” he said, according to a transcript from an event in Houston.
“We should not be apologising. And we must not ignore the misguided campaign to ‘keep it in the ground’ and hope it will go away. For too long the oil industry has been portrayed as the Dark Side, but it is not. It is a force, yes, but a force for good.”
The growing divestment campaign bids to blacklist the industry as others shunned tobacco producers or Apartheid-era South Africa.
By last December, over 500 institutions including large insurers, funds and banks managing US$3.4tn of assets pledged to move out of fossil fuels for climate reasons. That’s a 70-fold rise on September 2014.
Fossil fuels were not the problem, but their “harmful emissions,” said Al-Naimi, who represents the hydrocarbon-rich Middle Eastern kingdom at UN climate talks and stepped down as chairman of national oil company Aramco in 2015.
The world must scale up technologies that capture carbon dioxide, instead of replacing the polluting fuels with renewable sources, he added.
The US now leads Saudi Arabia as the world’s top oil producer following a revolution in techniques to extract it from shale rock, according to BP data.
Al-Naimi denied his country had declared war on US producers following oil cartel Opec’s decision not to limit production. Crude prices have plummeted more than 70% since June 2014, bankrupting shale drillers. 
“We must continue to work together and we must stick together if we want to achieve our common goal of supplying energy for the betterment of the world and humankind,” he said."

In a letter made available to the Guardian, climate scientists James Hansen (formerly of Nasa), Michael Mann (Penn State), Kerry Emanuel (MIT) and more than 100 other researchers said they were deeply troubled by the “well-documented complicity of ExxonMobil in climate denial and misinformation”.
The scientists urged the American Geophysical Union to reject funding from Exxon, as a matter of scientific integrity. The AGU’s annual meetings are among the largest of their kind, drawing about 25,000 scientists.
Exxon is under criminal investigation in New York and California for misleading investors and the public about the dangers of climate change.
The Guardian, Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times reported last year that the oil company knew about climate risks and factored them into planning as early as the 1970s – but continued to fund organisations rejecting established science well into the 2000s.
“In part [thanks] to Exxon, the American public remains confused and polarized about climate change,” the letter said. “And thanks in part to Exxon, climate science­-denying members of Congress and lobby groups operating at the state level remain a major obstacle to US efforts to mitigate climate change.”
The letter said that history should disqualify Exxon as a sponsor, because of AGU rules barring financial ties to scientific disinformation.
About 4,000 AGU members will gather in New Orleans on Monday for an oceans meeting.
The AGU said in a blogpost that it would review Exxon’s current activities, and take up the issue at a board meeting in April. Last year, the association decided there was no reason to cut financial connections with the oil company.
Exxon said news reporting about it’s activities was “inaccurate and deliberately misleading”. 
“We reject allegations that ExxonMobil suppressed climate change research,” a spokesman said in an emailed statement. “This is an inaccurate distortion of ExxonMobil’s nearly 40-year history of climate research that was conducted publicly in conjunction with the Department of Energy, academics and the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.”
In a shift of tactics, campaigners are now working to expose the fossil fuel companies responsible for climate change and propping up climate-denial and corporate lobby groups opposing policies such as cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
Those efforts have gathered pace over the last year as more details emerge about how Exxon reportedly concealed from the public evidence it had been gathering from its own scientists.
“We were so struck by the recent revelations – how they covered up the climate science and how they were being investigated by the New York and California attorney generals,” said Ploy Achakulwisut, a PhD candidate in atmospheric chemistry at Harvard University who is one of the organisers of the petition.
Organisers were disturbed to see Exxon listed among the sponsors of the Earth and space scientists’ most recent gathering in San Francisco.
“It seems to me like an appropriately clear case for the scientific community to stand up and reject what amounts to greenwashing for Exxon,” said Ben Scandella, a PhD candidate in environmental science at MIT and another of the organisers. 
“By accepting that sponsorship, the AGU gives up the ability to call out Exxon for their climate science disinformation activities.
“For me, personally, it is disconcerting to learn that a company knew one thing and told the world something completely different, and I imagine a lot of scientists are bothered by the idea that our research would be distorted for the sake of obstructing legislation on controlling carbon emissions.”"

Yet we still don’t treat climate change with the reverence we reserve for something like a terrorist attack.
Maybe the blame goes deeper, into our very natures: evolution did not design our bodies to treat climate change with urgency. 
Evolutionary responses favor real-time threats, not those that take place on an extended time scale. Shrinking Arctic ice cover, erratic changes in winter snow cover or rapid shifts in heat and cold don’t provide the same sense of threat as our fear of terrorist attacks or other bodily harm. 
The challenge in moving more forcefully to stop the flow of greenhouse gases is that if you have to stop and think about whether a specific action or activity is threatening, that very process engages very different parts of the human brain, and not the ones that impel us to action. 
The hormones that flood through our bodies to provide increased strength and speed in anticipation of fighting or running won’t kick in when the threat is one that can only be understood through research and thought. If you want to worry whether climate change will eventually make it more difficult for humans to feed themselves, for example, you need to break out the books and study science, statistics and a lot of other disciplines. Even after you study, it is hard to share that thought with your fellow humans in a way that elevates this to an Isis-like threat. 
One result: we only pay attention to climate change from time to time, and usually when it hits us in the face – Hurricane Sandy or drought if you are a farmer in California. But disaster rarely hits all humanity at the exact same time. And life goes on – our memories of tragedy fade, a survival mechanism also bequeathed us by evolution. 
One time when more of us paid attention was when the countries of the world met in Paris in December to map out the next steps in the battle to contain the dangerous greenhouse gas emissions that are trapped in the atmosphere and increasing planetary heating. Daily, for a few weeks, we heard stories, opinions, data and analysis. There was a “hook” – a small, international drama taking place in France. 
Now that the moment has passed, we are back to our own devices, and most of us don’t consciously connect whether gradual warming might double back to cripple human life. What if the changes make it difficult for critters and insects that play roles in food production to survive and perform their jobs? The cereal aisle in western supermarkets still offers dozens of choices. What if we don’t sense in a personal way how these changes might make us more vulnerable to opportunistic illness? We can avoid the issue unless the boss directs us to travel to Brazil and we are forced to worry about Zika.
Our difficulty looking longer-term encourages the thought that someone, somewhere is taking care of this problem for us, that there is really nothing the rest of us need do. We sit back and leave it to the experts.
The US supreme court’s recent insistence on looking through the lens of legal process – justices voted to stay Barack Obama’s carbon emissions regulations pending a challenge to them – neatly captures the fatal time factor. The court’s decision to cease implementation of the Clean Power Plan until the case is argued and decided isn’t fatal if the rule survives legal challenge. Then states will get back to work and ways will be found to reduce emissions. But the time lost in climate terms cannot be made up. 
Climate change is relentless; human habit, Daniel Kahneman tells us, is oblivious. Bridging those two extremes is the central challenge of our times."

One of the most prestigious and productive scientific organizations is slashing hundreds of jobs, many related to climate change research. The organization, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO for short) is simply put, one of the best in the world. It rivals well-known groups like NASA, NOAA, and the Hadley Centre for its contributions to climate science.
What does CSIRO do that is so special? Many things. For instance, they are world leaders in measuring what is happening to the planet. Their research includes ocean-going vessels and other instrumentation that measure the chemistry and temperature of the ocean; they help track where human-emitted carbon dioxide is going, how heat is building up in the oceans, and what is happening with the general health of the ocean biosystem.
CSIRO is also a modeling superpower. Their climate models form the backbone of our understanding of what changes have happened and what changes will happen because of human greenhouse gases.
But they also have deepened our knowledge about extreme weather. They’ve provided insights regarding how droughts, heat waves, and floods will change in the future.
All of these contributions are important not only for the understanding that they provide but also because this knowledge helps us plan for the future. If you want to know what we can do to mitigate or adapt to climate change, you need this information.
But according to CSIRO chief executive, Larry Marshall, CSIRO should shift focus. Here is the key statement he made last week:
Our climate models are among the best in the world and our measurements honed those models to prove global climate change. That question has been answered, and the new question is what do we do about it, and how can we find solutions for the climate we will be living with?
Are you kidding me? What kind of backward logic is this? From the reports I’ve read, something like 350 positions will be cut from CSIRO with the heaviest cuts (over 100) coming from the climate research groups. How can you predict how to adapt if you don’t know what you are going to adapt to? This doesn’t make sense. 
Sure, I have colleagues at CSIRO (who I also consider friends). Sure I don’t want them to lose their jobs. But, the real reason this foolish move upsets me is that it forces decision-makers to fly with blinders on as they make decisions for our future. How fast will the planet warm? What will the impacts be? How will it change weather patterns? How will those weather patterns affect the Earth’s biological systems? All of these questions and more will be harder to answer after these cuts. 
Australia is a small country (by population). Yet, it has punched far above its weight class in research. To think that this treasure of a research organization will be gutted is just shocking. 
This story has gotten a lot of press in Australia such as here and here. It is also covered in international venues such as here and petitions such as here and here. Let’s hope this move is reversed before it is too late."

Together with language, this knowledge is what separates us from all other species. Yet, until the 18th century, not even Aristotle, who speculated about most things, actually considered the possibility of extinction.
This is all the more surprising because “the end of the world” is an archetypal theme with a sonorous label – eschatology – that morphs in popular culture into many doomsday scenarios, from global warming to the third world war. Citizens of the 21st century now face a proliferating menu of possible future dooms.
Elizabeth Kolbert’s The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History is both a highly intelligent expression of this genre and also supremely well executed and entertaining. Her book, which follows her global warming report Field Notes from a Catastrophe (2006), is already set to become a contemporary classic, and an excellent place to start this new series of landmark nonfiction titles in the English language.
On the opening page of her investigation into the future of our planet, Kolbert quotes the great biologist EO Wilson: “If there is danger in the human trajectory, it is not so much in the survival of our own species as in the fulfilment of the ultimate irony of organic evolution: that in the instant of achieving self-understanding through the mind of man, life has doomed its most beautiful creations.” This warning note sets the mood for the 13 chapters that follow, an urgent contemporary report on “the sixth extinction”.
Kolbert’s perspective is both awe-inspiring and fearsome, but utterly engrossing, as you’d expect from a book whose premise is “we’re all doomed”. During the past half billion years, she tells us, there have been five mass extinctions on Earth, when “the planet has undergone change so wrenching that the diversity of life has plummeted”.
The history of these catastrophic events, notes Kolbert, tends to be recaptured just as humanity comes to realise that it is about to cause another one. Sure enough, in our postmillennial century, she finds that scientists around the world are now monitoring the next mass extinction, possibly the biggest devastation since an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs. With this difference: the impending cataclysm is… us.
Part of Kolbert’s concern is to educate the modern reader in the history of mass extinction, a comparatively recent idea
In 13 emblematic episodes, exquisitely narrated, Kolbert, a magazine journalist with the New Yorker, explores the possibility of our impending doom through the lives of, for instance, the Panamanian golden frog, the Sumatran rhino and the black-faced honeycreeper of Maui, “the most beautiful bird in the world”.
Part of Kolbert’s concern is to educate the modern reader in the history of mass extinction. While the concept, as she puts it, “may be the first scientific idea that kids have to grapple with”, as they play with their toy dinosaurs, Kolbert instructs that, actually, it’s a comparatively recent idea that dates to Enlightenment France. Until this moment in the western intellectual tradition, not even Aristotle (in his 10-volume History of Animals) had so much as considered the possibility that animals had a past. Later, in Roman times, Pliny’s Natural History includes descriptions of animals that are real, or fabulous, but none that are extinct. The word “fossil” was used to describe anything dug from the ground, as in “fossil fuel”. Even Carl Linnaeus, who pioneered his system of binomial nomenclature in the mid-18th century, catalogued only one kind of animal – those that exist.
It was the discovery of some American mastodon bones in what is now Ohio, during the early 18th century – an unintended consequence of French colonial exploration – that subsequently inspired Georges Cuvier, an anatomist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, to ask the essential question: “What was this primitive Earth? … And what revolution was able to wipe it out?”
Revolutionary France celebrated the rights of man. Cuvier was never going to recognise the truth about some later extinctions: that Homo sapiens is the problem, not the solution. Addressing the imminent next catastrophe with a certain grim relish, Kolbert spells out the results of her investigations: “One-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all freshwater molluscs, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed towards oblivion,” she declares, during the course of her odyssey through our natural world and its human-inspired devastation. Kolbert’s indictment of humanity is remorseless, and compelling: “The losses are occurring all over: in the South Pacific, in the North Atlantic, in the Arctic and in the Sahel, in lakes and on islands, on mountaintops and in valleys.”
Homo sapiens may have enjoyed brilliant success but we have done so at the expense of virtually every other species
Readers of The Sixth Extinction will be unable to evade the conclusion that we do indeed find ourselves on the brink of a great catastrophe, one in which the agent involved is not an inanimate object (such as an asteroid) or a geophysical force (such as the extreme global warming disaster of 250m years ago) but a sentient creature: ourselves. Homo sapiens may have enjoyed brilliant success on Earth but we have done so at the expense of virtually every other species. We are, as the Observer’s Robin McKie has put it, “the neighbours from hell”.
The Sixth Extinction ends in a windowless room at the Institute for Conservation Research in California known as the Frozen Zoo, the world’s largest collection of species on ice. This, suggests Kolbert, may be the slender thread on which life on Earth will depend in future. Who knows? She underlines her final message with a quotation from the Stanford ecologist Paul R Erhlich: “IN PUSHING OTHER SPECIES TO EXTINCTION, HUMANITY IS BUSY SAWING OFF THE LIMB ON WHICH IT PERCHES.”
We have been warned.
“The Sixth Extinction will continue to determine the course of life long after everything people have written and painted and built has been ground into dust and giant rats have – or have not – inherited the Earth.”

Lord Weidenfeld was never my publisher, but he took a flattering interest in my work, almost as if he had read it. He hadn’t, of course, he was far too busy: but in every conversation I had with him, he lavished on me a verbal catalogue of authors he thought I should chase up. He had the most magic bookshelves I ever saw, and I wouldn’t have been surprised to find that his collected Shakespeare was a signed copy. His gusto and gift for making people feel important turned even the most fleeting social encounter into an artistic event. The obituary in Der Spiegel got him exactly right: it said that he could make a small occasion into a great experience. “This is the way I was always meant to live,” he once told me, “sitting in a Vienna cafe surrounded by poets and intellectuals.” We were in an open-air bar in Italy, and there was nobody there but the two of us.
But at least Weidenfeld had a long life. The Australian scientist Bob Carter died far too young. The climate change orthodoxy can be a tough proposition to be sceptical about if you mind being accused of betraying the future of the human race. Carter knew how to maintain a gentlemanly vocabulary even when the guardians of dogma were calling him names. It’s a hard trick to work: sometimes it’s just easier to join in and call your persecutors intensely dense. But Carter always behaved as if they might have had a point. Perhaps he was working on the principle that politeness is an argument in itself.
Some of us, lacking Weidenfeld’s generous charm or Carter’s cool bravery, look less credible when trying to do the right thing. A few nights ago, I ventured out of my house for the half-mile trip downtown to Caius college, where I co-hosted a small concert for the Jean Grove Trust, a charity supported by my elder daughter. The trust looks after four little schools in Ethiopia, and is undeniably a good cause. I wonder, however, whether I looked undeniably convincing in the role of Bob Geldof. Instead of just saying, “Give us your money”, I recited from my Dante translation. Luckily my co-performer, the pianist Patrick Hemmerlé, looked the part when he played pieces by Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven. As he powered through Beethoven’s magnificent last piano sonata, Opus 111, I wondered all over again at the amazing passage in which the deaf composer, soon to be dying, seems to be inventing ragtime about 80 years early. How could he be so joyful at the finale of his life? But perhaps all creation is joyful."

In last Thursday’s debate, the last before tonight’s Iowa caucus votes, on Fox News of all networks, there was one brief climate question directed at Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL). Unfortunately it was framed as a ‘gotcha, flip-flop’ question, with Rubio asked about his apparent support 8 years ago for a carbon cap and trade system in Florida, versus his current opposition to the concept. Rubio responded:
I have never supported cap and trade and I never thought it was a good idea. And I was clear about that at the time.
And I do not believe it’s a good idea now. I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment. And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy. 
When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.
In another debate 4 months ago on CNN, Rubio made similar comments, adding:
America’s a lot of things, the greatest country in the world, but America is not a planet. And we are not even the largest carbon producer anymore, China is, and they are drilling a hole anywhere in the world that they can get ahold of.
Politifact ruled it “mostly true” that Rubio never supported cap and trade. However, the rest of his comments are mostly false. 
First, “blame China” is no longer a viable option. Despite having much lower cumulative historical carbon emissions than the USA, China has agreed to take serious action to curb its coal consumption and carbon pollution, and has announced that it will launch the world’s largest carbon cap and trade system. Using China to oppose an American carbon cap and trade system simply doesn’t make sense.
Second, the “our pollution is too small to matter” argument is known as the Tragedy of the Commons fallacy. If the USA can make that argument, then so can every country. If every country uses this excuse, then none cut their carbon pollution, and climate destabilization becomes inevitable. The good news is that the opposite is already happening. Virtually every country in the world agreed to cut carbon pollution as a result of the Paris climate negotiations, including the United States and China.
Third, there are already cap and trade systems in place in the United States. The George H.W. Bush administration invented the concept of cap and trade to tackle the problem of acid rain with an economically optimal, free market approach. Under that cap and trade system, emissions of the pollutants that were causing acid rain were cut more quickly and cheaply than expected, and the estimated economic benefits have outweighed the costs of the system 40-to-1. 
California and a collaboration of nine northeastern states also already have successful carbon cap and trade systems in place. In order to comply with proposed EPA carbon regulations, many more states are likely to implement carbon cap and trade systems, or join these existing networks.
Fourth, as these successful existing cap and trade systems demonstrate, the concept hasn’t been devastating for the economy. Quite the opposite – the economies of the nine northeastern states, which implemented their regional cap and trade system in 2008, and of California, where it was introduced in 2013, have fared better than the national average. There is also a consensus among economic experts that we should cut carbon pollution, with most favoring a cap and trade system or carbon tax.
In fact, in a March 2007 speech, Rubio wisely argued that Florida should take advantage of the economic opportunities created by this type of free market solution.
This nation, and ultimately the world, is headed towards emission caps and energy diversification. Those changes will require technological advances that make those measures cost effective. The demand toward such advances will create an industry to meet it—Florida should become the Silicon Valley of that industry.
Unfortunately there was no more debate about optimal climate policies last Thursday. Rubio rejected the possibility of a carbon cap and trade system, and the moderators moved on to another topic. However, the other Republican presidential candidates would likely have answered in a similar fashion. Governor Chris Christie pulled New Jersey out of the northeastern states carbon cap and trade system, Ted Cruz denies that the Earth is even warming, many of the candidates are science deniers, and the only Republican candidates who think we should take action to curb global warming (Lindsey Graham and George Pataki) have dropped out of the race.
Climate change has sadly turned into an ideological litmus test. Republican candidates fear that if they admit human-caused global warming is a problem that we need to solve, they won’t be able to win their party’s nomination. As Graham and Pataki’s candidacies showed, that may be true.
However, a growing number of Republican thought leaders and even a majority of Republican voters support a revenue-neutral carbon tax. The problem is that while they represent a majority of the party, the conservative right wing of the party that imposes ideological purity tests dominates the primary election voting. This may be a flaw in the American political system, since the Republican Party now stands alone as the only climate-denying major political party in the world, and a candidate who can pass the right wing ideological purity test is unlikely to win a nationwide general election.
It’s a problem that the Republican Party must solve, because we need them to participate in the climate policy debate. Their candidates’ current strategy of denying the consensus of climate science and economics experts just won’t cut it when the entire world is moving forward with efforts to solve the problem, taking advantage of the resulting economic opportunities that Rubio recognized eight years ago."

The survey, which questioned more than 18,000 people in 17 different countries, found that while climate change is seen as the third most concerning issue globally, people in Britain feel armed conflicts and population growth pose a greater threat.
The study asked people to consider the threat posed by nine different issues - including global terrorism, population growth, energy scarcity and climate change - and rank them in order of what they consider to be the most serious. It also asked participants to identify which issue they considered as the most serious threat.
By taking an average of these two measures - to include both the breadth and density of concern in order to create a “share of concern” index - the research reveals that those most concerned about climate change are people in Hong Kong, Denmark and Sweden, with a 20 per cent, 16.2 per cent, and a 16 per cent share of concern for the issue respectively.
In contrast, the UK, US and Saudi Arabia were the three least-concerned countries about the issue, scoring 10.8 per cent, 9.2 per cent and 5.7 per cent respectively. People in Britain expressed the highest concern of any country about global population growth, while those in Saudi Arabia felt most strongly about the threat of armed conflicts.
Overall, climate change achieved a 12.8 per cent share of concern, ranking behind only international terrorism and the threat of poverty as the most concerning issues globally."

Last week, Fox News moderators asked only one question relevant to climate change, about whether Florida senator Marco Rubio would support regulation to lower emissions. Rubio said he would not: “I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.”
On the trail, former Florida governor Jeb Bush interjected to say the free market would resolve climate change before government could.
“There’s someone in a garage somewhere,” he said, “parochially I hope it’s in Miami, that’s going to have a clue, to have an answer to this.”
Miami will settle for anyone doing something – so long as it’s before environmental changes driven by humans destroy the city’s economy. Late last week, Mayor Tomás Regalado joined 14 other south Florida mayors in signing an open letter to Rubio, asking him to give up his opposition to climate change action.
The low-lying city and its nearby resorts and islands suffer near annual floods from rising sea levels, costing the city hundreds of millions. The mayors warned that a 1ft increase in sea level could “wipe out as much as $4bn” in real estate, and 3ft could cost $31bn and swallow large sections of the Florida Keys and greater Miami area.
“We need a realistic national plan to slow global warming emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change,” the mayors wrote. “The science is well established: protecting the long-term future of our cities must include preventing global temperatures from rising.”
One of the signatories, South Miami mayor Philip Stoddard, was more blunt a few years before Rubio’s presidential bid. 
Rubio is an idiot. He says he is not a scientist so he doesn’t have a view about climate change and sea-level rise
“Rubio is an idiot,” he told the Guardian at the time. “He says he is not a scientist so he doesn’t have a view about climate change and sea-level rise and so won’t do anything about it.”
Rubio’s professed ignorance has shifted to skepticism – a sign that many Republicans have reluctantly accepted that the issue exists for voters, if not that the issue matters. Last year, Rubio and two of his rivals, senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, agreed in a symbolic vote that climate change is “is real and not a hoax”. Of the three, only Paul voted to agree that human activity causes global warming.
None have agreed that climate change exacerbates threats to national security and the economy, although the point is agreed on by Pentagon officials, Nasa scientists, foreign policy experts, dozens of Republican and Democratic leaders, international researchers and the pope. 
The candidates might be playing simple politics – no one wants to be seen agreeing with Barack Obama or Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton, who called climate denial a “charade” on Sunday night – but they have also tried out several arguments to discredit the dangers and science of climate change.
That not all data indicates constant warming is one of the preferred arguments of Ted Cruz, who held a Senate hearing last month titled Data or Dogma.
To testify, Cruz called a retired Princeton physicist who believes the planet needs more carbon dioxide; a controversial climate scientist convinced of corruption in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); a climate scientist who insists basic models need reinvention; and a Canadian jazz vocalist who frequents the Rush Limbaugh Show and recorded an album about cats.
With the help of his witnesses and RSS satellite data since 1998, Cruz argued: “There has been no significant global warming for the past 18 years.”
But the senator chose a very specific set of data: an extraordinary El Niño set record temperatures in 1998, and by the RSS metric global warming has slowed in the 18 years since. The result was a chart that began with a peak and spanned not quite two decades of slow warming. 
Carl Mears, the senior research scientist whose data Cruz used, told the Guardian that Cruz was guilty of the crime with which he charges scientists: presenting a very partial argument. 
“He ignores other time periods, and other types of data,” said Mears, stressing surface temperatures “that do not support his hypothesis. He asserts that the satellite temperatures are more accurate than the surface temperature without providing any supporting evidence.”
Despite his own work with satellite data sets, Mears said he suspects surface data sets are more accurate.
“I agree with Mr Cruz that policy should follow science and data,” he said. “But it is important to follow all the data, not just the part that supports one side of the argument.”
Rubio has also spoken of the “hiatus”, which Mears and others are studying and which remains only part of the picture. Last year was the hottest on record by far, smashing a record set only a year earlier.
A witness called by Democrats to Cruz’s Senate hearing, David Titley, a Penn State meteorologist and former navy admiral, rebuffed Cruz. Titley noted that science by definition contains error and revision – demonstrated, for instance, by the corrections made to satellite data produced by his fellow witnesses. 
He also showed a clear curve of rising temperatures and carbon dioxide levels since 1880. 
“There are plenty of other signs that are far less equivocal, and perhaps even more relevant to those of us who live on the Earth’s surface,” he said. “Land and ocean surface temperatures are increasing, sea ice is declining, glaciers are shrinking, oceans are rising, the list goes on.”
Cruz mentioned a ship that got stuck in ice around Antarctica, arguing that the polar ice caps are not melting. 
Charles Bentley, an expert on Antarctica at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told the Guardian that sea ice floats. 
“If someone says sea ice in the same sentence as related to sea level change, a red flag goes up.”
Bentley called the argument “a little bit misleading”, because sea ice, although an indirect sign of change around the poles, “doesn’t directly indicate anything”. Cruz’s argument also ignores the clear melting of ice and glaciers on and around the north pole, where Russia, Canada and the US are competing over newly open ocean.
Rubio and Cruz have both said they would pull the US out of the historic Paris climate accords, and with Bush and New Jersey governor Chris Christie said they oppose any measures that would “destroy” the economy or stifle business. Donald Trump, Bush and John Kasich have mocked the Paris summit as an unnecessary diversion.
If the US withdrew from the Paris deal, it would join North Korea, Syria, Libya and Venezuela among the handful of nations who refuse to sign.
The aversion to all regulation is a major departure from the policies of Republicans past. Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency, Ronald Reagan’s staff invented the cap and trade system, George HW Bush signed the Clean Air Act and Teddy Roosevelt protected 230m acres of land. 
But the candidates have largely agreed with Rubio, who in a debate said: “We are not going to destroy our economy, make America a harder place to create jobs, in order to pursue a policy that will do nothing, nothing to change our climate.”
How climate change action might affect the economy depends on the measures involved; most of those proposed affect the worst emissions producers, such as coal – an industry in decline in the US for decades. 
In 2014, about 67% of electricity generated in the US was from fossil fuels, according to the EIA, though oil only accounted for 1%. The US natural gas industry faces more pressure from cheap Opec oil than investment in renewable energy. 
But in 2011, before the industry was rocked by low oil prices, the five main fossil fuel industries still accounted for less than 2% of all US non-agricultural employment.
Doing nothing also has its consequences, as south Florida businesses have tried to remind Republicans. By exacerbating flooding, water and energy crises and mass migration, climate change threatens to devastate the world economy – US gas industry included – according to a survey of 750 economists, conducted last year. 
Economists at Stanford and UC Berkeley also published a study last year that found rising temperatures will likely exacerbate inequality."

The same thing happened in 2014 while Tony Abbott was prime minister, and the move has now been criticised as an attempt by the Turnbull government to remove the independence of the agency.
According to legislation, the board must consist of the secretary of the Department of the Environment and up to six others appointed by the minister. The agency can operate with the secretary being the only board member, since it reaches quorum when a majority of the board members are present, which now occurs with one.
Parliament sits for the first time in 2016 on Tuesday, with bills abolishing both the renewable energy agency (Arena) and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation still before parliament, despite having been rejected by the Senate. Signs indicate the Turnbull government intends to keep them.
Arena is tasked with investing in emerging renewable energy technologies, while the CEFC invests in commercially viable renewable energy technologies. Disruption in the government’s handling of renewables has been blamed for a huge drop in clean energy investment in Australia.
If Arena is not abolished before July, it is set to receive almost $57m from the commonwealth and then almost $500m the following year.

The agency would not answer any questions about the matter and instead referred Guardian Australia to the Australian government boards website, which shows all positions are vacant.
The last three directors had their terms expire on 16 January.
“Everyone has been assuming with the change of leader, and a Senate that wouldn’t repeal it, that they were going to hang on to Arena,” said Tom Swann from the Australia Institute. “So given that, it’s pretty strange that they’ve let the board lapse and it raises questions about the future of Arena.”
The Greens environment spokeswoman, Larissa Waters, told Guardian Australia the move was an attempt to remove the agency’s independence. “The Senate won’t let the Liberals destroy this innovative, job-creating organisation, and so the Liberals are arrogantly trying to cut off its independence and expertise,” she said.
 “Major proposals come to Arena’s board for decision and having only a time-poor department secretary on the board is bad due diligence and a wasted opportunity for injecting high-level, diverse expertise,” Waters said.
Swann said the agency’s empty board and the bills abolishing it and the CEFC still being before parliament continue to discourage the renewable energy industry. “Given that we’ve had such a huge drop-off of renewable energy [investment] in Australia, the last thing we need is confusing signals,” he said.
The chief executive of the Solar Council, John Grimes agreed the bills were bad for his industry and called on the government to remove them. “If Malcolm Turnbull doesn’t act on this then people will start to think he’s just another Tony Abbott,” Grimes said.
Waters said the bills were unlikely to be debated by parliament, but were being kept to keep peace within the Liberal party. “It’s duplicitous for the prime minister to talk up innovation, economic diversification and the achievements of Arena and CEFC, while keeping both of these cutting-edge agencies on the chopping block, presumably to placate climate-sceptic colleagues and donors,” she said.
“Given the Senate’s opposition to passing either abolition bill, listing them for debate sends an unnecessary and damaging investment message to the clean energy sector,” Waters said.
Labor environment spokesperson, Mark Butler told Guardian Australia: “The fact that Arena and the CEFC are still on the chopping block shows that the Liberals’ attacks on renewables hasn’t stopped under Malcolm Turnbull. Greg Hunt has confirmed that these two agencies will remain in the Turnbull Liberal government’s sites.”
A spokesman for the environment minister, Greg Hunt, said the government’s policy was still to abolish the two bodies, but said “there is little prospect of support in the Senate”. He said the new Office of Climate Change and Renewables Innovation, which was being established inside the Department of the Environment, “will bring a fresh focus to the role of innovation in supporting emerging renewable and low emissions technologies that will drive down emissions”."

The days are rapidly getting longer, by about four minutes, and it is marked as a significant day in many cultures. February 2 is celebrated by Christians as Candlemas, when the church candles are blessed, and by pagans as the Festival of Light. In America it is Groundhog Day, when this animal’s behaviour is said to foretell whether spring is coming.
In parts of Europe this folktale involves the hedgehog. On either continent if the animal emerges from the ground and can see his shadow he returns immediately to hibernation knowing that winter is set to continue. A British folklore rhyme about Candlemas “being sunny and bright, winter will have another flight, and if Candlemas be cloudy with rain, winter is gone and won’t come again”, makes roughly the same prophesy.
This midwinter day, after the wild, wet and mild weather of the last two months, many would welcome animals seeing their shadows and hope it heralded a spell of frosty dry weather to bring the seasons back towards a normal pattern.
But judging by the latest science published on Friday, looking at European weather over the last 30 years, we have already irrevocably changed our climate.
Meteorologists are still reluctant to give weather forecasts for more than six days in advance, and hedgehogs being in short supply in Britain, it is hard to tell what the rest of the winter has in store. But looking at computer predictions for the direction and speed of the jet stream, more warm, wet weather is on the way."

Not enough graphs.
So here are six that you might have missed, but that tell us a few things about the state of the climate and the state of the public’s thinking on global warming. 
So how have global temperatures been recently? You know, while human-caused global warming has been on that pause that didn’t happen.
The forecast is for continued global warming largely driven by continued high levels of greenhouse gases.
Above is a chart from the UK’s MetOffice showing the three main global temperature data sets. These, for the hardcore among you, are known as HadCrut4 (MetOffice), GISTEMP (NASA) and MLOST (NOAA).
Pretty clear, right? All three show 2015 was the hottest year on record.
The chart shows “anomalies” (that’s the temperatures above or below a long-term average), in this case, against the average temperature between 1961 and 1990. 
So for the MetOffice data, 2015 was 0.75C above the long-term average.
In December 2014, the MetOffice guessed (and when I say guess, I mean they used some powerful, skilful and sophisticated modelling) that 2015 would be between 0.52 and 0.76C above average. So they were right. Just.
And while we’re talking about forecasts from the MetOffice, here’s another one of theirs from a few days ago. 
The MetOffice now makes “decadal” forecasts – that is, another of their guesses (same caveats apply as before with the term “guess”) on “near term” conditions globally over the next five years. 
The black line shows actual temperature measurements. The red band are previous predictions and the green band shows the expected range according to climate models.
In short, according to the MetOffice, the forecast is “for continued global warming largely driven by continued high levels of greenhouse gases”.
You can’t really talk about global warming without talking about the oceans, given that this is where the vast majority of the extra heat and the extra carbon dioxide ends up.
The above chart, from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shows the latest temperature readings from ships and from a network of almost 4,000 floats – known as the Argo array.
A study published a couple of weeks ago found heating of the oceans was accelerating, particularly in the deeper ocean.
One of the most popular talking points among climate science denialists is that CO2 is just great and the more of it that we pump out, the better things will be. 
This goes against the advice of every science organisation of repute on the planet. But who needs science when rapper BoB can apparently just nudge us off the edge of the Earth?
Anyway, as I’ve written here before, there’s an industry that has grown up around climate science denial and its epicentre is the network of US-based “free market” conservative thinktanks.
The chart above is from a paper by Yale University’s Dr Justin Farrell in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences published in October 2015.
Farrell examined the output of 164 thinktanks – mostly based in the US – that form a “climate counter-movement” by attacking science and working against policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
After writing a program to analyse some 39m words worth of reports, letters, blog posts and the like, Farrell found something interesting (actually, he found lots of interesting things). 
As the chart above shows, thinktanks that had taken funding from either oil giant Exxon or groups linked to the oil billionaire Koch brothers were far more likely to say that “CO2 is good” than those that didn’t. 
While most people accept that climate change is happening, there continues to be a roughly even split among the public about its causes.
Some think it’s mostly natural, some think it’s mostly human-caused. This split is in no small way thanks to the misinformation campaigns run by the groups mentioned above. 
In Australia the public is still split on the causes of global warming, according to a CSIRO survey of about 5,000 people. 
But one fascinating aspect of a CSIRO survey on public attitudes to climate change isn’t what people think, but what people think other people think – if you follow me. 
The chart above is taken from a 2013 study published in Nature Climate Change and illustrates how fabulously crap most people are at gauging the climate opinions of others. 
For example, 7% of Australians think climate change is “not happening” – as shown by the dotted line on that bar. But that group thinks that about half of Australians think the same. Wildly wrong. 
Rising CO2 emissions and economic growth have been like two kids who met as childhood sweethearts and just never broke up. It has always seemed like the two were made for each other.
But if you want to keep an economy growing but tackle the critical issue of rising emissions, then there has to be a break-up. Decoupling economic growth from rising emissions is the big challenge. 
This chart comes from a December 2015 paper, also in the journal Nature Climate Change.
The black squares show the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted for every unit of GDP. Clearly, that’s been dropping. The white circles are carbon dioxide emissions, and clearly they’ve been going up.
Success would mean both those lines heading rapidly south. The study showed that for the first time, emissions had dropped slightly while the world’s economy grew. 
So is there a break-up on the cards?
Commenting on the finding, Myles Allen, professor of geosystem science at the University of Oxford said: “Is this the beginning of the end of global warming? Probably not. But let’s hope it is the end of the beginning.”"

The Indian conglomerate was issued an environmental authority for its Carmichael mine, west of Bowen in north Queensland, by the department of environment and heritage on Tuesday.
It is one less hurdle for Adani’s highly contested plans, after its Australian chief complained last week that delays in government approvals were “incentivising” green activists to plot further legal challenges to stymie the company’s progress.
Adani still needs to obtain significant bank funding to realise its $16.5bn mine, rail and port project.
It must convince the Queensland government it has obtained “financial closure” before it will be allowed to begin dredging near Great Barrier Reef waters to expand the Abbot Point export facility.
A lull in world coal demand and moves in India to rely less on imported thermal coal have cast doubt on the future of the mine.
Adani still has to obtain a mining lease from the Queensland government.
The state land court last year recommended resources minister Anthony Lynham approve the lease after a legal challenge by conservation group Coast and Country failed to persuade the judge that the mine would have any impact on Asian coal consumption.
One of the mine site’s traditional owners has challenged native title tribunal approval of the project in the federal court, but Lynham’s office has conceded it is able to issue the mining lease before the outcome of that challenge, after earlier expressing reluctance to preempt it.
Adrian Burragubba from the Wangan and Jagalingou clan has argued the tribunal denied natural justice by favouring Adani without properly investigating its claims, including that the mine would create 4,000 jobs, when the actual figure was closer to 400.
The Australian Conservation Foundation has also lodged a federal court challenge to commonwealth approval of the project under the Environmental Protection and biodiversity Conservation Act.
The mine, which alone would cost about $4.1bn to build, would produce up to 60m tonnes of thermal coal a year for sale in Asian electricity markets, notably to Adani’s own generators in India.
The ACF alleges federal environment minister Greg Hunt failed to account for the impact of emissions from Carmichael coal, which some analysts have argued could blow the world’s “carbon budget” to keep temperature rises below the 2C limit recently agreed at the Paris climate conference.
Adani still also has to reach compensation agreements with a number of remaining stakeholders, including local governments over the project’s use of their roads.
It must also finalise Indigenous land use agreements with traditional owners of the sites for associated works including an airstrip and workers’ accommodation."

Research commissioned by objectors to the 117-mile HS2 line through the Chilterns shows that if trains were limited to 300 kilometres an hour rather than the proposed 360km/h, they could save hundreds of thousands of tonnes of CO2. Britain is committed to reducing emissions under UK law and the new Paris climate deal.
In addition, many communities along the route, which is eventually planned to reach northern England, would see a reduction in noise levels by up to 30% from up to 18 trains an hour, they say.
“The 23% energy saving achieved by reducing the maximum HS2 speed to 300km/h would translate to an equivalent saving in carbon emissions. HS2 Ltd’s own projections indicate that the HS2 scheme will give rise to a net carbon emission of 2.1 to 2.6m tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent over a 60-year period,” says the report by SLR Consulting and a team of experts, commissioned by the HS2 Action Alliance (HS2AA). 
The total emissions could be as high as 6.5m tonnes due to underestimates, claims the report, delivered to the transport select committee on Monday. 
No other country runs high-speed trains at more than 300km/h, which is now the accepted norm in China, France, Germany and Japan, the report said. 
“To run trains at 300km/h would not only save energy, but reduce costs for maintenance of rolling stock and infrastructure and provide some reduction of route construction costs. A lower top speed provides significant advantages,” the report states.
HS2 Ltd has made its economic case to government by claiming that the high-speed line will lead to a significant decrease in air, car and freight travel. But the consultants, who are independent of the communities objecting, argue that their assumptions are wrong and that the true emissions of the line could be substantially greater than government has been led to believe.
 “We believe these assumptions currently overstate the magnitude of modal shift [in transport] that will be achieved. The assumptions of HS2 are very unclear,” they say. 
Acoustic experts added that trains running at more than 300km/h make disproportionate noise because aerodynamic noise becomes more influential at this speed.
“The sound energy being produced by passing trains at 300km/h [is] actually only 25% of that produced at 360km/h. This would represent a substantial benefit. A reduction in maximum design speed to 300km/h would bring about a six decibel reduction in noise level. At speeds over that, not only are overall [noise] levels higher but acoustic screening from barriers is likely to be less effective,” says the acoustic report.
A spokesman for HS2AA said: “In 2013, transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin said cutting minutes off the journey time between London and Birmingham was ‘almost irrelevant’, saying that the route was essential for Britain’s future competitive edge. If that is correct it is hard to argue against a reduction in speed so the train runs as fast as a Train à Grande Vitesse (TGV) in France.”"

We know this, and we have known about the heat-trapping nature of these gases for over 100 years. But scientists want to know how fast the Earth is warming and how much extra energy is being added to the climate because of human activities. 
If you want to know about global warming and its future effects, you really need to answer these questions. Whether this year was hotter than last year or whether next year breaks a new record are merely one symptom of a warming world. Sure, we expect records to be broken, but they are not the most compelling evidence. 
The most compelling evidence we have that global warming is happening is that we can measure how much extra heat comes in to the Earth’s climate system each year. Think of it like a bank account. Money comes in and money goes out each month. At the end of the month, do you have more funds than at the beginning? That is the global warming analogy. Each year, do we have more or less energy in the system compared to the prior year? 
The answer to this question is clear, unassailable and unequivocal: the Earth is warming because the energy is increasing. We know this because the heat shows up in our measurements, mainly in the oceans. Indeed the oceans take up more than 92% of the extra heat. The rest goes into melting Arctic sea ice, land ice, and warming the land and atmosphere. Accordingly, to measure global warming, we have to measure ocean warming. Results for 2015 were recently published by Noaa and are available here.
A recent paper by Karina von Schuckmann and her colleagues appeared in Nature Climate Change, and provides an excellent summary of our knowledge of the energy balance of the Earth and recent advances that have been made. The article describes the complexity of the situation. The Earth is continuously gaining energy from greenhouse gases, but there are also natural fluctuations that cause both increases and decreases to the energy flows. 
For instance, volcanic eruptions may temporarily reflect some solar energy back to space. Natural variability like the El Niño/La Niña cycle can change heat flows and how deep the heat is buried in the ocean. The energy from the sun isn’t constant either; it varies on an 11-year cycle, but by less than 0.01%. With all of this and more happening, how do we know if an energy imbalance is natural or human caused? How do we separate these effects? 
The effort to separate human from natural effects is seen to be possible when one considers how the imbalance is measured in the first place. There are multiple complementary ways to make these measurements. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages and they have to be considered together.
One way is through satellites that orbit the Earth. These satellites can measure the heat entering the atmosphere and the heat leaving the system. The difference between them is the imbalance. Currently, the longest operating satellite measurement for this is from Nasa and is named Ceres (Clouds and Earth’s Radiation Energy System). The difficulty is that the energy imbalance is only about 0.1% of the actual energy flows in and out, and while the changes can be tracked, their exact values are uncertain.
Another way to measure the imbalance is to actually take the ocean’s temperature. Temperature tells us how much heat a system has. If the temperature is increasing, it means the energy within the system is increasing as well – the system is out of balance. Not only do we have to measure the ocean temperatures accurately, but there is a need to measure the temperatures year after year after year exceedingly accurately to much better than a 0.1°C margin. What really matters is how the temperature is changing over long periods of time. 
While it may sound easy to measure the oceans, it is actually quite challenging. The oceans are huge (and deep) and difficult to access. The need is for enough measurement locations at enough depths and with enough precision to get an accurate temperature. 
In recent years, we have relied upon a system of automated ocean measurement devices called the Argo fleet. These devices are scattered across the globe and they autonomously rise and sink (down to 2,000 meters) and record temperatures and salinity during their travels. Because of the Argo fleet, we know a lot more about our oceans, and this new knowledge helps us ask better questions. But the fleet could be made even better. They do not measure the bottom half of the ocean (below 2,000m depth) and they do not fully cover regions near or under ice or near shores. 
Furthermore, a 10-year trend is much too short to make long-term climate conclusions. We have to stitch Argo temperatures to other instruments, which have been measuring the oceans for decades. That stitching process has to be done carefully so that a false cooling or warming trend is not introduced.
Another way is through ocean levels. As the oceans warm, the water expands and sea levels rise. So, just by measuring the changing water levels, it is possible to assess how much heat the oceans are absorbing. The drawback to this method is that oceans are also rising because ice around with world is melting, particularly in Greenland and Antarctica. As this melted ice water flows into the oceans, it too causes sea levels to rise. So, it’s important to separate how much of ocean level rise is from heat-expansion and how much is from ice melting.
And another way is through the use of climate models, which are computer simulations of the environment. Very powerful computers are used to calculate the state of the climate at millions of locations across the globe, in both the oceans and in the atmosphere. The calculations use basic physics and thermodynamics equations to track the thermal energy at each of the locations. 
So, there are many ways to measure the Earth’s energy imbalance. While all methods are telling us the Earth has a fever, they differ in details and better synthesis of all the information is essential to improve the knowledge of what Earth’s energy imbalance is. Right now, the Earth is gaining perhaps as much as 1 Watt of heat (a Joule per second) for every square meter of surface area. Considering how large the Earth is, this is an incredible amount of heat being gained day and night year after year. This is over 1 zettaJoules (sextillion Joules) per year. 
What I like about this new paper is the recommendations for the future. Perhaps the most important recommendation is that we need to continue to make accurate measurements of the Earth’s temperatures, especially in the oceans. We need to extend those temperate measurements to deeper locations (below 2,000 m) and make measurements near shores, in the Polar Regions, underneath ice, etc. This will require a sustained funding of our measurement systems and a long-term view of the Earth’s changing climate. 
Fully understanding where the excess heat is going in the Earth system is a first step to making good predictions as to what its consequences are for the future climate and the oceans. It is an essential activity to enable planning for the future. Dr von Schuckmann summarized her work nicely when she told me, 
Advancing our capability to monitor the Earth’s Energy Imbalance means increasing our knowledge on the status of global climate change - and the global ocean plays a crucial role. A concerted multi-disciplinary and international effort is needed to improve our ability to monitor this fundamental metric defining global warming."

The call comes as experts say fires like those could be the new normal.
The Australian Conservation Foundation has called for the public inquiry as dozens of fires continue to ravage the world heritage forests and look set to burn for days or weeks to come.
“We need to ask whether or not Parks and Wildlife have adequate resources to implement a policy of actively fighting … remote area fires, especially in sensitive alpine areas,” said Jess Abrahams, an ACF campaigner.
He said fire services did an exceptional job but an inquiry was needed to look into the policies that should exist around fighting fires in remote areas and the resources that would be needed to implement them.
David Bowman from the University of Tasmania agreed an inquiry was required. 
“It’s critical,” he told Guardian Australia. He said it was important that it not seek to lay blame on anyone because the current situation was “unprecedented” and could not have been predicted.
When asked whether there would be an inquiry the Tasmanian premier, Will Hodgman, told reporters yesterday there would be “an assessment” with peer reviews done by experts from interstate.
Dozens of fires were still burning inside the world heritage forests in Tasmania, according to the Tasmanian Fire Service.
Bowman said they could continue to burn for 10 or 20 more days and were likely to be made worse by dry and warm conditions that are forecast as a high-pressure system moves through Tasmania.
Bowman said without investing in research, it was impossible to know what might have been done to avoid the devastation occurring now.
“These fires are really interesting,” he said. “They’re basically unfought and free-flowing over a landscape. Trying to reconstruct them would ... reveal clues about what sort of management would work.”
Bowman said an inquiry should examine whether controlled burning, fire breaks or roading might help. “And getting the expert firefighters to reflect on whether they could do more if they had a bigger budget.”
But right now there was almost nothing that firefighters could do, Bowman said. Many of the fires were burning in peat, which happens underground, making backburning impossible. 
“You’d have to bulldoze strips in the soil but it’s a world heritage area,” Bowman said. “If there was something simple that could be done, it would be done.”
The Australian Conservation Foundation said the inquiry should look not just into fire-fighting strategies, but also into the role of climate change in the fires, which experts say was likely to be a cause.
These fires were started by an unusual number of lightning strikes, something that could increase as a result of climate change.
And the dry conditions that led to the fires were also expected to be made more likely as a result of climate change, said Michael Grose from the CSIRO, who conducted a major study into the future climate of Tasmania. “Hotter temperatures, reduced rainfall in key seasons [and] worse fire weather, are all consistent with what is projected with climate change, particularly under a high-emission scenario,” he told Guardian Australia. 
“I’m almost certain this is the new normal,” Bowman said."

The chief executive of the national science agency, Larry Marshall, said the redundancies were in line with CSIRO’s 2020 strategy to increase collaboration with industry and boost commercialisation of science.
The former Silicon Valley entrepreneur told staff in an email obtained by Guardian Australia the agency’s research had pioneered climate models and honed their measurements “to prove climate change”.
“That question has been answered, and the new question is what do we do about it, and how can we find solutions for the climate we will be living with?”
He said job losses were in line with the agency’s 2020 strategy to transform Australian businesses, particularly the resource industry, so they could compete in “a new and uncertain future”.
“Digital technology will disrupt every Australian industry and each part of our business must reinvent itself to help Australia respond to this global challenge,” he said.
“As our business unit leaders work through the process of realigning their teams for the new strategy it is inevitable that there will be job losses.”
The worst-affected areas would be the agency’s units on manufacturing, land and water, oceans and atmosphere, and its new “data innovation hub”, Data61, he said.
“Our headcount is projected to be unchanged at the end of a two year period, but it is anticipated there could be up to 175 less CSIRO people per year during this two year transition.”
A CSIRO spokesman, Huw Morgan, confirmed that staff were being told of the changes on Thursday.
He said the changes were part of a strategic shift in the organisation towards climate change “mitigation and adaptation [and] data collection and analysis, how we can use data in science and innovation”.
Andy Pitman, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales, questioned whether the nature of climate change had been fully understood. 
“[Questions about climate change have] been answered in the same way that Galileo answered the structure of the universe when he used the first telescope,” he said.
“We have considerable confidence in how average climate will change globally and to a degree over Australia. What we don’t know is how extremes will change, how cyclones will change in intensity, how much heat waves will intensify, which are exactly what you need to know in order to adapt.”
He said the cuts would diminish Australia’s understanding of its climate. “It will lead to Australia adapting to things that won’t happen, and not adapting to things that will happen, with a much higher probability,” he said.
Pitman said that over time, a partnership between Bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO and the university sector had built a collaboration that had the capacity to guide adaptation to climate change. “That partnership is breaking up and I think that is going to be to the deep regret of governments in the future.”
CSIRO’s oceans and atmosphere flagship is a world leader on many aspects of climate science. Its staff include scientists such as Pep Cannedel, who leads the global carbon project, a major international project that tracks the carbon cycle, identifying out where carbon is produced and where it goes.
It also includes scientists such as Wenju Cai, who is among the world’s leading experts on the interaction between oceans and the atmosphere. His work has uncovered, among other things, the nature of El Niño, a climate phenomenon that redistributes rainfall around the globe.
The head of the CSIRO staff association, Sam Popovski, said he was “bewildered” by job losses “in these fundamental landmark areas of science that CSIRO’s had a world-leading reputation in”.
“The new CEO has obviously come in and developed a new strategy, which is moving the organisation towards a more commercial and digital technology focus,” he said.
“On its own, that’s not an issue, but to do that while also throwing away a lot of research that’s in the public interest seems a retrograde step.”
He said staff were sceptical that “any assurances about job numbers two years out will come to fruition”, he said.
Successive federal funding cuts, including a $115m reduction in the 2014 federal budget, have seen the agency’s staffing levels shrink by 20% in the past years, equal to around 1,400 jobs.
Guardian Australia revealed in November 2014 that science and research roles were hit hardest by the cuts.
A senior climate researcher at CSIRO told Guardian Australia that staff were “completely in the dark” about the cuts and have been getting their information from the media."

The power station on the edge of the Saharan desert will be the size of the country’s capital city by the time it is finished in 2018, and provide electricity for 1.1 million people.

Noor 1, the first section at the town of Ouarzazate, provides 160 megawatts (MW) of the ultimate 580MW capacity, helping Morocco to save hundreds of thousands of tonnes of carbon emissions per year.
“At around 2pm, the king will press a button, the parabolic mirrors will start turning, the heat will begin to turn the turbines and the plant will come to life,” said Maha el-Kadiri, a spokeswoman for Masen, Morocco’s renewable energy agency. 
King Mohammed VI will then lay the foundations for Noor 2, the next stage of the solar complex. Noor 1 had been due to open in December but was delayed by unspecified “agenda concerns,” el-Kadiri said.
After it is switched on, the plant will initially provide 650,000 local people with solar electricity from dawn until three hours after sunset. 
“It is a very, very significant project in Africa,” said Mafalda Duarte, the manager of Climate Investment Funds (CIF), which provided $435m (£300m) of the $9bn project’s funding. “Morocco is showing real leadership and bringing the cost of the technology down in the process.”
The north African country plans to generate 42% of its energy from renewables by 2020, with one-third of that total coming from solar, wind and hydropower apiece.
Morocco hopes to use the next UN climate change conference, which it hosts in November, as the springboard for an even more ambitious plan to source 52% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030.
“Between now and [the next conference], many projects will have come to light and we will prove that we can match our energy demands with renewables,” the country’s energy minister, Abdelkader Amara, said at a meeting during the Paris climate summit in December. 
Such a move would have regional implications. CIF estimates that if international banks and governments deployed another 5GW of solar energy, electricity production costs could fall by 14%. Scaling that up to 15GW would cut costs by 44%.
Some $3.9bn has been invested in the Ouarzazate solar complex, including $1bn from the German investment bank KfW, $596m from the European Investment Bank and $400m from the World Bank. 
If the dreams of its architects are realised, the resulting energy will eventually be exported north to Europe, and eastwards to Mecca, as well as providing a secure source of energy at home.
“Morocco knew their demand for electricity was growing at 7% a year and that they were dependent on imports for 97% of that energy,” Duarte said. “They had a vision to promote renewables at a time when oil prices were high and they undertook regulatory reforms, put institutions in place, and they have done a great job.” "

And you can be a part of it";"Leap day is coming up at the end of the month – remember this one?
“Thirty days hath September,April, June, and November.All the rest have thirty one,except February, on its own,which has twenty eight most times.And in a leap year, twenty nine.”
I got interested in leap years a few months ago when a group of us in Canada were trying to come up with a title for an independent political platform we had just drafted. The document – launched during our recent federal election and signed by tens of thousands of Canadians – was a roadmap to get the country completely off fossil fuels by the mid-century or sooner, in line with what many scientists are telling us we must do, and what engineers are telling us we now can do.
And we wanted to go further: the plan argues that in the process of fundamentally changing our country to make it “green”, we also have a once-in-a-century opportunity to make it fairer. We could redress terrible wrongs done to indigenous peoples; radically reduce economic, racial and gender inequalities; eliminate legal double standards for immigrant workers; and create a whole lot of stable, well-paying jobs. In very un-Canadian fashion, we even dared to hope that the manifesto might become a model for similar broad-based alliances in other countries.
The text we came up with was unabashedly radical, and it went on to be endorsed by more than 100 organisations. An array of Canadian celebrities also added their names: Leonard Cohen, Donald Sutherland and Ellen Page, among others.
Our first challenge was what to call it. We wanted to convey the need for speed, since as Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change, said recently: “Where capital goes in the next five years will decide what kind of world we have.”
One suggestion was “The Leap”. And yes, we worried about inevitable comparisons to Mao Zedong’s disastrous Great Leap Forward. But what ultimately tipped the balance in its favour was when we realised that 2016 is a leap year.
It wasn’t just good timing, we thought, but a powerful analogy. After all, we periodically add an extra day to our calendars because if we didn’t, the seasons would gradually fall out of alignment and eventually the seasons would go wacky. Imaging New Yorkers doing their Christmas shopping in T-shirts (oh right, that happened).
It was Julius Caesar, in 46BC, who decided to bring the 365-day solar calendar to the Romans, throwing in that extra day every four years. He wasn’t known as a humble man, but even a “dictator in perpetuity” realised that it was easier to change rules written by other humans than it is to change the laws of nature.
That’s a lesson worth re-learning – and fast. Like the Romans with their failing calendar, we find ourselves trapped within multiple failing systems: economic, political, even spiritual. And all these system failures have put humanity on a collision course with the planet, which warms and writhes the more we refuse to recognise its limits.
We all received a vivid reminder of this problem a couple of months ago in Paris. To much fanfare, our governments unveiled a global climate deal that pledged to keep warming levels to 2C – or better yet, 1.5C. Then many of those politicians went home to hand out new drilling leases, new pipelines, and new highways.
That’s why we chose The Leap as the name for our manifesto: the gap between where we are and where we need to be is so great, and the time so short, that small steps simply will not cut it.
With this in mind, the manifesto not only calls for a rapid shift to 100% renewable electricity, it insists that these new energy projects should be democratically controlled – and that “indigenous peoples should be first to receive public support for their own clean energy projects. So should communities currently dealing with heavy health impacts of polluting industrial activity.”
To pay for all this, we called for dramatic changes to how public revenues are collected and spent, from an end to fossil fuel subsidies, and higher royalty rates on fossil fuel extraction, to cuts in military spending. And those are just a few of its 15 demands.
The plan captured the imagination of many Canadians. Burned out by decades of fighting against what they don’t want – tar sands pipelines, exploding oil trains, draconian security bills – they seized on the chance to rally around a vision for the world they actually do want. On leap day later this month, there will be meetings, teach-ins and other events across the country, all of them pushing our new government to adopt a holistic approach to the twin crises of climate change and inequality.
And as we had hoped, it is spreading beyond our borders. Platforms partly inspired by The Leap have been launched in Denmark and across the European Union, and others are in the works in England and Australia. Even one in Nunavut. Several groups in the US are looking at drafting regional leap manifestos.
Two millennia ago, Julius Caesar realised that there was something even more powerful than his empire: the planet’s revolution around the sun. Today, we need a different kind of solar revolution, one that doesn’t just change how we generate our power, but also who benefits.
Here’s the good news: we have the momentum to make that leap – from the recent victories against Keystone XL and Shell’s Arctic drilling, to the surprising strength of Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign.
So take a minute or two to think about the extra day at the end of this month. It’s a reminder that people can indeed come together to change a failing set of rules. The laws of nature, not so much.
Then let’s make this 2016 the year we started to bridge the chasm between what is, and what must be. Let’s make it the year we started to leap.

Netflix?";"Former senior CSIRO climate scientist explains climate models in Australia were not being used to ‘prove’ climate change. That had happened long ago";"Dr Penny Whetton had spent 25 years working on climate change modelling for Australia’s premier science agency, but in 2014 it was time to go.
“I could see the writing on the wall,” says Whetton, who put up her hand to take a redundancy package in October 2014.
This week, she has heard of the anger and sadness among her former CSIRO colleagues at the news that climate change research is being targeted for cutbacks and redundancies.
Whetton still holds an Honorary Research Fellow position at the agency, where she had worked as a senior principal research scientist and one of the key people leading the CSIRO’s climate modelling work.
She is one of a very small handful of Australian scientists to have been a lead author on three consecutive Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports.
Her central role has been to use climate models to work out the implications for climate change on Australia. Whetton had also been a leader of the project to deliver the latest climate change projections across Australia, released last year.
In short, Whetton has intimate knowledge of what Australia’s climate modelling expertise is being used for.
This week’s announcement by CSIRO executive director Larry Marshall has angered many in the country’s climate science community, who have been queuing up to criticise the moves.
But beyond the implications of the announcement, there has also been much bemusement about Marshall’s statements and his apparent simplistic understanding of aspects of climate science.
If Whetton saw the writing on the wall in October 2014 then surely everyone else should have been able to see the letters scrawled metres high when Marshall was appointed that same month.
In one of his first interviews, Marshall appeared to be intrigued by water dowsing - the ancient idea that farmers could use sticks together with a mysterious unidentified perception to find water under the soil.
Former CSIRO chief of Land and Water told Science at the time that he was “appalled” by Marshall’s statements on dowsing. 
Marshall has a scientific background (he studied physics), but before taking the job at CSIRO he had spent 25 years in Silicon Valley starting tech companies and working as a venture capitalist.
In an email to staff this week, Marshall acknowledged Australia’s climate models were “among the best in the world”, saying “our measurements honed those models to prove global climate change”.
Elsewhere, Marshall has said that we “spent probably a decade trying to answer the question ‘is the climate changing’” before then suggesting that “after Paris, that question has been answered”.
There are several things wrong here. One is that the main use of CSIRO’s climate modelling work has not been to “prove” that humans are changing the climate.
Another is the frankly bizarre idea that the question of human influence on the climate was answered only three months ago at the Paris climate talks.
Dr Whetton told me: “At what point did we know with a high level of certainty that humans were changing the climate? Well, the IPCC in 2007 said human influence was unequivocal.”
While it’s true that models have been used to measure human impacts, this has not been the focus of modelling work at CSIRO. 
“The work [at CSIRO] was very much supporting climate adaptation work,” says Whetton.
“Proving global climate change? I don’t know what [Marshall] means by that. That’s settled. What needs to be further pursued are the details of regional climate change.
“The models are there to understand how the climate works but also to make projections for the future. That’s the information that you need to do appropriate adaptation planning and to calculate costs and benefits of mitigation actions.
“None of that regional climate work is settled. We need to refine our projections.”
As an example, Whetton pointed out that while there was now a lot of evidence pointing to a decline in rainfall in the south of Australia, there was “less certainty” about what would happen in the north.
The north of Australia happens to be the area where the Liberal Government has fantasised about creating new food bowls, new industries and new communities. 
Professor Steve Sherwood, the director of the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre said: “Marshall speaks of contributing to the proposed agricultural development of the Northern Territory, but we don’t know for how much longer this region will still support agriculture or even human habitation as the Earth keeps warming, nor how much drying (if any) Australia’s existing agricultural regions will experience. 
“The groups that would help provide answers are the ones he says we don’t need any more.” 
In interviews this week, Marshall has said he has been inspired by the approach taken by Netflix and its high performance culture.
Professor Samantha Hepburn, Director of the Centre for Energy and Natural Resources Law at Deakin Law School, pointed out that CSIRO was “not a technology startup” but was a “crucial agency for social and environmental progression”. 
Whetton said the reaction among her former colleagues had been “initially shock and disbelief” because many had not seen the latest announcement coming. 
“Certainly now there’s a lot of anger as well,” she said, “but we don’t know the full details yet.” 
“It is not just that people feel their jobs are under personal threat,” she said. “They can’t imagine why such an important part of scientific research to support Australia’s decision making is to be shut down. It is difficult to believe that anything like our current efforts will be maintained.
“New modelling work is being done right now. Who will do the job that CSIRO has always done in interpreting those models to understand the impacts for Australia. Where will that advice come from in the future?”
Perhaps we could ask Netflix?"

But scientist are still in the dark about who will lose their jobs; no specific scientists or programs were identified.
On Thursday Marshall sent an email announcing that 350 jobs would be lost from the CSIRO as the organisation moved away from studying how climate changes, and towards ways of mitigating or adapting to climate change.
A senior scientist from CSIRO who attended Friday’s meeting said Marshall had confirmed 110 full-time equivalent staff would be cut from the oceans and atmosphere flagship, which has roughly 130 full time-equivalent staff. Another 120 staff would be cut from the land and water flagship, and a few more from other areas. 
In the email to staff on Thursday, Marshall said that since climate change was proven to be real, CSIRO could shift its focus.
“Everybody is laughing at Marshall’s statement,” the scientist told Guardian Australia. “Who is he to declare that climate change is answered? The IPCC says so many problems are not answered yet. And unless you know how the climate is changing, how do you adapt to it?”
Then, on the ABC’s program 7.30, Marshall further defended the shift saying universities were focused on the issue.
“The 7.30 response is a con,” the scientist said. “There are a lot of thing that universities cannot do.
“Because most university research is dependent on temporary research grants, many programs the CSIRO has built over decades would be impossible to reproduce.” 
One example he gave was Cape Grim, in north-west Tasmania, where the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology run an atmospheric monitoring station, one of only three in the world to get “baseline” data from the cleanest possible air. 
“We’ve been doing that for 40 years,” he said. “Universities are not doing the carbon budget or the carbon cycle. There are a lot of capabilities that are not in universities that are in CSIRO. Unless they have a new huge injection of funds this capability would be lost. This took us 40 years to build.”
Tony Haymet has previously been the Policy Director at CSIRO and the director of the SCRIPPS Institution of Oceanography in the US, where he is now a professor. He likened Larry Marshall’s management of the CSIRO to “schoolboys playing at being managers”.
“If you are a complete failure, what you do is take one of your best divisions, shut it down, and invest in your pet project,” Haymet said. 
“That’s the coward’s way out ... The job is to raise more resources. It’s like shutting down the Australian cricket team, saying we need a lacrosse team, and spending three decades investing in that.”
He said several key capabilities will be lost from the country and the world. 
“If this was a whole of government approach, and they said we want to take this capability from the CSIRO and park it at the Bureau of Meteorology or a university, that’s fine but I’ve been told they didn’t consult with stakeholders at all,” he said.
Haymet said the cuts are “a kick in the guts” to farmers, the fishing industry, the navy and people who live on the coast and is worried about sea level rise. 
“We’ve only seen the beginning of climate change. We don’t know what the heck is waiting for us,” he said."

The German carmaker said it was still trying to establish the cost of the emissions affair, which could run into tens of billions of euros.
The company has admitted installing defeat devices in 11m vehicles to cheat diesel emissions tests. As a result, it faces the prospect of having to pay out fines and compensation to customers.
VW had been due to post results on 10 March and hold its annual meeting on 21 April.
The fallout from the scandal is also hurting sales of the company’s cars.
Sales of new VW-branded vehicles fell 14% year on year in the UK last month, reducing its market share in a country that has previously been one of the carmarker’s most successful markets.
Other brands owned by VW were also affected. Seat car sales fell 25%, while Skoda sales were down 2.4%. Audi sales, however, increased by 1.4%.
Group sales declined despite the overall new car market enjoying its strongest performance in January since 2005.
VW is yet to confirm a new date for releasing the results, but said in a statement: “Volkswagen will set a new date for the publication of the annual accounts for fiscal year 2015 due to remaining open questions and the resulting valuation calculations relating to the diesel emissions issue. 
“In this regard, Volkswagen will achieve the best possible transparent and reliable outcome for its shareholders and stakeholders.”"

The former secretary of state did so by focusing on the Vermont senator’s perceived weak spot: foreign policy.
Given that many voters seem to care a great deal about America’s role in the world, that could yet prove a fatal vulnerability.
Sanders, who polls predict will win easily in New Hampshire on Tuesday, appeared to be out of his depth when pressed about how his administration would handle foreign policy issues. 
Two particular stumbles stood out. First, when asked about the presence of US ground troops in Afghanistan, Sanders replied: “We can’t continue to do it alone.” America isn’t alone in Afghanistan, where the Nato coalition is still present; Sanders’ answer was far more relevant to US troops in Iraq. 
Second, when asked whether North Korea, Iran or Russia posed the greatest threat to the US, Sanders said Islamic State did. Pressed further, Sanders said North Korea, “because it is such an isolated country run by a handful of dictators, or maybe just one”.
Clinton’s vote for the Iraq war – when she was a senator from New York – could also leave her vulnerable but the former secretary of state was quick to shift the focus back to Sanders’ inexperience, saying: “When New Hampshire voters go on Tuesday to cast your vote, you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief.”
But does foreign policy even matter to those who were watching the debate and making up their minds?
In short, yes. It might even be fair to describe foreign policy as the defining issue of this election, if public polling from Pew Research Center is to be believed. 
In December 2011, US adults were asked about the most important issues facing the country on the eve of the 2012 election: 55% mentioned economic concerns and only 6% mentioned foreign affairs. 
When Pew offered the same options to respondents in December 2015, only 23% chose economic concerns – and 32% said foreign affairs.
More specifically, terrorism is a growing issue. In December 2014, just 1% of respondents said terrorism was the most important issue facing the country. A year later, that had risen to 18%. 
There are, however, clear partisan divides here. Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to say that Iran’s nuclear programme, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and China’s power are the top threats to national security. Democrats are almost as likely to consider global climate change a national threat as Isis.
Unless Sanders can build confidence in his ability to handle foreign policy (or convince Democrats that the economic issues which form the centerpiece of his electoral platform are the most pressing facing the country) his efforts to reach the White House may well be in trouble.
With the New Hampshire primary just three days away, a poll from CNN and WMUR published on Monday morning is particularly interesting.
The survey is based on interviews with 837 adults in New Hampshire before the Iowa caucuses and 556 adults after them. Not all the individuals questioned said they planned to vote in either party’s primary, and the margin of error on these numbers is over 5%. In other words, be cautious interpreting these numbers.
The poll suggests Sanders has not been harmed by his very narrow defeat in Iowa. The Senator could win 61% of support in New Hampshire; Clinton is backed by just 30% of possible voters. 
Those numbers are largely consistent with the averages Real Clear Politics creates across dozens of polls, which also suggest that Sanders has a 31% lead.
Another poll, from NBC/WSJ/Marist and published on Thursday, tells a slightly different story. The 2,551 adults interviewed 2-3 February gave Sanders a 20% lead on Clinton. 
Finally, a survey from the Lowell Center for Public Opinion suggests the race is even tighter, with just 15% between the two Democratic candidates. 
Among Republicans, polls published since the Iowa caucus suggest a slight dip in support for Donald Trump, but not enough to make a dent in his considerable lead in the state. An average of all polls currently suggests Trump is 17% ahead of his closest rival in the state, Marco Rubio. The Florida senator overtook Ted Cruz two days ago – a trend that might yet be reversed."

The project, which will conclude in March, will deploy resources from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and Nasa to analyze one of the strongest El Niños on record. El Niño is a periodic phenomenon in which parts of the eastern Pacific warm, causing a ripple effect for weather around the world.
Noaa’s Gulfstream IV research plane and its ship Ronald H Brown will collect data from the vast stretch of the Pacific ocean where El Niño climate events are spawned. Nasa will deploy its Global Hawk unmanned aircraft, which is able to fly at 65,000ft for 30 hours at a time. 
It is hoped that instruments dropped from aircraft, supported by weather balloons, will help improve weather forecasts and models that predict the longer-term impact of climate change. The scientists will coordinate with researchers based in Honolulu and the Pacific island of Kiribati, around 1,340 miles south of Hawaii.
“This has never been done with a major El Niño,” said Randall Dole, a senior scientist at Noaa’s Earth Sciences Research Lab. 
“A field campaign ordinarily takes years to plan and execute. But we recognized what an important opportunity we had and everyone worked hard to pull this mission together.”
Noaa said it was conducting the rapid assessment due to heightened interest over El Niño’s impact upon California, which is in the midst of a historic four-year drought. El Niño brought a slew of rain to California in December and January, prompting warnings to residents not to let their guard down in an unprecedented water conservation push.
California’s Folsom Lake, which was nearly depleted by the drought, is nearing capacity; Lake Tahoe has been replenished by around 28bn gallons of water since December. 
The precipitation has proved a boon for ski resort operators, with the water content of Sierra Nevada’s snowpack standing at 130% of normal for this time of year. Californians have also marveled at strange sightings of tropical fish, with several warm-water sea snakes washing up on the state’s beaches in recent months.
 Felicia Marcus, chair of California’s state water resources control board, said: “We are hopeful that we are turning the corner on this drought.” 
However, 64% of the state remains in extreme drought conditions, with 11 of its 12 largest water reservoirs below historical capacity averages.
While California has received some welcome rain, other parts of the US have experienced exceptionally dry and mild conditions. According to Noaa, only 5.7% of the Great Lakes’ surface was covered by ice as of 3 February, a huge drop on 2015, when 50% of the lakes’ surface was frozen.
 The impact of El Niño has perhaps been most pernicious in Africa, with Zimbabwe declaring a state of emergency this week over a drought that has ravaged much of the south of the continent. An estimated 26% of Zimbabwe’s population, around 2.4 million, are now considered food insecuytre due to dying cattle and failed crops."

Much of the money spent by big oil was targeted at a specific piece of legislation, SB-350, that would have mandated a 50% reduction in gasoline use in the state by 2030 in addition other climate change initiatives.
The bill was a marquee piece of legislation for Governor Jerry Brown and Democratic state leaders in advance of the Paris climate talks.
The oil industry targeted business-friendly Democrats in the legislature to kill the gasoline-related portion of the bill, sparking a major intra-battle in the final weeks before the vote. Ultimately, the industry was successful and the oil-related part of the bill was removed in its allowing it to pass in a weakened state with no petroleum restrictions.
“Big oil might be on the right side of the shareholder reports, but we’re on the right side of history,” said Senate leader Kevin de León, one of the key authors of SB-350, on the defeat of the oil restrictions in the bill. “Ultimately, California is going to demand that an industry which represents most of the problem has an economic and moral duty to be part of the solution.”
Recently required disclosures to the California secretary of state reveal that The Western States Petroleum Association, a trade group for the oil industry, was the state’s single largest spender when it came campaigning in the state Capitol last year, reporting $10,949,149.83 in total “payments to influence”. $6.7m of that took place in the third quarter, and an additional $1.6m was spent in the final quarter, the periods when SB-350 was hotly contested.
That was an increase over the almost $9m it spent in 2014, and $4.7m spent in 2013.
“Big Oil is the new robber barons for us in the California legislature,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. “If there is any question of this, it was confirmed in the last days of the the legislative session.”
Included in most recent filings from the trade group are meals at Spago, a restaruant in Maui, Hawaii, for nine legislators, racking up tabs of up to $182.28 each. Oil companies also lobbied individually on SB-350 and other issues. That event took place during a controversial week-long conference in Hawaii sponsored by the California Independent Voter Project that brings together California legislators with corporate event sponsors.
Chevron Corporation and subsidiaries spend nearly $4m in 2015, while on the other side of the issue, billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer’s Climate Action spent nearly $2m advocating in support of change legislation and other causes.
Despite the disclosures, the exact nature of much lobbying spending remains cloudy because it can be reported under the catch-all category of “payments to influence”, which accounted for $6.1m of the Western States spending, or 69% of the spending by the top ten lobbyists in California’s state capital, Sacramento, according FPPC information provided by Consumer Watchdog.
Those rules are changing later this year, and will require itemization of payments listed as “other”, but would not require third-party vendors to list specific activities.
“There’s still a lot they can hide through third party expenditures, but at least we’re on the right track,” said Court."

The president said his final budget on Tuesday would propose doubling clean energy research spending from $6.4bn to $12.8bn by 2020.
“Rather than subsidise the past, we should invest in the future,” Obama said in his weekly address. “That’s why the budget I will send to Congress this Tuesday will double funding for clean energy research and development by 2020.”
It was the third time in as many days that the White House has tried to use the budget to promote Obama’s climate change agenda.
On Thursday, the White House told reporters Obama would ask Congress for an oil tax of $10 a barrel to help pay for high-speed rail, electric cars, and driverless vehicles.
The move was immediately dismissed by Paul Ryan, the House speaker, as “dead on arrival”.
But Obama indicated on Saturday that he expected Congress to at least give a hearing to his proposals for doubling down on clean energy research.
“While Republicans in Congress are still considering their position on climate change, many of them realise that clean energy is an incredible source of good-paying jobs for their constituents,” Obama said in his address. 
Republicans and Democrats have been working together in recent days to pass the first bipartisan energy bill in a decade - although progress has stalled over the response to the Flint water crisis.
However, Obama said he believed there was still common ground on energy.
“That’s why we were able to boost clean energy research and development in last year’s budget agreement. And I hope they support my plan to double that kind of investment,” the president said.
The research initiative grew out of promises Obama made on the eve of the Paris climate summit when the US and other big economies pledged to ramp up $20bn in funding for clean energy research.
A parallel initiative, led by a constellation of billionaires including Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, was launched to leverage more research funding from the private sector.
The White House said in a conference call with reporters on Friday afternoon that Obama would seek more funds for research into battery storage, electric cars, and cleaner fuels. The budget will also seek substantial funding for research into nuclear reactors and carbon capture and storage technology – both technologies favoured by Republicans. 
Tuesday’s budget is one of the last remaining opportunities left to Obama to shape the environmental agenda.
In the coming months, the White House expects the Republican-controlled Congress to try to cut the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency, and so undermine its ability to enforce his signature achievements such as new rules cutting carbon emissions from power plants. 
The White House also expects skirmishes over the Green Climate Fund, which was set up under the UN talks to try to help poor countries switch to cleaner fuels and protect their people against climate change."

As the letter circulates building signatures, Australian scientists gathering at the country’s largest climate conference in Melbourne made a similar call.
The proposed cuts will see up to 350 jobs go at the national science agency in the next two years and are expected to affect climate change research with most of the jobs going from the CSIRO’s oceans and Antarctica climate monitoring divisions.
Jean Palutikof, who is director of national climate change adaptation research facility at Griffith University, said the CSIRO strategy of focusing on how Asutralia should adapt to and mitigate climate change, without studying what those changes were, was illogical. 
“Headless chickens comes to mind,” said Palutikof, who has worked with the UN on climate change adaptation. “How can you understand what you have to do if you don’t understand what you’re adapting to?”
The letter signed by international scientists says the cuts will make the targets agreed to in Paris in December harder to achieve. It cites article 7.7.c of the Paris Accord, which directly calls for strengthening of scientific knowledge of climate change.
“CSIRO’s decision to slash climate research capacity will severely curtail Australia’s capacity to deliver on key promises of the Paris agreement,” the letter says.
It suggests the cuts will cost Australian society. “The societal benefits of climate science will far outweigh the likely high costs of reacting to future climate change instead of strategically planning for it.”
It argues that cancelling CSIRO’s climate modelling work would end up costing the economy. “Without committing to the development of next generation climate modelling and climate monitoring, billions of dollars of public investment on long term infrastructure will be based on guesswork rather than on strategic and informed science-driven policy.”
The letter says that if the CSIRO does proceed with the cuts, then the country urgently needs to find a new home for the capabilities that will be lost. “If these climate science research cuts at CSIRO proceed without being filled elsewhere, then Australia will not develop its capability to assess the accelerating risks associated with climate change.”
Dave Schimel, chief adviser on carbon cycle science at NASA’s jet propulsion lab in California, was outraged by the cuts. “This is a national treasure for Australia,” he said. “From the perspective of an international scientist with a 30 year history of collaboration, this is a little like selling off the Library of Congress or the British Museum.
“Historically, there have been two groups that have really been the heart and soul of climate science on the planet. This is one of them ... the international carbon community right now is in shock.” 
As the joint conference of the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society and the Australian Research Council’s centre of excellence for climate system science began in Melbourne on Monday, scientists were meeting to register their disappointment in the cuts.
“We’re hopeful that this capacity stays in Australia,” said Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick from the University of New South Wales, who helped to organise the protest. “The universities can’t pick that up, the bureau [of meteorology] can’t pick that up. So if worst comes to worst ... the next case is having the capacity in a different type of organisation... I’m not sure how that could happen.”
More than 200 scientists donned arm-bands the blue of the CSIRO logo on Monday and staged a protest outside the conference in Melbourne on Monday to object to the cuts.
Dr Peter Stott, who leads the Climate Monitoring and Attribution team at the UK Met Office, said the cuts would have a global impact. 
“It is very concerning that such a decision could be made because it shows a lack of understanding of what you need to do to get the information we need to mitigate or react to climate change,” Stott said. 
Stott said the suggestion by CSIRO chief executive Larry Marshall that the science of climate change was “settled” was “totally wrong.”
 “What we need to know now is how do we manage climate change,” Stott said. 
Melbourne University’s Professor David Karoly, who was one of the authors of the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 and is a Climate Change Authority board member, said the cuts “directly impact Australia’s ability to meet its obligations under the Paris Accord”.
Karoly said that Australia could not fulfil those obligations without the work of the CSIRO unless there was a significant investment in other organisations, such as the Bureau of Meteorology, to allow them to take over the work.
Dr John Church, a CSIRO research fellow, said that the CSIRO had shirked its duty to the Australian people in announcing these cuts and that the only option was for another research organisation to step in.
“This is a decision to cease all climate change research at CSIRO,” Church said, later clarifying by saying that an 80% cut to climate change research jobs was effectively ceasing all research.
“This is are where the Australian people need active and ongoing science research into the future.”
Prof Roger Jones, research fellow with the Victoria Institute of Strategic Studies and another IPCC author, said that the cuts would amount to losing 2,000 years of experience from climate change research in Australia.
“We know from recent events around Australia that we can experience significant shifts in climate in short periods of time,” he said. “Understanding how these shifts come about could be worth billions of dollars to Australia.”"

It was on this date in 2009 that Melbourne endured its hottest conditions on record – a sweltering 46.4C. 
To make matters worse, hot winds blasted through the region at speeds in excess of 100km/h. In Kilmore East, just north of Melbourne, a critical failure in a 43-year-old power line caused bursts of 5000C plasma to arc out and ignite the tinder-dry vegetation in the gully below.
Fanned by such extreme winds, the fast-growing inferno would by the end of the day be responsible for the majority of the 173 lives lost in the dozens of fires that engulfed Victoria on Black Saturday, Australia’s worst bushfire disaster.
Several of the other blazes that day were started by felled power poles and other electrical issues. This was also the case for many other fires before and since, including Australia’s previous-worst bushfire tragedy, the 1983 Ash Wednesday fires, which claimed 75 lives.
Richard Turner, director of South Australian renewable energy powerhouse Zen Energy, has a plan to stop such a thing happening again.
The 51-year-old entrepreneur is on a mission to replace ageing statewide energy infrastructure with community microgrids of rooftop solar and increasingly affordable battery storage systems. Although there are significant challenges in taking people off the grid, he sees areas hit by bushfires as the best place to start.
Turner argues statewide energy systems are inefficient at the best of times, but that in fire danger areas, the case for switching to localised solar-and-storage is particularly compelling in both a safety and economic sense.
“Fundamentally climate change is moving us towards more and more extreme summers and more bushfires,” he says.
“Utility companies have been hit with some huge class action suits over recent years over fires, and in response they are shutting down power lines [on bushfire risk days] earlier and for longer, leaving communities without power for significant periods.”
In 2014 Black Saturday bushfire victims secured an Australian-record $494.7m payout from power distributor SP AusNet asset managers Utility Services Group and the Department of Sustainability and Environment, and regulators are keen to avoid a repeat.
Climate change is moving us towards more and more extreme summers and more bushfires
Turner notes that turning off the power during the sweltering heat of bushfire risk days isn’t just uncomfortable for those affected, but potentially dangerous given people often rely on electricity to power the devices that alert them to bushfire danger and the water pumps used to defend their home.
Up against the companies invested in preserving the status quo in the energy network as well as next-generation competitors in the battery-storage area such as American giant Tesla – which has just entered the Australian market – Zen Energy is busily presenting its case around the country.
Turner says his company has been in productive talks with Victorian energy minister Lily D’Ambrosio over the prospect of subsidising Zen Energy systems capable of running as a localised backup for periods when the grid needs to be switched off.
“They’ve committed to act on this but being government, it will take time,” he says. 
Zen Energy is also trying to get in on the action in Western Australia, where company chairman and former federal government climate advisor Ross Garnaut has, according to Turner, been in discussions with state authorities regarding distributed power systems.
D’Ambrosio’s counterpart in Western Australia, energy minister Mike Nahan, has signalled that grid operator Western Power is considering going a step further than Victoria’s plans.
In Australian ecosystems, bushfires have long played a crucial role in burning through established vegetation to clear the way for new growth, and Western Australia is taking the same view of the energy infrastructure wiped out by the Yarloop bushfires in January – don’t replace what was there before, but rather introduce the energy systems of the 21st century.
The cost of the rebuild of the energy infrastructure network from those fires has been estimated at $26m following the destruction of 873 power poles, 77 transmission poles, 44 transformers and up to 50 kilometres of overhead power lines.
In some of the affected areas, Western Power is investigating the viability of solar-and-storage not just as a backup, but as a standalone system without links to the grid.
Other options being implemented by Australian state governments to fireproof their energy systems include undergrounding power lines or outfitting networks with rapid earth fault current limiters (REFCL). 
Lu Aye, associate professor in the department of infrastructure engineering at the University of Melbourne, notes however that the cost of maintaining an ageing infrastructure grid will only get worse.
 “Smaller distributed power systems, from a cost and safety perspective, are in many ways the better option,” he says. 
That’s without even factoring in the bigger picture. 
When it comes to bushfires, the most significant benefit of switching over to green energy solar-and-storage systems is not the mitigation of today’s risks, but the reduction of carbon emissions and thus the frequency and severity of such disasters in the future. 
After all, as any firefighter worth their salt will attest, the best way to deal with bushfires is to take decisive action early, before things get out of control."

But let’s pause from the hyperventilation of the past week and ask whether there is an underlying logic.
Could the shift from studying how climate changes, to studying ways of mitigating and adapting to climate change, be a good thing?
The CSIRO’s chief executive, Larry Marshall, who is responsible for the decision, has deployed several arguments in defending the move. Let’s take a look at them one by one.
Marshall’s first justification for the shift, as laid out in an email to staff, pointed out that the question of whether climate change was real had been answered. So it was time to move on. He said:
Our climate models ... [proved] global climate change. That question has been answered, and the new question is what do we do about it and how can we find solutions for the climate we will be living with?
At the UN climate change conference in Paris last year, the world agreed to try to limit global warming to 2C, or maybe even 1.5C. Of course, it looks as though the world will probably warm by much more than that.
Marshall is right that we need to invest in adaptation to these very significant and inevitable changes.
But adapting to climate change will require a proper understanding of how the climate will change. 
Humans know how to live in different climates – they are nothing if not adaptable. There is nothing mysterious about how to live in a new climate.
But the one thing that makes adaptation really difficult is uncertainty. If you don’t know what the climate will be like in the future – whether it will be wetter or dryer, whether cyclones will be more or less frequent – then you can’t prepare.
You cannot adapt for a future that you don’t understand.
And our uncertainty in how the climate will change is very significant. In 2014, nearly 1,000 of the world’s top climate scientists produced the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. One third of the report – working group two – is all about adaptation. This is the best statement of what we know about how climate change will impact on people and how we should adapt. And the central message of that chapter is that we simply do not know how the climate is going to change in many cases.
We have some idea about how much the average temperature across the surface of the Earth will change. But, as Andy Pitman from the University of New South Wales, tells Guardian Australia:
What we don’t know is, over Australia, what the detailed pattern of rainfall change will be, how extremes will change, how much cyclones will intensify, how much heatwaves will intensify and a whole range of other things that are precisely what you need to know in order to adapt. And the closing down of Australia’s climate modelling capacity leaves Australia hopelessly exposed to the range of climate impacts we are likely to experience.
Adapting to different climates isn’t the problem. The problem is that we don’t know what those climates will be.
When challenged with the above concerns, Marshall argues that the CSIRO isn’t needed to do that work because universities are now doing it. On the ABC’s 7.30 program, he said:
The good news is most of the universities in this country and around the world have become really good in that area. We’ve disseminated, for example, our unique climate models and shared them with those universities and with the Bureau of Meteorology.
But experts in the field say that argument doesn’t hold up.
Universities are not the same sort of institution as the CSIRO and there is a difference in the sort of projects they are capable of doing.
As Pitman explains, university research is funded by grants, which last for a few years, and so cannot do some of the long-term monitoring and modelling that the CSIRO has done over several decades:
A climate model is the fundamental enabling tool that one needs. It’s a million lines of computer code that runs on the biggest supercomputers in the world. Someone has to be the custodian of that code and it has to be someone with permanency in the Australian system ... No individual university could hope to be the long-term custodian of a climate model because it’s impossible to guarantee the [continued] funding necessary by any of the competitive grants that universities have access to.
Besides spending three decades developing the capability to model future climates, the CSIRO has, for decades, been key in running one of only three “baseline” atmospheric measuring stations, at Cape Grim in Tasmania. When we heard last year that the world had passed a new milestone of carbon dioxide concentrations, it was, to a significant extent, based on data from Cape Grim and two other stations, both in the northern hemisphere.
David Karoly from the University of Melbourne says it’s also hard for university researchers to get funding for work that helps specific communities. He says competitive grants for academics prioritise projects that answer questions of global significance, which would leave projects like the CSIRO’s Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator, which provides better forecasting of fire, cyclones and floods across Australia.
The loss of these capabilities will impact most Australian industries, says Tony Haymet, previously a policy director at the CSIRO and a director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the US:
Australian farmers and the fishing industry, the Royal Australian Navy, anyone who lives on the coast and worries about erosion or sea level rise, this is a kick in the guts to them because there are so many stakeholders and users of this CSIRO capability who not only need it now but are going to need it more in the next 30 years.
One of Marshall’s motivations seems to be that the CSIRO should be more like the start-ups, which he would have been accustomed to as a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley. In his letter to staff, he said:
In Australia we worry a lot about failure and spend too much time analysing rather than doing. Start-ups work faster because they dare to try new things and measure in real time whether they are working, and they are not afraid to change or pivot to deliver the best outcome. We must not be paralysed by our past.
As Marshall hints at, start-ups are built to fail. And the vast majority of them do – up to 90% . Like with natural selection, failure is part of what makes start-ups, in toto, so successful: only the best survive.
The calculation that makes failure OK for start-ups is that their failure costs relatively little but success has a huge payoff. So the risk is worth it.
The CSIRO, however, is different. This year will be the 100th anniversary of the CSIRO, or at least of the body that eventually grew into the CSIRO. And, despite cuts to its budget, it costs more than a $1bn a year.
Far from anything like a start-up, Dave Schimel, the chief adviser on carbon cycle science at NASA’s jet propulsion lab in California, has described the CSIRO as “a national treasure”. 
This group is one of only three or four groups in the world that enable this kind of work to happen ... This is a national treasure. From the perspective of an international scientist with a 30 year history of collaboration, this is a little like selling off the library of Congress or the British Museum.
In that context, others point out that “pivoting” – as start-ups do – doesn’t make sense. Haymet said:

Proposals being debated in Montreal by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the United Nations’ aviation agency, would force makers of the world’s largest passenger jets to upgrade or stop producing certain models as early as 2023, according to sources close to the negotiations and documents seen by Reuters. 
US and European negotiators are trying to come up with the world’s first carbon dioxide emissions standards for aircraft as part of the industry’s contribution to efforts to combat climate change. 
Aviation was not included in the global climate deal agreed by a UN conference in Paris in December, but ICAO is trying to nail down the first of its two-part strategy as soon as Monday after six years of talks. It is due to finalize a market-based mechanism for all airlines later this year. 
Differences remain on where to place the bar on efficiency, with the United States and Canada pushing for more stringent targets than the European Union, while environmental groups have accused Europe of dragging its feet. 
“The CO2 standard will push industry to be as fuel-efficient as possible in all market conditions to reduce GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions and the impact of aviation on climate change,” stated the Canadian paper presented at ICAO last week. 
The proposals could revive pressure on European planemaker Airbus to upgrade the world’s largest passenger jet, the A380 superjumbo, with new engines. Airbus recently examined that proposal to boost sales, but it has dropped down its list of priorities. 
It could also spell the end for Boeing’s struggling 747-8 passenger jet and freighter and force the U.S. planemaker to upgrade at least one of its two smaller freighters. Airbus and Boeing declined to comment on negotiations.
The Montreal talks, which run until 12 February, are designed to set ambitious rules for new types of aircraft in the future. A less stringent standard would apply to aircraft already in production, but this has led to the fiercest arguments since some of these planes would need to have costly improvements. 
The fuel efficiency standards would apply to smaller business and regional jets, along with larger commercial planes weighing at least 60 tonnes that account for the majority of aviation sector emissions, two sources familiar with the matter said. 
The rules for in-production aircraft would come into effect by 2023, but could also be phased in over a five-year period until 2028, one source said. The tougher standard for new designs could go into effect by 2020. 
Participants have been weighing 10 different options for new targets, with one being the weakest and 10 requiring the greatest reduction in emissions, the documents seen by Reuters showed. 
European representatives have said they will not back a standard higher than 6 on large planes in production. The United States and Canada had initially backed options 8 and 9 but said they would not budge below a 7, and at one stage did not rule out breaking off talks, the sources said. 
However, on Sunday some progress was reported in narrowing differences. Tougher standards have higher cost implications for planemakers. 
While Airbus and Boeing have already planned more fuel-efficient upgrades to most of their programmes, including the popular A320 and B737, some jets would have to be upgraded or cease being produced by as early as 2023. “They’re not content,” one delegate said of the jetmakers. 
A question mark remained over the current-generation wide-body jets produced by Airbus and Boeing, the A330 and 777-300ER. Both are likely to be superseded by new models before 2023, but aviation analysts have said recent market experience and low oil prices suggest demand for older jets can be resilient. 
Environmental groups said the standard will boost efficiency, but it will only make a small dent on the industry’s greenhouse gas emissions, which are projected to triple or quadruple from current levels by 2040. They say the standard needs to be accompanied by a strong global market-based approach. "

However, a new study has found that the adjustments NOAA makes to the raw temperature data bring them closer to measurements from a reference network of pristinely-located temperature stations.
Before delving into the new study, it’s worthwhile to revisit the temperature adjustments that Lamar Smith disputes. Volunteers have been logging measurements from weather stations around the world for over 150 years, and climate scientists use that data to estimate the Earth’s average surface temperature. But over a 150-year period, things change, as the authors of this study explain.
Stations have moved to different locations over the past 150 years, most more than once. They have changed instruments from mercury thermometers to electronic sensors, and have changed the time they take temperature measurements from afternoon to morning. Cities have grown up around stations, and some weather stations are not ideally located. All of these issues introduce inconsistencies into the temperature record.
To find out how much actual temperatures have changed, scientists have to filter out these changes in the way the measurements were taken. Those are the adjustments under attack from Lamar Smith. They’re important, scientifically justified, and documented in the peer-reviewed literature.
Scientists make adjustments to account for changes in the way both land and ocean temperature measurements have been made over the past 150 years. The ocean adjustments make the biggest difference, and in fact they actually reduce the measured amount of global surface warming over the past century, as compared to the raw data. Thus you would think contrarians like Lamar Smith would appreciate these adjustments; however, over the past couple of decades, they act to very slightly increase the overall global surface warming trend.
Climate contrarians who oppose taking action to slow global warming have focused their arguments on the past 18 years, during which time the warming of surface temperatures temporarily slowed down (it’s now speeding back up). The latest version of the NOAA method to adjust the temperatures made the slowdown a little smaller, and that didn’t sit well with those contrarians. 
Lamar Smith soon began making conspiratorial accusations and demanding NOAA scientists’ emails. Last week, he convened a hearing in the House Science Committee and claimed, with no supporting evidence or basis in reality,
An example of how this administration promotes its suspect climate agenda can be seen at the National Oceanographic [sic] and Atmospheric Administration. Its employees altered historical climate data to get politically correct results in an attempt to disprove the eighteen year lack of global temperature increases.
NOAA conveniently issued its news release that promotes this report just as the administration announced its extensive climate change regulations.
The new study published in Geophysical Research Letters by Zeke Hausfather of Berkeley Earth, Kevin Cowtan at the University of York, and Matthew Menne and Claude Williams Jr. at NOAA, set out to test how well the adjustments are working. Contrarians’ biggest complaints focus on urban heat sources near land temperature stations, and scientists’ adjustments to remove that urban heat contamination.
To check how well those particular adjustments work, NOAA set up a network of pristinely located temperature stations across the USA that they could use as a reference. The authors of the study explain:
To help resolve uncertainties caused by reliance on the historical network, NOAA began setting up a U.S. Climate Reference Network starting in 2001. The Climate Reference Network includes 114 stations spaced throughout the U.S. that are well sited and away from cities. They have three temperature sensors that measure every two seconds and automatically send in data via satellite uplink. The reference network is intended to give us a good sense of changes in temperatures going forward, largely free from the issues that plagued the historical network.
With more than a decade’s worth of this pristine reference data available, the study authors were able to compare it to the raw and adjusted data. The US land temperature adjustments have the biggest impact on the trend from the 1950s to 1990s, because that’s when there were changes in the time of day at which the measurements were recorded, and in the technology used to take the temperatures. 
The authors found the adjustments don’t have any significant effect on the average temperature or warming trend since 2004. Lead author Zeke Hausfather explained,
Over the last decade there are plenty of issues with the raw data, but they tend to roughly cancel out in their trend effects.
The study showed that the averaged raw and adjusted US land temperature data are both very close to the pristine reference data during that period of 2004–2015. 
However, while they don’t have much effect on the average US land temperature trend since 2004, the authors found that the adjustments bring the data from individual stations closer to their nearby pristine reference measurements.
In short, NOAA’s adjustments are doing what they’re supposed to do – removing biases in the raw data to make it more accurately reflect the true temperature changes at each measurement station. As lead author Zeke Hausfather told me,
NOAA’s necessary corrections to biases in temperature data have come under a lot of poorly informed criticism in the past few months. Our new study as well as a great deal of prior research shows that adjustments to temperature stations are effective at removing biases introduced by station moves, instrument changes, and other factors. The fact that adjustments make the old historical network more similar to the new Climate Reference Network strongly suggests that they are getting it right.
Conspiracy theories are strongly linked to science denial, but as is usually the case, this particular conspiracy theory has no basis in reality. "

Even if global warming is capped at governments’ target of 2C - which is already seen as difficult - 20% of the world’s population will eventually have to migrate away from coasts swamped by rising oceans. Cities including New York, London, Rio de Janeiro, Cairo, Calcutta, Jakarta and Shanghai would all be submerged.
“Much of the carbon we are putting in the air from burning fossil fuels will stay there for thousands of years,” said Prof Peter Clark, at Oregon State University in the US and who led the new work. “People need to understand that the effects of climate change won’t go away, at least not for thousands of generations.”
“The long-term view sends the chilling message of what the real risks and consequences are of the fossil fuel era,” said Prof Thomas Stocker, at the University of Bern, Switzerland and also part of the research team. “It will commit us to massive adaptation efforts so that for many, dislocation and migration becomes the only option.”
The report, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, notes most research looks at the impacts of global warming by 2100 and so misses one of the biggest consequences for civilisation - the long-term melting of polar ice caps and sea-level rise. 
This is because the great ice sheets take thousand of years to react fully to higher temperatures. The researchers say this long-term view raises moral questions about the kind of environment being passed down to future generations.
The research shows that even with climate change limited to 2C by tough emissions cuts, sea level would rise by 25 metres over the next 2,000 years or so and remain there for at least 10,000 years - twice as long as human history. If today’s burning of coal, oil and gas is not curbed, the sea would rise by 50m, completely changing the map of the world.
“We can’t keep building seawalls that are 25m high,” said Clark. “Entire populations of cities will eventually have to move.”
By far the greatest contributor to the sea level rise - about 80% - would be the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet. Another new study in Nature Climate Change published on Monday reveals that some large Antarctic ice sheets are dangerously close to losing the sea ice shelves that hold back their flow into the ocean.
Huge floating sea ice shelves around Antarctica provide buttresses for the glaciers and ice sheets on the continent. But when they are lost to melting, as happened the with Larsen B shelf in 2002, the speed of flow into the ocean can increase eightfold.
Johannes Fürst, at the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg in Germany and colleagues, calculated that just 5% of the ice shelf in the Bellingshausen Sea and 7% in the Amundsen Sea can be lost before their buttressing effect vanishes. “This is worrying because it is in these regions that we have observed the highest rates of ice-shelf thinning over the past two decades,” he said.
Avoiding the long-term swamping of many of the world’s greatest cities is already difficult, given the amount carbon dioxide already released into the atmosphere. “Sea-level rise is already baked into the system,” said Prof Stocker, one of the world’s leading climate scientists.
However, the rise could be reduced and delayed if carbon is removed from the atmosphere in the future, he said: “If you are very optimistic and think we will be in the position by 2050 or 2070 to have a global scale carbon removal scheme - which sounds very science fiction - you could pump down CO2 levels. But there is no indication that this is technically possible.” A further difficulty is the large amount of heat and CO2 already stored in the oceans.
Prof Stocker said: “The actions of the next 30 years are absolutely crucial for putting us on a path that avoids the [worst] outcomes and ensuring, at least in the next 200 years, the impacts are limited and give us time to adapt.”
The researchers argue that a new industrial revolution is required to deliver a global energy system that emits no carbon at all. They conclude: “The success of the [UN climate summit in] Paris meeting, and of every future meeting, must be evaluated not only by levels of national commitments, but also by looking at how they will lead ultimately to the point when zero-carbon energy systems become the obvious choice for everyone.”
“We are making choices that will affect our grandchildren’s grandchildren and beyond,” said Prof Daniel Schrag, at Harvard University in the US. “We need to think carefully about the long timescales of what we are unleashing.”"

The global initiative was a first attempt to halt carbon emissions from air travel – one of the fastest growing sources of climate pollution.
In a call with reporters, White House officials described the standards as “a huge deal”, noting that the aviation authority has also proposed an aspirational goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2020.
But campaign groups, specifically the International Council on Clean Transportation, said the proposed standards were a missed opportunity and would have little real effect in curbing emissions.
The standards proposed at an expert meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (Icao) in Montreal would apply to all new commercial and business aircraft delivered after 1 January 2028. 
But they exclude aircraft that are already in use, and as most airlines have lifetimes of 20-30 years, it will take decades to cover the current fleet. 
In addition, the standards would on average require only a 4% reduction in the cruise fuel consumption of new aircraft, compared to 2015.
The proposals will be put to countries for formal adoption next year.
Icao said the standard was aimed at larger aircraft, which were responsible for the vast majority of global aviation emissions.
“The goal of this process is ultimately to ensure that when the next generation of aircraft types enter service, there will be guaranteed reductions in international CO2 emissions,” Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, president of the Icao council said.
“We also recognize that the projected doubling of global passengers and flights by 2030 must be managed responsibly and sustainably.”
The exclusion of high-polluting industries such as international aviation and shipping was seen as a major weakness of the historic agreement reached last December.
Currently, air travel and shipping together account for about 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but are projected to account for about 30% by 2050. But emerging economies had balked at the idea of including shipping and aviation in the Paris agreement, and so negotiators left them out of the deal.
White House officials said they were satisfied with the proposed standard – given the range of countries’ positions. The European Union and some emerging economics had been reluctant to take stronger action. “This is a really a strong result,” the officials said. “It’s the first ever CO2 standards for aircraft covering existing aircraft.”
But campaign groups suggested the Icao recommendations would do very little to rein in emissions – and in some cases lagged behind technology that was already in use.
According to an analysis by the International Council on Clean Transportation, some of the top performing commercial aircraft were already achieving the standard – with room to spare. By 2020, eight years before the proposed standards were even due to come into effect, the average aircraft would already be 10% more efficient than the Icao standard.
“Given the substantial lead time for the standards, along with anticipated fuel efficiency gains for new aircraft types already in development by manufacturers, the standards will serve primarily to prevent backsliding in emissions,” ICCT said in a statement. “Additional action would be required for the standard to reduce emissions below business as usual.”
Vera Pardee, an attorney for the Centre for Biological Diversity, said the proposed standard put an additional burden on the Obama administration to make good on earlier promises to cut aviation emissions.
The Environmental Protection Agency had been waiting for Icao to bring in its standards before moving to cut emissions from the domestic airline industry. 
However, the White House would not say whether the EPA would propose those new domestic standards before Barack Obama leaves the White House."

It is time the BMA found an alternative for the term 'junior doctor' for any doctor in hospital under consultant level

What keeps me up and night and I think what keeps most of the country up at night is what are we going to do about it? How are we going to mitigate it?” – CSIRO chief executive Larry Marshall, ABC’s 7.30, February 4
Perversely, I’m pleased CSIRO chief Larry Marshall is lying in bed worrying about how to mitigate the effects of climate change. I’m only glad he’s not a farmer like me, because I doubt he’d cope.
 Standing in the paddocks of my Gippsland dairy farm, I guess I have an advantage over Marshall because it’s here that the rubber of climate change adaptation hits the road. 
 This is one of the worst seasons on record around here and the only thing that has made it survivable has been good, early planning.
 We sold 10% of our cows and planted turnips for summer feed almost two months earlier than usual to eke out moisture deep in the soil. We pushed bloody hard to get an irrigator up and running so we could offer the cows a lush oasis of millet with water from our farm dam.
 Most importantly, we were quick to speak with our bank manager and buy hundreds of tonnes of extra hay and silage. It was not a pretty plan. It was a survival plan in the teeth of a failed season and a milk price that is below our break-even point.
 We are still a long way from next Spring but the survival plan is getting us through. I can’t imagine how we would have managed without it.
 Central to our planning were the CSIRO’s soil moisture maps and Pastures from Space. Combining the two tools, we could see that not only were our pastures not growing in the peak of Spring, there was little chance they could. The soil was powder dry all the way down to a couple of metres. That can only be fixed by weeks and weeks of rain.
 In other words, we knew we were stuffed early enough to do something about it, thanks to the CSIRO. It’s survivable if we plan early, plan well and it doesn’t happen too regularly.
 Still raw with the discomfort of this experience, I was gobsmacked to hear Larry Marshall say the climate change question has been answered; I realised he’d never make a farmer.
 The big question for me looms large: how common will this type of season be in the future? 
 The climate modelling is neither detailed or accurate. All we know is that, since I was a little girl in the 70s, it’s been getting steadily drier around here and the scientists say it will continue to become drier, warmer and increasingly unpredictable. That’s nowhere near enough information to make good decisions.
 To be frank, we don’t even have a worthwhile forecast for the next fortnight or the three months ahead. The Bureau of Meteorology’s oft-reported seasonal outlook is so unreliable here, it is literally as credible as tossing a coin. 
 I guess farmers are used to running blind into the next season and getting through when things don’t pan out well, but a long term climate shift is not something you can manage by buying in extra hay. 
 If this type of season begins to roll around every five to 10 years rather than every 20 to 50, it’s no longer going to be viable to keep doing what we’re doing. And it takes years to reshape a farm. I need to know whether we should be working towards farming cows, canola or cacti sooner rather than later.
 Farmers are innovators by nature. Rather than simply howling to the wind when it’s all too late, I will do something about it. What, for sure, I don’t know. Cuts to the CSIRO’s climate and land and water divisions will make finding the answers – and making milk Australian families can afford – ever more difficult."

In a release posted to the CSIRO website titled “Correcting the public record on changes at CSIRO”, Marshall took issue with reports about the proportion of staff in the oceans and atmosphere unit that would be cut and sought to calm concerns about the survival of particular research programs.
“In our oceans and atmosphere business we have about 420 staff, not 140 as reported by some media, and after these changes we expect to have about 355, contrary to media reports,” Marshall said.
A senior researcher in the oceans and atmosphere business told Guardian Australia it was true there were 420 staff across the whole unit but, in the two divisions that studied climate change, there were only about 140 full-time equivalent staff. 
He said the oceans and atmosphere unit had two programs that researched climate change: “Assessing our climate” and “Oceans and climate”. 
“[Marshall] clearly said climate would be cut so it must be from those programs,” the researcher said.
Marshall also emphasised there would be no net loss of staff at the CSIRO over a two-year period.
The CSIRO Staff Association has lodged a formal dispute with management over the job losses, claiming CSIRO management has breached their enterprise agreement by failing to consult with staff over changes that could impact on their jobs. In a letter to management, the association asks for the changes to be suspended and for more details to be shared with the staff.
A spokesman for the association said a meeting of members next week would consider industrial action. Since a new enterprise agreement is currently being negotiated, industrial action would be protected under the Fair Work Act. 
“Without pre-empting any decision our council might make, I feel as though we will probably go on a more aggressive footing when dealing with management now,” he said.
Marshall’s statement indicated the climate models that CSIRO runs would be moved to another institution. 
“Our climate models have long been and will continue to be available to any researcher and we will work with our stakeholders to develop a transition plan to achieve this,” he said.
But Andy Pitman, the director of the ARC centre of excellence for climate system science at the University of NSW, said there was no way a university could take on that responsibility.
“I mean I run a centre of excellence which is the the best-funded university capability in the country and we do not remotely have the capability to be the custodians for the climate modelling systems,” Pitman said. “We live and breathe on a three-year funding cycle with an 80% failure rate. You cannot run a national capability in that environment.”
Marshall also reassured the public about the future of the Cape Grim atmospheric modelling station, saying “it is not under threat from the changes”.
Guardian Australia has sought further clarification from Marshall.
A draft letter to the government from international climate scientists has gathered more than 2,100 signatures and a section of the World Meteorological Organisation has issued a statement condemning the cuts.
Paul Durack, of the Lawrence Livermore national laboratory in the US, has been collecting signatures from international climate scientists for an open letter to the Australian government calling for the CSIRO capabilities threatened by the cuts to be saved.
On Monday night the World Climate Research Program put out a strongly worded statement against the cuts. 
“We read that these cuts occur in the name of innovation,” it said. “One can hardly imagine a worse and more backward step toward any of those laudable goals than ignoring climate and discarding climate research.”"

Climate change, retreating summer ice and the prospect of shorter journey times and 40% lower fuel costs has led Russia, European governments and some industries to expect a major ice-free shipping lane to open above Russia, allowing regular, year-long trade between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans within a few years.
But, says the Copenhagen Business School in a new paper, low bunker fuel prices, a short sailing season and continuing treacherous ice conditions in the Arctic even in summer months means it could be 2040 at the earliest before it is commercially viable for ordinary merchant ships to pass through what is known as the northern sea route.
Until then it will remain cheaper to send trade between Europe and the east via the Suez canal, it says.
The conclusions of the report were backed this month by the powerful Danish Shipowners’ Association, which includes 40 major shipping companies such as Maersk, the world’s largest. Denmark has the eighth largest fleet in the world and would stand to gain the most in Europe if the northern sea route opened.
“We have gone from hyper-optimism to total realism. The world economy was developed on the basis of a high oil price. The northern sea route seemed viable [a few years ago] but now it’s not the case. The route has vast potential but it will take a long time to open up,” said Anne H. Steffensen, director of the association at a meeting of Arctic country ministers and industry in Tromsø.
Russia has tried to open up the Arctic to international traffic by offering icebreaker service and better port facilities. But cargo in transit along the northern sea route dropped from 1.3m tonnes in 2013 to 300,000 tonnes in 2014. Last year only 100,000 tonnes was transported between Asia and Europe on the route. However, there was a big rise in the number of vessels going to and from Russian Arctic ports.
The Copenhagen Business School report, which compares the costs of building ice-reinforced ships suitable for the northern sea route, to existing costs of using the Suez canal, includes fuel prices, wait times, lengths of journey, canal fees and different sea conditions. It concludes that trade is unlikely to open up the northern route for decades.
It expects the Arctic sea ice to be too thick and treacherous for many years, requiring expensive ice breakers and strengthened hulls. 
“The Arctic navigation season is currently too short and ice conditions are too unpredictable for liner shipping to be feasible. Arctic liner shipping will only become a viable alternative to the contemporary shipping lanes if global warming continues to melt the ice cover along the North-west passage and the Northern sea route.
“It is highly unlikely that large-scale containerised cargo transports will appear in the near future. The question then arises: when, if ever, will the ice conditions allow for continuous and economically feasible container transport along the route?”
The greatest potential for the use of ice-reinforced container ships was found if the speed of global warming increased and the price of fuel is high. But even in this scenario, the cost per container was about 10% higher than going via the Suez canal route.
Scientists have predicted that ordinary vessels would be able travel easily along the northern sea route, and moderately ice-strengthened ships should be able to pass over the pole itself by 2050. 
Russian authorities still sees a bright future for shipping along its northern shoreline, but not as a busy international shipping route. “It is 100% sure that the northern sea route will be no alternative to the Suez Canal,” Russia’s deputy minister of transport, Viktor Olersky, told the Arctic Circle 2015 assembly.
Unusually high temperatures in January led to January seeing the lowest recorded extent of sea ice in the satellite record. The ice extent averaged 13.53 million square kilometres (5.2 million square miles), which is 1.04 million sq km (402,000 sq m) below the 1981 to 2010 average, according to the US government’s National Snow and Ice Data Centre.

Part of Sierra Leone in west Africa. The country’s capital, Freetown, sits on a peninsula at the bottom of the image. North of Freetown and across the river, we can see the runways of the Lungi airport. The area in the central-right portion of the image is the Sierra Leone river estuary. The estuary is dominated by mangroves and lowland coastal plains and is an important breeding habitat for multiple waterbird species. Diverse socioeconomic activities are supported by the estuary, such as fishing, tourism and sea transport. But the estuary is being threatened by a growing population. Unauthorised housing development has caused the removal of about 20 hectares of mangrove vegetation over the past five years alone. Poor waste disposal, unsustainable fishing and many other factors are also taking their toll on the ecosystem. 
While a large snowstorm in January 2016 blanketed the eastern United States, winter weather was also whitening areas across Asia.
Jeju Island — just south of the mainland of the South Korea peninsula (obscured in this view by clouds) — received more snow than has been measured there since 1984, according to news reports. Accumulation of 12 centimetres (4.7 inches) of snow closed the island’s airport for a few days and stranded about 86,000 travellers.
The wintery weather was not limited to South Korea. Snow also fell in areas of Taiwan, western and central Japan, and mainland China.
After battles in Libya on 4–6 January, several fires were observed at oil production and storage facilities near Sidra, on the coast between Sirte and Benghazi. Smoke plumes from several oil tanks and facilities spread a pall of black smoke across the nation’s Mediterranean coast.
The oil refinery fires continued throughout the month. The stream of black smoke that emanated from the refinery grew tremendously as the fires caused by the initial shelling spread to giant storage tanks. 
Earth’s 2015 surface temperatures were the warmest since modern record-keeping began in 1880, according to independent analyses by Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Globally averaged temperatures in 2015 shattered the previous mark set in 2014 by 0.23F (0.13C). 
The 2015 temperatures continue a long-term warming trend, according to analyses by scientists. The planet’s average surface temperature has risen about 1.8F (1C) since the late-19th century, a change largely driven by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere. Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with 15 of the 16 warmest years on record occurring since 2001. 
Phenomena such as El Niño or La Niña, which warm or cool the tropical Pacific Ocean, can contribute to short-term variations in global average temperature. A warming El Niño was in effect for most of 2015.

Since August 2015, heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow and forced tens of thousands from their homes in Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil. Rosario, Argentina is north of Buenos Aires, on the western shore of the Parana River. The entire Parana River floodplain for hundreds of kilometres is still underwater or wet, as seen in this image from Nasa’s Terra spacecraft.
Lake Poopó — once Bolivia’s second-largest lake and an important fishing resource for local communities — has essentially dried up. News reports blame recurrent drought and the diversion of the lake’s water sources for mining and agriculture.
The right image was acquired in April 2013 when it still held water. The left image in January 2016, by which time the lake had dried up. 
This is not the first time that Poopó has evaporated; the lake last dried up in 1994. In that case, it took several years for water to return, and even longer for ecosystems to recover.
Morocco gets plenty of sun — about 3,000 hours per year, according to the Solar GCC Alliance. A new solar plant in the desert country is poised to take advantage of the ample Saharan sunlight. The image above shows the first phase of the solar complex, Noor 1, located on the edge of the Saharan desert in the south-central Moroccan town of Ouarzazate.
The power station will be the size of the country’s capital city by the time it is finished in 2018, and provide electricity for 1.1 million people. Noor 1 will provide 160 megawatts (MW) of the ultimate 580MW capacity, helping Morocco to save hundreds of thousands of tonnes of carbon emissions per year.
A massive winter storm system pummelled the eastern United States in late January 2016, with two low-pressure systems merging into a potent nor’easter that dropped heavy snow from Virginia to New England. By late afternoon on 23 January, snowfall totals were approaching records in several states, and hurricane-force winds were battering the coastlines and leading to serious flooding. 
This image of the storm system was composed through the use of the VIIRS “day-night band,” which detects faint light signals such as city lights, moonlight, airglow, and auroras. In the image, the clouds are lit from above by the nearly full moon and from below by the lights of the heavily populated east coast. The city lights are blurred in places by cloud cover.
This image of Virginia, Maryland, and Washington DC in the early afternoon on 24 January shows most neighbourhoods received at least 18-24in (46-61cm) of snowfall.
This beautiful, natural-colour image features the small nation of Bahrain and parts of eastern Saudi Arabia. Located on the south-western coast of the Persian Gulf, Bahrain is a small Arab state, made up of an archipelago consisting of Bahrain Island and some 30 smaller islands.
In the middle of the image, on the Persian Gulf, the King Fahd Causeway is clearly visible. On the right of the image is the island of Bahrain, home to some 1.5 million people, with its modern capital Manama featured at the top. The greys represent the densely built city centre and surrounding towns.
On the top right part of the island, on a smaller island about 7 km north-east of the capital, Bahrain airport is visible. Towards the central left part of the island, Bahrain University and the Al Areen wildlife reservation.
On the bottom-right tip of the island a series of horseshoe-shaped artificial atolls are clearly visible. On the left side of the image, in Saudi Arabia, part of the Rub’ al-Khali, the world’s largest sand desert, is also visible. Distinct throughout the entire image, the striking variations of blue represent the shallow versus deep waters, with the presence of coral reefs.
Part of the astronaut experience is observing many different landscapes and geological patterns, especially in deserts where vegetation is rare. A crew member aboard the International Space Station took this photograph of a circular hill in the Kavir Desert in central Iran. 
Numerous, multi-coloured lines on the sides of the hill show that it consists of many thin layers of sedimentary rock.
The neighbouring dry lake has a white salt-covered surface. By contrast, the darkest areas are shrubby desert vegetation on the lowest slopes of the hill — the only zone where enough water concentrates to allow vegetation to grow.
The astronaut might even be able to tell the difference between the long curved lines on the left of the image. One is an ancient shoreline formed when the lake contained permanent water and had waves strong enough to shape sediments into a smooth beach. The other curved, slightly irregular line is a harder rock layer protruding from the desert floor.
It’s wintertime in the northern hemisphere, which means spectacular phytoplankton blooms return to the Arabian Sea, seen here off Oman (left), Pakistan (centre), and India (right). 
Blooms show up this time of year in the Arabian Sea because of the winter monsoon. Winds shift from south-westerly to north-easterly, stirring up currents that bring nutrients up from the depths and out from coastal tributaries. The change in wind direction also picks up dust from the arid lands of south-western Asia, carrying it out over the sea. This dust contains mineral nutrients that phytoplankton need to fuel their growth.
Dust storms help fertilise the ocean. They move nitrate, phosphate, and iron from the land into ocean surface waters around the world. 
Out-of-control bushfires are still raging in Tasmania’s north-west, Australia. The Australian Conservation Foundation has called for the public inquiry as dozens of fires continue to ravage the world heritage forests and look set to burn for days or weeks to come. The world heritage area was home to a range of unique alpine flora including pencil pines, king billy pines and cushion plants, some more than 1,000 years old. Now more than 10,000 hectares of land has been incinerated, and ecologist say that, unlike eucalyptus trees, the ancient flora will not recover.
In December 2015, torrential rains in parts of Missouri and Illinois led to severe flooding along the Mississippi river. The pulse of water that began in the river’s northern reaches eventually flowed all the way to Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico. The area between those two areas also saw river levels rise; the images above show flooding that occurred at the confluence of the Arkansas and Mississippi rivers.
The image shows the rivers on 12 January 2016, when the Mississippi river had crested in the area of Arkansas City, Arkansas.
As is often the case in winter, a thick river of haze hovered over the Indo-Gangetic Plain in January 2016, darkening skies over northern India and Bangladesh. 
The haze likely resulted from a combination of urban and industrial pollution, agricultural and cooking fires, and a meteorological phenomenon known as a temperature inversion. Usually the air higher in the atmosphere is cooler than the air near the surface, a situation that allows warm air to rise and disperse pollutants. However, cold air often settles over northern India in the winter, trapping pollution near the surface, where it has the greatest effect on human health.
Air pollution has emerged as a significant issue in India. Satellite observations show that levels of both sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are rising. A recent World Health Organisation analysis of particulate pollution concluded that many of the world’s most polluted cities were in India. Meanwhile, New Delhi, India’s capital city, began an experiment to keep half of vehicles off the road for the first two weeks of January in an attempt to curb air pollution.
Fires burning throughout Cambodia. Most of the fires burn in grass or cropland, which appears as a tan colour in this image showing heat signatures from fires in red.
Scientists are beginning a new project that will use aircraft to monitor entire reef systems in Florida, Hawaii, Palau, the Mariana Islands, and Australia. The COral Reef Airborne Laboratory will use an airborne instrument called the Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer to gather the data. 
The team plans to visit the Republic of Palau, a chain of islands at the far western end of Micronesia. The island chain is comprised of 458 sq km of dry land, and approximately 525 sq km of reefs spread through the ocean. This image highlights portions of Ngerbard and Kossel reefs, which are located to the north of Palau’s largest island, Babeldaob.
This image offers a wider view of the reefs surrounding Babeldaob. About half of Palau’s reefs are barrier reefs. These appear in long stretches along island coastlines, separated from the shoreline by a lagoon. The western side of Babeldaob has a well-developed barrier reef system that extends about 150km; the eastern side has some barrier reefs near the southern part of the island, but they are less developed and have gaps."

The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) published the RSPO Next standards on 9 February following rising pressure from industry and campaigners who claim that certified firms are still participating in deforestation, land-grabbing and the destruction of biodiversity, such as the loss of habitat for orangutans.
Created in 2004, the RSPO has led the push to create an accredited sustainable palm oil industry. Today it brings together 2,500 companies, from producers and traders to investors and retailers. Around 20% of the world’s palm oil is certified by the non-profit.

Palm oil is the most widely used vegetable oil in the world, according to WWF, and is found in an estimated 50% of supermarket products, from breakfast cereals to shampoo.
The spread of plantations used to produce palm oil, pulp and timber has largely been blamed for last year’s forest fires that engulfed vast areas of Indonesia. The resultant haze also affected Malaysia and Singapore, forcing schools to close and grounding flights. It is also thought to be behind up to half a million reported respiratory infections.
As global climate change targets become increasingly ambitious, pressure to preserve carbon-rich forests and soils is set to rise.
Major companies using palm oil are clamouring to demonstrate they are taking action, with some promoting initiatives they claim go beyond the standards originally established by the RSPO. Last year the Palm Oil Innovation Group – a small group of companies (including Danone and Ferrero) and NGOs that aim to build on the RSPO’s standards – published its charter calling for stronger action to tackle deforestation and human rights violations within the industry. The Sustainable Palm Manifesto, launched by a separate group, has focused on protecting high carbon forests. 
The RSPO has now responded with new, voluntary standards that ban planting on peatland and other carbon-rich soils, and require companies to implement fire prevention policies, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, pay employees a living wage and commit to zero deforestation.
Its pre-existing standards only ban the cutting of primary forests or those considered to be of high conservation value. They also ban the use of fire to clear land but, unlike RSPO Next, do not require companies to have procedures in place to prevent fire on land they manage. Furthermore, under the original RSPO requirements only extensive planting on peatland is discouraged and the reduction requirements for greenhouse gases are less comprehensive.
RSPO Next is, however, voluntary for members. The RSPO believes it would be impossible for some firms to implement the standards if they were compulsory. 
While CEO Darrel Webber admits that there is likely to be some initial confusion, he is confident that if RSPO Next is successfully implemented by enough companies early on, it will be only a matter of time before it becomes the industry norm.
Andrew Jenkins, sustainability manager at Boots, part of the Retailers’ Palm Oil Group represented at the RSPO, fears RSPO Next will create a two-tier system that is inaccessible to smaller companies. “You don’t want to make it so complicated that only companies like ours that can afford to pay people like me to look at it can understand the system … If you’re going to change the market you’ve got to get everybody on the market, not just the big companies.”
Jenkins admits, however, that the RSPO has little alternative. “They are stuck between a rock and a hard place on this one. If they tried to rebuild the entire system it would take years and nothing would happen.”

Others believe that the RSPO should concentrate on improving adherence to existing standards. In November, a report from the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) claimed that companies auditing RSPO certified plantations were failing to identify violations and in some cases colluding with plantations to deliberately disguise them, leading to deforestation, human trafficking and intimidation of environmentalists.
“If the system doesn’t work it doesn’t matter how good or bad the standards are … It could be mitigating the impact of the industry quite significantly if it was implemented, but what we see is that it’s not being implemented by a lot of companies,” says Tomasz Johnson, former EIA forests campaigner and author of the November report. 
The RSPO says it has thrown out two companies accused of malpractice in the report, is working with an independent regulator to review the claims and will introduce a register of auditors later in the year.
Despite serious complaints that the RSPO is not moving fast enough, few seem able to imagine a viable alternative. “RSPO doesn’t work right now, it doesn’t go far enough, but if it wasn’t around we’d probably have to reinvent it,” says Johnson."

Karen Orenstein, senior analyst, Friends of the Earth US, Washington DC, USA @KarenOrenstein @foe_us
Sometimes the needs of a vulnerable community won’t line up with the interests of an external invester, and public money is the only thing that will get the job done. For adaptation, being able to mobilise sufficient funds without the private sector is an imperative and the inability to generate the necessary funds is purely a political problem. The money is there, it’s just being spent on the wrong things. Brandon Wu, senior policy analyst, ActionAid, Washington DC, USA @brandoncwu
The $100bn developed countries signed up at Paris to raise each year needs to be deployed in a way that leverages at least another $900bn a year from the private sector. It could be best spent reducing investment risks and demonstrating the financial rewards associated with switching to cleaner energy solutions. Anthony Hobley, CEO, Carbon Tracker Initiative, London, UK @arhobley @CarbonBubble
One of the first steps has to be going back to countries’ Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) that they agreed in Paris and developing clear strategies for investment priorities, as there is a huge amount of work to do to match different countries’ needs with the financial resources available. Coming up with more specific strategies will help to direct public and private finance to priority programmes, policy and capacity needs. Tim Ash Vie, head of climate change, Adam Smith International, London, UK @AdamSmithInt
If you look at most INDCs from developing countries their emission reduction targets are subject to international climate finance, technology development and capacity building. What would happen if the means of implementation does not flow to developing countries? George Wamukoya, member of the African Group of Negotiators, Nairobi, Kenya
Uruguay is a great example of how domestic policy has led to a transformation in its energy sector. They used a fairly small grant from the Global Environment Facility to draw up an ambitious renewable energy law including training for national electricity utility staff on how to integrate renewable energy into the grid. Uruguay is now a double world record holder: installing the most wind per capita and receiving the largest share of clean energy investment as a percentage of GDP. Joe Thwaites, research analyst, World Resources Institute, Washington DC, USA @WRIFinance
Currently governments around the world subsidise fossil fuel exploration and production on a huge scale. Therefore a large onus is on governments to change and set up the right policies and regulations to drive investment in the direction of green energy rather than brown. Policymakers need to send clear signals to the private sector on where to invest their money. Sam Barnard, research officer, Overseas Development Institute, London, UK @samuelmarch
Regulators need to take a carrot-and-stick approach, incentivising finance for green energy while placing sanctions on finance for fossil fuels. Carbon pricing would send a significant message. There should also be manatory disclosure schemes where companies are expected to provide comprehensive reporting on all their energy investments, green and brown. Remco Fischer, programme officer, UNEP Finance Initiative, Geneva, Switzerland @UNEP_FI
 Project-based, short-term, supply-driven funding is not very powerful in driving long term transformation. Some early feedback from applicants to the recent Green Climate Fund (GCF) funding round late last year had applicants reporting that accessing funding from the GCF is very demanding and costly. The GCF board itself seems to be also taking a narrow definition of what “climate finance” should be spent on – all of this is unhelpful from the perspective of developing countries trying to prepare for climate change. Aaron Atteridge, research fellow, Stockholm Environment Institute, Stockholm, Sweden @SEIclimate
Looking long term, we also need to invest in creating a private sector in developing countries that can provide its own climate smart products and services. This involves creating the right incentives through fiscal and regulatory policies, subsidies or finance, as well as providing business support services in the right sectors, such as climate smart insurance. Tim Ash Vie
Most global climate-related finance is skewed toward mitigation rather than adaptation. But adaption money is needed to cover stronger early warning systems, address treatment of environmental refugees, and provide extreme weather insurance to 400 million more people in vulnerable countries by 2020. Virginie Fayolle, senior economist, Acclimatise, London, UK @VirginieFayolle
The other half is ensuring the money is channeled to the right recipients for the right activities. For climate finance to truly benefit impacted communities, we need to have community engagement at all levels of the process: policy, project design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The GCF makes some steps in the right direction, at least on paper, including by being the first fund to have a gender policy and action plan in place in advance of disbursing any money – but there’s room for improvement as always.

At Senate estimates on Wednesday, Finkel was asked by Labor senator Kim Carr when he found out the CSIRO would be cutting 350 staff over two years from climate change research programs. “When they were publicly announced,” Finkel responded.
 Finkel said since the announcement he had been discussing with leaders of other research bodies, including universities and the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), as to how the CSIRO’s research could be maintained. 
Director of the BoM, Rob Vertessy, told Senate estimates on Monday he was only told of the cuts 24 hours before they were publicly announced. Vertessy said if the CSIRO were to drop its climate modelling work “it would leave a hole in the national development capability”.
Prior to being questioned, Finkel delivered a statement addressing the CSIRO cuts. “There is no question that Australia needs a continuous and highly effective commitment to climate science, both to meet our national needs and to fulfil our international commitments,” he said. 
“Our most immediate national concern must be to ensure that long-term data collections will be funded and staffed, and that the climate modelling capabilities developed by the CSIRO will continue to be made available for scientists to use and refine.
“I am pleased that the CSIRO has this week committed to working with stakeholders to develop a transition plan to maintain this capacity.”
Finkel said other research institutions potentially had the capacity to take on some of the CSIRO cuts, but it would not be simple.
“I’m not saying it’s a simple case of absorbing the changes that have happened. But I am saying that those changes are happening in the context of a lot of capacity ... I’m not in any way dismissing the significance of the changes at the CSIRO,” he said.
Andy Pitman, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science at the University of NSW, told Guardian Australia on Tuesday there was no way a university could take on that responsibility.
“I mean I run a centre of excellence which is the best-funded university capability in the country and we do not remotely have the capability to be the custodians for the climate modelling systems,” Pitman said. “We live and breathe on a three-year funding cycle with an 80% failure rate. You cannot run a national capability in that environment.”
Last week chief executive of the CSIRO, Larry Marshall,  told staff  that 350 positions would be cut as the organisation moved away from researching climate change. Scientists around the world have since spoken out against the move. 
On Monday, the World Climate Research Program, part of the World Meteorological Organisation, put out a statement criticising the cuts.
“We read that these cuts occur in the name of innovation,” it said. “One can hardly imagine a worse and more backward step toward any of those laudable goals than ignoring climate and discarding climate research.”
Paul Durack of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the US has been collecting signatures from international climate scientists for an open letter to the Australian government calling for the CSIRO capabilities threatened by the cuts to be saved. More than 2,100 signatures have been collected so far.
The CSIRO Staff Association has lodged a formal dispute with management over the job losses, claiming CSIRO management breached their enterprise agreement by failing to consult with staff over changes that could impact on their jobs. 
A spokesman for the association said a meeting of members next week would consider industrial action."

The unexpected decision creates instant uncertainty about the future of Obama’s climate plan and the historic global agreement to fight climate change reached in Paris last December.
The White House registered its immediate disapproval, and said in a statement that the administration would continue taking “aggressive steps” to reduce climate pollution. “We disagree with the supreme court’s decision,” the White House said.
But officials told reporters in a conference call that they remained confident this was a “bump in the road”, and that the plan would prevail.
The officials also said Obama had been briefed and would speak on the decisions soon.
The surprising vote by the justices put a temporary freeze on Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules cutting carbon emissions from power plants until the Washington DC circuit court of appeals hears challenges from 29, mainly Republican-led states, and dozens of corporations and industry groups. Arguments are scheduled for 2 June. 
The 5-4 decision for a stay  came as a shock to the EPA and environmental campaign groups, and was widely seen as a sign that opponents of the power plant rules have made a strong argument against the plan.
“We’re disappointed the rule has been stayed, but you can’t stay climate change and you can’t stay climate action,” said Melissa Harrison, an EPA spokeswoman. “We believe strongly in this rule and we will continue working with our partners to address carbon pollution.”
Margie Alt, the director of Environment America, said in a statement: “This decision is a huge loss for our kids’ future and for all Americans who care about the health of our planet, and a huge win for the polluters and the deniers.” She added that she hoped it would only be a temporary setback.
“It is not what we had hoped for,” Joanne Spalding, senior climate counsel for the Sierra Club, said. “We are disappointed.”
Opponents of the EPA rules – who had described the clean power plan as a “war on coal” – said the stay was an indication the carbon-cutting regulations would eventually be overturned.
West Virginia, one of the states leading the legal challenge, said it was thrilled at the outcome.
“Make no mistake – this is a great victory for West Virginia,” Patrick Morrisey, the state’s attorney general, said in a statement. 
The main lobby group for the coal industry claimed the decision indicated the supreme court was leaning in their favor on the broader legal challenge.
“We are pleased the supreme court took this unprecedented step to protect the states from further economic harm while the courts are deciding whether the administration’s power plan is unlawful and unconstitutional,” said Mike Duncan, president of Americans for Clean Coal Electricity. “The stay is a signal the supreme court has serious concerns with the power plan. We’re optimistic the power plan will ultimately be rejected.”
Republicans in Congress claimed the stay was a rebuke to Obama’s use of his executive powers to fight climate change, in the absence of any legislative efforts. “Today’s decision by the Supreme Court is an important step toward reining in the Obama administration’s unprecedented abuse of executive power,” Deb Fischer, Republican Senator from Nebraska, said in a statement.
The plan was a linchpin of Obama’s climate agenda and was critical to the administration’s efforts to persuade nearly 200 countries to rally around the Paris agreement.
The rules were the first ever cutting climate pollution from power plants – the single largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the US. They called for reducing carbon emissions from power plants by about one-third by 2030.
Obama and US officials have been adamant in their discussions with world leaders that the power plant rules would withstand legal challenges, and would come into force even if a Republican wins the White House next November.
The United Nations had invited world leaders to a signing ceremony on 22 April to finalize the agreement, and spur further action to cut emissions. White House officials said last month that they expected to unveil further climate actions in the lead-up to the ceremony. 
Campaign groups insisted that the reasons for the stay would have little to no bearing on the case itself – and expressed confidence that the EPA ultimately would prevail. “The bottom line is that they still need to look closely at the case,” Spalding said.
Under the schedule set out by the EPA when it unveiled the rules last summer, states had until September to submit their plans for cutting emissions from power plants. Many of the states suing the EPA had been working on their plans. 
But that schedule was now put in doubt by Tuesday’s decision – which raises the prospect that states may not finish their plans before Obama leaves the White House.
What happens next is that states can call pause on that work while the lower court considers arguments about the EPA’s authority to limit carbon pollution from power plants. 
White House officials said the plan had been constructed to allow for such legal delays. States do not have to submit their final plans until 2018, and the rules do not come into force until 2022. “That glide path gives states and utilities ample time to get their plans in place, and that continues to be the case notwithstanding the decision today,” the officials said in the conference call. 
But the decision was nevertheless a blow to the administration’s repeated claims that the rules were at little risk from the courts.
Gina McCarthy, the EPA administrator, had frequently expressed confidence that the EPA could beat back any legal challenge, citing previous supreme court decisions upholding the agency’s authority to cut carbon emissions.
The EPA had also chalked up a number of other legal victories against industry groups to block air pollution and other rules.
But the stay had shaken some of that confidence, and injected uncertainty into the energy transformation that was already taking place on the ground – even in the absence of the power plant rules.
America’s use of coal for electricity fell to an all-time low last year, and about 5% of coal-fired power plants were shut down. Most of that electricity was replaced with fracked natural gas, but wind and solar energy was also coming onto the grid.
“Today’s supreme court decision is a major setback,” said Gregory Wetstone, the president of the American Council on Renewable Energy. “But this is not the end of the story ... There is every reason to anticipate that, in the end, the court will affirm that the Clean Air Act does indeed provide authority to address the greenhouse emissions that are changing the global climate.”"

The work shows faster jet stream winds will delay transatlantic flights, adding thousands of hours a year to journey times and millions of dollars to airline fuel bills. Earlier work showed other impacts of rising temperatures on aviation, including bumpier, more turbulent flights and reducing the weight planes can carry.
Climate change is increasing the speed of the jet stream, a strong high-altitude wind that blows west to east across the Atlantic. Pilots harness the jet stream to get from the US to Europe more quickly, but have to battle it on the return journey, which currently takes an hour longer.
Dr Paul Williams, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading, UK, combined the software used by aviation companies to calculate the best routes each day with climate models to reveal the impact of warming on flight times. 
The faster jet stream slowed eastbound transatlantic flights more than it speeded up westbound flights, leading to round trips that were on average a minute and 18 seconds longer. There are currently 300 round trips a day, meaning the delay adds up to 2,000 extra hours year, $22m in extra fuel and 70m extra kilogrammes of CO2 emitted.
“The aviation industry is facing pressure to reduce its environmental impacts, but this study shows a new way in which aviation is itself susceptible to the effects of climate change,” Williams said. “This effect will increase the fuel costs to airlines, potentially raising ticket prices, and it will worsen the environmental impacts of aviation.” Fuel costs are a critical factor in the competitiveness of airlines.
“The jet stream is does not just live in the Atlantic, it goes all the way around the world and there is another one in the southern hemisphere too,” Williams said. “So it is plausible that similar flight routes around the world will be affected and when you look at those numbers, it is just enormous.”
Carbon emissions from aviation are a significant and fast growing factor in driving global warming. On Monday, governments proposed for the first time to reduce future emissions from airplanes, although campaigners said the new standards would have little real effect.
The new research, published in Environmental Research Letters, examined flights between London’s Heathrow airport and New York’s John F. Kennedy International and calculated the impact of a 15% increase in the speed of the jet stream, which is expected in the next few decades unless current carbon emissions are heavily cut.
William’s calculated more than 1.3m flight paths in simulations covering 40 years and found that while New York to London flights were on average four minutes faster, the return flights were five minutes and 18 seconds longer. This was because planes slowed down by the jet stream spend more time fighting the headwind, while those sped up by it spend less time getting the boost.
The current record for the fastest (non-Concorde) transatlantic flight - five hours and 16 minutes, set in 2015 - was assisted by an unusually fast jet stream. Williams said passengers should expect that record to be broken more often, but they should also expect more frequent very slow flights of over seven hours. Climate change will approximately double the chances of both, he said.
The jet stream is driven by the temperature difference at high altitudes between the polar region and the equator. Satellite measurements have already shown that climate change is increasing this temperature difference. “We know the jet stream is getting stronger,” said Williams. “This is good hard science that we understand very well.”
Changes to the northern hemisphere jet stream have also been linked to extreme rainfall and flooding in the UK and heavy snowfalls in the US."

The energy and climate change committee said that, without such technology, it would be much more expensive to meet national and internationally agreed targets on reducing greenhouse gases. The extra cost could run to billions, outstripping the £1bn of public funds that had been promised for CCS.
Angus MacNeil, the Scottish National party MP who chairs the committee, said: “The manner in which the government pulled the plug on the CCS commercialisation competition was hugely disappointing. UK companies had been working towards this for years and were only weeks away from final proposals. This is the latest in a series of snap decisions that have damaged confidence in the government’s energy policy.”
Ministers agreed to long-term carbon targets at the landmark Paris climate summit in December, to much fanfare, but it came shortly after the chancellor, George Osborne, announced that mooted CCS plants would not receive government help.
That decision, buried in the spending review in late November, days before the Paris conference started, was a severe blow to the UK’s fledgling CCS industry. CCS is seen as a way of extending the life of coal and gas-fired power stations, as it removes the emissions from burning fossil fuels from the atmosphere. Without it, much more investment would be required into low-carbon alternatives such as renewables and nuclear power.
The government’s statutory advisers on meeting emissions targets, the Committee on Climate Change, have also warned that without CCS the UK will find it much more expensive to meet its carbon-cutting goals.
Government support for the technology had been promised since 2005, when the idea was first mooted of a publicly funded competition among companies to find the best proposals. After years of wrangling by various governments, by last autumn the competition was in its final stages, with a prize settled at £1bn and two bidders remaining, both consortia that had spent several years and millions of pounds on their plans. These projects, in Yorkshire and Scotland, have now been halted.
The MPs also warned that the government was missing the opportunity to use existing North Sea oil and gas infrastructure, much of which may be lost as those fields are depleted, as a cornerstone of a new CCS industry. They called for the government to put forward new CCS plans.
Luke Warren, chief executive of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, said the government’s withdrawal had “an extremely negative impact on the industry”, and that although it might appear to be saving money in the short term, it would leave the UK with much greater costs in the next two decades. 
“[A new government strategy for CCS] needs to clearly set out the government’s ambitions in the near term and address the challenge of providing storage infrastructure [and] a sustainable future for vital energy-intensive industries, and maximise our North Sea oil and gas assets,” he said. 
Energy experts also warned of the potential consequences of a failure to pursue CCS technology.
Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said: “The decision to cancel the £1bn CCS demonstration programme carries large risks. In the absence of a new plan for CCS, the UK is effectively outsourcing demonstration and commercialisation to other countries. This was the only significant large-scale demonstration programme in the EU, and one of a handful worldwide.”
While CCS is currently expensive, he added, investing in CCS would be a way to bring down costs. “Given that the government wishes to replace coal with gas, significant CCS deployment will be essential - otherwise, gas demand is likely to have to fall sharply from the mid-2020s.” 
A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: “We haven’t closed the door to CCS technology in the UK, but as part of our ongoing work to get Britain’s finances back on track, we have had to take difficult decisions to control government spending. 
“CCS should come down in cost and we are considering the role that it could play in the long-term decarbonisation of the UK. We are committed to meeting our climate change targets in a way that is affordable and provides secure energy to our families and businesses.”"

The British oil company believes fossil fuels will still be providing 80% of total energy supply in 2035 and admits that under this scenario, carbon emissions will rocket.
The forecasts were immediately attacked by critics who accused BP of deliberately talking up the prospects for its own business while providing a downbeat assessment of future demand for wind and solar power.
The predictions are contained in the latest annual BP Energy Outlook, which looks at long-term trends and develops projections for world energy markets over the next two decades.
“In the middle of a downturn in oil and gas prices, it is important not only to adapt to the current tough conditions, but also to prepare for the next set of challenges,” argued BP’s chief executive, Bob Dudley.
The key message seems to be that the oil and gas industry must keep on extracting new reserves to meet strong demand for energy from developing countries and a growth in the world population.
Spencer Dale, BP’s chief economist, was unwilling to say what price assumptions were used in his predictions but did expect an improvement away from a current level of just above $30 a barrel oil.
Prices would eventually rise to somewhere between $30 and $100 and while the high figure was not a natural “resting place”, Dale said he expected events to ensure prices would spike up again on occasions to $100.
The positive picture for fossil fuel prices and production from BP was attacked by critics as disingenuous and self-serving. 
“This is a story of how an oil and gas company predicts the rosy prospects of oil and gas companies. BP would like us to believe that government action on climate will fail, that clean technologies will fizzle, and that the future of energy will still be based on the carbon fuels of the past,” said Greg Muttitt of Washington-based campaign group Oil Change International.
“Dressed in a veneer of concern about climate change, in fact BP’s outlook is a public relations exercise, designed to boost fossil fuels and undermine public faith in clean alternatives. Meanwhile it deflects responsibility to government or to coal companies, to distract from its own extraction of oil and gas. This is not a credible view of the future of energy.”
Dudley told the International Petroleum Week conference in London on Wednesday that the commodity cycle that saw oil prices hit $100 as little as eight months ago was not over. He said the second half of 2016 would see stronger prices because “every storage tank and swimming pool” would be full of oil. 
The oil company admitted that in the past it has underestimated the growth of wind and other renewable power technologies in the energy mix but had overestimated the contribution from nuclear and biofuels.
It expected carbon emissions to grow by almost 1% a year for the two decades, “suggesting the need for further policy action” such as a meaningful price for carbon, it said in its outlook.
BP was unwilling to speculate on where its base case scenario would leave the Earth’s temperatures, but it would be way above the two degrees centigrade growth seen as safe by most scientists.
The company also outlined a mixture of alternative scenarios, some of which presume much more policy action to counter global warming, including one with a very high carbon price of $100 a tonne (compared with around $5 a tonne now).
The outlook predicted that “tight oil” – mainly US shale – would rise from around 4m barrels of oil equivalent to 8m in the 2030s. It added that US shale gas could provide almost 20% of the world’s supplies within 20 years.
BP also forecast a major future increase in output from non-Opec production in deep water Brazilian fields and the Canadian tar sands, even though the latter is very expensive and involves high carbon production methods.
Launching the outlook, Dale denied the base case forecast was one the company planned its business round but said it was up to ministers to find wider solutions to climate change.
“The idea that you plan on any single base case would not be a sensible thing ... I am not a climate scientist and the mapping between carbon emissions and temperatures itself is highly ill-defined and uncertain thing.
“Its a very challenging environment but our job here is not to do anything in terms of advocacy. Our job is not to say whats optimal what is the right thing to do, that’s for policy makers. Our job is to say what is the most likely case.”"

Politicians, businesses and green campaigners from other countries rallied to the support of the president after the US supreme court put a temporary freeze on new rules to clean up coal-fired power plants, the centrepiece of Obama’s climate plan. They insisted that the Paris commitments on tackling emissions would be enforced.
Miguel Arias Cañete, the EU’s climate change commissioner, said: “We have confidence in all countries to deliver on what they promised. The EU will continue to lead by example and enshrine its targets into law. I will meet the US climate envoy Todd Stern next week in Brussels and hope to better understand the potential implications of the court decision.”
Lord Stern, one of the world’s foremost economists on climate change, said: “It is perhaps no surprise that vested interests have united against the clean power plan.”
He warned: “We have to recognise that delay is dangerous and faltering by the US risks being amplified elsewhere. While this is a setback, it does not change the profound attractiveness to the United States of the transition to low-carbon economic growth, and a world that is cleaner, safer and more prosperous.” 
Bas Eickhout, spokesman for the European Green MEPs, said: “This is unexpected but does not change the growing global momentum to shift away from fossil fuels. The US administration played an important role in the Paris deal and it is clear they will want to continue with their implementation of the clean energy plan.”
President Obama’s strong stance on climate change had “rightly won support internationally”, added Lisa Nandy, the UK’s shadow energy and climate secretary. “There is such strong public support within the US for Obama’s efforts on climate change that I think this ruling will prove to be only a very temporary issue. The supreme court has already upheld the authority of America’s Environmental Protection Agency to limit carbon from power stations.”
Under the proposed “clean power plan” rules, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was empowered to force coal-fired power stations to cut carbon dioxide emissions by about a third by 2030. The new rules, which have been years in the making, in the face of strong opposition from some states and businesses, mark the first nationwide limits on CO2 from fossil fuel power generation in the US.
The White House said the 5-4 supreme court decision to put the new rules on hold was only a “bump in the road” and a “temporary procedural issue”. A senior official from the Obama administration assured journalists: “The Paris agreement and the implementation of that is going forward and I don’t think this will affect that much one way or another.”
“Our international partners understand the US system is one where rules get challenged and there is litigation. They are aware of that,” he added.
On 22 April, the UN wants world leaders to gather in New York to formally sign the Paris agreement and bring it into operation. The White House official said the “stay” ordered by justices on the EPA rules would be unlikely to affect US participation.
Many overseas observers blamed vested corporate interests and Republicans hostile to climate action for the setback. 
John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “The hardline climate sceptic Republicans and their corporate backers from the big utilities will use all their power and money to try to thwart Obama’s attempts to kick start a renewable energy revolution. We can only hope this is a last desperate throw of the dice as coal continues to slide down the power league table.”
Craig Bennett, UK chief executive of Friends of the Earth, said: “It’s no surprise that following the historic yet inadequate outcome of the Paris climate talks the old world order is fighting to maintain the incumbent dirty energies of yesteryear. They may succeed in slowing things down a little but they won’t stop humanity from taking its next big step forward to live free from polluting fossil fuels.”
However, the US Chamber of Commerce, the country’s main business lobby, called the supreme court decision “a stunning rebuke” to the Obama administration, and called into further question US ability to deliver on the climate promises made at Paris. 
“The implications of this decision are likely to extend well beyond the United States and call into question the durability of the Obama administration’s pledge to the United Nations to slash US net greenhouse gas emissions 26%-28% by 2025 from the 2005 level,” a blogpost from the Chamber’s thinktank said. 
“We estimate that the shortfall would expand from the current range of 45%-49% to a range of 60%-63% — that’s more of a chasm than a gap. At the Paris climate talks in December, administration officials, who should have known better, spent considerably energy assuring anyone who would listen that the clean power plan was legally unassailable.”
Although the court ruling was on a procedural issue, dealing with states coming forward with plans for the implementation of the EPA rules, it was a sign of the attitude of many of the justices towards Obama’s move, said Dirk Forrister, chief executive of the International Emissions Trading Association. 
“Despite this ruling, the 2022 enforcement date remains unchanged at this stage. The decision just suspends temporarily the legal obligation for states to submit their implementation plans. While the ruling is procedural and not a direct comment on the substance of the rule, it shows that the court has some reservations about the rule.”
Reuters reported that shares in US coal companies jumped when the supreme court ruling was announced. Peabody Energy shares leapt 10.7%, Cloud Peak Energy shares by 18.7%, and Consol Energy by 3.9%. "

Global warming poses a systemic risk to the world economy and could significantly cut the value of investments, the experts argue, so those with fiduciary responsibility have a duty to act to reduce that risk, or be taken to court.
“Clients of investment firms and beneficiaries of pension funds might have a legal case to bring if those who manage money for them stand idly by as emissions erode the value of their stock,” said Howard Covington, the former CEO of a £20bn asset management company and a trustee of environmental law organisation, ClientEarth. “We are currently exploring such a possibility.”
James Thornton, CEO of ClientEarth, said: “To produce a wholesale change in attitude, a court ruling on the obligations of fiduciary investors to control systemic climate risk will probably be needed. Because of the uncertainties in estimating future climate damage, this will not be an easy case to bring. But we anticipate that such a case will ultimately succeed.”
ClientEarth successfully sued the UK government in 2015 over illegal levels of air pollution. It has also helped investors file shareholder resolutions at the annual meetings of major mining companies demanding more transparency on the risks of climate change to their businesses.
But Covington said: “It would be fair to say that not a lot of progress has been made with this kind of engagement. It requires investors to put their heads above the parapet, but most investors like a quiet life.”
In an article published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, Covington, Thornton and Oxford University professor of energy economics, Cameron Hepburn, say that investors will be crucial in ensuring the largely voluntary climate change deal sealed in Paris in December is implemented. 
“Investors will play a major part, either voluntarily or because they will be forced by the courts to meet their legal obligations to manage climate risk,” they argue.
The authors say that dangerous climate change could damage the global economy by, for example, droughts and heatwaves that lead to famines which in turn lead to migrations of millions of people. They estimate there is a 5% chance of global investment portfolios being reduced by 10% - $7tn - in coming decades, a level of risk and exposure that is routinely declared and acted on by big companies today.
Prof Hepburn said: “The risk exceeds the legal test of materiality and should be too large to ignore. In practice most investors neglect it entirely.”
The team estimate publicly listed companies - largely owned by investment and pension funds - account for about a quarter of global emissions. The investors can reduce the risk of climate change by demanding action to cut carbon emissions from the companies they have stakes in and shifting investment from fossil fuel companies to green companies, the authors say.
The Guardian has revealed previously the high exposure of many pension funds to coal, oil and gas companies, whose value could plummet if most fossil fuel reserves are left in the ground, as is needed to tackle global warming.
But Covington said the financial risks of climate change are systemic. “There has rightly been a lot of attention on fossil fuel companies, but that is just the supply side,” he said. “There is also the demand side - all the users of fossil fuels - and there is plenty they could do to employ more efficient processes to limit emissions, so it goes right across the full spectrum of companies.”
“This expert view from ClientEarth is a wake up call to trustees and investment professionals,” said Mark Campanale, founder of the Carbon Tracker Initiative, a thinktank that has highlighted the risks that action to cut emissions poses to fossil fuel companies, a view backed by the Bank of England and World Bank. “If investors cannot demonstrate that they’ve considered the key risks, ClientEarth have laid out the basis for a legal challenge.
Campanale said the legal risk for fund managers is particularly high for those investing in fossil fuels. “If investors throw the hard-earned cash of pension fund members at the fossil fuel industry right now - knowing it is in steady but clear decline - then no one should be surprised that they face the possibility of being sued.”"

This doesn't bode well | Scott Lemieux";"The presidential election just got even more important – it will be a choice between a president in favor of climate action and one who would ignore it";"Hours before New Hampshire’s primary voters made Donald Trump the favorite for the Republican presidential nomination Tuesday night – I can’t really believe this even as I type it – the US supreme court reminded us of why the upcoming presidential election is so important. On a party-line vote, the court temporarily stopped Barack Obama’s clean power plan from going into effect. This decision could well portend a future one that will have devastating consequences – not only for the climate but for the state of our lawmaking process.
The decision also underscores the urgency of the November elections in two ways: it will be a choice between a candidate who supports taking action against climate change and one who believes it should be ignored, and it will present a choice between a president who believes that the federal government has the authority to effectively regulate and one who believes that the supreme court should arbitrarily throw monkey wrenches into the political process.
The clean power plan is a set of regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions in the face of climate change. In addition to improved fuel economy standards for vehicles, the Environmental Protection Agency announced carbon dioxide emissions standards that would, barring major technological advancements, make coal-fired power plants nearly impossible to build. These regulations would not, in and of themselves, save the planet, but they represent an important step.
But 29 states, mostly led by Republicans, took the issue to the courts. A lawsuit arguing that the regulations are illegal is currently pending at the DC circuit court of appeals, which is likely to hear the case in June. In the meantime, the supreme court’s stay Tuesday means that the regulations will not go into effect at least until the lower court issues its ruling in the fall, and most likely means that they will not go into effect before the upcoming presidential election (assuming the supreme court decides to keep the stay in effect while deciding whether to take the case itself).
Because of the ruling, the court might be able to kill the clean power plan without even ruling on it. If the Republicans win the White House, the regulations would never go into effect, because the incoming president would reverse Obama’s executive order. Admittedly, a new Republican administration could rescind the regulations anyway, but it is more difficult to stop a program that is in effect than to stop one from being implemented in the first place.
Either Democratic candidate would support the CPP, but there’s at least a chance that the supreme court will find that the regulations exceed the authority of the executive branch and still get rid of them.
None of this means there are good arguments against the legality of the CPP. As Harvard law professors Jody Freeman and Richard Lazarus, have explained, the plan should be upheld – in particular, because the constitutional arguments against it are absurd.
One of the arguments against the CPP is that the regulations constitute a “taking” without fair compensation from coal companies, which would violate the fifth amendment. If taken seriously, this argument from the libertarian fringe would render most of the contemporary regulatory state unconstitutional. As Freeman and Lazarus observe, not “even one single Justice in more than two centuries of cases [has] endorsed such a reading of the fifth amendment”. It’s probably a non-starter even with the Roberts court.
Energy interests also argue that the CPP, which involves cooperation between federal and state officials, is a constitutionally impressible coercion of state officials. This is based on a couple of controversial supreme court decisions that have prohibited the federal government from “commandeering” officials of state governments. It’s a very weak argument in this context, although the high court’s conservatives have bought similarly weak federalism arguments in the past.
The most likely path by which the supreme court could attack the CPP would be to argue that it exceeds the authority given to the executive branch under the Clean Air Act. In theory, this would allow Congress to change the law to permit the executive branch to enact necessary carbon regulations. While superficially more modest than a constitutional ruling, as long as Republicans control the House of Representative it would guarantee that these needed regulations would not go into effect even with a Democrat in the White House. 
Even if the court ultimately upholds the regulations and the Democratic party retains the White House, the decision to stay the CPP from going into effect will delay regulation that is urgently needed. At worst, it will tie the hands of the government and prevent it from addressing one of the most urgent problems facing the country and the world, based on arguments that constitute far-right crackpottery."

But that will not bring back coal from the brink, and it may not stop some states and power companies from moving ahead on their own to clean up the US electrical grid.
A day after the supreme court’s 5-4 ruling to halt the Environmental Protection Agency rules cutting carbon emissions from power plants, the White House dared to describe the decision as little more than “a bump in the road”. 
Tuesday’s decision puts a temporary freeze on Obama’s signature climate policy: a plan to cut carbon emissions from power plants 32% on 2005 levels by 2030. 
But the EPA will keep on working with states that decide to go ahead with their plans and “the administration will continue to take aggressive steps to make forward progress to reduce carbon emissions”, the White House said on Tuesday.
The White House said the rule, though aimed at the biggest single source of US emissions, was part of a suite of climate measures.
“We’re going to continue to take aggressive steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” said White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz, pointing to stricter emissions standards for cars, trucks and aircraft, as well as the long-term extension of renewable energy tax credits. Those credits, he said, will have a larger impact on emissions than the clean power plant law.
More than 30 states were actively working to comply with the EPA rules, including Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Virginia, according to the Ceres sustainable business network. A number of major utilities, including American Electric Power in Ohio, Xcel in Minnesota and DTE in Michigan were also working to cut emissions, Ceres said. 
The governors of California, Colorado and New York reaffirmed they would push ahead on their climate action plans. Jerry Brown, California’s governor, accused the justices of being “tone-deaf”.
“This arbitrary roadblock does incalculable damage and undermines America’s climate leadership,” Brown said. “But make no mistake, this won’t stop California from continuing to do its part under the Clean Power Plan.”
 Andrew Cuomo, New York’s governor, also said his state would move forward on its climate plan. “New York State remains committed to moving forward with our own actions to protect the environment and the public health,” he said in a statement. “But this issue requires a global response – and the Clean Power Plan is crucial to ensuring a cleaner, greener, and safer future for all.”
Fitch, the major credit rating service, also said that some power companies and states had already started to move funds to clean energy, in anticipation of the rules.
“Fitch has assumed compliance by states in its longer-term sector outlook,” the ratings service said. “The clean power plan had already begun to influence the business strategies and capital expenditures across the US power sector, and it is unclear how the industry participants would react to the delay induced by the stay.”
Fitch said there were now doubts about whether the EPA could keep to a schedule that required states to put forward plans for power plants by September.
However, Vicki Arroyo, who heads the Georgetown Climate Center, noted that the judges had refrained from extending the timeline in their decision on Tuesday. 
“Since the court declined to extend the actual (later) compliance deadlines, it is possible that states will still be held to a similar timeline for compliance,” she said. 
But she acknowledged that any slippage in the timeline increased the risk that a Republican president could stall the regulations – if the party takes the White House in November. “Obviously that does get us close to the Presidential election and it’s possible that a future Administration might try to slow-walk any changes required or not continue to defend it – to your question on timing, though I sincerely hope that does not happen,” she said in an email.
 As you know, the Supreme Court has been clear in three separate cases now that the EPA has the authority and responsibility to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act – with the AEP v CT case pointing to the 111 approach with states in particular as an alternative to that nuisance suit. We’re optimistic that much if not all of the rule will be upheld on the merits.
Administration officials told reporters in a conference call they remained confident in the EPA’s strong track record of winning environmental lawsuits brought by industry. When the power plant rule gets a full review by the court later this year, the White House expects to win.
“We do remain confident that we’re going to prevail on the merits when the clean power plant rule gets its full day in court,” said Schultz.
Officials also noted that other air pollution rules – which have a knock-on effect on carbon emissions – remained in effect, and that states were moving ahead on policies promoting renewable energy.
California, which has the most aggressive plan, has committed to obtain 50% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Such measures being rolled out in other states were bound to push more coal-fired power plants out of service, experts said.
Other states – and utility companies – were pushing ahead to clean up their fleets of power plants, clean energy industry groups said.
“This is not the end of the story,” Gregory Wetstone, chief executive officer of the American Council on Renewable Energy, said. “Public and private sector momentum behind the shift to lower carbon power generation will continue.”
Meanwhile, campaign groups said a historic transition away from coal-fired power plants was already occurring – with or without the EPA rules.
“The shift in the electricity from coal and natural gas towards clean power is ongoing, and it doesn’t depend on the clean power plan,” Joanne Spalding, the Sierra Club’s chief climate counsel. “It is actually following the trends in the electricity sector. It is not setting them. There is no reason for that to slow down even though the rule is stayed.”
Coal made up just over a third of US electricity generation last year – the lowest on record and in line with EPA forecasts. In November alone coal use fell further, making up only 29% of the power mix, according to government data.
That was well on its way to the EPA projections for 2030, the target date of the clean power plant rules. The agency has projected that coal would account for just 27% of US power generation by 2030.
Even so, some leading Democrats admitted the court decision had injected an element of doubt into the future of the power plant rules once Obama leaves the White House in 2017.
Some of the states and industry groups suing the EPA also said they saw the decision for a stay as an indication they would eventually succeed in overturning the rules.
Paul Ryan, the US House speaker, called the ruling “a victory for the American people and our economy”.
“This rule should be struck down permanently before coal country is destroyed completely, and American consumers are consigned to higher energy prices,” he said in a statement.
Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, said the supreme court decision was “an unfortunate setback” and completely unexpected. “This was an especially stunning move by the supreme court given just weeks ago the DC circuit court of appeals categorically rejected a halt of the clean power plan.”"

In fact, many of us would welcome an extra couple of degrees warmth. So what is all the fuss about?
Unfortunately the warming would not occur evenly around the world. A study published recently in Nature shows what 2C of warming – a rise, of this level, above the pre-industrial global mean surface temperature – might really feel like and which regions may be hit hardest.
Some of the regional hot spots cited are the Mediterranean countries, Brazil and the US, where 2C of global warming could translate into local temperature increases of more than 3C. But the region expected to suffer most is the Arctic, where night-time temperatures are predicted to soar by 6C.
“Some countries are much more exposed than others,” says Rob Wilby, from Loughborough University.
The Earth has already warmed by an average of 1C, and the uneven nature of this warming is becoming clear with Arctic regions already beyond the 2C mark. Meanwhile, climate models suggest that the Mediterranean could pass the 2C level once global temperatures have risen by 1.4C.
Oceans, which cover 70% of the planet, warm much more slowly than land and are partly responsible for the uneven pattern of warming. Local factors, like loss of heat-reflecting snow in the Arctic, make a difference, too.
And it isn’t just temperature: changes in rainfall are also expected to be unequally distributed, with most land areas getting more of a dousing, according to the researchers. “Recent flooding episodes in the UK give us an insight into just how vulnerable we are,” says Wilby."

Marshall has announced a refocusing of research inside the CSIRO, with plans to abandon its work on studying how climate changes and instead concentrate on adaptation and mitigation. The move garnered widespread criticism from climate scientists in Australia and abroad, with experts arguing it is impossible to adapt to climate change unless you know precisely how it will change.
Speaking to the ABC on Thursday, Marshall said: “I must admit I feel a little bit like the early climate scientists in the 1970s fighting against the oil lobby.”
He continued: “I guess I had the realisation that the climate lobby is perhaps more powerful than the energy lobby was back in the 70s.
“There’s a lot of emotion in this debate – in fact it almost sounds more like religion than science to me,” he said.
He said that the reaction had not shifted his opinion or made him consider reversing the decision. 
“For that to happen someone’s going to have to convince me that measurement and modelling is far more important than mitigation. And at this point, none of my leadership believe that. They believe quite the contrary which is why we’re driving in this direction.”
Labor’s Kim Carr, who will be questioning Marshall at Senate Estimates today, suggested to Guardian Australia Marshall’s comments resembled the language used by climate change deniers.
“I’ve heard all those words before. That climate change is like a religion. And I think there’s any number of conservative politicians that have used that very same expression. There’s no doubt in my mind that this is the sort of language that appears to sections of the government.”
Asked if he meant the language resembled that of a climate change denier, Carr responded: “Why would a head of a science agency be using language like that?”
Carr said the government didn’t need to intervene in the operation of the CSIRO to be responsible for these changes. “The CSIRO operates within a political context,” he said. “You don’t have to tell [public servants] to do this or do that. There is a political culture that is established.”
“It strikes me that this is a decision that reflects government priorities. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the minister isn’t telling the truth that the minister wasn’t telling the truth when he says we didn’t know this was what they were going to do but there’s no doubt in my mind that this reflects government priorities.”
Fairfax Media has today reported Marshall released a video to staff today, where he tried to further explain the reasoning for the cuts to staff.
He is quoted saying in the video: “It’s completely understandable that someone who’s spent 20 years, for example, studying climate change, measuring climate change or modelling climate change, it’s perfectly understandable that they don’t want to stop doing that and we must respect that, and we must find a place for them in the rest of the innovation system, perhaps in an university, where they can continue to pursue their passion. 
“But CSIRO’s direction has changed, and in the climate area we’re shifting from measurement and modelling to mitigation, because that’s where we believe we can have the most impact and deliver the most benefit.”

According to the summit’s website in the United Arab Emirates, the “best minister in the world” award was “thoroughly and independently managed by Thomson Reuters where the search for the nominees is conducted according to the established criteria”.
According to a radio interview by the “humbled” Hunt, the award was also initiated by Reuters.
“Reuters news agency said to the UAE government that they’d like to create the award and present it at the World Government Summit,” the federal environment minister said.
“They then commissioned the World Bank, the OECD, Ernst &amp; Young and an international strategic firm called Strategy and Co to draw up a list of 100 – they then winnowed it down to 10. They used a series of criteria, they had a voting program – and we didn’t know about it, and I got a call just over a week ago.”
But Thomson Reuters said it was “not correct” to say that the company initiated the award or were responsible for designing the selection process.
“Thomson Reuters was solely responsible for assisting in the administration of the award, to a set of criteria approved by the World Government Summit organisers,” said Tarek Fleihan, head of corporate communications for the financial information company in the Middle East, Africa and Russia.
Thomson Reuters promised a full clarifying statement, but has not yet issued one. Reuters news said it had no involvement in the process.
Accepting the award at the summit, Hunt said that “on a personal level I am genuinely humbled to receive this award. I am, however, deeply proud that this inaugural award is being presented to an environment minister.” 
In an interview with Fairfax Media, Hunt described his win as “really an award for Australia” and reassured readers that his wife had insisted he “still had to put the bins out”.
The website says there were nominations from 80 countries, which were assessed based on four criteria:
“The aim of this award is to recognise innovation in global government work and highlight ministerial initiatives that have resulted in positive changes in their communities,” the UAE minister of cabinet affairs, Mohammed Al Gergawi, told the summit as he gave Hunt the award.
“Our world today needs ministers to serve as role models of thought and action, which bring about progress and welfare and improve general societal wellbeing.”
Official statistics released in December revealed Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions increased in the year to the end of June 2015 by 0.8% and by 1.3% when land use and deforestation were taken into account.
On Wednesday the Greens deputy leader, Scott Ludlam, attacked Hunt’s “brazen audacity” over accepting the “best minister in the world” award. 
In a satirical address to the nation, Ludlam said while the award “might sound like something his mum made up ... on behalf of the Australian Greens I am asking you to join me in calling on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to declare February the 10th a public holiday to mark this unique occasion”.

But we do now have some clue how many myths one of those candidates, Senator Ted Cruz, can fit into an eight-minute diatribe. At least six.
When asked about climate change at recent hustings, Cruz has been delivering a stock set of answers from the Little Book of Climate Change Denial (not a real book).
At one such event in New Hampshire, the representative from Texas delivered a diarrhea-like splurge (sorry) of talking points, myths and cherry-picked factoids.
The world isn’t warming – check. This is all about government control – check. Scientists used to think an ice age was coming – check. Every pinhead contains an etching of Al Gore in a loving embrace with a dirty private jet – no check.
This is not to single out Cruz who, we understand, is currently second in national polls.
The Donald, currently leading in the polls for the Republican nomination, also denies the science of human-caused climate change. So does third placed Marco Rubio. It’s a hat trick.
We know already that denying climate science has become part of the Republican psyche in the United States, but every once in a while it’s worth pausing to remind ourselves just how nuts this situation has become. 
These are people who fancy themselves as the leader of the “free world” but think every science academy in the world together with the world’s thermometers, tide gauges and glaciers are all engaged in an elaborate hoax. 
Anyway, let’s have a look at Cruz’s Climate Clangers (this phrase is hereby released under a Creative Commons licence). 
Cruz has been using a story from Christmas 2013 to try and make climate scientists look like idiots. He says:
… an exploration ship was sent down to Antarctica to document how the polar ice caps were melting. And the people who led this exception they believed the computer models that everything would be melted so they headed on down…. They had to go and be rescued because they got stuck in the ice.
Cruz is referring to the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, but it has been abundantly clear that the scientists did not think that “everything would be melted” because, as they wrote on their expedition website and Planet Oz has pointed out before, one of their tasks was to investigate why Antarctic sea ice was growing. 
I asked Professor Chris Turney, of the University of New South Wales and who led that expedition, about Cruz’s remarks.
The Australasian Antarctic Expedition 2013-2014 made it clear from the start that we went pole wards to try and refine our understanding of why there is more sea ice in the south. We most certainly never ‘believed the computer models that everything would be melted’.
I fear Senator Cruz has confused which way is up. As I hope Senator Cruz is all too aware from his time chairing the US Senate Science and Space Sub-Committee, the Arctic is a large ocean surrounded by continents while Antarctica is a continental ice sheet surrounded by ocean. The two respond to climate change in quite different ways. 
Since satellite observations began in the 1970s, the amount of sea ice in the Arctic has suffered a long-term decline and is now at an all time low. In marked contrast, the amount of sea ice surrounding the Antarctic continent has reached an all time high.
One thing we do know is as the world’s temperatures continue to climb, weather patterns around the planet are changing and some of the biggest changes are happening in the south. Stronger winds are shifting sea ice around the Southern Ocean, helping more survive the summer. But these winds are also causing a big change in ocean circulation that appear to be melting key parts of the continental ice, making surface waters less salty and therefore easier to freeze. 
I’m sure Senator Cruz doesn’t need reminding that as scientists we’re trained to test ideas, not believe in them.
Another to have made the same claim about Turney’s expedition is conservative commentator Mark Steyn, who is currently being sued by climate scientist Michael Mann. Steyn made the exact same claim in an article in The Spectator.
Steyn was called to give evidence to a hearing of the US Senate’s science subcommittee, chaired by Cruz.
Next week, Steyn begins a speaking tour of Australia, sponsored by the “thinktank” the Institute of Public Affairs – the country’s prime pusher of climate science denial.
When it comes to global temperature readings, Cruz has his laser vision set on the satellite data, which is showing slightly less warming than the temperatures on the ground (where we live, and grow stuff).
Cruz uses this data to claim that global warming stopped 18 years ago.
But even the senior scientist who looks after the satellite data that Cruz likes to cite, says the ground-based temperature measurements are more appropriate when it comes to climate change.
Cruz does not seem so keen to mention those various collections of land-based measurements, which show, for example, that 14 of the 16 hottest years on record have all happened since 2000.
The hottest year on record was 2015, but 2016 will give that a run for its money.
Climate science deniers don’t like land-based measurements because they go through various corrective processes. Some think scientists are doing this deliberately to fiddle the numbers and show warming. Conspiracy time.
Yet Cruz and others are apparently ignorant of how scientists have to do far more fiddling around with data from satellites.
For an excellent explainer on all this, watch this Yale Climate Connections video. 
This one is an oldie but a goodie. 
Cruz has been telling people that in the 1970s “you had Liberal politicians and scientists who were talking about global cooling” and how we were “headed to another ice age”. 
While it’s true that a few scientists were writing about possible future cooling, a review of research appearing in academic journals found that between 1965 and 1979 there were more than six times as many papers saying the world was warming. Only seven academic papers in fifteen years were predicting cooling.
Cruz goes on to criticise scientists because they then “repackaged their theory” when the evidence suggested they were wrong. 
But to suggest that scientists should not change their mind when presented with evidence fundamentally challenging their ideas is a supremely odd idea.
Another favourite of climate science deniers is to suggest that climate science is a religion.
Cruz likes this line too, and seems to be suggesting that someone’s views should not be driven by a religious belief. 
Seems good advice. Guess who said this?
Life, liberty, and property, the fundamental natural rights of man are given to every one of us by God, and the role of government fundamentally is to protect those rights.
In New Hampshire, Cruz told an audience:
Anyone noticed in the last two or three years the terms magically changed? It had been global warming and then suddenly it became climate change.
Ooh. Conspiracy? Not really. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (my emphasis) was formed in 1988. Was that “two or three” years ago?
Cruz is trying to suggest there’s some underlying political motive to change the name because the world isn’t warming (when it is).
But probably the best-known example of politically motivated interference in the language of climate change comes from Cruz’s side of politics.
In 2000, the influential pollster Frank Luntz wrote a memo to Republicans saying the term “global warming” should be replaced by the “less frightening” term “climate change”. The memo was based on a report written for energy companies.
Just like magic, this PR advice was adopted by the George W. Bush administration.
As a sort of climax to his splurge, Cruz has been saying that climate change is the “perfect pseudoscientific theory” because it can “never, ever, ever be disproven.” 
This is a little bit like saying you can’t disprove that there’s a small community of genetically modified clown people living on Uranus (I suggest a quick check with a long-handled mirror).
But what would it take to “disprove” human-caused climate change? Well, here’s a few things. 
You’d have to first overturn the laws of atmospheric physics, and maybe then prove the atmosphere and oceans are not heating up, that the world’s plants and animals on the move across the world are reacting to something else (like, say, messages from Uranus), that the oceans are rising just because they fancy it and that all the recent record hot years could have just come along by chance.
Shouldn’t be too hard, eh?"

In Senate estimates on Thursday, under questioning from Labor’s Kim Carr, Marshall said 100 jobs would be cut from the oceans and atmosphere program . He said they would hire another 35 people, leaving an overall loss of 65 people.

As a result of the cuts, Marshall confirmed that the number of people working on monitoring and modelling climate change would be cut in half. 
The news comes one week after Marshall announced, in an email to staff, that there would be a shift in research priorities, away from understanding the nature of climate change, and towards adaptation and mitigation.
The announcement was quickly condemned by scientists around the world, and, unusually, by the World Meteorological Organisation, which is part of the UN.
Asked about the international criticism, Marshall said he was surprised, particularly by the criticism from the US, which he said had already led a similar shift in research priorities.
“It’s a matter of fact that the United States invests 75% of its dollar investment into the environmental area into mitigation and only 25% into modelling and monitoring,” he said.
“Over the last decade, the investment in the US in modelling and measuring has changed hardly at all – roughly 4% a year, while in contrast, the investment in mitigation technologies has changed 40% a year.”
“Given the US is playing a lead in a major shift in research priorities, this was a big part of our thinking of following that leading trend. So it surprised me to be criticised by someone who had led that trend.”
Tony Haymet from Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the US said any suggestion the US was scaling back its research into measurement and observation was wrong. He said there were some large-scale investment in mitigation technologies like carbon capture and storage, but they often weren’t successful.
“I certainly think we need to invest more in mitigation but it’s not either or,” Haymet said. “We don’t know perfectly what we need to mitigate against so we need to do both.”

Marshall also apologised for his statements made on the ABC on Thursday morning, when he compared the criticisms of the cuts to the lobbying by the fossil fuel industry against climate researchers in the 1970s. 
“There’s a lot of emotion in this debate – in fact it almost sounds more like religion than science to me,” he said earlier on the ABC. 
Senator Carr had asked Marshall if he was aware the comparison was used by climate change deniers and was uttered by former prime minister John Howard.
“I apologise for any offence I made to anyone with my reference to religion,” he said.
“It was a poor way of expressing the passion with which people feel about this,” Marshall said.

The outspoken Joyce – who to the trepidation of many colleagues has been elected leader of the rural-based Nationals party and therefore also becomes deputy prime minister in Malcolm Turnbull’s Coalition government – just got a little more publicity than he was banking on.
Frustrated that a campaign to draw attention to Australia’s veterinary quarantine laws was not getting much attention, Joyce later explained that he asked his advisers for any specific cases that might get some attention. Someone mentioned the terriers – Pistol and Boo – allegedly brought into the country by private plane and rumbled because they had been taken to a poodle parlour on the Gold Coast.
“Bingo”, Joyce said, immediately spotting the publicity opportunity, although perhaps not anticipating the infamy of a take-down skit on John Oliver’s show.
Since he entered politics in 2005 Joyce, now 48, has always said what he thinks, in the vernacular of the bloke on the street, although only in more recent years has it been apparent that he has entirely thought through the consequences.
And his relationship with the man he now serves as deputy will be fascinating to watch, because on so many things his views could not be more different from Turnbull’s.
I’m always sceptical of the idea that the way that anybody’s going to change the climate ... is bureaucrats and taxes
Turnbull lost the Liberal leadership in 2009 because he was not prepared to “lead a party that is not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am.” Joyce led the internal fight against his backing for the Labor’s carbon tax, which caused his overthrow.
During that campaign Joyce made famously outlandish claims that the tax could see the cost of lamb roasts soar to $100. When the carbon tax was eventually repealed, Joyce urged journalists to observe the weather that day. “No one thinks it is too hot,” he said. Just last year he continued to question the link between climate change, human activity and the weather, this time because it was cold.
“Look … I just – I’m always sceptical of the idea that the way that anybody’s going to change the climate – and I’m driving in this morning and we’re driving through a frost – is with bureaucrats and taxes. All that does is … it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. I make you feel guilty so I can get your money and put it in my pocket and send reports backwards and forth to one another,” he told conservative commentator Andrew Bolt.
His National party supporters have also backed the push that forced the Coalition to appoint a special wind commissioner to investigate health complaints against wind farms and have argued for a crackdown on tax concessions for green groups. 
Turnbull is a self-made millionaire and proponent of free markets. Joyce is a self declared agrarian socialist. He has campaigned against investments by foreign state-owned enterprises in Australian farms and resource projects and in favour of stronger competition laws to protect small businesses.
Turnbull wrested the Liberal leadership from Tony Abbott last year promising a calm and rational economic debate. When Joyce was the Coalition’s finance spokesman in opposition, he claimed Australia could default on its foreign debt.
“We’re going into hock to our eyeballs to people overseas. And you’ve got to ask the question how far in debt do you want to go? We are getting to a point where we can’t repay it,” he said, a warning dismissed by leading economists as both irresponsible and a nonsense.
The governor of the Reserve Bank Glenn Stevens said at the time there were “few things less likely than Australia defaulting on its sovereign debt”.
Turnbull is a strong supporter of marriage equality. Joyce is opposed and has claimed legalising marriage equality was like “passing a piece of legislation that said that a diamond is a square” and could mean Australia was seen as “decadent” in parts of south-east Asia.
In his maiden speech to parliament Joyce said abortion was “the slavery debate of our time.”
The Liberals’ main economic aim is to boost economic growth, including by encouraging non-working parents to return to their jobs, or work more hours. Joyce and the Nationals champion the rights and needs of stay-at-home mothers.
But his the earthy, plain-speaking style also creates Joyce’s appeal. He cuts through. He makes people listen. And he knows how to win his party’s rural constituency.
As the Guardian’s Gabrielle Chan reported he used a recent speech on his plans as agriculture minister to laud the family farm.
“I hear from some quarters, the day of the family farm is over, possibly walking out the door with the family business and the family house. Like journalism without grammar, the land without the family farm is meaningless, soulless, it goes to the core fabric of our nation,” he said.
The country accountant grew up in the bush, entered politics as a Queensland senator and then moved to New South Wales for the lower house seat in the federal parliament, New England, that could allow him to pursue his leadership ambitions. In his early years in parliament he regularly voted against his own party, or held out for extra concessions for country areas. But he always agonised over his dissent - during a particularly fraught debate about selling the government-owned telecommunications company Telstra in 2009 – where he wielded a decisive vote, he took himself to hospital with chest pains.
Since 2013 when he became a cabinet minister, he has learned to – for the most part and in his own way – work within the party strictures. He has curbed his excesses of language and restricted his wanderings off the approved party script.
But the Depp dog furore is a perfect example of the different approach Joyce will take to leading the Nationals – the rural-based minor party in the governing Coalition that has in recent years had a series of gentlemanly leaders who, wherever possible, have settled differences with their Coalition parties quietly, created public fusses only rarely, and international incidents never.
With the Greens making common cause with farmers battling coalmines and coal seam gas and rural-based independents nipping at their heels, there have been strongly divided views in the Nationals about whether they can survive without being quite a lot louder.
The old school Nationals have argued Joyce has not got the character or discipline to be leader. They formed an “anyone but Barnaby” faction and tried desperately to stall and stymie his determined rise to the leadership. They were deeply angered by what they thought was unseemly public pressure by Joyce for the well-respected previous leader, Warren Truss, to step aside.
But younger Nationals MPs and Senators have supported Joyce and backed his cause because they think that once the election has been run, and won, it is time for the Nationals to making a noise.
“We have to differentiate if we are to survive as a party. When we disagree we have to be prepared to say so publicly,” one said as the party prepared for the Thursday night meeting where Joyce was elected unopposed.
The government is talking up the idea that the urbane Turnbull and blunt-speaking Joyce will make a complementary team. 
While that might be the case in public style, it seems unlikely it will always be the case in policy substance. Just how far he pushes the Nationals’ desire for political “differentiation” is Joyce’s critical judgement as leader.
As for Johnny Depp’s dogs, after the international fracas died down, Joyce was awarded the Froggatt award for principled decision making by the Invasive Species Council for “acting quickly and decisively” against actor Depp and his wife, Amber Heard, for allegedly bringing their Yorkshire terriers into Australia in breach of quarantine laws. 
The chief executive of the Invasive Species Council, Andrew Cox, said Joyce was right to resist public pressure and stand up to the film star.
“It might have seemed like a bit of a joke at the time but Barnaby Joyce did the right thing by enforcing Australia’s strict quarantine laws,” Cox said."

When you stop to ponder how those piles of pumpkins, heavy bunches of carrots, or basketfuls of ripe tomatoes all start out as seeds, the realisation is humbling. When we sow seeds, the worst we can expect if things go wrong and the seeds fail to germinate is disappointment. We can try again and hope for better luck, but life goes on. In some parts of the world, if seeds fail to germinate, or crops fail to establish, those that sowed them could face death. If their seeds don’t come up, they don’t nip to the garden centre for another packet – they start living on food aid.
The prospect of having to rely on what your own garden or allotment produces, for your very survival, ought to send a shudder down the spine of even the expertly “self-sufficient” gardener. Can you begin to imagine watching your seedlings wither and die, in the sure knowledge that sometime soon you will be relying on food handouts? And will you entertain the thought that, in order to give your own seeds the best start in life, you might actually be condemning fellow “gardeners” in other parts of the world to a life of grim dependency – or worse? Hence the terrible irony writ large across the front cover of a magazine here on my desk: “Greenhouse heating: What is the true cost of protecting your crops?” The actual title of the article is equally ironic: “Heating: A high price to pay?”
Predictably, the article is actually a consideration of the different fuels available for running propagators and heating greenhouses – electricity, gas and paraffin, all of which release carbon dioxide, either through their generation or when they are burnt, as gas and paraffin are, at the point of use. The main focus of the article is on the costs of using different fuels and the types of heater available. A few brief paragraphs at the end do discuss being “environmentally friendly”, with the admission that to be completely “green” you shouldn’t heat a greenhouse at all.
The carbon dioxide produced by a gas- or paraffin-fired heater is a “greenhouse gas” in every sense. It respects no international boundaries; heating your greenhouse contributes directly to the global “greenhouse effect”. We can no longer afford to count just the economic cost of nurturing our seeds or cuttings – we need to turn the price tag over and look at the environmental and human costs.
I haven’t used a heated propagator, or heated a greenhouse other than to give minimal frost protection in extremis, for years. Nor does it worry me that I may never do so again. It’s bad news, I know, for the manufacturers of greenhouse gardening equipment, but business as usual, even in the multimillion-pound gardening industry, cannot continue. It would be good news for the planet, and it might just help ease the burden on those who depend on their ‘gardening’ to stay alive.
If you really can’t resist the urge to twiddle the thermostat dial in the coming months, at least keep it at minimum, turn it off when possible, and switch, if you’re using electricity, to a renewable supplier. This will at least help us, here in the “energy-obese” developed world, to tighten our belts. Better still, forget energy-intense artificial heating and make better use of what warm places you already have, or cut to the chase and tap directly into the sun.
One of the most effective “propagators” I’ve used, powered entirely by natural and renewable energy, is an empty compost bag turned inside out, so the heat-absorbing black side faces out. I simply slip trays or pots of seeds inside it and stand them on the sunny bench of an unheated greenhouse, polytunnel or lean-to, or in a sunny porch. Failing that, commandeer a sunny window-sill, or use a sheltered south- or west-facing wall or window-ledge. The sun will do the rest, even on cloudy but otherwise bright spring days. Simpler still, slit the bag open and lay it over your sown containers, black side up. Go put your hand into an empty inside-out bag on a sunny day and feel what I mean.
Don’t expect the same results you would get from using a heated propagator, or by heating a greenhouse to maintain a constant temperature. It will generally take longer for the seeds to come up, but come up they will. On colder nights it might be necessary to take them indoors, or to be creative with layers of fleece, cardboard and old curtains. If you’re using a lean-to greenhouse, even a modest one, think about painting the area of wall it covers black. This will absorb the sun’s energy during the day, then act as even more of a “radiator” at night, especially if it’s draped in warm layers on cold nights. Switching on to sunshine, while it might not be as constant as the power flowing through a three-pin plug, or hissing from a gas bottle, costs nothing. Not even lives.
As we consider switching off our propagators and heaters, as we think long and hard about “powering down” our garden energy use in general, we need to throw another important switch to “on”, and that’s a switch in our thinking. We need to stop trying to beat or “extend” the seasons (global warming already promises us plenty of seasonal hiccups). We need, instead, to move closer to the seasons, to become more intuitive, to plan better, and be more realistic about just what we can or can’t grow without the subsidy afforded by fossil fuels. With only a little experience we can “stretch” the growing season by using cloches, polytunnels and unheated greenhouses – any structure that catches the sun’s energy.Can we really afford, financially, ecologically, or morally, to be sowing tomato seeds in early February, just so we can pick fruits in June? Waiting another month won’t bring us to our knees, and they’ll probably taste better to boot. But our impatience to have our seeds sprinting into action, at the flick of a switch or the strike of a match, is helping to fuel the destruction of crops, in distant lands, on which life itself depends.

The finding provide new evidence on the source of the confusion and denial surrounding global warming in American public life.
In the first national survey of classroom science teachers, researchers found there was short shrift given to the teaching of climate change in public middle and high schools in all 50 states.
The survey of 1,500 teachers, published in Science on Thursday, found most pupils spend only an hour or two in the course of an academic year learning about climate change in middle and high school – and much of what they are taught is confusing or simply wrong. 
Only 38% of American schoolchildren were taught lessons that adhere to the scientific consensus that climate change is largely the result of the burning of fossil fuels, the researchers from Pennsylvania State University and the National Centre for Science Education found. 
Some 30% of teachers spent less than an hour on climate change during the last academic year, the researchers found. In higher grades, much of that time was spent going over old material without introducing more advanced material.
Some 7% attributed recent warming to natural causes – which is simply wrong – while 4% of teachers avoided talking about the cause of climate change. Another 22% said their lessons mentioned the scientific consensus – but also that there was significant disagreement among scientists, which is also incorrect. 
The findings suggest that younger generations – those most likely to experience the havoc and stress of climate change in their lifetimes – are not getting the education to best serve their needs.
Eric Plutzer, a political scientist at Penn State, and a co-author of the study, said: “We don’t think that is good preparation for citizens to be effective in advocating for policies that are going to be critical to their own generation and their children and grandchildren.”
The lack of teaching and the mixed messages about climate change leave schoolchildren more susceptible to disinformation about climate change spread by political or corporate interests once they enter adulthood, the researchers said.
The energy industry has spent millions funding climate denial and supporting Republicans in Congress who deny global warming is occurring.
Indeed, the researchers found that many of the teachers themselves were confused about the causes of climate change. Only 30% of middle school teachers and 45% of high school teachers said that human activity was the main driver of climate change, the researchers found.
Their findings are in line with other studies which have found systemic failings in the teaching of climate change. A Stanford University study of science textbooks used in California public schools last year found misleading material. 
Unlike other, more informal surveys, the researchers did not give much weight to the idea that the teachers faced political and parental pressure to avoid teaching the science. But politics remained a factor in how teachers decided to teach the material, Plutzer said. 
“Politics intrude in the same form it takes in the public debate, with teachers whether consciously or not aligning in much the same way as political groups do outside the classroom.”
However, the researchers said it would be unfair to heap the blame on teachers.
Climate science was not yet part of the testable curriculum for many schools – which means there were fewer guidelines available to teachers.
That also meant that teachers were inclined to spend more time teaching other material that students would encounter on standardized tests.
Some of the teachers were also caught out by the rapid advances in climate science. Fewer than half of teachers reported receiving any training in climate science at university, said Josh Rosenau, policy director for the National Center for Science in Education and a co-author. “The scientific community has not made sure that teachers are kept up to date with those advances,” he said, adding that there should be continuing education programs on climate change for teachers."

The European Systemic Risk Board – set up by the EU in the wake of the 2008 crash to monitor risks to financial markets – has warned in a new report of economic “contagion” if moves to a low carbon economy happen too late and abruptly.
A scramble to take fossil fuels offline could reduce energy supplies, while increasing their cost and exposing investors to the worst effects of ‘stranded assets’, or fossil fuel holdings that may never be recouped without causing climate disaster. 
Nearly 200 governments at the Paris climate summit in December agreed to bring greenhouse gas emissions down to net zero in the second half of the century, to tackle global warming.

But if governments dither and are then forced to green their economies in a rush, the study warns that banks which are exposed to ‘carbon-intensive’ or CO2-heavy assets could face systemic risks. 
To quantify the dangers, “policymakers could aim for enhanced disclosure of the carbon intensity of non-financial firms,” says the board’s report, ‘Too late, too sudden’, published on Thursday. “The related exposure of financial firms could then be stress-tested under the adverse scenario of a late and sudden transition.”
The study comes as the debate on carbon disclosures moves from the question of ‘if’ to ‘how’. A warning last December by the governor of the Bank of England that investors face huge losses from climate change was quickly followed by the creation of a new global taskforce.
Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York is leading the task force which aims to produce a voluntary industry-led code for disclosures under the rubric of the G20’s Financial Stability Board.
But the new ESRB report appears to go further, by advocating new forms of regulation.
Ben Caldecott, the director of sustainable finance at Oxford University’s Smith School, is currently researching how to locate and analyse data on firms’ carbon assets, and how to design stress tests for them.
“We need to find an answer to these questions pretty damn fast,” he told the Guardian. “Without better data on asset-level and company-level exposure to these risks, effective stress testing will be challenging. Correcting this major flaw in our understanding is now an urgent priority.”
Mandatory climate disclosure obligations were strengthened in France last July, under the country’s energy transition and green economy law. It responded to a fear that fossil fuel firms are hugely over-valued because they may never fully exploit their carbon assets without causing dangerous global warming. 
A market ‘correction’ could wipe trillions of dollars off the global economy, experts say.
The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, whose members represents over €13tn in assets, already asks businesses to address the carbon intensity of their assets and potential impacts of global warming on their operations.
 “The longer we wait to engage with this challenge, the greater the risk of abrupt change and far more costly economic adjustments later on,” said the group’s chief executive, Stephanie Pfeifer. 
Companies already have a legal duty to disclose the principal risks, according to Alice Garton, an attorney for the green law firm ClientEarth. “We expect to see carbon intensive companies reporting on these risks in their annual reports this year so investors can make informed decisions about where to invest their money,” she said."

The task agreed by consensus among 195 nations is clear, ambitious, and complex: re-engineer the infrastructure of the global economy to eliminate practices that destabilize Earth’s climate system, while ensuring ongoing and expanded prosperity for all people everywhere.
That the task is difficult should not put us back on our heels. As we move into new territory, we will face new obstacles. This is how we learn, how we know if we are up to the challenge, how we know which adjustments to make, and how we succeed in crossing an unknown ocean.
For centuries, explorers have sought to navigate the Northwest Passage—a shortcut from Europe to Asia that wouldn’t require sailing around the southern extremes of Africa or South America. For much of that time, the idea was something between a flight of fancy and a dangerously unapproachable challenge. Many have died making the attempt.
Twenty-one years ago, in the summer of 1994, a 57-foot fiberglass sailboat named Cloud Nine set sail, with captain Roger Swanson at the helm. Cloud Nine carried a crew of six, who were attempting to transit the fabled Northwest Passage from east to west. There was a tremendous amount of pack ice choking off all the routes through the Passage that summer, and the crew of Cloud Nine was forced to abandon the voyage and retreat out of the Arctic.
Thirteen years later, in the summer of 2007, Cloud Nine returned to the Arctic for another east-to-west attempt. This time around, the crew of six discovered little to no ice in the Northwest Passage. To the astonishment of those on board and of those watching their transit, the nearly 7000-mile voyage took only 73 days, and Cloud Nine never touched one piece of ice.
The Passage was wide open and completely ice-free. Cloud Nine was the first American vessel in history to complete the east-west transit of the Northwest Passage. Members of the crew acknowledged they got an assist from a changing Arctic, characterized by far less ice.
The reliable deep cold of the polar regions is part of what gives us a stable climate system: with extreme cold at the poles, the warmer climate bands of lower latitudes are more stable and defined. That defined differentiation of climate bands keeps the Polar Vortex swirling in the Arctic. Cold reinforces cold, which keeps the climate bands steady. As the Arctic warms, the warmer air mixes more readily with the climate of lower latitudes, and the Polar Vortex “bleeds” into those other latitudes, bringing deep Arctic winter to more temperate regions.
This is climate destabilization.
When Cloud Nine first ventured into the Arctic in 1994, there was limited computer and GPS technology and no satellite communication. By the time the pioneering vessel returned to the Arctic in 2007, however, the technology had changed. Through the Internet, it has become possible to study records of the Arctic’s ice extent, using photos and data mapping from satellites launched in the late 1970s. A clear downward trend was beginning to emerge by 2007.
In the 13 short years between those two sailing expeditions to the far north, there had been a forty-percent loss of summer sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. That is a 40% loss of our North Polar ice cap. This change is happening outside of Earth’s natural and geological cycles. Human activity is having a profound and sudden impact on our planetary climate systems and the Arctic is experiencing the most rapid and visible change.
We stand at the dawn of a new age of exploration. We have sailed the oceans and photographed the Earth from space. Now, we see entire regions changing so quickly, our exploration of the physical world is becoming an exploration of how Earth’s life-support systems work, where they are vulnerable, and what our choices have to do with it.
Our civilization has been designed by human beings. The design we have inherited is generating this unprecedented global challenge. How we respond requires people to work together politically.
The halls of power often resemble the Arctic—a sparsely populated remote vastness full of peril, where success is almost out of the question. It requires real moral courage to stand up and to do the work of an engaged citizen.
While staying on familiar shores is comfortable, the political challenge of getting all of this right means all of us are called to venture out. Some of us go and speak to our lawmakers. Others must build new civic spaces for shared decision-making. Even in nations transitioning from conflict to a new civil state, individuals can steer events by their presence, by giving voice to their conscience, by learning from others, and by staying engaged over time.
We have to be willing to venture into that territory that lies beyond common practice and expertise, learn as we go and begin to play an active role in shaping how we care for what Pope Francis reminds us is “our common home”.
We are all crew on a small vessel, sailing into new waters. We are climate explorers with the capacity to be spendthrifts or stewards; we can waste or rescue the natural systems that give us life as we know it. Engaged citizens working as good stewards are defenders of life.
We now know that a passive response to climate disruption is far more costly than active engagement. We cannot afford to delay any longer. We cannot afford time-consuming indulgences like pessimism or cynical naysaying. Despair is not allowed on this small boat.
The world gathered in Paris—defying the threat of another violent attack—in defense of life. The terms are set for those daring souls who will engage in redesigning our politics, our industry, and our economics.
Safe passage will require imagination, collaboration, and perseverance.
Welcome to the new age of exploration.

Paying tribute to Scalia, President Obama said he would nominate a successor. In the Senate and on the campaign trail, however, Republicans said they would not cooperate, even to the extent of scheduling a nomination hearing in the upper house they control, at any point in the president’s final year in office.
We could be in for a year or more with only eight justices on the supreme court, balanced four-four between conservatives and liberals. What will this – and the political identity of Scalia’s eventual successor – mean for the key issues that divide America today?
It is the most significant abortion case in 23 years, and the supreme court will have to make its decision without the man who has defined its conservative voice for decades.
The high court is preparing to hear a challenges to Texas’s harsh anti-abortion law – perhaps the toughest in the nation. In the immediate wake of Scalia’s passing, it was clear what the loss could mean. At Saturday night’s Republican presidential debate in South Carolina, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas warned: “We are one justice away from a supreme court that will strike down every restriction on abortion adopted by the states.”
Whoever replaces Scalia, however, may join the court only after the eight remaining justices strike a decisive blow to the anti-abortion movement.
The Texas case concerns a 2013 law that required all abortion providers to have a physician with hospital admitting privileges and to follow the hospital-like regulations governing ambulatory surgical centers. Only the first provision of the bill is in effect, and it has closed more than half of Texas’s 41 abortion clinics.
What makes the Texas case so consequential is that it asks the justices to clarify how far a state can go in restricting abortion before a law becomes unconstitutional. In 1992, in Planned Parenthood v Casey, the court gave states the right to restrict abortion in the interest of the woman’s health as long as the restriction was not an “undue burden” on abortion access.
Lower courts have been using different standards of evidence to decide what makes a law a health measure as opposed to an “undue burden”. In the case of the Texas law, the fifth circuit court of appeals ruled that courts did not need to scrutinize the evidence for the law as long as Texas lawmakers felt that they were passing a necessary health measure. (Major medical associations have argued that there is no evidence the Texas law will make abortion safer than it already is.) Other federal courts have ruled the opposite, and struck down similar anti-abortion measures.
For those hoping that the court will halt the spread of harsh anti-abortion laws, the basic arithmetic hasn’t changed. Anthony Kennedy, the court’s moderate, would still need to side with the four liberal justices for a 5-3 ruling against Texas’s law and setting broad limits on other laws like it. The broadest possible ruling would invalidate similar measures that have been challenged in Alabama, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Wisconsin, laws that together threaten more than 20 clinics. Such a ruling would make it far more difficult to pass new restrictions.
For abortion foes, Scalia’s death has sharply narrowed the range of good outcomes. The best they can hope for is probably a 4-4 split, with Kennedy joining the conservative minority.
In the event of a tie, the decision that is being appealed takes effect. The Texas law would go fully into effect, and all but nine or 10 clinics in the state would have to shut down. But a tie does not set a nationwide precedent, meaning the question of how far states can go in regulating abortion will be left unanswered.
Moreover, those laws that would have shut down more than 20 clinics across the south and midwest will remain blocked: a 5-4 conservative ruling for would have allowed those laws to take effect. Abortion foes, in other words, are missing out on a chance to drastically remap abortion access in America. In Louisiana and Alabama, the number of abortion clinics would have dropped from five to one. Mississippi, which has one clinic today, would have become the first state without any abortion providers despite Roe v Wade, the 1973 case that established a right to abortion.
There is a similar test case available to the court, concerning an admitting privileges law in Mississippi. The court could vote to hear that case in its new term beginning in October, when the bench may be full again. The court could also postpone the Texas case until then.
Abortion is sure to come up as the Senate considers whoever President Obama nominates to take Scalia’s place. In modern nominations, the potential justice’s leanings on abortion have always been hugely contentious. But whoever is the next justice to join the court might not see an abortion case this big for decades. Molly Redden
When the supreme court ruled in 2008 that the second amendment gives Americans an individual right to own a firearm, it was Antonin Scalia who wrote the historic and controversial majority opinion. The decision in District of Columbia v Heller, which struck down a local handgun ban, was 5-4.
It was also Scalia who last month joined Clarence Thomas’s strongly worded dissent when the supreme court chose not to reconsider a seventh circuit court of appeals decision that an Illinois city’s assault weapon ban was constitutional.
“If a broad ban on firearms can be upheld based on conjecture that the public might feel safer (while being no safer at all), then the second amendment guarantees nothing,” the dissent argued. 
Scalia’s death throws the supreme court’s divided stance on the second amendment into question.
Dave Kopel, an attorney and gun rights advocate, was part of the legal team that won a historic victory in the Heller case.
“President Obama has said he believes the second amendment is an individual right, but in terms of what he thinks it protects, it’s a vanishingly small right,” he said. “The politics of what happens in a confirmation process is unclear, but based on the past, we can expect that he will appoint someone who will pay lip service to the second amendment and then vote to overturn Heller.”
Kopel said he testified in the Senate confirmation hearings of Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Sotomayor, he said, “told the Senate that she considered Heller settled precedent”, but then voted against it “at the first opportunity”, when she joined the dissent in the 2010 McDonald v Chicago case, which clarified that the second amendment individual right established in the Heller case also applied to the states.
Since the Heller and McDonald cases, the supreme court has dodged several opportunities to further clarify the scope of the second amendment, prompting questions among legal observers about whether the court has become gun-shy.
While the supreme court does not have any cases immediately on deck that involve the second amendment, Kopel said, there are gun rights cases in the pipeline, including the appeal of a second circuit decision upholding assault weapon bans in New York and Connecticut.
Scalia’s loss has shifted his perspective on the security of gun rights in the US, he said.
“Of course it’s concerning,” he said. “It was only a 5-4 decision.” Lois Beckett
In April, the supreme court is expected to hear arguments on the White House’s plan to defer deportation for millions of illegal immigrants. In theory, Scalia’s death might not have a big impact on the issue. 
Only five votes are required to uphold Obama’s decision to use executive power to allow up to 5 million more immigrants to apply for quasi-legal status and work permits. 
Obama can count on the four liberal members of the court to back his move. If the administration can win the support of Anthony Kennedy or John Roberts, the chief justice, the president will be able to move forward. Otherwise, the plan will be blocked. 
Either way, the decision could redefine the balance of power between the executive and legislature. Obama’s critics accuse him of consistently overstepping his authority. Texas attorney general Ken Paxton, for example, has urged the court to make it clear that no president can “unilaterally rewrite congressional laws and circumvent the people’s representatives”.
Obama’s program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or Dapa, would allow as many as five million undocumented migrants to apply for work permits. 
In 2014, Obama told millions of undocumented migrants: “You can come out of the shadows.”
But the plan was almost immediately challenged. Obama asked the court to move quickly on the issue – to which the court agreed – but it also added in the question of the constitutionality of Obama’s effort to force the programme into law.
Democratic presidential candidates have said they would continue the programme if it is upheld by the court. Most of the Republicans in the race have vowed to dismantle it and redouble immigration enforcement. 
In the event that a decision is not taken, Scalia’s absence could also the block the executive from introducing similar moves. Edward Helmore
One of Scalia’s last acts on the bench was to issue a stay ruling that could send Obama’s clean power plan, which regulates carbon emissions from power plants, back to a lower court. The court’s stay order came in 5-4 vote, reflecting a split between the liberal and conservative wings, with no explanation given. It left the administration without a back-up plan.
Obama referred to the decision as “unusual”, but sought to comfort supporters that the administration remains confident the legislation will ultimately succeed. 
Still, the stay has left supporters of the clean power regulations in a difficult situation. The supreme court issued stay after a lower court refused to do so – the first time court justices have issued a stay before any court heard arguments. 
While the Clean Power Plan registers broad public support, the legislation has been opposed by 26 states and the energy industry and 15 attorneys general are in support of efforts to limit electricity sector responsibility for nearly a third of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. The clean power plan is the centrepiece of the administration’s efforts to address climate change – and Obama’s environmental legacy. 
If the decision is kicked back to the lower DC circuit court of appeals, it could favour the administration. The DC panel is made up of mostly Democratic appointees, and is likely to dismiss the states’ argument that the clean power plan is illegal and represents federal government overreach. In that event, though, the supreme court would still have to overturn its stay – which would be problematic if Scalia’s seat remains empty.
But the supreme court’s stay has also rendered the Environmental Protection Agency unable to enforce any part of the bill until the litigation is over – marking a significant victory for opponents of regulation to restrict greenhouse gas emissions. Edward Helmore"

The advice is that, as with terrorism, we assess these risks on a worst-case scenario and then plan our actions to counter them.
The brief is a follow up to a hard-hitting report Climate Change, a Risk Assessment, which described the frightening consequences to the human race of the temperature rises we can expect this century. It says we need to plan our actions now to counter these dangers.
The report was compiled by four experts, including Sir David King, formerly the UK’s chief scientific adviser, and, although commissioned by the Foreign Office, came with the disclaimer that “it should not be taken to represent the views of the UK government”.
Governments of all political hues, starting with Mrs Thatcher, have a history of commissioning influential reports on climate change. They come with copper-bottomed and far-reaching recommendations about action that will safeguard the British public (and the rest of the planet) from the dangers of overheating, and then they are almost totally ignored by the politicians that paid for them. The Stern Report on the economics of climate change, ordered by Gordon Brown, when he was chancellor, being the best-known example.
These dangers to Britain are no longer all long-term. Flooding and mass migration are already happening. Food shortages and sea level rise only require extreme weather events to take them from the list of probable events to stories that will dominate the news; but yet another report is probably destined to gather dust."

 The commission will tell foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday that a Europe-wide debate is needed on how to limit global warming to 1.5C, according to a staff working document for ministers seen by the Guardian. 
 It was written in response to last December’s Paris climate summit, which agreed a plan for cutting emissions to net zero after mid-century, and an intent to peg global warming to 1.5C.
Temperatures have already risen by 1C since pre-industrial times and slamming the brakes on climate change “is by no means an easy undertaking”, the document says.
“It will require exploring possibilities for realising ‘negative’ emissions as well as profound lifestyle changes of current generations.”
Negative emissions can refer to carbon capture and storage technology powered by biomass, geo-engineering of the atmosphere and oceans, or CO2 removal that sucks emissions out of the air. 
A review of the ambition of the bloc’s pledge to cut CO2 emissions by at least 40% from 1990 levels by 2030 will be crucial, the paper adds. This will take place after a report is published by the UN’s climate panel, the IPCC, in 2018. 
“There is no requirement that the EU updates its 2030 headline target as a result of this process in 2020, but the timeframe presents the EU with an opportunity to do so,” it says.
The decade’s end will be “the only significant political moment before 2030 to leverage more ambition from other major economies like China and India,” as well as the US and Brazil, the document states.
 However, the European commission is known to already be developing scenarios for increased emissions cuts through energy savings and a new renewable energy directive. In that context, green groups said they were disappointed that action on the hard-won 1.5C target was being delayed.
 “The EU has to redo its homework and set out a pathway to meet stricter energy efficiency and renewables targets,” said Greenpeace EU’s climate policy adviser, Bram Claeys. “We can’t have confidence in a plan that plays fast and loose with global warming and fails to accelerate Europe’s shift to 100% renewable energy.”
Wendel Trio, the director of Climate Action Network-Europe, said: “Like all other countries, the EU needs to ensure its policies are coherent with what was agreed in Paris, and needs to substantially increase its targets for 2020, 2030 and 2050. This discussion needs to take place now, and not be postponed for another three to five years as the European commission is proposing.”
EU leaders are expected to discuss the possibility of raising the EU’s 2030 target at a summit on 17-18 March. But powerful figures in the commission will try to ensure this happens through a revision of the bloc’s carbon market rules in 2023.
 
The EU’s climate chief, Miguel Arias Cañete, has already signalled that he would like the union to ratify the Paris climate agreement at a conference in New York on 22 April.
 “It is in the EU’s interest to join early, alongside major economies such as the US and China, and alongside other ‘high ambition’ countries,” the paper says. Other legal scenarios could also allow the agreement to enter into force without the EU’s participation.
Decisions to increase climate ambition will be hard fought, with coal-dependent countries such as Poland likely to dig their heels in. 
“The potential scale of such a deep transformation will require a wide societal debate in Europe,” says the document, which was jointly prepared by the European commission and its foreign office, the European external action service.
A 2C rise in global temperatures could have consequences including the migration of 20% of the world’s population from cities flooded by sea level rise, such as New York, London and Cairo, according to a study published this month."

Along the way he has endured attacks of giant flesh-eating bee-flies, paddled a raft 60 miles in driving Siberian rain, braved volcanoes in Alaska, and inhaled polluted air in China for weeks on end, all the while hauling pounds of rocks. And all in the name of Science.
The date he seeks plays extremely hard to get.
In Siberia, Seth and his colleagues whacked off rocks from cliffs in dozens of mosquito-infested riverbanks scattered across over a thousand miles of Siberia, and hauled them back to MIT in Massachusetts. He pulverized his rocks to free tiny zircon crystals and then baked them before bathing them in ultra-pure hydrofluoric acid (an acid so powerful that it dissolves glass) for two days. He then took his cleaned-up gems to the University of Arizona, where he inspected each and every tiny grain under a microscope and then zapped it with a laser and sucked the vapor into a machine called a “LaserChron.”
Sadly, not a single gem was worthy.
“So all that work really for naught!” Seth told me when I met him in the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco in December.
The date Seth was pursuing was the age of the most cataclysmic event to hit the Earth since animals evolved. No, not the end-Cretaceous when the dinosaurs were annihilated, a much bigger catastrophe even than that: the end-Permian mass extinction, when more than 90% of species ceased to exist. It was a time when severe global warming made oceans as hot as the legal limit of a hot tub, and gasses from Siberian volcanic eruptions were the suspected culprit. To convict the eruptions, Seth needed to see if they occurred just before the mass extinction, at a precision never before achieved.
Obviously it makes sense if you want to date the onset of the eruption and tie that time in Earth history to when the mass extinction occurred, you want to date the first stuff to erupt. 
But that stuff formed so explosively that it’s now a jumble of volcanic ash and shattered sediments, and unfortunately for Seth it turns out that those sediments brought with them all those unworthy zircons. Seth told me,
There were zircons that ranged in age from about 260 million years old to 2.5 billion. It’s just a hodge-podge of stuff.
Undeterred, Seth moved on to find a date for the 2 ½-mile-thick, thousand-mile-wide layer cake of the Siberian lavas. But the lavas had no zircons, so he had to settle for perovskite crystals instead.
So we had to go to kind of like the ugly stepsister. But in the absence of the cute sister maybe the ugly sister is not so bad! You’re hard up, so that’s where you’ve got to go!
To cut a long story short, Seth did get his date – several in fact. Some of them were actually from zircons extracted from volcanic ash he found sandwiched between layers of lava.
And what those dates proved was that an unconscionable quantity of lava erupted in what geologists call a ridiculously short period of time – about 300,000 years or less - and yes, right before the mass extinction. The eruptions delivered a huge slug of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere, far more than humans could even if we were to burn all our fossil fuels, which explains the hot tub ocean temperatures. The eruptions were so relentless that there wasn’t any time for soil to develop between lava flows.
It’s a similar story in Antarctica, where lavas of the “Ferrar Large Igneous Province” have been tied to a minor (but still global) mass extinction known as the Toarcian Extinction.
Every single rock I dated from the Ferrar, and we’re talking up the mountain, down in the ravine, from one side of the continent to the other, along the Transantarctic Mountains - they’re all 182.6 million years old! It’s every single rock the same! And we’ve already talked about how much work it is to date one frigging rock! And when I date 22 of them and they’re the same age, and they’re from all over the place in the Transantarctic Mountains it gives me a great sense of: it’s all in one shot! It’s not a big slow prolonged event.
Seth’s dating quest, and similar travails by other geochronologists, have now proven the close link in time between several mass extinctions in Earth’s past and huge eruptions, including for the end-Cretaceous extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs. In that example geochronologists have tied the famous Chicxulub asteroid impact date to the same time as gargantuan eruptions in India, suggesting that the impact may have aggravated the eruptions. So it seems the dinosaurs were extinguished by the original “double whammy.”
The worrying thing for us today is that almost all these mass extinctions seem to have involved global warming. To understand them better, and to be able to compare their greenhouse gas emission rates to ours, we’re going to need a lot more dates.
Everything is rate-dependent in Earth history. We could date them all, but it’s time consuming and expensive to do it to the utmost precision. It takes a hell of a lot of time, it’s hard work, and it doesn’t always work!
But Seth, and geochronologists like him, continue their quest undaunted.

Yet many of the smallest and most at-risk countries in the world now claim that they do not have the means to access these funds directly. 
“It’s a paradox,” said Anote Tong, the president of Kiribati in December. “We need [the funds] the most but we don’t have the capacity to get it because we’re not accredited.” Tong added that the accreditation process involves so much bureaucracy it is a significant challenge for low-resourced governments. 
 Later, when told of Tong’s words by the Guardian, representatives of the governments of Tonga, the Comoros and Grenada all said they shared his concerns.
The GCF, which became operational in 2015, is funded by developed countries and aims to assist developing countries with climate change mitigation and adaptation projects, such as early-warning systems for climate-related disasters. 
For a country to directly access GCF finance, it must first nominate a “national designated authority” – usually an existing government department like the finance or environment ministry – which then nominates an institution for accreditation. 
That institution is reviewed by the GCF’s accreditation panel, self-described as independent and technical. The nominated institutions include a variety of local, regional, public and private institutions such as Rwanda’s ministry of national resources or Namibia’s Environmental Investment Fund.
The difficulty lies in demonstrating that these institutions comply with the GCF’s fiduciary and gender policy standards, and that they can apply the relevant environmental and social safeguards. These measures – to guard against corruption, among other problems – are outlined in the 52-page application form. 
Institutions must prove they have: a track record of delivering mitigation and adaptation projects, a fully functional independent audit committee with plans for the past three years, various procurement committees, relevant guidelines and data on complaints handled in the past two years, examples of conflicts of interest in the past two years and how they were dealt with – and so on.
Kashmala Kakakhel, a climate finance fellow at the Women’s Environment and Development Organisation, says that some of the recently accredited national entities, from India and Namibia for example, had told her that the accreditation process was “excruciatingly painful”.
The pain doesn’t have to be endured alone, help is available. The World Resources Institute, for example, is working on climate-finance readiness in Kenya, the Philippines and Fiji – funded by the German government. In Kenya, it is working with the National Environment Management Agency (Nema) to help the government access and use GCF finance effectively. It has hosted workshops for Nema staff, helped clarify the agency’s decision-making process and connected it with institutions from other countries in a similar position, so they can learn from each others’ experiences.
The GCF also has a special US$30m “readiness programme” to support developing countries’ institutions through the accreditation process. As of December 2015, 95 countries had expressed an interest in support from this programme and 33 have had their requests approved. This financing will be distributed in 2016 and comes from the funds donated by developed countries – the maximum a country can receive is $300,000. 
The purpose [of the GCF] was that any of these small nations should be able to access the fund directly
According to Anoop Poonia, climate finance coordinator at the Climate Action Network, support should be more long term and on-site than it currently is. Ideally, an expert should be present in the country for months, if not years, and ensure an institution is accredited before they leave. Micronesia is one of the first examples where this long-term support is being planned, and a local consultant will be hired to work on the country’s accreditation for two years. 
But as two years is a long delay, other countries are opting for the alternative route of direct access – through multilateral institutions that have the means to become accredited quickly. For example, the GCF recently gave a $31m grant for a new river water intake station, waste water treatment plant and sewer coverage in Fiji. The Fijian government was only able to access the grant through a partnership with the Asian Development Bank, one of several international banks to have become accredited already.
This goes against the spirit in which the GCF was founded, says Poonia. “The purpose [of the GCF] was that any of these small nations should be able to access the fund directly,” he says. “In the past, the experiences of communities who have historically been facing injustice, whether indigenous peoples or communities in far-flung areas outside of the commercial mainstream, were always left out or their voices and concerns were never really heard.” 
Simplifying the accreditation process would perhaps be the biggest help and this plea has been heard by the GCF’s executive director and secretariat. The final text of the Paris agreement also urges institutions like the GCF “to support country-driven strategies through simplified and efficient application and approval procedures”. 
Despite this pressure, simplification is far from certain, according to ActionAid’s international climate policy manager, Harjeet Singh, and others. “Since accountability to donors as well as to poor people is of prime importance it is unlikely that the fiduciary standards will be relaxed for poor countries,” says Singh. “Instead of expecting the rules to be simpler, it seems that poor countries will have to learn to play the game the hard way.”

The island nation’s parliament unanimously agreed to ratify the Paris agreement on Friday, according to local news reports.
The motion was proposed by the country’s attorney general, Aiyaz Sayed Khaiyum. He told parliament that it would need to ratify the treaty ahead of a signing ceremony in April in New York, where Fiji’s prime minister, Voreqe Bainimarama, will formally sign the document on behalf of the country.
He said tackling climate change was a major priority for the archipelago, which could face wide-scale flooding, fiercer tropical storms, and depleting fish stocks as a result of the world’s changing climate.
The process marks the beginning of an expected wave of ratification votes as other countries prepare for their attendance at the New York ceremony.
In order to formally take effect, the Paris agreement needs at least 55 countries, representing at least 55% of the world’s climate emissions, to ratify the treaty. Observers are confident the milestone can be passed in time for the New York event, given all the world’s major economies expressed full support for the Paris agreement at last year’s summit in the French capital.
Under its national climate action plan, Fiji pledged to generate 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. It also promised to cut overall emissions from its energy sector by 30% by 2030 compared to business-as-usual, conditional on it receiving climate finance from industrialised nations.

With completion originally scheduled for this year, just how much of the once-revolutionary vision has actually been realised?";"Years from now passing travellers may marvel at the grandeur and the folly of the futuristic landscape on the edges of Abu Dhabi: the barely occupied office blocks, the deserted streets, the vast tracts of undeveloped land and – most of all – the abandoned dream of a zero-carbon city.
Masdar City, when it was first conceived a decade ago, was intended to revolutionise thinking about cities and the built environment.
Now the world’s first planned sustainable city – the marquee project of the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) plan to diversify the economy from fossil fuels - could well be the world’s first green ghost town.
As of this year - when Masdar was originally scheduled for completion - managers have given up on the original goal of building the world’s first planned zero-carbon city.
Masdar City is nowhere close to zeroing out its greenhouse gas emissions now, even at a fraction of its planned footprint. And it will not reach that goal even if the development ever gets fully built, the authorities admitted.
“We are not going to try to shoehorn renewable energy into the city just to justify a definition created within a boundary,” said Chris Wan, the design manager for Masdar City.
“As of today, it’s not a net zero future,” he said. “It’s about 50%.”
 When Masdar City began, in 2006, the project was touted as a model for a green mixed-use urban landscape: a global hub for the cleantech industry, with 50,000 residents and 40,000 commuters.
Foster + Partners designed a car-free city scape, with Jetson-style driverless electric cars shuttling passengers between buildings incorporating built-in shades and kitted out with smart technologies to resist the scorching desert heat, and keep cooling costs down.
Mubadala, Abu Dhabi’s state-owned investment company, pledged financial support to the estimated $22bn experiment in urban design.
Ten years on, however, only a fraction of the town has been built - less than 5% of the original six square km “greenprint”, as Wan called it. The completion date has been pushed back to 2030.
The core of Masdar City is in place, anchored by the large square-ish building that is the Middle East headquarters of Siemens. A 45-metre Teflon-coated wind tower helps channel cooling breezes down a shaded street equipped with a grocery store, bank, post office, a canteen, and a couple of coffee shops.
As many as 300 other firms such as GE’s Ecomagination and Lockheed Martin also have an official presence – though Wan acknowledged that in many cases that just amounts to a hot desk.
The International Renewable Energy Agency took over the other major building for its shimmering steel headquarters last year.
Irena chose Abu Dhabi as its base, after Masdar promised a state-of-the-art sustainable building. The six-storey headquarters uses only one-third of the energy of comparable office buildings in Abu Dhabi – thanks to air-tight insulation and high-efficiency elevators. The design rejected overhead lamps, to encourage use of natural lighting, and called for solar water heaters on the roof.
By UAE standards, both the Siemens and the Irena buildings are state-of-the-art in terms of optimising energy use – but it’s less clear how they stack up globally. The UAE uses its own ratings system which does not readily translate to more familiar green building standards.
In addition, the agency’s 90 or so staffers are the only occupants of the six-storey, 32,000m space. Fewer than 2,000 people work on the campus, according to tour guides.
Only 300 live on-site, all graduate students of the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, who are given free tuition and accommodation. 
The pioneering autonomous transport system - which was originally supposed to stretch to 100 stations - was scrapped after the first two stops. 
There is a bike-sharing station – though it’s a good 10 miles away from Abu Dhabi, and there are no bike paths. 
And the rationale for Masdar City – demonstrating a model of green living – has been abandoned. “The original aim was to be net zero, yes, but that was when we were looking at the city in isolation,” Wan said.
He maintained it was important to look at Masdar City within the context of the other renewable energy holdings of the parent company. Among Mubadala’s other holdings, Masdar Clean Energy is developing the Shams solar farm.
“Masdar as a family company is supply[ing] much, much more clean energy than what is being consumed in the city, for sure,” Wan said. “All I am saying is that we are not going to use a city line boundary to try to dictate what is the most cost-effective way to produce clean energy, because the money invested in Masdar City and the money invested in Shams is the same source.”
He went on: “In the bigger picture I am doing more good for the country and for planet Earth because it’s much more efficient.”
Long before the drop in oil prices, the UAE led the oil-producing Gulf countries in moving their economy away from fossil fuels.
The country’s leaders, staring at the prospect that their estimated reserves could run out in 50 years, invested in tourism, tech and renewable energy. Today about 70% of GDP comes from non-oil sectors, according to Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE prime minister.
The country is eager to be seen as a leader in renewable energy and sustainability, convening regular leadership retreats to discuss their future beyond oil.
In January the country’s prime minister tweeted:
Celebrating the last barrel of oil, as my brother Mohammed bin Zayed has said, we will build a sustainable economy for future generations.
The UAE spent $20bn on a nuclear power plant, still under construction, projected to produce close to 25% of its electricity by 2020. The country is also building what has been billed as the world’s biggest solar farm in Dubai, and to install rooftop solar on every home in the emirate by 2030.
The first 25 families have moved into a net-zero emissions residential neighbourhood in Dubai, with plans for a solar-powered hotel and school. “Whether we are an oil state or not, we need to take care of the Earth and future generations,” said Emil Samarah, one of the developers.
With the downward pressure from oil prices, the UAE has stepped up its efforts to wean itself off oil, lifting fossil fuel subsidies and billing Emiratis – not just expatriates – for water and electricity.
But delivering on the original dream of Masdar has been elusive. Crews broke ground in 2008, but plans withered in the global economic recession which soon followed when investors put their green dreams on hold. “A lot of the people who were considering investing in Masdar City decided to take a breather,” Wan said. 
Meanwhile, the jet-set transport system was overtaken by technological developments in the auto sector. The expensive purpose-built system no longer made sense in an era when zero-emission electric cars were widely available. “Five years ago it’s true that we did not perceive the speed with which the electric vehicle would be developed,” Wan said. 
But he insisted that Masdar was not a total failure. “Masdar is part of an evolutionary process,” he said. "

Speaking to journalists in Brussels, Todd Stern also said that a recent supreme court decision to block Barack Obama’s clean power plan would not affect US climate pledges, or plans to formally sign up to the Paris agreement later this year.
Republican candidates such as Trump or Cruz who query climate science on the presidential stump would in practice be “very loathe” to set off the storm that would follow any ditching of the Paris accord, Stern argued.
 “Paris as an agreement has such broad acceptance and support around the world from countries of every stripe and region and Paris itself was seen as such a landmark - hard-fought, hard-won - deal that for the US to turn around and say ‘we are withdrawing from Paris’ would inevitably give the country a diplomatic black eye,” he said.
 “When President Bush took the US out of Kyoto – which in retrospect was in fact a quite flawed document - he took lots and lots of diplomatic flak and that, I think, would pale in comparison to what would happen if a president took us out of Paris, which is seen as a strong viable structure that all countries have now bought into.”
Trump, the current frontrunner in the Republican race, described President Obama’s speech to the Paris climate summit last December as “one of the dumbest statements I’ve ever heard.”
And Cruz, who won the Iowa caucus, has promised to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, describing Obama’s focus on securing a global accord as “nutty”.
 
 EU sources say that there is “significant concern” in Brussels about the possibility of either candidate winning the election in November.
 “I think everyone is a bit worried about what might happen next,” one official told the Guardian. “Everyone wants to make sure that we aren’t left alone in a deal we all negotiated together.”
 The EU is anxious to avoid a Kyoto protocol-type situation where it was the only significant global player obliged to make emissions cuts, after the US and others failed to join in. 
“There’s a sense that if the US did not join [Paris] it might discourage other major economies like China and possibly India and Brazil from joining,” the source said.
 International attention has been focused on the recent US court’s blocking decision which, if sustained, could cast doubt on at least a third of the emissions cuts promised by the US government in Paris.
 Diplomats in China and India have even questioned whether the deal could survive the reassessment of US commitments that this would entail.
 Stern pointed out though that the death of the supreme court justice Antonin Scalia earlier this week created the possibility of a “more than slight change to procedural posture” in the supreme court. There is currently a 4-4 balance between liberal and republican judges on the court benches, with President Obama expected to try to appoint a ninth judge in the spring.
 “It is hard to tell how this is going to play out, but the supreme court is in a different place right now,” Stern said.
 He maintained though that the US government had anticipated litigation over its power plant emission cuts - if not the legislative stay granted - and was confident in the underlying strength of its position. 
 “We think we are going to prevail in the court but we are going to go ahead and sign the agreement this year. Period. And we are not in any way going to back away from our 2025 targets,” he said.
 References to a capping of global warming a 1.5C in the Paris text were “not a requirement, but a kind of urging,” Stern stated.
 The US state department has begun an internal conversation about the domestic measures needed by 2050 if the US is to play its part in making this happen. A formal review may begin later this year. "

The plans were immediately attacked by green campaigners, who contrasted the continued role of fossil fuels with commitments to cut carbon dioxide made by the EU at the Paris climate summit two months ago.
Gas will have to be imported, from sources including Russia, Norway, Qatar and other Gulf states, under plans set out in the commission’s “Sustainable Energy Security Package”.
This will require tens of billions of euros of investment in infrastructure, including new cross-border pipelines, and the development of terminals for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Most LNG currently comes from the Gulf but which in future could also be supplied from the shale fields of the US.
Miguel Arias Cañete, EU climate change commissioner, acknowledged the problems with gas supply that have haunted Europe in the recent past, such as Russia turning off supplies to the Ukraine for political ends. But he said that the renewed focus on diversifying supply and on constructing storage facilities would improve energy security.
“After the gas crises of 2006 and 2009 that left many millions out in the cold, we said never again. But we are still far too vulnerable to major disruption of gas supplies, and the political tensions on our borders are a sharp reminder that this problem will not just go away,” he said. “Today’s proposals are about a reliable, competitive and flexible system in which energy flows across borders and consumers reap the benefits. They are about standing together to protect the most vulnerable. They are about securing our clean energy future.”
While gas is a lower carbon fuel than coal, the implication of such a massive new investment in gas infrastructure is that its use will continue for decades to come. This could open up conflicts with the EU’s targets on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, enshrined in last December’s Paris accord, which the EU played a major role in bringing about.
Dustin Benton, head of energy and resources at the Green Alliance thinktank, told the Guardian: “This doesn’t deliver on the commission’s promise for an efficiency-first energy security strategy. Better markets for gas can help keep EU energy secure if combined with continued renewable energy growth, but this strategy won’t stop us wasting power stations worth of energy.”
A contrast with the Paris agreement, at which the EU pledged to hold future temperature increases to no more than 2C or 1.5C, was inevitable, said Jiri Jerabek, energy policy adviser at Greenpeace EU. “It’s like the Paris agreement never happened, and the commission is stuck on gas, dishing out a costly proposal that will keep Europe hooked on energy imports. Only if Europe focuses on renewables and energy efficiency will Europe meet its climate targets and reduce dependence on foreign supplies.”
Claude Turmes, energy spokesman for the Green MEP grouping in the European parliament, called the strategy “rolling out the red carpet for Gazprom”, Russia’s national energy giant. “The commission is basing its strategy on a huge over-estimation of demand for gas. Instead of pumping millions into projects that are doomed to fail, they should wait until new, more credible estimates for gas demand can be formulated.”
Organisations focused on energy efficiency - under the previous commission, known as one of the “three pillars” of energy policy for 2020 - were disappointed at what they saw as a lack of commitment to reducing energy use. Proponents of renewable energy - another key target under the 2020 plans - also found little cheer in the new package.
Dr David Clarke, chair of a Royal Academy of Engineering group on UK energy policy, told the Guardian that if gas use was to be continued at such levels in Europe, then fledgling technology for capturing and storing greenhouse gas emissions would become essential. He said: “If we are to meet 2050 carbon reduction targets it becomes necessary to completely eliminate CO2 from power generation. The post-2030 use of fossil fuels in power generation becomes increasingly challenging without the ability to implement CCS. Given that a logical part of replacing coal-fired capacity in the 2020s will be to build new gas-fired plant, it is important we progress demonstration of CCS on gas at the earliest opportunity.”
Last November, days ahead of the Paris climate summit, the chancellor,George Osborne, cancelled the government-sponsored £1bn competition to build the first power-station scale CCS plant in the UK. There are now no major CCS projects at an advanced stage in Europe.
About half of Europe’s energy goes to heating and cooling old and leaky buildings, according to the European Insulation Manufacturers Association. Jan te Bos, director general, said: “Buildings are Europe’s largest single user of energy so it is encouraging that the commission published a heating and cooling strategy as part of today’s package. What is needed next are concrete proposals for an EU wide building renovation plan ideally with targets - otherwise the strategy wastes a unique opportunity to properly reduce European dependence on energy imports.”"

The Victorian wine industry is partway through what could shape up to be its earliest vintage on record, thanks to an exceptionally warm spring and warm summer.
Grape growers are also experiencing a compressed vintage with typically later-ripening red grape varieties demanding to be picked at the same time as earlier varieties such as chardonnay, causing congestion in the crushing bay as three months of grapes arrive in three weeks.
Snow Barlow, honorary professor of agriculture and food systems at Melbourne University, said vintage dates had been shifting forward at a gradually accelerated rate over the past 30 years and the trend was set to continue, with grapes ripening an average of seven days earlier for every degree the climate warmed.
“They clearly are the canary in the cage,” he told Guardian Australia. “You can say what you will about climate change but the plants don’t lie, they just react to what they feel, and they are reacting again.”
A 2011 study by Barlow’s Melbourne University colleague, Leanne Webb, examined the vintage records of 44 vineyards, some of which went back as far as 115 years, and found that grapes had ripened at a rate of 1.7 days a year earlier between 1993 and 2009. 
A later study, led by Webb and co-authored by Barlow, found that change was driven by a warmer temperatures and lower soil moisture content, even accounting for an industry-wide shift towards picking earlier to get low-alcohol wines.
“It does mean that for particular varieties you really do have to think about moving,” Barlow said.
“It sounds a bit ho-hum in some ways but the climate is changing and you really do have to analyse carefully when you are looking to set up an agricultural enterprise not only whether this is the place to do it now but whether this is still going to be the place to do it in 25 years time – whether you are going to have access to the water you need in 25 years.
SA wine companies are looking at the Adelaide Hills and thinking well, do we really have enough water there?
“The South Australian wine companies are looking at the Adelaide Hills and thinking well, do we really have enough water there?”
The same trends have been observed in Europe, where records have been kept by generations of winemakers since the 1500s. The information is a valuable indicator of climatic change – there is an extensive global dataset noting the picking dates and, in later decades, the sugar levels, or Baumé, of individual vineyards.
“Where it differs a bit in Europe is that for the most part they have probably pushed the boundaries a bit more than we have but more toward the cool side, so when you look at Bordeaux or look at Champagne and the worst years are sort of the cold and wet ones,” Barlow said. “So they’re talking about it as something that will help.”
In Australia it’s the opposite effect: warm springs and hot summers can produce lower-quality wine, and if they’re coupled with bushfires there is, Snow said, “bugger all you can do” to save the wine being tainted by smoke.
Damian Sheehan, chairman of Wine Victoria and general manager of Mount Langi Ghiran winery in the Grampians about 190km west of Melbourne, said grapes that ripened quickly risked “decoupling” their sugar and acid content, which meant they reached the desired alcohol level before the flavour was developed.
“You have just got this very, very high (indicative) alcohol content and you want to make sure that you manage it so that you don’t end up with high alcohol wines,” he said.
“You do start acclimatising and you start knowing what you are going to do to make sure that the alcohol levels are what you want to produce.”
Sheehan said they would not know if it was a record early vintage until after the season ended, but that most vineyards appeared to be picking early.
He said a number of companies were planting Spanish or Italian reds, rather than traditional French varieties, to cope with the warming climate. Others were looking to expand into cooler climates such as Tasmania.
Andrew Weeks, executive director of Wine Grape Growers Australia, had not noticed the early trend, saying 2016 was “probably the most un-uniform vintage I have ever had anything to do with”. His own cabernet sauvignon vineyard in South Australia’s Riverlands was harvested at its usual time.
Weeks said climate change fell behind economic challenges on the concerns listed by most growers he spoke to who worried about “whether the policy settings will see them viable in one to two years’ time”.
“If you have got that sort of time frame, it’s hard to be concerned about what the climate might be doing in 20 or 30 years,” he said."

Given these dire ecological trends, limited public funding and legislative gridlock, the time is ripe for a budget-neutral, executive-branch approach for managing our natural resources: triage. A science-based triage approach should be used to classify areas and species into one of three categories: not at immediate risk, in need of immediate attention or beyond help. 
Refusing to apply triage implicitly assumes that we can save everything and prevent change, which we cannot. Prioritization will occur regardless, just ad hoc and shrouded. This triage system would replace the status quo of inadequately managing our full portfolio of over 1m square miles of public land and 1,589 threatened and endangered species.
For areas or species not at immediate risk, we can delay action while monitoring to detect changes in that status. For example, increased temperatures and prolonged periods of drought may increase both wildfires and populations of tree-killing beetles in forests of the Pacific north-west. Knowing this, we can track these variables and explore management options that minimize risk without prematurely devoting disproportionate resources.
For areas needing immediate help, we must act now. For the coral reefs of the Florida Keys and US Virgin Islands, all anthropogenic impacts (such as overfishing, pollution and coastal development) must be dramatically reduced. Otherwise, because the health of these coral reefs is currently so compromised, they are unlikely to survive the sea level rise, rising ocean temperatures and increasing acidification resulting from climate change. For species protections, it would be wise to focus on keystone species such as oysters (water filterers), parrotfish (algae eaters on overgrown coral reefs), bees (pollinators) and wolves (key predators).
For areas we can no longer maintain, we must make the most difficult of choices – give up, and accept that change is not always preventable. In Alaska, it may be too late to prevent the climate change-induced shift from coniferous-dominated to deciduous-dominated stands, with unfortunate impacts on forest-dwelling species and the logging industry. In the ocean, entire fisheries can be lost from an area when species shift due to warming waters.
This is not to say we should de-list endangered species or revoke area protections. Rather, management should account for shifts in climate and habitats and aim to maintain the services ecosystems provide (like pollination, soil fertility, air and water purification and recreation), but acknowledge it may be costly and futile to attempt to maintain a particular ecosystem configuration or species in a particular location. 
However, even degraded coral reefs can supply key ecosystem services such as fisheries and storm protection. A river can continue to be a source of clean, fresh drinking water and provide habitat for a diversity of species even if it is no longer suitable for trout or salmon.
For triage to be successful, categorization must be transparent, based on the best available science, and it must avoid politicization and subjectivity. This approach would require us to weigh the many benefits ecosystems provide against the cost effectiveness of various management options. Given the distribution of management authority and the value of local ecological knowledge, these discussions and decisions would need to be just as robust at the local and state levels as at the national level.
Employing triage would enable us to holistically consider our natural resources, design strategic management, focus our energies and resources and save as much of our environment as possible for the benefit of this and future generations."

The United States alone could be responsible for between 30-60% of the global growth in human-caused atmospheric methane emissions since 2002 because of a 30% spike in methane emissions across the country, the study says.
The research shows that emissions increased the most in the middle of the country, but the authors said there is too little data to identify specific sources. However, the increase occurred at the same time as America’s shale oil and gas boom, which has been associated with large amounts of methane leaking from oil and gas wells and pipelines nationwide.
“I’d say the biggest takeaway is that there is more we — the US — could be doing to reduce our methane emissions to combat climate change,” said study lead author Alex Turner, a Harvard University chemical engineering PhD candidate.
The Aliso Canyon gas leak in California, which was plugged last week after a nearly four-month effort to contain it, has brought new attention to methane. The gas is roughly 86 times as potent as carbon dioxide as a driver of climate change over a period of 20 years, or 35 times as potent over the span of a century. The Aliso leak spewed enough methane into the atmosphere to equal the greenhouse gases emitted by more than 440,000 cars in a year.
The US Environmental Protection Agency is trying to rein in methane emissions from oil and gas operations, and has proposed new rules to curb them from oil and gas wells. The Obama administration’s climate action plan seeks to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by up to 45% below 2012 levels by 2025.
Global methane emissions have risen and fallen several times since the 1980s, Turner said, but they’ve been rising continuously since 2007.
“The causes for this renewed growth are currently unknown,” he said,
In the US, the government tally of the country’s annual human-caused methane emissions between 2002 and 2012 shows that emissions have been about 29 million metric tons annually, without any significant trends up or down. Research by Turner’s team, however, showed that emissions ranged from about 39 million tons to about 52 million tons during that period. The team based its findings on satellite data.
The Harvard study, published last week in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, adds to mounting research that shows that the government’sdata on methane emissions is not consistent with observations made by universities and other institutions.
The official tally, taking what is known as a “bottom-up” approach, calculates methane emissions based on expected leak rates at oil and gas well sites, not actual measurements. The Harvard researchers used a “top-down” method, calculating emissions based on actual satellite measurements, showing that US methane emissions are far greater than those estimated by the government.
Turner said he and other researchers are working with the EPA to reconcile those differences.
“Both the bottom-up and top-down communities are trying to understand the sources of methane, but the different methods have different strengths, and we are working on making them more compatible,” he said.
EPA spokeswoman Enesta Jones said the Harvard study adds to a wide body of new research about how to best quantify methane emissions. The EPA is reviewing those studies, she said.
With the US responsible for as much as 60% of global methane emissions growth, it’s critical that the country reduce natural gas use as quickly as possible, said Robert Howarth, a Cornell University ecologist and methane researcher who is unaffiliated with the Harvard study. Failing to do so could jeopardise commitments made as part of the Paris climate agreement’s goal of keeping global warming to below 2C.
“There is simply no way to do that by reducing carbon dioxide emissions alone because of lags in the climate system,” he said. “Even with major carbon dioxide emission reductions starting now, the planet would reach 1.5C in 12 years and 2C in 35 years. But the planet responds much more rapidly to methane, so a reduction in methane emissions now would slow the rate of global warming immediately.”
Howarth said the Turner team’s study is consistent with his own research.
“I believe the US probably is responsible for this much of an increase in global methane emissions,” Howarth said. “And, the increase almost certainly must be coming from the fracking and from the increase in use of natural gas.”
Raymond Pierrehumbert, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Oxford who is unaffiliated with the Harvard study, said its findings are useful, but don’t mean much for climate change in the long run.
“It is always useful to know what the emissions of various greenhouse gases are, but methane is still just a sideshow, and relative to what the US. needs to do to fulfill its Paris commitments with regard to keeping the warming under 2C, even a substantial upward revision of methane leakage is almost completely irrelevant,” he said. “The warming due to steady methane emissions essentially stops increasing after just two decades, and is largely reversible once the leakage stops.” "

Here’s what happened next";"Eight years ago, when my friends and I started an international development organisation we were by all accounts completely unqualified. We were in our early twenties and had little or no formal training or experience. Most of us were tree-planting as a way of paying for university when one of our fellow planters, Jeff Schnurr, came back from a trip to a tiny tropical island named Pemba, just off the coast of Tanzania. He regaled us with tales of how he’d met Mbarouk Omar, the man who now heads up our local sister NGO, and had sketched out with him a dream to restore the island’s lost forests. He now wanted to know: would we go out there and help?
Fast-forward eight years and our NGO, Community Forests International, has helped to plant more than 1.5m trees across Pemba. Our movement has also blossomed from rural farmers managing low-tech nurseries into community-scale solar microgrids and regenerative agriculture. Pemba is becoming a place to watch for lessons in frontline climate change adaptation. And in the grand scheme of things, we’ve had next to nothing to do with it. 
I say this because as development professionals we often overstate not only our achievements abroad but also our individual roles. This reinforces misconceptions among the general public that the communities we support in the global south cannot ever help themselves, let alone help us.
Community Forests Pemba, the local NGO we partner with, is made up almost entirely of Tanzanians with decades of research and administrative experience as well as an intimate understanding of local challenges. They even taught us how to run our own organisation back in Canada, guiding us on issues such as good governance and building partnerships, and encouraging us to replicate the model we used in Pemba in other places.
We wouldn’t have had half the success we have had without them, so why does the wider sector continue to recycle an old narrative that suggests solutions only flow from wealthy to poor societies but not the other way round? Here are some key lessons we’ve learned from our local partner:
The first time I travelled to Pemba I spent three months trying to build a piece of technology to recycle discarded paper into seedling containers. I struggled because I couldn’t speak the language well enough to describe it to local tradespeople. Rather than looking to my colleagues in Pemba for direction, I blindly followed my own bias. It never really took off and I’m just lucky it turned out to be only a minor distraction. The real answer came later, when my friends there demonstrated how plastic containers could be reused if cared for properly – an embarrassingly simple solution. 
Even the name of our organisation betrays our early naivety – the notion that reforestation in Pemba would be best advanced as a strictly community-based activity. We’ve had some great success with that approach, but also huge failures: we lost tens of thousands of trees and years of effort when our communal ideal just didn’t fit the realities on the ground. In one case, land use disputes resulted in shepherds purposely grazing livestock over a newly planted “community” forest. In another, farmers completely neglected a large community plot in favour of tending their own individual woodlots. Our work started to flourish when we stopped trying to dictate where and how trees were planted and focused instead on just supporting the people most committed to the effort. 
The fact that none of us are experts by conventional standards has also put us in a unique position as development practitioners. We’ve been free to ask questions – hard questions or dumb questions as needs be – and to adapt as we learn. Being an expert isn’t necessarily bad for development, but assuming you have all the answers can be. 
Being critical of our work and constantly questioning our effectiveness is uncomfortable but it is also fundamental to advancing our cause. The fact that a group of 20-year-old Canadians can found an international organisation is an expression of our own privilege. So is the fact that we speak a language of power and can navigate the esoteric world of proposal writing and donor relations more easily than our Swahili-speaking colleagues. At the same time, these privileges undeniably have been vital to the achievements we now share with our Tanzanian partners. Sadly, privilege is one of the most powerful things that we Canadians bring to the work – that, and our solidarity. People don’t like to talk about privilege, but it’s how you use it that matters: use it to level the playing field. 
Changing how we practise development could be our best tool for addressing inequalities at the heart of development. Creating the space for underprivileged people to assume positions of leadership in our work, for example, and recognising the unmatched knowledge that our partners in the global south have of their own cultural and environmental context, offer small steps toward big systemic change.

It’s shown up in many conservative media outlets like The Wall Street Journal and The Australian. It’s been presented by congressional Republicans’ favorite climate witness, John Christy, in recent hearings called by Ted Cruz and Lamar Smith.
The chart, which tries to compare estimates of the temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere to model simulations, is full of problems. Its purpose is clear – to make it appear that climate models are unreliable, and thus cast doubt on all of climate science and the tremendous risks posed by human-caused global warming. In other words, its purpose is to undermine climate policy efforts to reduce those risks by slowing global warming. 
But as with all charts of such singular, unscientific purposes, it’s simply another example of cherry picked data being presented in a multiply misleading way, as the annotated version below illustrates (for an animated version, click here).
To start, the observational and simulated model data are aligned at a single point at the start of the graph, in 1979. That choice serves to visually exaggerate any difference between the models and data. When doing this sort of comparison properly, climate scientists will average the data over a period called the “baseline,” usually between 10 and 30 years, so that any abnormally hot or cold single years in the data or model runs don’t throw off the alignment.
In fact, there was recently a paper published by Hawkins &amp; Sutton showing that the choice of baseline can significantly impact how accurate the models appear in this sort of comparison, and thus it’s important to carefully choose an appropriate baseline period and perhaps test the comparison with multiple different periods. Christy didn’t even use a baseline period to begin with! NASA Goddard director Gavin Schmidt did the comparison using a baseline period of 1979–1988, and as you can see, the result looks quite different.
Normally, climate contrarians love to harp on uncertainties. In fact, the whole argument against implementing climate policies to slow global warming hinges upon the backwards logic that we don’t know enough to take action.
However, in Christy’s chart, no uncertainty ranges are shown whatsoever. The difference this makes is clear in Schmidt’s version above, which shows the spread of individual climate model simulation runs (in grey), although doesn’t show the significant uncertainty in the observational data. When both are taken into account, the observations are consistent with the range of model projections.
Christy’s graph also averages together multiple different observational data sets, which aren’t in terribly close agreement. Gavin Schmidt shows some of these in his version of the chart. Christy’s version also somehow glosses over the fact that atmospheric temperature estimates from satellites and weather balloons diverge in recent years.
Another problem is that Christy doesn’t say which observational data sets he’s averaging together, but there are more than three groups that use satellite data to estimate the temperature of the atmosphere (Schmidt shows four of them in his chart). So he could be omitting some of the data that shows larger warming trends.
We don’t know because this is “blog science.” The analysis hasn’t been vetted by other experts, or published in a scientific journal after being subjected to peer-review. We don’t even know if Christy is accurately representing the climate models, because they don’t produce a simple “bulk atmosphere temperature” output. As such, Christy’s chart should be taken with a grain of salt.
The average elevation of the “bulk atmosphere” shown in Christy’s graph is 25,000 feet, which is just below the peak of Mount Everest, and not far below the elevation at which commercial aircraft generally fly. The temperature at such high elevations isn’t very relevant to humans.
We live on the Earth’s surface, so we care about the global surface temperature. And because we live at the surface, we have an easier time measuring the temperature here, so we know average global surface temperatures with more certainty than the atmospheric temperatures that Christy focuses on. 
Atmospheric temperatures are just one of the many climate changes simulated by climate models. For example, climate models have done an excellent job predicting how much temperatures at the Earth’s surface would warm (e.g. see Mann et al. 2015).
They’ve also done well predicting the rate of sea level rise (e.g. see the Fifth IPCC Assessment report).
Arctic sea ice is actually declining a bit faster than models predicted (e.g. see Stroeve et al. 2012).
And then there’s ocean heating. Only about 1–2% of the energy imbalance causing global warming goes into warming the atmosphere, and only about 3% is used up melting ice. Over 90% of that energy goes into warming the oceans. And climate models are doing a very good job predicting the rate at which the oceans are heating up (e.g. see Cheng et al. 2015).
As the statistician George Box said, “all models are wrong, but some are useful.” Climate models are certainly useful, and are doing a pretty darn good job predicting global warming. Their predictions have been far more accurate than those made by climate contrarians, who keep telling us that the Earth will start to cool any day now, as we keep breaking heat records.
The only reason to focus on the temperature of the atmosphere, most of which is far above where humans actually live, which we can’t measure as accurately, and which only accounts for about 1–2% of overall global warming, is because it’s the only data that seems to indicate that climate models might not be accurate. That’s called cherry picking. And even then, to make that argument requires presenting the data in a multiply flawed, misleading way.
Climate models are doing a good job because we understand basic physics. We know that as we keep increasing the greenhouse effect, more heat will be trapped, and the planet will keep warming. Ice will keep melting, sea levels will keep rising, and various bad things will happen, because we’re warming the planet much faster than it does naturally. That’s a dangerous physical reality we can’t escape just by creating cherry picked, misleading charts."

Christiana Figueres, a 59-year-old Costa Rican, said she would not accept any extension of her term as head of the Bonn-based UN Climate Change Secretariat after what she called the historic Paris Agreement. 
“We now move into a phase of urgent implementation,” she wrote in a letter to governments, which agreed a goal in Paris to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2100 by shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy such as wind or solar power. 
“The journey that lies ahead will require continued determination, ingenuity and, above all, our collective sense of humanity and purpose,” she wrote in the letter, dated 12 February and made public on Friday. 
Figueres, a former Costa Rican climate negotiator, took over the UN job at a low point in 2010 after a summit in Copenhagen the year before collapsed in acrimony between rich and poor. 
She patiently worked to build trust among governments with radically different interests, ranging from the United States and China to small island states worried by rising seas or OPEC nations fearing a loss of export revenues. 
Nicholas Stern, of the London School of Economics who wrote a 2007 study about the economics of climate change, said Figueres had an “outstanding ability to see where we need to go as a world and to bring people together”. 
Her successor is likely to come from a developed nation - Figueres succeeded Yvo de Boer, of the Netherlands. 
Separately, Hela Cheikhrouhou, head of the UN’s Green Climate Fund set up to channel money to developing nations to help them cope with climate change, also said on Friday she would stand down in September after a three-year term. The fund has so far attracted about $10bn in pledges from 43 nations, after repeated delays. The cash will help developing nations cut emissions and adapt to impacts such as desertification, heat waves, floods and rising seas. 
Earlier this week, former French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, main host of the Paris summit, also quit a post presiding over UN climate negotiations. French environment minister, Segolene Royal, will take over the job, overseeing talks until the next annual talks in Morocco in November."

Blizzards, stranded mushers, charging bull moose – all featured on the 33rd annual Yukon Quest international sled dog race, an event that is more extreme wilderness challenge than competition.
“We were looking for the toughest sled dog race in the world, and this year we found it,” said Rob Cooke, an ex-Royal Navy British-Canadian who finished on Thursday despite nearly pulling out halfway through.
Overshadowed by the better-known Iditarod, the Yukon Quest starts in early February, travelling between Fairbanks, Alaska, and Whitehorse in Canada at a brutal time of year, when temperatures often drop to -40C (-40F) or worse.
With only nine checkpoints over 1,000 miles, Quest mushers camp out on the trail and see nobody for hundreds of miles, traversing four mountain ranges and an area larger than France.
The scale of the landscape guarantees an experience for the contestants, many of them self-described “Quest addicts” who return year after year to test their personal limits and tackle whatever Mother Nature throws at them.
“This is the ultimate challenge for you and your team,” said Mike Ellis, who finished on Wednesday in 10th place. “I’m not out here racing against other teams, I’m out here racing against the clock and the trail and the weather and myself.”
This year, a handful of teams got trapped by a blizzard, one musher was charged by an angry bull moose, search and rescue was called out for a dog who then instantly recovered, and a sudden, early thaw nearly sank the winner as he sped along the Yukon river to the finish line.
Veteran Alaska musher Hugh Neff of Laughin’ Eyes Kennel in Tok took home the 2016 trophy, his second victory in 16 consecutive Quests. “This is about so much more than a trophy,” Neff said at the finish line. “It really is the dogs. All I do is take care of them.”
Neff took nine days, one hour and 25 minutes to complete the trail, followed 80 minutes later by 2015 champion Brent Sass of Wild and Free Mushing in Eureka, Alaska. Allen Moore of SPK Kennels in Two Rivers, Alaska, placed third with a time of nine days, three hours and 59 minutes. 
All three teams have signed up for the more expensive Iditarod, starting on 5 March, when 82 elite mushers will compete for a purse of $725,000, with $70,000 going to the winner.
Neff took home just $25,000 for his Yukon Quest victory, or $10,000 after race expenses – a relatively tiny purse that is intentional, said John Firth, who travelled the inaugural trail in 1984, and has written a couple of books about the race. “The Quest appeals to the Joe Blow musher who wants to run the race but has no expectations of a pay packet at the end,” he said.
And that emphasis upon survival, rather than speed, is reflected in the rules. 
Mushers are allowed only 14 dogs and one sled, which must be repaired if it breaks. The sled carries enough food to feed 10,000 calories to each dog each day, along with a mandatory axe and pair of snowshoes. Dogs can be dropped at checkpoints, but a musher must have six dogs to finish. No two-way communication is allowed, and mushers must remain self-sufficient and all times, refusing any offers of help except from their handlers in Dawson City.
Many mushers appreciate the emphasis on endurance rather than racing checkpoint to checkpoint in pursuit of a purse. “The Iditarod is about money and the big time and the flash, and everything I hate about mushing,” said Ellis. “The Quest is about dogs and trail and community and friends. Really the only similarity is they’re both 1,000 miles.”
However, one-third of contestants scratch each year, suggesting that the Quest attracts mushers most likely to end up in difficulty. This year, trouble struck on the closed Top of the World Highway east of Dawson City, where the trail was rerouted after heavy jumble ice blocked the Yukon river. 
The elite teams raced over the detour without difficulty, but mushers at the back of the pack reached the highway’s 3,000-foot summit in a blizzard as night fell. Lead dogs were up to their necks in snow, and refusing the move forward. Some teams gave up, camping out in deep cold and starting to succumb to fear and desperation. 
Laura Neese, a 19-year old rookie from Michigan, was the only musher on the summit that night with a dogteam willing to move ahead no matter what. 
Neese’s team leader Maple ploughed through snow so deep it threatened to bury her, breaking trail for both Neese and another team that was camped out in a makeshift shelter, and in a bad way.
“I’d never seen anything like that before, with the drifting and the winds,” said Neese, after completing her first 1,000-mile race. “It was – well, I completely give my leader Maple all the credit for getting us to Dawson without either having to camp or me having to play lead dog for a while.”
Neese is known for singing and whistling to her dogs as she beds them down in straw. The relationship between musher and dogs is absolutely what determines success. 
“You have to have your mind right first, and let the dogs know you’re going to get them through this – and then they’re going to get you through it,” said Allen Moore, Quest champion in 2013 and 2014. “They have to know you’re going to take the best care of them.”
Dogs have to pass a physical at the start, finish and all checkpoints and mushers are involuntarily withdrawn at the first sign of abuse. 
Even so, bad things happen. One dog died on the 2016 Quest, experiencing a sudden gastric hemorrhage half an hour outside a checkpoint. The dog’s owner, Sebastian Dos Santos Borges of France, immediately scratched. “The mushers are usually the first to call us over,” said race veterinarian Lori Walker. “They love their dogs.”
So much so that another musher hit his emergency locator beacon when his lead dog Charlie suddenly collapsed just outside a checkpoint. Within 30 minutes, Charlie was in the back of the vet’s SUV wagging her tail, licking the vet’s face, and begging for snacks. DeBruin was allowed to continue but ultimately scratched. Vets diagnosed Charlie with muscular myopathy, or muscle spasm.
With the last musher due to finish on Friday – just in time for the annual banquet – pretty much every contestant said they would be back again in 2017. 
Would rookie Laura Neese? Absolutely. “I loved it,” she said. “I thought I was addicted before, but I’m worse now.”"

Combined, the two effects suggest coral reefs will have trouble recovering from bleaching events, like the the world is currently experiencing.
When carbon dioxide is emitted from factories, cars and power plants, about 30% of it is absorbed by the ocean. As that happens, the acidity of the oceans increases, which makes it harder for corals to build their alkaline skeletons.
But exactly how the increasing acidity impacts coral growth was hard to determine. “If you just look at survival rates of these things, effectively they all survive,” said Peta Clode from the University of Western Australia. “So if you look at that data you think nothing is wrong.”
Even studies that used microscopes to examine how corals grow in more acidic water had trouble finding differences, she said.
So Clode and colleagues went a step further and grew corals in a range of different temperatures and acidities, and then used a high-resolution three-dimensional x-ray microscope to examine how they grew.
Published in the journal Science Advances on Friday, the images and videos they produced revealed striking deformities in corals grown under conditions the oceans are expected to see by the end of the century.
Under normal conditions, baby corals grew skeletons that were symmetrical, strong and with thick walls.
But when the acidity was raised to the level expected by 2100 if emissions are not cut drastically, the skeletons had some spines stunted in growth, while others grew longer. Some parts of the skeleton were completely absent.
They grew into an asymmetrical shape and their walls became pitted and porous, and half of them had fractures in their deformed skeletons.
“You think ‘oh my god, look at them.’ It is very dramatic,” said Clode. “You would expect they would not grow very well. But to see such deformity is surprising. We expected they might just grow less.”
The effect of heat alone seemed to have little impact, and when combined with high acidity it had a beneficial effect, mitigating some of the deformities caused by the higher acidity.
Clode said that was not completely surprising, since higher temperatures that did not stress coral – temperatures that were not too high or too suddenly raised – had been seen to improve coral growth before.
The results showed that as the ocean acidifies, young coral reefs will have trouble re-establishing after they get damaged by events like bleaching or storms, Clode said.
“The juveniles, they’re the reef formers of the future so to start out at a disadvantage like this, you start to worry about how [much] it can take,” said Tracy Ainsworth from James Cook University in Townsville, Australia.
Ainsworth and colleagues recently published a different paper examining the struggles coral will experience in the future.
They examined the viral loads in corals as they got bleached over three days in 2011 on part of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, publishing their results in the journal Frontiers of Microbiology.
Bleaching occurs when corals are stressed by things including hot temperatures, being exposed to the air, or heavy rainfall that lowers the salinity of the water. Global warming is expected to increase the frequency of bleaching by pushing corals closer to the limits of temperatures they can tolerate.
Ainsworth and colleagues found that as the coral bleached, a viral outbreak occurred. Among the many viruses they saw explode was a big spike in one that was similar to the herpes viruses that infect humans. Viral loads were up to four times higher than has ever been seen in corals before.
Ainsworth said the viral loads of corals during a bleaching event hadn’t been studied before, and outbreaks like this might be normal. 
That is bad news since it might be too much for corals to cope with as they bleach more frequently, she said. “When corals are under stress, it’s not just bleaching that they have to overcome,” she said. “It’s coupled with a change in the microbial communities that it has to deal with.”"

Doing so would save countless lives globally";"It is the greatest environmental hazard of the age. Nothing focuses our concern for the future more, divides rich and poor, exercises science, business, politicians, old and young. It is an existential threat, a generational battle. All political and financial resources must be concentrated on stopping climate change.
But now that governments have signed up to the unambitious Paris climate agreement and pledged to try to limit greenhouse gas emissions, we must ask whether we have lost sight of everything else. Is the environment just about carbon and parts per million of gases in the atmosphere? What about the environment that we can smell, see and touch today?
For 20 years or more concerns about nuclear waste, food production, the quality of river water, the health of our soils and seas, the fate of our forests, the impact of road-building and many other important ecological issues have been steadily marginalised, starved of resources or pushed off the agenda by climate change.
Climate has become for government an excuse to build nuclear power and ditch other green policies. Money for biodiversity has been slashed, planning laws revoked, pollution and waste controls weakened and sustainable development policies rejected. Most popular and ministerial attention has been focused on energy companies and big carbon polluters, and the wider environment has visibly deteriorated. Seeing trees as sticks of carbon, air as gas, or forests as sinks is abstract, esoteric and emotionally stultifying.
Most heinous of all the sins of emissions is what has happened to our air quality since climate change climbed the political agenda 20 years ago. No government wants us to know that far more people will suffer grievous illnesses and will die from the filthy air shrouding our cities than from any warming of the atmosphere in the next 30 years. Climate change may give us a glimpse of the terrifying future we are heading towards if we don’t change our ways, but toxic air is already here, and killing us in ever greater numbers.
New estimates from the Global Burden of Disease project and the World Health Organisation state that between 5.5 and 7 million people die from air pollution every year. That’s more than die from malaria and HIV/Aids put together; more than the population of Scotland. In the next 10 years we can expect as many people to die from breathing poisonous air as were killed in the second world war.
Most of those deaths will be in China and India which, in the name of extreme poverty eradication, have been transforming their cities and are now having to pay for a health crisis of their own making. But we in rich countries do not have the same excuses. Our industries and governments have known for well over a century the health effects of polluted air. Yet they have fought in Europe to be allowed to continue polluting, and people have been encouraged to switch to diesel and more polluting fuels because they emit less CO2.
In Britain, 29,000 people die a year from breathing in particles of unburned carbon and construction dust, and an estimated 23,500 more as a result of nitrogen dioxide. To condone these deaths is unforgivable; to actively seek to carry on polluting is like declaring war on the public. It’s saying, “We know that the whole of Christchurch or half the city of Worcester will be asphyxiated next year, but there is nothing we think we should do about it.”
It’s a case of looking after the green pennies while the green pounds take care of themselves
But those 50,000 or more deaths a year are just the tip of the iceberg, hiding hospital wards full of people with heart disease, cancers and respiratory and lung problems caused by lifetimes spent breathing toxic air. No one counts the heartbreak when parents die young, or when children are unable to breathe properly or when Granny develops dementia – which is now linked to air pollution too.
Nor does government want us to tell us how much air pollution really costs. This is reckoned by the European environment agency to be over £10bn a year in damage to people’s health, buildings, soil and water. That is dozens of new hospitals and schools, thousands of extra nurses and teachers, and enough left over to protect most of Britain’s premier conservation sites.
After 20 years of battling to get government to take the climate seriously, we must wake up to the fact that the very air we breathe is killing us and making us bankrupt, yet governments are deliberately making the situation worse. Despite the Volkswagen scandal – the German car giant admitted that it cheated emissions tests in the US – new pollution limits for diesel cars have been delayed until 2019.
On the drawing board in Britain are a new runway and hundreds of thousands more planes every year in the southeast, a massive national road-building programme, several new road crossings for east London taking air pollution into the heart of some of the poorest areas, the £50bn HS2 rail line, fracking, giant infrastructure projects from nuclear power stations and new ports. All will add to air pollution and to climate emissions.
The government has developed tunnel vision. Because it sees environmental problems as many separate issues, it does not understand the links between them and the benefits of addressing them together. Yet the science shows that if air pollution is addressed, there will be a significant decrease in climate emissions. Restoring peat bogs and investing in conservation will not only improve biodiversity, reduce flooding and make for a healthier environment, it will also reduce greenhouse gases.
We have been distracted by climate change and have let governments dictate the agenda. Now we must return to basics, and address all those issues that have been conveniently dropped. Who will get angry about the degradation of water quality, the plague of plastic in our seas? Mining? What about computer and smart phone waste? Litter? Population control? Endangered species? Unless we address mass consumption – the root of our environmental crisis – climate change will not only worsen, we will be left with a degraded world.
Rather than solely trying to tackle the vast problem of climate change, we must address all the many factors which make it worse. It’s a case of looking after the green pennies and letting the green pounds take care of themselves."

The report adds to a chorus of eminent bodies and individuals criticising the move, which the CSIRO made after almost no consultation with its own scientists or other research institutions.
Earlier in the month it was revealed CSIRO would be cutting up to 350 staff from climate research programs over two years. Over the following weeks, the organisation’s chief executive Larry Marshall explained that would result in a loss of about 50% of the staff working in climate modelling and measuring.
In a report titled “Flying Blind: Navigating Climate Change without the CSIRO,” the Climate Council said governments and businesses relied on the CSIRO’s climate modelling and measuring work to make billion-dollar decisions and if the cuts went ahead, would be relying on “guesswork”.
The report notes Australia and the rest of the world agreed to strengthen commitments to climate science at COP21 in Paris in December. “The recently announced cuts to climate science mean that Australia has already reneged on one of its obligations under the Paris commitments,” it concludes.
It cites a number of examples of decisions and industries that have relied on the modelling and measuring performed by the CSIRO:
“If there’s one take-home message from the report it’s that you can’t just say ‘all right we know this, let’s cut the research and go onto something else’,” Will Steffen, a climate councillor and professor at the Australian National University told Guardian Australia. “For a problem that’s as big and complex and ongoing as climate change, that’s just crazy and makes no scientific sense at all.” 
An open letter signed by more than 2800 scientists raised similar concerns. In response to the chorus of criticisms, Marshall initially said the response was more like religion than science, and compared climate scientists to oil lobbyists in the 1970s. Then chairman of the CSIRO board David Thodey released a written response, where he repeated that organisation would work to ensure these important capabilities would not be lost from Australia.
Paul Durack from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the US, who oraganised the open letter, told Guardian Australia the response was an “unfortunate dismissal of some legitimate concerns raised by the international climate community.”
“The details contained in the letter have echoed the previous announcements and have provided no further details about how they plan to ensure that some of the key aspects that are ‘committed’ to be kept will continue beyond the next round of CSIRO cutbacks in the coming years,” Durack said.
It was revealed in Senate estimates that CSIRO executives did not consult with organisations like the Bureau of Meteorology who depend on CSIRO modelling until 24 hours before the cuts were made public.
Even Ken Lee, the director of the division that would take the brunt of the cuts was only told about the cuts four days before they were announced.
The Climate Council, which produced the new report, is a crowd-funded body that seeks to provide authoritative information on climate change to the community. It was created after the Abbott government cut the Climate Commission when it took government in 2013, and seeks to perform the same job."

Perhaps the best known is the Heartland Institute, which actually puts on climate “conferences” and publishes materials that appear at first glance to be scientifically sound. We who work and follow the climate change science and public discussions know enough to be skeptical about anything produced by groups like the Heartland Institute – their veneer of scientific credibility is very thin. 
On the other hand, perhaps the intended audience isn’t scientists are even people who closely follow the science. Perhaps their intended audience is legislators, teachers, and others who have influence over society?
With this as a backdrop, I received a copy of a humorous report from an elected official in the USA. The report was entitled “Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming,” published by Heartland. Since elected officials have too much going on to do a thorough debunking, I looked into this report to see what substance was there.
As a scientist, when I read any manuscript I ask a number of questions. Who wrote it and what is their expertise in the field? When statements and conclusions are made, what is the evidence? How do these conclusions fit into prior work in the field? Is the new study confirming prior work or in conflict with it? If there is conflict, why?
The authors of this manuscript are Craig Idso, the late Robert Carter, and Fred Singer. These three are not exactly (or even nearly) a trio of reputable climate scientists. According to a literature search performed using the search engine SCOPUS, neither Idso nor Singer published a credible paper on global climate change or its implications in years.
One way to measure the authors’ impact is by counting how many people have read and cited their work. For both of these authors, the number of people who have cited them is shockingly low. To put their impact in perspective, a scientist like Kevin Trenberth receives three times more citations each year than the combined citations of Singer and Idso in their entire careers. So, having these guys be lead author on a climate change document is a bit like hiring retired scientists or op-ed writers to do your research. 
But just because they are not active and reputable scientists, could they be correct? Sure, they could be. So let’s look at the content.
The central theme of this manuscript is an attack against the expert consensus on human-caused global warming. The consensus refers to the very strong and repeatable measure of what scientists think about climate change. What do the best scientists say?
It turns out multiple groups have measured the consensus. The measurements have been done many different ways, all leading to the same conclusion – the consensus is strong. Not only is the consensus strong, contrarian scientists are less talented than those in the consensus. They publish less on the subject, and peer review has found the work of most high-profile contrarians to be faulty. So, on the one hand, you have approximately 97% of the best scientists in agreement, and on the other hand, you have about 3% of the less-talented scientists in dissent.
Dr. Naomi Oreskes conducted the first major study that looked at consensus more than a decade ago. Dr. Oreskes examined the abstracts of hundreds of papers and found that they strongly confirmed the human influence on climate. In fact, she found no papers that dissented. The Heartland publication falsely calls Dr. Oreskes a “non-scientist.” In fact her scientific impact measured by citations is approximately four times that of the combination of Idso and Singer. Instead, they try to refute her with references to think-tank non-reviewed publications and websites.
Peter Doran and Margaret Zimmerman performed the second major consensus study in 2009. This was the first peer-reviewed study that quantified that 97% agreement among climate scientists. The authors accessed a large database of Earth scientists and created a secure polling system to ask about their level of agreement. 
The authors broke the scientists into groups based on whether climate change was their field of study and whether they published a majority of their papers in that field. Approximately 10% of the respondents were in the most expert category. There were a series of questions for the respondents and a very strong consensus that temperatures had increased and humans were the cause. The Heartland Institute falsely claimed that the survey was only two questions, and their sole reference used to rebut the paper was an article in the National Post.
William Anderegg and his colleagues completed the third major measure of consensus in 2010. They created a database of the most prominent climate scientists by searching the scientific literature for papers and citations. They found that only 2% of the experts were unconvinced on the extent of human impact. Importantly, the contrarian scientists were found to publish less and publish less impactful studies – simply put, the best scientists agreed. 
How does the Heartland document counter this study? They claimed that the mainstream scientists are “hyper productive.” They even accuse these scientists by saying “It is unlikely these scientists actually participated in most of the experiments or research contain in the articles bearing their name.” Next, they point out that the contrarians tend to be older and retired. I wouldn’t disagree with either of their conclusions. The 97% of scientists that agree are more productive and younger than those who disagree. The references that the Heartland uses to support its conclusions are from its own website, from the Wall Street Journal, and other non-scientific outlets. Not very convincing. 
The Heartland document finally attacks the 2013 study by John Cook and colleagues of the scientific literature. The authors examined over 12,000 abstracts and found that among those taking a position, less than 3% rejected or minimized human-induced climate change. Among the abstracts that gave a position, 97% were in agreement. Just like before, in response to this the Heartland document cites no peer-reviewed scientific sources — just think-tank literature, websites, and blog posts.
What was surprising was that the Heartland report actually cited a consensus in favor of their viewpoint. The article “Scientists’ Views about Attribution of Global Warming” was published in 2014. The authors found a strong correlation of expertise with recognition that humans are a cause of climate change. For instance, for scientists who have published more than 10 papers on the topic, there is a 90% consensus that human influences dominate. 
I could go on, but you get the point. What we see is that it doesn’t matter how you measure the consensus. Whether you ask the scientists, whether you read the papers, or whether you trawl the literature in other ways. The results are reinforcing, which why we know there is such a strong consensus.
While I won’t spend too much time on the scientifically incorrect or misleading statements in the Heartland report, I will mention a few. In chapter 4, they claim that a doubling of carbon dioxide would result in approximately 1°C warming. They neglected to remind the readers that we have nearly already reached that and we are nowhere near doubling of carbon dioxide yet. The report claims that meteorological observations are consistent with a climate sensitivity of 1°C but they provide no support for this assertion and in fact, the research does not support this. 
The report falsely claims that climate models assume all the warming since the industrial revolution is from carbon dioxide. Climate models include many factors in addition to carbon dioxide. The report also falsely claims that models do not attempt to simulate internal climate oscillations. They claim that thawing of permafrost is not likely to emit dangerous methane, which will add to the warming, but they give no evidence to support their claim. 
This is what happens when you have a fossil fuel-funded political organization parade a document as a scientific publication. You get nonsense and non-science.

Longreach in central Queensland had 13 days straight when the maximum temperature hit 40C (104F) or higher – four days longer than the town’s previous record. 
Down in New South Wales and Tasmania, residents fought off bushfires. A few weeks earlier, South Australia had its hottest October on record. 
This was the spring of 2014, Australia’s hottest September-November period on a record going back to 1910, beating the previous record by a 10th of a degree – a large margin in climatological terms. 
“Temperatures were 1.67C above the 1961–1990 average, the largest such departure from the long-term average observed since national records began in 1910,” the Bureau of Meteorology said. 
These sorts of spring conditions are perfect for priming bush areas for dangerous fire seasons (extreme fire weather is on the rise in Australia) that damage property, risk lives and devastate wilderness areas.
But the spring of 2014 had been the second record breaker in a row. The previous hottest spring had been the year before, 2013.
There had never been two record-breaking springs occurring back-to-back in Australia’s entire record, going back to 1910. 
The most recent spring of 2015 was hotter than 2013, but not quite as hot as 2014. The hottest October on record was the one we just had. 
We had just had two hit springs in a row and we were set for a third. They broke records by a long way.
So springs in Australia are starting to feel like summer, but could the so-called “lucky country” just be having a run of bad luck?
If there had not been about 40% more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now than there had been before the start of the industrial revolution, could Australians have still sweated through record-breaking springs?
A new study in the journal Geophysical Research Letters by Dr Ailie Gallant, of Monash University, and Dr Sophie Lewis, of Australian National University, has come to a conclusion.
Gallant told me: 
When we examined a world without human-emitted greenhouse gases in climate models, we found zero instances when there were two consecutive years with record-breaking springtime temperatures like those we observed in 2013 and 2014. 
But when we examined a world with these additional greenhouse gases, we saw that this happened somewhere between 1 in every 10 years and one in every four. This evidence suggests that this repeated record breaking that we saw in spring in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2015, is almost certainly due to greenhouse warming.
Now this isn’t a surprising outcome. Australia has been warming at roughly the same rate as the rest of the globe, and the cause is the greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere, mainly from burning fossil fuels.
Previous studies have found human fingerprints all over Australia’s recent heat records. 
To carry out the study, Gallant and Lewis combined computer climate models. They ran the models to see if the results they gave matched what was happening in the real world. The differences were “statistically indistinguishable”.
To see what impact greenhouse gases were having, they then removed the greenhouse gases from the models to make a comparison.
What makes the study intriguing is that it not only tried to answer the question of the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions, but also looked to find out exactly how they were affecting temperatures. Gallant says:
We had just had two hot springs in a row and we were set for a third. They were really remarkable. They broke records by a long way. We wanted to know; is the weather we are experiencing changing, or is it just that we’ve warmed up. 
The evidence is that the underlying air masses are warming, rather than the systems themselves changing.
We are getting more record hot springs and it is highly unlikely that this is not due to climate change. But the reason we are getting more record hot springs is not because the weather systems are changing, it is just that everything is warmer.
The study found the natural background conditions (such as atmospheric circulations and the state of the El Niño/La Niña cycle) that existed during those record-breaking springs “have occurred in the past” yet temperatures had been at least 0.21C cooler. 
If the dignitaries at that Brisbane G20 meeting were wondering why they were struggling in such oppressive heat, then it seems they had the answer right in their hands.

But vegan diets are better for the planet | Leilani Münter";"It is not enough to cut down on fossil fuel emissions. Its also important to think about how meat consumption harms the environment";"As a professional race car driver, I’m all too aware of the impact driving has on the planet. That’s why I don’t work with any fossil fuel companies and, since 2007, I have adopted an acre of rainforest for every race I run in order to offset the unavoidable emissions of my race car. But as much as that is making a difference, I know my vegan diet has an even greater impact on the planet.
Off track, I am proud to have now driven more than 33,000 miles in my electric car over the past couple of years and thanks to the solar panels on the roof of my house, I am driving on sunshine. I often drive my electric car to my races and my race car often carries messages about clean energy like wind and solar. Beyond just messaging, in July of 2014 my race team became the first in history to power our pit box using 100% solar power. 
But cutting down on fossil fuel emissions alone is not enough to reduce one’s carbon footprint. Currently, one-third of all the arable land on the planet is being used to grow feed for livestock. Combined with the animals themselves, this means that the production of meat is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. It results in more greenhouse gas emissions than the entire transportation sector. Beef production for example, emits 150 times more greenhouse gasses than soy. It’s a little-known fact, hidden in large part by powerful corporate interests. 
So when the US Department of Agriculture’s advisory council proposed last year that the new dietary guidelines encourage people to eat less meat, I was thrilled. I thought this was an important way to help every American reduce their carbon footprint. 
The draft guidelines were scientifically sound and forward-looking, acknowledging the realities that we all need to make changes in our everyday lives in order to battle climate change. A recent report found that government education on the climate-meat connection presents a valuable path forward to reducing emissions, and that reducing global meat consumption is critical to meeting the 2C warming goal of the Paris Agreement. 
But then, unfortunately, we ran into politics as usual with powerful lobbyists representing meat and other big agricultural sectors using their vast influence in Washington to have their profits put ahead of the health of the American people, the welfare of billions of animals – and the future of the planet. So despite countless studies that show meat’s impact on our bodies and our environment, the proposed change didn’t make it into the final guidelines. 
The USDA put the brakes on their plan to help inform Americans of how their food choices matter when it comes to sustainability and how we can make cleaner and healthier choices at the dinner table. The only people who gain from this decision is the animal agriculture business. It is disappointing that the USDA puts their interests above ours.
By including climate concerns in its guidelines, the department of agriculture had the opportunity to give Americans more information on how to accelerate the transition to a safer climate. Instead it chose to ignore those emissions, stalling out in the drive towards sustainability. If Americans don’t realize the environmental impact of their food choices because the USDA chooses not to include these factors, we all lose – the planet loses, our health as a nation loses, the billions of animals slaughtered for food lose with their lives. 
Information is the key to people making informed decisions and creating a better world for our future. This is why I use my platform in racing to talk about these issues. Before I became a race car driver, I earned a degree in biology from the University of California in San Diego. 
Ironically though, it is my race car that gives me a voice as an environmentalist – it is at the racetrack where I have my biggest audience and where I am definitely not preaching to the choir. By bringing environmental messages to the racing world, I’m raising awareness on critical issues to that audience that isn’t otherwise engaged in discussions of climate change. 
I hope Americans will not wait for the government to catch up and will educate themselves about their food and the impact it has on our planet."

But, he says, initiatives by the Indonesian government over the past couple of decades have left small-scale fishermen like him adrift.
First came intensive shrimp farming, which a 2007 report by the Food and Agriculture Organisation blamed for mangrove depletion. Then came palm oil; in an effort to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, extensive sections of coastal areas were converted into palm oil plantations to produce biofuel.
The consequences were catastrophic. Damanik recalls how the fish catch plummeted and major floods swept away entire villages. The biofuel policy was a death knell for these small communities, who were displaced from their ancestral lands and fishing grounds.
Damanik, the chairman of Kesatuan Nelayan Tradisional Indonesia (KNTI) – Indonesia’s traditional fisherfolks’ union – took his plight to meetings held by civil society organisations alongside the UN climate talks in Paris in December. 
At the Climate Action Zone, a space dedicated to sharing experiences on climate change actions, attendees raised questions about the solutions proposed by the UN, in particular the blue carbon initiatives put forward by United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
Blue carbon refers to carbon dioxide stored in coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, coastal salt marshes and seagrass meadows. The concept was first introduced by a number of UN institutions in the 2009 report, Blue Carbon: the role of healthy oceans in binding carbon. 
Blue carbon initiatives aim to protect and develop these coastal ecosystems as they play a vital role in pollution filtration and carbon storage, which is crucial for mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change.
Organisations like Conservation International (CI) and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognise this – as do some CSOs – and have been at the forefront of initiatives to highlight the importance of blue carbon in conservation efforts, and getting governments to include conservation within their policy-making.
Through their efforts, the International Blue Carbon Initiative (ICBI) – lauded as the first integrated programme focused on mitigating climate change by conserving and restoring coastal marine ecosystems globally – came into existence.
Yet blue carbon schemes in general have been dubbed a “false solution” by CSOs like the World Forum of Fisher Peoples. Controversy has risen over how agencies propose to conserve endangered areas: by monetising mangroves and including them within carbon markets.
“It is virtually ocean-grabbing, under another name,” says Mads Barbesgaard, chair of political affairs at Afrika Kontakt. “[The idea of blue carbon initiatives] doesn’t tackle the core of the issue that’s driving the climate crisis,” which he believes is pollution caused by transnational corporations and unsustainable industrial techniques. 
“Instead, it paints a rosy picture in which transnational corporations can continue to pollute in one place as long as they do a bit of so-called conservation somewhere else, without paying much attention to what conservation actually means to the people who’ve lived off these resources for generations.”
For CSOs, blue carbon schemes represent an extension of programmes such as REDD+ that are said to breed initiatives geared towards the commodification of nature. “The underlying idea of blue carbon initiatives is to shift the focus of our government away from their obligation to ensure the rights of small-scale fishers,” says Damanik. “The overall proposal of blue carbon initiatives is to expand ocean grabbing practices which, for us, means risking the loss of our food, jobs, and welfare.”
On the other hand, those in favour of blue carbon initiatives say they can lead to a prosperous marriage between the public and private sector to target environmental woes. 
Gabriel Grimsditch, a IUCN representative, believes that environmental markets can bring green into the mainstream. He adds that such initiatives speak to transnational corporations in a language they understand, and these are then more likely to factor environmental issues into their ongoing activities. In short, these markets can then help societies take the step towards creating a greener economy.
“If organised correctly, [carbon markets] can provide sustainable financing for environmental management and conservation without depending on donor hand-outs,” he says. 
While this would represent a breath of fresh air for cash-strapped conservation efforts, Grimsditch issues a word of warning. “Social and ecological safeguards and regulations are important for carbon markets in order to avoid malpractices, perverse incentives and abuses.” 
Back in Langkat, the KNTI is working with a number of organisations and local government bodies to restore the ravaged coastal ecosystem on their own terms: “for the benefit of the people and the planet – not for profit”. 
It might not be the easiest path, but this is just one battle in their struggle to assert that the best solutions to climate change are those based on their traditional knowledge and artisanal practices.

At a summit in Paris in December, 196 nations, including the US, agreed to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels in order to prevent the worst effects of climate change. The agreement, the first to demand all countries slash emissions, will require major emissions reductions given that the world has already warmed by 1C during the past century.
A paper by Duke University calculates that in order to help achieve the Paris goal, the US will need to reduce its emissions by 40% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. This is a jump from the 26-28% reduction the US has promised to undertake by 2025.
The US would prevent many premature deaths and save the economy billions of dollars should it make the necessary emissions cuts, the Duke study shows. A total of 295,000 Americans who would otherwise die from lung cancer, heart attacks or respiratory diseases by 2030 would be saved due to the reduction in air pollution. 
Currently, the US experiences about 200,000 early deaths each year due to emissions from heavy industry, cars, trains and ships, as well as commercial and residential heating. Ozone and particulate matter released from the burning of fossil fuels are linked to 100,000 of these annual deaths.
“If we continue on the current high trajectory of emissions we’ll continue to have a large number of pollution-caused deaths,” said Professor Drew Shindell, lead author of the research. “Climate change doesn’t feel immediate unless you have the kind of smog you have in China right now but the health benefits would happen right away if we acted. And they’d happen right here in the US.
“People should realise that emissions are having a big impact already. You are talking about more than 100,000 deaths a year at a time when people spend a huge amount of time and money on a relatively small number of deaths from terrorist attacks or plane crashes. Air pollution is a very big health challenge, it’s having a major public health impact in the US.”
Although coal is in decline in the US, the main national mechanism to reduce emissions has been put on hold by the supreme court, which is considering challenges from nearly 30 states to a plan by Barack Obama’s administration to limit emissions from power plants.
To get to a 40% reduction in emissions by 2030, not only would this plan need to proceed unhindered, it would also have to be expanded to areas beyond electricity generation. Almost all of America’s car fleet would need to be electrified.
“It’s a tall order, there’s no getting around that,” said Shindell. “We’d need the support of Congress and the supreme court. But it’s achievable if we really want it. The US does require a big jolt because we are nowhere near the path we need to be on. We are creating a very difficult climate for future generations.”
The study, which has been published in Nature Climate Change, is based on a model of future emissions scenarios and the known health impact of air pollution. The economic cost was calculated from the value the Environmental Protection Agency places upon each avoided premature death.
A 75% reduction in transport emissions would save 120,000 lives by 2030, the Duke study calculated, while a 63% cut in energy emissions would prevent a further 175,000 deaths. Most of these saved lives would be in cities and states that contain high concentrations of polluting industry, such as Ohio and Kentucky.
The US would also gain economically from emissions cuts, with $800bn saved by 2030 due to the reduced health burden, increased consumer spending and transition to new clean energy opportunities.
According to the World Health Organisation, about seven million people died in 2012 as a result of air pollution. WHO said this total – which represents one in eight of all total global deaths – shows that air pollution is the “world’s largest single environmental health risk”. Heart disease and stroke are the primary deadly consequences of air pollution."

An international team of scientists examined two dozen locations across the globe to chart rising and falling seas over centuries and millennia. 
Until the 1880s and the world’s industrialisation, the fastest seas rose was about 3cm to 4cm a century. During that time global sea levels did not get much higher or lower than 7.6cm above or below the 2,000-year average. But in the 20th century the world’s seas rose 14cm. 
Two different studies published on Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences said that by 2100 the world’s oceans would rise between 28cm to 131cm, depending on how much heat-trapping gas Earth’s industries and vehicles expel.
Rutgers earth and planetary sciences professor Bob Kopp, lead author of the study, which looked back at sea levels over the past three millennia, said: “There’s no question that the 20th century is the fastest.
“It’s because of the temperature increase in the 20th century which has been driven by fossil fuel use.”
Sea level rise in the 20th century was mostly manmade, the study authors said. A separate, not-yet-published study by Kopp and others found that since 1950 about two-thirds of the US coastal floods in 27 locales were linked to manmade warming.
Study co-author Stefan Rahmstorf, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, said that if seas continued to rise as projected, another 45cm would cause lots of problems and expense, especially with surges during storms.
“There is such a tight relationship between sea level and temperature,” Horton said. “I wish there wasn’t, then we wouldn’t be as worried.”
If greenhouse gas pollution continues at the current pace, both studies project increases of about 57cm to 131cm. If countries fulfil the treaty agreed upon last year in Paris and limit further warming to another 2F, sea level rise would be in the 28 to 56cm range.
Jonathan Overpeck at the University of Arizona, who wasn’t part of the studies, praised them, saying they show a clear cause and effect between warming and sea level rise."

The government has been proposing an expansion of gas use as a “bridging” technology that emits less carbon than coal, which ministers have said will be phased out as a power generation source by 2025. 
But, according to a study published on Tuesday by the respected UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC), the scope for gas without carbon capture and storage (CCS) is “very limited”.
“If we are using the bridge analogy, then we are already some way across the bridge,” said Mike Bradshaw, professor of global energy at Warwick Business School.
George Osborne, the chancellor, controversially cancelled the long-running £1bn government-sponsored competition to develop a demonstration plant for CCS last November. The move was a blow to plans to make the UK a pioneer in the fledgling technology, which has yet to be demonstrated at commercial scale.
Without CCS, the UK will only be able to use 10% more gas in 2050 than it did in 2010, according to the UKERC study, if legally binding climate change targets are to be met.
That will be a severe limitation to companies wishing to generate power from gas in the long term, and it poses a conundrum for the UK’s domestic heating, for which gas is the primary fuel. Few other sources of domestic heating have yet been explored, with renewable heating such as biomass boilers and heat pumps accounting for a tiny proportion of UK homes.
Prof Bradshaw said that shale gas from the UK could still be used, but that this would depend on such gas production being proved commercially viable “and we are a long way from that”.
He said that a new “dash for gas” to replace coal could provide “some short term gains” in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but he cautioned that this might not be cost-effective. “It is in fact a really dangerous assumption.”
He said: “If all coal-fired power generation is to be removed by 2025, and we are no longer supporting the development of CCS, policy makers must think carefully about how best to replace that capacity. Gas can play only a modest role between now and 2020 and in the medium to long term has no role as a bridging fuel because the UK has already exploited a large amount of the decarbonisation potential in the power sector.”
Prof Jim Watson, director of UKERC, noted that electricity generators were not building new gas-fired power stations, despite having planning permission to do so. He said this was a reflection of current policy and economics. 
The likely future limitations to gas use for electricity generation, which UKERC has uncovered, are likely to prove a further deterrent to companies wishing to build such generation, unless government policies are amended. The government has slashed support for renewable energy since coming to power last May, as well as abruptly ending the CCS plans, while strongly backing shale gas exploration.
Amber Rudd, energy and climate change secretary, told a meeting of the all-party parliamentary environment group last week that “new technological breakthroughs” were required to tackle emissions and avoid dangerous climate change, but she insisted that CCS was currently too expensive for the government to support.
Watson said it was possible that the government was hoping CCS would be developed in another country, and the UK could then adopt the technology, but said this was “problematic” because the UK had previously been a pioneer in attempting to develop CCS.
He said the UK’s climate change targets were “doable, but the policies have to be in place to get there”.
Tony Bosworth, energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “This report shows gas is not a long term solution to our energy problems. Building more gas-fired power stations, as the government wants, risks locking us into a high carbon future, making it harder to tackle climate change. The real answer to our energy problems is investing more in renewable power and improving energy efficiency.”"

At a meeting in Brussels in October 2013, Karel de Gucht told the firm that the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) could address its concerns about regulations in developing countries that restrict the company’s activities.
The news emerged as a Greenpeace barricade delayed the resumption of talks between EU and US delegations on the TTIP deal, which both sides hope can be completed before President Obama leaves office next January.
According to minutes of the October meeting, the hour-long conversation focused on shale gas; “geopolitical aspects”; EU plans to label tar sands as high-polluting; and a possible reconversion of ExxonMobil’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal in the US to export crude to Europe. This would be “costly and may take two-three years,” the minutes said.
Heavily redacted records show that two officials from Exxon’s US and EU regions were present in the room with de Gucht, the then-trade commissioner, Claes Bengtsson, his cabinet member, and two other unidentified individuals. 
According to a briefing paper for de Gucht, released to the Guardian under access to documents laws, the commission was keen to point out the advantages that a TTIP deal could offer ExxonMobil, with respect to countries not party to the trade deal.
“TTIP is perhaps more relevant as setting a precedent vis-a-vis third countries than governing trade and investment bilaterally,” the paper says. “We think that this third country element is in the interest of the energy sector, and especially globally active companies like Shell or Exxonmobil. After all, companies like Shell or Exxonmobil face the same trade barriers when doing business in Africa, in Russia or in South America.”
The commission was in effect saying that once the trade deal was in place, other countries outside it would be progressively forced to adopt the same measures, making it easier for companies such as ExxonMobil to expand into their markets.
John Hilary, the executive director of the campaign group War on Want, accused the commission of overstepping its mandate in the talks. “It is tantamount to corruption that the European commission should be prepared to work hand in glove with such vested interests in crafting deals that will have a profound effect on our environment,” he told the Guardian.
At the time that the brief was written, several countries in the “global south” were tightening regulations on fossil fuel companies for the first time in a decade, despite ExxonMobil’s ambitions to open up shale gas fracking wells in North Africa, Asia and South America.
The briefing paper said that the TTIP talks were a unique chance to write a new rule-book for global trade that “could serve as a model for subsequent negotiations involving third countries”.
“The commission’s clear priority is establishing a template for all future deals,” Hilary said. “It is critical because it means that no countries will be able to tighten the regulatory regime on fossil fuel companies operating on their territories.”
Dr Valérie Marcel, associate energy fellow at Chatham House, said that in late 2013, fossil fuel firms had been increasingly fearful that the long-term investment climate was changing.
“There was a growing trend of producing countries wanting to capture maximum windfalls from petroleum projects,” she said. “They were imposing windfall taxes or threatening to change contractual terms, so they [the oil companies] probably wanted to put political pressure on those governments.”
ExxonMobil’s public response was to protest against regulatory frameworks, financial incentives and “protectionist policies,” which it said were holding industry back. It also called on the US to end its ban on exports of crude oil and LNG.
This was a position the firm shared with the EU, and which informed debate at the meeting whose minutes the commission redacted because they “reveal possible strategies that the commission may adopt in the ongoing negotiations,” according to documents previously released to the Guardian.
But commission officials deny offering ExxonMobil any advantages and, while declining comment on the discussions, insist that trade reform is needed.
“EU and US companies face discrimination when they need access to resources,” a commission spokesman told the Guardian. “Once they have produced the energy goods, they do not get access to the grid, or access at less favourable conditions. Energy resource countries supply energy resources at below market prices to their domestic industry. The EU and US industry is put at a disadvantage.”
Steve Kretzmann, the director of the campaign group Oil Change International, described the commission’s behaviour as a “scandalous” attempt to liberalise the global crude market that went beyond shale gas and shale oil.
“I see it as standard setting because it would allow the EU to place greater diplomatic and political pressure on those [developing] countries to lower all their trade barriers,” he said. “If the US is not doing this protective policy anymore you shouldn’t either.”
ExxonMobil would not respond directly to questions about the meeting. But Nikolaas Baeckelmans, the company’s vice-president of EU affairs, said: “ExxonMobil supports an open, unbiased, and rules-based trade and investment system. We see that as essential to global free enterprise and to promoting alignment of business interests, productivity, and economic growth.” "

Set more ambitious targets based on climate science. We explain what it all means";"The vast majority of global companies have no obligation to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. Still, many of them try. But the overall efforts aren’t nearly enough to help deal with the potential devastating impacts of climate change, from increasing droughts and wildfires to the mass extinction of species. Critics say businesses need to do more, including setting more ambitious carbon reduction targets and proving they can hit those goals. Now, an increasing number of environmental consulting and advocacy groups are using science-based targets to describe the types of goals they say companies and businesses need to achieve in order to make a difference.
But what are science-based targets? Here is what you need to know:
The term refers to carbon emission reduction goals that are line with the levels that a United Nations climate report said will be required to keep global warming in check. To help raise awareness of corporate climate action, the UN Global Compact has formed an initiative – simply titled Science Based Targets – in collaboration with the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the World Resources Institute and the World Wildlife Fund to help guide companies in enforcing these targets.
The UN climate report projects that manmade emissions will likely increase the global temperature 3.7C to 4.8C from the average temperature before Industrial Revolution by the end of this century due to manmade emissions. Just yesterday, new studies showed that global warming is causing sea levels to rise much faster than they have in the past 28 centuries. Scientific evidence has already prompted political leaders to agree that limiting the temperature rise to 2C would help to minimize the environmental and social devastation. The recent Paris climate agreement calls for limiting the increase to 1.5C. Business should use science to set benchmarks for their environmental initiatives as well. 
There isn’t one definitive way to come up with a good target. The Science Based Targets initiative has outlined models and factors, such as taking into consideration the company’s contribution to the global gross domestic product, that companies should include in calculating the actual and projected emissions over time, and steps to reduce them. The initiative reviews and approves the targets set by participating companies, which have two years after signing up to come up with a game plan.
So far, the initiative has approved plans from 12 companies, including Dell, Kellogg, NRG Energy and Pfizer. It has commitment from more than 100 companies to set new goals. Some of the companies, such as General Mills, plan to reduce emissions from the goods and services they purchase and their delivery and distribution operations.
Setting ambitious targets is one thing, meeting them is another. Whether companies can meet the voluntary targets they created is far from certain. Critics also have pointed out that some companies grossly under-report their carbon footprint. Meanwhile, the public will most likely remain skeptical – particularly considering the actions of some companies like Volkswagen, which fail to follow environmental laws. "

Now, companies can rely on science-based targets and data to help get results";"Momentum is building in the private sector to curb climate change now more than ever. Investors worldwide have pledged to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from $600bn in assets under management. Hundreds of companies have committed to reduce emissions, use more renewable energy and put a price on carbon. Decades of progress have brought us to this point, made even more concrete by the Paris agreement in December.
If the Paris agreement is to succeed in stabilizing the climate, the private sector must increase ambition beyond current practices. The 1,000 largest companies alone are responsible for one-fifth of total global greenhouse gas emissions. Many companies have been working on environmental sustainability for years, but emissions from the corporate sector are still growing. So how will we know if each company is doing its part to solve the climate problem?
First, it’s important to set the right targets, and use the best science available to inform these targets. This changes the conversation from a discussion about how much a company could reduce emissions to how much it must reduce emissions to help avoid the most damaging effects of climate change.
Before taking aim, though, each company needs to know the size of its carbon footprint. The practice of carbon footprinting is already commonplace, thanks to the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard which provides an internationally-consistent approach for companies to measure their emissions. This standard was published by World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development in 2001.
At the time, I was managing the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Climate Leaders program, working with companies to measure emissions using the GHG Protocol and to set emissions reduction targets. We focused on large multi-national companies with the biggest carbon footprints, and by the close of the program in 2010 (as the agency moved towards mandatory reporting), more than 200 companies were onboard.
To get EPA’s approval, companies had to offer targets that went beyond the expected “business as usual” improvements. At the time, these companies setting targets were ahead of their peers – after all, measuring corporate greenhouse gas emissions was a new voluntary practice and cutting emissions was not required.
But most businesses set targets by looking at what could be done through available low-cost energy efficiency opportunities and other reduction activities with a quick payback, such as swapping long-lasting LED lighting for electricity-gulping incandescent bulbs. So while companies may creep away from carbon, they still depend on it. And although most companies are genuinely committed to cutting emissions – not least because their stakeholders hold them accountable for it – they are wary of failing to meet their targets if they aim too high.
The good news is greater ambition can lead to innovation. Even in those early days, some companies did set stretch targets. SC Johnson, for example, developed an ambitious emissions-cutting goal with little idea of how they would meet it. Working with a landfill near one of the company’s largest facilities, they used landfill gas to directly power their operations, cutting emissions by 17% and saving $1m per year. Their early ambitious target empowered the energy team to make this innovative project happen.
Today, it’s common for companies to set emissions targets. In 2014, 1,372 companies reported greenhouse gas targets to CDP’s global climate registry, the most widely used corporate reporting registry on climate impacts. But most still take a cautious approach that leads to only incremental improvements, even as the science on climate change becomes more compelling.
Since the days of EPA’s Climate Leaders initiative, target-setting practices have generally stayed the same, which fails to encourage innovation or stem the climate crisis. We now know we must cut global greenhouse gas emissions up to 70% by 2050 to limit global warming to less than 2C, the amount of warming deemed safe by the international community. And economists have indicated that failing to deal with a changing climate will bring long term, negative economic impacts.
More and more corporations are heeding this call and setting science-based targets, which represent a company’s share of the global carbon budget: the amount of carbon the world can collectively emit while hoping to stay on a 2C path. To figure this out, companies can choose among various methods, including one that divides the carbon budget among different sectors, taking into account each sector’s growth projections and unique opportunities to cut carbon emissions.
Science-based targets was a popular topic in the run-up to the Paris climate summit, and by the close of the conference 114 companies had publicly committed to this approach, and 10 companies announced their targets. Dell committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their facilities and logistics operations by 50% from 2010 levels by 2020; the computer giant also committed to reduce the energy intensity of their product portfolio by 80% from 2011 levels by 2020. Meanwhile, consumer foods leader General Mills committed to reduce absolute emissions 28% across their entire value chain – from farm to fork to landfill – by 2025, using a 2010 base-year.
Such targets are not yet standard practice, but eventually all companies will need to accept planetary boundaries – the limits in which humans can operate safely – if they are to continue doing business. This principle also applies to other critical environmental like water and land use.
There is no halfway to avoiding environmental catastrophe. Science-based targets demonstrate that companies can and will welcome environmental science as a guide for long term sustainability. What’s important now is to change the discussion from what companies think they can do, to what they must do to usher in a prosperous, low-carbon future."

“We’re not necessarily out of the coal business and it’s not fossil fuels because we’ll still use gas. We need to be out of the CO2 emissions business,” Andrew Vesey, the chief executive of AGL told Guardian Australia. “We’ve done a lot of thinking around this and we believe our view of the future will be restraints on carbon emissions.”
The quicker you want to try to do this, the more you need the intervention of government
Vesey also admitted the expense of decommissioning power plants and mines and returning them to their natural state – the so-called rehabilitation cost – was a concern at the top of their “issues list”.
AGL, established in 1837 as the Australian Gaslight Company, is a $12.3bn company and provides gas or electricity to 3.7 million people in eastern Australia. Before 2012, it was Australia’s biggest investor in renewable energy. Then it went on a buying spree of coal-fired power stations, making it also Australia’s biggest investor in coal power and Australia’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter.
But in what appeared to be an about-face last year, less than six months after Vesey took control, AGL announced it would be not be involved with conventional coal-fired power generation after 2050 and said the company supported a target of less than 2C of global warming.
“It’s nothing to do with the science – it’s irrelevant what I believe. If markets believe it, if customers believe it, if investors believe it, if government is making policy, then what I have is a significant risk in my portfolio that I have to mitigate,” Vesey told Guardian Australia this week.
In practice, the announcement last year meant the company would run its coal-fired power stations through to the end of their life, including Loy Yang A, the country’s biggest-emitting generator, which produces 15m tonnes of CO2 each year.
But it also meant AGL wouldn’t extend the life of those plants or invest in any others unless they had carbon capture and storage. 
Critics said the move was merely window-dressing, arguing the closure of coal-fired power stations by mid century was inevitable. And it meant the country’s biggest polluter would continue running the most polluting power station until the middle of the century – something that seems at odds with a target of 2C of warming.
But Vesey argued it was a significant move. “We fundamentally said we … are not going to extend the lives of the plants, which is quite a big commitment if you think about it because that’s a very low cost option. And the last thing you want to do as the manager of a company is close off options, but we did. And we said we wouldn’t finance any new plants and we wouldn’t acquire any new plants.”
Critics also questioned the timeframe. “People immediately came out and said 2048 is too long,” Vesey said. But change needed to be managed carefully.
“Change takes a long time but when it comes everybody is always surprised. The impacts on customers on communities and on shareholders are [more] significant the faster you do this. The quicker you want to try to do this, the more you need the intervention of government.”
He said that announcement was a first move in an uncertain environment. “We did this in an environment where there was no clear policy about transition – there were no set goals.”
At the time the Australian prime minister Tony Abbott had been trumpeting the importance of coal, having famously said it was “good for humanity”.
“If things change, if there are other mechanisms, they could be brought forward – if there’s consensus in the policy framework,” Vesey said. “But we have been very clear about what we’re doing.”
Vesey supports a price on carbon. And previously, he has said the government should simply mandate that old or dirty power plants be shut.
Asked if that meant AGL would be looking for compensation for shutting plants, Vesey said he didn’t believe plants should be paid for closure. “We believe that you’ve made the investment and you take the upside of that. But if you’ve made an investment that is not right, there must be some accountability for investors.”
But Vesey went on to say he’d be supportive of anything that helped develop consensus around the closure of ageing plants. He has previously been critical of an idea by Frank Jotzo from the Australian National University, where competitors would bid in a reverse auction for how much they needed to be paid by other companies to shut their plant. But Vesey now said the idea could work.
“It’s not what we would have argued for,” Vesey said. “But if somebody comes up with this and it’s politically acceptable … if it’s doable and it gets capacity out of the market then we would take a very hard look at it. We won’t stand in the way of anything that does that.”
But environmentalists have pointed out that shutting power plants and coalmines raises the prospect of decommissioning and rehabilitation costs that companies might not be prepared to pay for.
A Credit Suisse report from January noted AGL only had $77m put aside for rehabilitating its Loy Yang power plant and associated mine, which will leave them $320m short when it closes in 2048.
AGL disputes the way the way the provisioning is calculated to grow over that time, but Vesey admits that a blow-out of rehabilitation costs is at the top of their “issues list”.
If mines are closed early, that could mean they need to find more money. But Vesey said he was more concerned about costs associated with stricter demands on rehabilitation in the future.
“The world changes. So is there a sense that expectations in 2048 for rehab will be different than today? I’d say yes.”
Since the first of AGL’s coal power plants closes in just six years and it is already beginning to deal with rehabilitation of the coal seam gas projects it’s pulling out of, Vesey said the company was confronting the issue now. “It’s becoming very real to us and we really want to take a position that is ahead of where we need to be so that we can have a conversation.”
In December Vesey attended sideline talks at the Paris climate conference and shortly after announced a $3bn Powering Australian Renewables Fund (Parf). 
It was met with headlines declaring AGL was going greener, but critics were quick to point out it aimed to create 1,000MW of renewable capacity, which is roughly AGL’s share of the government’s renewable energy target. 
Vesey dismissed that criticism, saying that between the Parf and its other renewable ventures, “we’re going to blow the doors off the renewables target.”
But to get renewables moving, Vesey argued the basic problem was the balance of supply and demand, and to fix that old coal-fired power stations needed to be shut down one way or another to lower supply.
“The fact of the matter is you can’t continue to add capacity to a market that is over supplied.” If supply was lowered, wholesale prices would go up, which would make investment in new infrastructure more profitable, he said.
“It’s 7,000MW oversupplied and we’re adding 5,000MW just to hit the RET target.”
“Having the target, while good, is not enough. My view is that, you need to get to the fundamentals of what’s preventing private capital from moving.”"

The Climate Central research shows that coastal flooding days have more than doubled in the US since the 1980s, the primary drivers of which have been the warming of the atmosphere and oceans. The findings are based on a separate study, released on Monday, that found the Earth’s seas are rising at a pace unseen in the past 2,800 years.
Between 2005 and 2014, a gauge at Kings Point in New York showed there were 157 days where the water reached above an established “nuisance” level – double the total of the previous decade. A total of 96 of these flooding events are attributed to changes in the climate. 
In Washington DC, a total of 522 human-induced flooding days have occurred since 1950, with just 336 deemed to have occurred regardless of the changes in our climate. In San Francisco, the number of human-caused flooding events is almost three times above the unaltered trend while Charleston in South Carolina endured 219 flooding days between 2005 and 2014, with the vast majority climate change-driven.
The analysis compares the latest yearly estimates for human-caused global sea level rise with hourly water level records at 27 tide gauges around the US, to see the influence of climate change on nuisance flooding. The world’s oceans are estimated to have risen by an average of six inches compared with the 19th century, spurred by melting land ice and the thermal expansion of seawater.
The results show that flooding events are being severely exacerbated by climate change, primarily in the upping of high tide marks. With even just a small increase in the high tide level, flooding can inundate areas, resulting in roads being cut off or houses and businesses becoming swamped.
Across all the tidal gauges, climate change was responsible for three-quarters of these flooding events over the past decade. The US’s east coast is experiencing sea level increases above the global average, possibly due to a change in the Gulf stream that is causing warmer water to pile up along the Atlantic seaboard.
“This human fingerprint on flooding is already interfering with people’s lives and local economies, as well as degrading local infrastructure,” said Dr Ben Strauss, who led the analysis. “We aren’t talking about buildings getting knocked over, but there are real effects to people’s lives.
“There has been a sharp spike in flood rates over the past few decades, driven by us. This is only going to continue to accelerate and we will see more dramatic impacts in the coming decades. We can take adaptive measures but eventually a lot of land will be submerged. These flooding events are the warning bells.”
Barrier islands, which are long offshore deposits of sediment or sand found in places such as New Jersey and North Carolina, will bear the brunt of the continued sea level increases. Miami Beach, which is re-engineering its flood controls to deal with regular inundations, is considered particularly vulnerable.
“In the long run some places will have to be abandoned, but in the short term it’s not clear,” said Strauss. “It will all depend on how we plan. The better we plan for this, the better our chances will be.”
 The study released on Monday, compiled by an international team of scientists, found that if greenhouse gas pollution continues at its current pace, the sea level will rise by a further 57cm to 131cm. If countries fulfil the treaty agreed upon last year in Paris and limit further warming to another 2C, sea level rise would be in the 28 to 56cm range."

This week it was announced the bleaching event, which began in 2014, is already the longest in history and could extend well into 2017. “We may be looking at a two- to two-and-a-half-year-long event. Some areas have already seen bleaching two years in a row,” says Mark Eakin, coordinator of the Coral Reef Watch program at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Corals around Hawaii have been hit twice by the event already, with Fiji last week smacked by a gust of warm water that devastated coral and killed tonnes of fish, just before Cyclone Winston tore through the island nation. Fiji had already been hit by the same extended bleaching event last year. 
“Research shows that the frequency of mass bleaching events is increasing because of global warming. The corals are being hit again and again,” Eakin says. The big problem with that is that coral reefs need time to recover. If they get hit too frequently, they can disappear, being taken over by algae and seaweed.
And now the warm water that’s bleaching the world’s coral is stretching to the doorstep of the world’s biggest coral reef system. “It’s crunch time for the Great Barrier Reef,” says Tyrone Ridgway from the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland in Australia.
What the weather brings now will change everything. Authorities are praying for clouds and rain.
When waters warm beyond what coral can cope with, they expel the algal squatters that feed them energy and give them their brilliant colours, leaving them white and weak. If that lasts too long, the corals starve, become infected with viruses, and die.
In 1998, the world woke up to the possibility of such a global bleaching event when the biggest El Niño on record shot a splurge of hot water around the globe, bleaching one sixth of the world’s coral. Half the reefs on the Great Barrier Reef were affected.
It happened again in 2010. Then in October last year, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared we were in the midst of the third recorded global bleaching event.
Scientists predicted that 38% of the world’s coral reefs would be affected and up to 5% could be lost forever.
This one started when a strange patch of warm water nicknamed “the blob” emerged off the coast of Mexico and California. It was made worse when an El Niño started to emerge in the Pacific Ocean, warming waters, but failed to properly kick in. And it was capped off when a near-record breaking El Niño finally did emerge in late in 2015, sending hot waters right across the equatorial pacific, baking corals anywhere in its path.
Back in October when the event was announced, Noaa provided a projection for the period from February to May this year, showing what parts of the world should expect some bleaching (alert level 1) and those where widespread bleaching and coral death was expected (alert level 2).
Things looked grim. Huge swaths of the world’s oceans were painted a dark shade of red, indicating alert level 2.
Now that we’ve reached that period, the projections are tightened, and Noaa is painting a slightly less devastating picture.
“Climate models will never provide exact forecasts as they are based on multiple runs and real life only gets one,” explains Eakin.
Throughout the tropics, where most coral reefs live, the forecasts remained similar.
In the Great Barrier Reef “the intensity hasn’t necessarily manifested itself as badly as it might have been forecast,” says Ridgway.
“But saying that, the next three to four weeks will be the crunch time as to whether the reef bleaches,” he says.
And early signs are worrying. “There are reports of bleaching on some of the flats on the central Great Barrier Reef and we have seen bleaching on Heron Island.”
So Ridgway is hoping for bad weather. “Now if we get good weather – nice still conditions – for the next few weeks over the reef, that will help ramp up the heat. If we get wild weather like storms, that will help mix the water and keep the temperatures at bay.”
Scientists in Australia are rushing to document what happens if the reef bleaches.
“In our global warming experiment, we’re not experts,” says Ove Hoegh-Guldberg a professor at the University of Queensland and the chief scientist with XL Catlin Seaview Survey. That project aims to capture the reefs before and after the bleaching, and learn exactly what factors influence it.
Hoegh-Guldberg says it’s too early to say what will happen with the Great Barrier Reef and whether it will be as bad as 1998 or not. He was recently at Heron Island and saw the bleaching begin. “I was quite surprised by how advanced it was,” he says.
He says each El Niño is different, and each one happens in an increasingly warmer world. Studying what happens this time will help reef managers understand and predict the process.
While Australia’s famous reefs are touch-and-go, other places, where the populations are rely even more on the reefs for their livelihood, have less reason for hope.
Eakin says the greatest worry is for places including Kiribati, the South Pacific and the Indian Ocean, which remain on the highest alert. Bleaching has now happened on Fiji and he says the latest reports are that reefs in New Caledonia are bleaching now.
Then, as the Northern Hemisphere moves towards summer, bleaching could spread into the Northern Pacific and the Caribbean.
“Basically, it’s heating up in a quite scary way,” says Richard Vevers, executive director of XL Catlin Seaview Survey. “When you look at the bleaching forecast globally, there’s some horrific looking illustrations of the level two alert predicted over the coming months.”"

The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said it would be a “disgrace” and that he was “shattered by the concept” of the Heathrow 13 being imprisoned, while the Green MP Caroline Lucas said it would be “deeply unjust”.
Heathrow executives said that the protesters had jeopardised safety at the airport and needed to face the consequences.
The activists, 13 men and women aged between 22 and 67, cut through the fence and blocked a runway at Britain’s biggest airport on 13 July 2015, causing various flights to be delayed and 25 to be cancelled. They were convicted in January of aggravated trespass and entering a restricted area of an aerodrome, and were warned by a district judge that prison sentences were almost inevitable. 
McDonnell, whose constituency includes Heathrow and who has been a longstanding opponent of the airport’s expansion, said the protesters had been “motivated by best motives”. 
He said: “We are fearful that the Heathrow 13 may receive a custodial sentence which frankly, I think, would be a disgrace … It is in the tradition of this country over centuries that people have taken direct action of this sort and it should not be one which receives a custodial sentence.” 
Lucas, who will speak at a rally in support of the protesters outside Willesden magistrates court ahead of their sentencing on Wednesday, said: “Sending the Heathrow 13 to prison would be utterly unwarranted. They took a principled and non-violent stand against the colossal environmental cost of expanding an airport that already breaches air pollution laws – yet they’re being treated as if they are somehow a danger to society.
“The real dangers we face are the toxic fumes emitted by airports and the looming threat of catastrophic climate change. Sending these committed activists to jail would be deeply unjust.”
Lucas said that if the 13 were jailed, an early day motion would be lodged in parliament urging their release.
Heathrow’s chief financial officer, Michael Uzielli, declined to say whether he felt the activists should be jailed. He said: “We absolutely support the right to peaceful protest, but our imperative has to be the safety of passengers and employees. They broke through the fence and entered the live runway, and if you do break the law there are going to be consequences. 
“Peaceful protest happens quite often and we have a good track record of facilitating those without impacting on our passengers’ journeys.”
The protesters who could be jailed on Wednesday, 10 of whom have no previous convictions, include charity workers, a retired professor, a climate scientist and local residents. The 13 are Danielle Paffard, 28; Rebecca Sanderson, 28; Richard Hawkins, 32; Kara Moses, 32; Ella Gilbert, 23; Melanie Strickland, 32; Graham Thompson, 42; Sheila Menon, 44; Cameron Kaye, 23; Edward Thacker, 26; Alistair Tamlit, 27; Sam Sender, 23; and Robert Basto, 67.
During the trial, the 13 argued that their actions were reasonable, proportionate and necessary to prevent death and serious injury via air pollution and climate change, saying that 31 people a year die prematurely around Heathrow due to its pollution, and thousands die due to the effects of climate change. 
In a statement on Tuesday, the Heathrow 13 said: “Clearly, none of us would choose to go to jail, but this shouldn’t be singled out as the main ‘injustice’. Climate change is the real injustice, with the majority of the world’s population, those in the global south, being the ones who continue to be most affected.
“The science is clear … There can be no new runways in the UK if we are to take climate change seriously.”
The action, which began at 3.30am and lasted around six hours before the last protester was removed from the runway, was part of the long-running Plane Stupid campaign against airport expansion. Its high-profile direct action was originally part of a campaign that eventually led to plans for a third runway at Heathrow being overturned in 2010 by David Cameron’s coalition government.

Every couple of days, the float will drop deeper – down to 2km – and then rise to the surface to transmit its data, before disappearing back into the depths to do the whole thing again. 
These floats do this for as long as eight years, until the poor little things die of exhaustion (well, their batteries run out). 
There are about 3,800 of these floats scattered across the globe as part of a program called Argo, supported by more than 30 countries. 
It’s likely you’ve never heard of Argo and much less likely you’ve ever seen one of the floats.
But for the last decade, climate scientists and oceanographers have been using the data from these Argo floats to plug a gaping ocean-sized hole in our understanding of global warming.
Scientific papers that use the data from these floats are now appearing in science journals at the rate of about one per day. 
But now, scientists are sounding an alarm for the future of this ocean monitoring system. In a commentary in the journal Nature Climate Change, scientists say cracks are starting to appear in the network, largely because of uncertainties over funding. 
The commentary predicts it could be only two years before the number of floats drops below a critical threshold of 3,200, which would “considerably undermine the ability of the observing system to monitor and measure the global ocean”.
Australian Dr Paul Durack, of the US government-funded Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is one of the scientists sounding the alarm. He told me:
Argo is an amazing entity – there are at least 30 nations involved – and it’s giving us observations that we have never had before. From about 2005, Argo gave us comprehensive ocean data – if you don’t have data you can’t say anything. Basically, it has completely changed the game.
Knowing what’s happening in the globe’s oceans is critical. About 90% of the extra heat from human-caused global warming has ended up there. 
When you get below a couple of hundred metres you see the inexorable growth of global warming happening in the oceans
Some 31 countries have contributed to the Argo program, with floats costing about US$25,000 each. The United States funds about half, with about 2,142 of the floats currently in circulation. 
France is the second-biggest supporter, with 356 floats, followed by Australia with 346. Two-thirds of the global ocean is in the southern hemisphere.
CSIRO’s Dr Susan Wijffels is the co-chair of the global Argo program and also the lead scientist for Australia’s contribution to Argo.
In the Nature Climate Change commentary, Wijffels says any drop in the number of deployments of floats could spell trouble. She told me:
Argo is fundamental because this all comes back to the heat problem. The key thing that matters for the Earth is how much extra heat is retained in the system. 
While we have seen this huge debate over the last 15 years about this so-called ‘hiatus’, really what Argo shows us is that surface variability [in temperature] is just a re-organisation of heat.
When you get below a couple of hundred metres you see the inexorable growth of global warming happening in the oceans. That’s driving a good chunk of the sea level rise. It is telling us what the radiation imbalance is at the top of the atmosphere.
Once that heat and that carbon is down there in the deep ocean it’s there for decades – if not longer – and it’s locking in that warming. We see that warming in Argo right down to the depths of our measurement – right down to two kilometres and its probably extending further.
Oceanographer Prof Dean Roemmich, of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, is also a co-chair of the global Argo program. He told me why there’s a fear the comprehensive coverage that Argo gives the world’s oceans could be at risk. 
In most nations Argo is supported by research funds – rather than as operational oceanography – with no mechanism for inflation or for long-term funding. So far Argo has been successful in increasing the lifetime of floats so that less deployments are needed to maintain the array and bringing in new national programs to sustain the level of total deployments. 
Durack points out these advances are difficult to sustain and without them the array would decline. This is an important caution, and along with it we need to continue making the case for Argo’s great value in order to increase support from Argo national programs.
Roemmich says Australian scientists are “world leaders in basic research using Argo data, particularly in the Southern Ocean” and that the country also provides critical operational support.
Tim Moltmann is the director of the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS), a program funded by the Department of Education and Training and which has provided about half the funding for Australia’s Argo program over the past decade.
It has been revolutionary. What we knew about the subsurface ocean before Argo was pretty much limited to what we could get from ships – dropping instruments into the water and getting measurements. You can imagine that’s pretty sparse
What’s critically important from an Australian perspective is that from a historical point of view, measurements of the oceans have been dominated by the northern hemisphere.
Argo has been critically important for Australia and the southern hemisphere because it has enabled us to bootstrap our subsurface observing capability in a remarkable way. 
That’s how we know that ocean heat content is changing. That’s how we know that so-called ‘pause’ [in global warming] isn’t really a pause if you look at the whole system, because the heat has been building up in the ocean.
IMOS has funded about half of Australia’s Argo effort so far, says Moltmann.
Over the past decade, about 20% of the funding for Australia’s Argo program has come from the CSIRO, which also employs about four full-time staff who work to understand and interpret the data and maintain the floats.
Paul Durack is also the scientist who helped to coordinate an open letter signed by almost 3,000 scientists from 60 countries calling on CSIRO to reconsider planned cuts to its climate change research.
He is worried those cuts could make matters worse for Argo. In the commentary, written before the cuts were announced, Durack writes:
Future forecasts are inherently difficult to generate, due to the short-term nature of national budgets, along with unanticipated technology and deployment problems or new technology breakthroughs. These are further confounded by a critical dependence on each and every nation that contributes to the array – and a loss of just one of these key contributors will have a profound impact.
CSIRO chairman David Thodey wrote last week that the agency was “committed” to “contribute to the international Argo floats program”.
But when I asked for details of the commitment and whether the cuts would impact on Argo, a CSIRO spokesperson would only say the agency was “currently working through the impacts of the strategic realignment” with staff and research partners. "

The hunt is on for her replacement, the UN job portal is open, the salary in the region of $200,000 (£143,000).
Applicants need to demonstrate vision, communication skills, experience of working with senior leaders and be a patient sort.
With less than five years until a new global pact comes into force, it’s a critical time for whoever takes over, with the prospect of little glory but plenty of graft.
On the downside you have to live in Bonn. On the upside it requires a lot of travel so you won’t be there much.
The UN climate body has only had four heads: one from Malta, two from the Netherlands and the incumbent from Costa Rica. History favours candidates from small countries, not permanent members of the UN security council.
Climate Home has canvassed opinion from the international climate change community – here’s a rundown of the top 10 names being discussed (in no particular order).
Mexico’s ambassador to Germany is highly regarded in climate circles, having taken over the presidency of the UN talks in 2010 with the Copenhagen hangover still raging. Careful diplomacy and a tight alliance with Figueres saw the Cancun talks get back on track after the Danish disaster.
If the UN wants to emphasise its commitment to implementation between now and 2020, the executive director of the International Energy Agency could be a decent bet. The Turkish economist is on the UN’s Sustainable Energy 4 All panel and is a respected media performer.
Lima’s environment chief has an election coming up, potentially freeing him up for other pursuits. Credited with ensuring UN talks were more open and transparent in 2014, MPV was asked to assist COP21 president Laurent Fabius in Paris as a bridge with civil society groups.
The lean and quiet environment minister of the Gambia lives on the frontline of climate change, a powerful advocate for investment in adaptation and loss and damage. One-time head of the Least Developed Countries group was chosen to be one of Fabius’ advisors in the closing stages of Paris.
Diseko brought a touch of drama and glamour to UN talks through 2015, fiercely defending the 134-strong Group of 77 she was charged with leading. She’s an old hand at the UN and one of the key advisors to the South African government during the 2011 COP17 summit in Durban.
Former chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, Grenada ambassador to the UN and Oxfam climate advisor, Williams is a UN talks veteran. She’s another potential candidate who lives on the climate frontline, often writing about the impact of rising sea levels on her home.
An architecture critic, author, economist and diplomat, there are apparently few subjects Corrêa do Lago cannot discuss with authority. Brazil’s smooth and media-friendly ambassador to Japan was – until 2012 – its head of climate negotiations, and chief negotiator at the Rio+20 talks.
Secretary of state for climate change between 2008-2011, Ribera now runs the Paris-based IDDRI thinktank, which played a key behind-the-scenes role helping the French government at COP21. An established name on the circuit, Ribera has also led IDDRI’s Latin American outreach.
If Laurent Fabius was the face of the UN climate talks, Tubiana was the brains trust behind the project, advising the COP president on the technical aspects of a climate deal. A warm personality who made many new friends in the past year, it’s doubtful she’d want to swap Paris for Bonn.
When Paris looked in trouble, France turned to Teixeira to resolve the developed v developing divide at UN talks. A robust negotiator and career civil servant who rarely smiles in public, she was the face of the Rio+20 talks and sits on the UN high level panel for post-2015 development. "

In their annual open letter, Bill and Melinda Gates provide an update on their plans to stimulate innovation in technologies for tackling climate change, energy poverty, and gender inequality.
In Bill’s section of the letter, which is addressed to teenagers, the Microsoft founder and billionaire philanthropist argues it should be a development priority to deliver clean energy to the 1.3 billion people who do not have access to power.
He also stresses that the new power needs to be low carbon in order to tackle the risks presented by climate change. “If we really want to help the world’s poorest families, we need to find a way to get them cheap, clean energy,” he writes. “Cheap because everyone must be able to afford it. Clean because it must not emit any carbon dioxide - which is driving climate change.”
And Gates argues the goal has to be truly zero emission power. “Can’t we just aim to cut carbon emissions in half?’ I asked many scientists,” Gates wrote. “But they all agreed that wouldn’t be enough. The problem is that CO2 lingers in the atmosphere for decades. Even if we halted carbon emissions tomorrow, the temperature would still rise because of the carbon that’s already been released. No, we need to get all the way down to zero.”
In something of a break from past comments when Gates has been critical of renewable energy technologies, once dismissing wind and solar power as “cute”, the letter welcomes recent rapid progress on renewable energy.
“New green technologies are allowing the world to produce more carbon-free energy from solar and wind power,” he writes. “Maybe you live near a wind farm or have seen solar panels near your school. It’s great that these are getting cheaper and more people are using them. We should use more of them where it makes sense, like in places where it’s especially sunny or windy. And by installing special new power lines we could make even more use of solar and wind power.”
However, he reiterates his view that to stop climate change and make energy affordable for everyone, the world will need “some new inventions”.
“We need more powerful, more economical solutions,” Gates writes. “In short, we need an energy miracle. When I say “miracle,” I don’t mean something that’s impossible. I’ve seen miracles happen before. The personal computer. The Internet. The polio vaccine. None of them happened by chance. They are the result of research and development and the human capacity to innovate.”
Gates argues that a combination of private sector research and development, such as his recently launched Energy Breakthrough Coalition, government action, and individual endeavour can combine to deliver a new generation of clean energy technologies.
“We need a massive amount of research into thousands of new ideas – even ones that might sound a little crazy – if we want to get to zero emissions by the end of this century,” he said. “New ways to make solar and wind power available to everyone around the clock could be one solution. Some of the crazier inventions I’m excited about are a possible way to use solar energy to produce fuel, much like plants use sunlight to make food for themselves, and batteries the size of swimming pools with huge storage capacity.
“Many of these ideas won’t work, but that’s okay. Each dead end will teach us something useful and keep us moving forward. As Thomas Edison famously said, ‘I have not failed 10,000 times. I’ve successfully found 10,000 ways that will not work’.”
Gates also urged young people to engage with the energy challenge. “You may be wondering what you can do to help,” he wrote. “First, it’s important for everyone to get educated about this energy challenge. Many young people are already actively involved in climate and energy issues and I’m sure they could use more help. Your generation is one of the most globally minded in history, adept at looking at our world’s problems beyond national borders. This will be a valuable asset as we work on global solutions in the decades ahead.
“Second, if you’re someone with some crazy-sounding ideas to solve our energy challenge, the world needs you. Study extra hard in your math and sciences. You might just have the answer.”
In a separate interview to promote the letter with news agency Bloomberg, Gates provided more detail on how a global clean energy R&amp;D push could be orchestrated and offered an insight into why he is so confident a breakthrough will materialise.
“What we need to get that probability [of a breakthrough] up to be very high is to take 12 or so paths to get there,” he told the news agency. “Like carbon capture and sequestration is a path. Nuclear fission is a path. Nuclear fusion is a path. Solar fuels are a path. For every one of those paths, you need about five very diverse groups of scientists who think the other four groups are wrong and crazy.”
He also revealed the Breakthrough Energy Coalition is working on new investment approaches that would provide more “patient capital” than that offered by traditional venture capital funds, allowing for greater investment in long term R&amp;D efforts."

Stanford University has announced that Nike co-founder and chairman Philip H Knight – one day before his 78th birthday – was contributing $400m to the school to create a new program called Knight-Hennessy Scholars. Graduate students chosen for the program will address the “increasingly complex challenges facing the world” such as poverty and climate change.
“We wanted to create something enduring, that would be unlike anything else currently available to the world’s brightest minds, and that would make the biggest impact possible toward solving global challenges affecting the environment, health, education and human rights,” said John Hennessy, the Stanford president. Hennessy will serve as the program’s inaugural director after stepping down from his current role at the end of this academic year.
“This is using education to benefit mankind and I think it really could be transformative,” Knight told the New York Times. “I jumped on it right away.”
According to Stanford, the total endowment to finance the program will be $750m. So far, thanks to donations from “dozens of Stanford benefactors” the school has raised more than $700m for the program, which will be the largest fully endowed scholarship program in the world.
The Knight-Hennessy Scholars program will officially begin in 2018, offering full tuition and board to 100 students.
Knight’s $400m donation is the largest cash gift that Stanford has received from an individual. It is equivalent to the $400m that John A Paulson, the billionaire manager of the Paulson &amp; Co hedge fund, gave to Harvard last year."

20% of the world’s population will eventually have to migrate away from coasts swamped by rising oceans. Cities including New York, London, Rio de Janeiro, Cairo, Calcutta, Jakarta and Shanghai would all be submerged.
The authors looked at past climate change events and model simulations of the future. They found a clear, strong relationship between the total amount of carbon pollution humans emit, and how far global sea levels will rise. The issue is that ice sheets melt quite slowly, but because carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for a long time, the eventual melting and associated sea level rise are effectively locked in.
As a result, the study authors found that due to the carbon pollution humans have emitted so far, we’ve committed the planet to an eventual sea level rise of 1.7 meters (5.5 feet). If we manage to stay within the 1 trillion ton carbon budget, which we hope will keep the planet below 2°C warming above pre-industrial levels, sea levels will nevertheless rise a total of about 9 meters (30 feet). If we continue on a fossil fuel-heavy path, we could trigger a staggering eventual 50 meters (165 feet) of sea level rise.
Predicting how quickly sea levels will rise is a challenge. However, two other studies just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that the Antarctic ice sheet could melt more quickly than previously thought, and thus contribute to relatively rapid sea level rise. Over the past century, global sea level has risen faster than at any time in the past two millennia, and most of the recent sea level rise is due to human-caused global warming. Several feet of sea level rise this century is likely, with a possibility of 5 feet or more.
The Nature Climate Change study didn’t just look at sea level rise; it also looked at global temperature changes. Earth’s sharpest climate changes over the past half million years have occurred when the planet transitions from a ‘glacial’ to ‘interglacial’ period, and vice-versa. 
Right now we’re in a warm interglacial period, having come out of the last ice age (when New York City and Chicago were under an ice sheet) about 12,000 years ago. During that transition, the Earth’s average surface temperature warmed about 4°C, but that temperature rise occurred over a period of about 10,000 years.
In contrast, humans have caused nearly 1°C warming over the past 150 years, and we could trigger anywhere from another 1 to 4°C warming over the next 85 years, depending on how much more carbon we pump into the atmosphere.
What humans are in the process of doing to the climate makes the transition out of the last ice age look like a casual stroll through the park. We’re already warming the Earth about 20 times faster than during the ice age transition, and over the next century that rate could increase to 50 times faster or more. We’re in the process of destabilizing the global climate far more quickly than happens even in some of the most severe natural climate change events.
That rapid climate destabilization is what has climate scientists worried. It’s faster than many species can adapt to, and could therefore cause widespread extinctions, among other dangerous climate change consequences. Coastal flooding in places like Florida has already become much more common than it was just 50 years ago, and sea level rise is expected to keep accelerating.
As Aaron Goldner, one of the Nature Climate Change study authors told me, the next 10–20 years are critical in determining which path we follow. There’s a big difference between an eventual sea level rise of 1.7 meters and one of 9 meters.
The sooner we transition away from fossil fuels and cut our carbon pollution, the better we’ll be able to limit the climate destabilization and associated damages. It’s a sobering thought: our children, grandchildren, and future generations for hundreds, even thousands of years will feel the impacts of the choices we make over the next decade."

For the first time, scientists conducted an experiment on a natural coral reef which involved altering sea water chemistry to mimic the effect of excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 
The results provide strong evidence that ocean acidification linked to greenhouse gas emissions is already slowing coral reef growth, the team claims. 
Without “deep cuts” in greenhouse gas emissions, the world’s coral reefs may not survive into the next century, scientists say. 
Carbon dioxide is absorbed by the ocean where it reacts with seawater to increase acidity. 
If the water becomes too acid it dissolves away the calcium carbonate corals that molluscs and creatures such as crabs and lobsters need to build their shells and stony skeletons. 
Although previous studies have demonstrated large scale declines in coral reefs in recent decades, the reason for the trend has been harder to pinpoint. 
Acidification is one possible cause, but others include warming, pollution and over-fishing. 
To investigate the role played by greenhouse gas emissions, the US scientists manipulated the acidity of seawater flowing over a section of the Great Barrier Reef off Australia’s One Tree Island. 
Bringing the reef’s pH value – a measurement of acidity or alkalinity – closer to what it would have been in pre-industrial times increased the rate at which calcium carbonate was deposited to grow hard coral exoskeletons. 
Lead researcher, Dr Rebecca Albright, from the Carnegie Institution in Washington DC, said: “Our work provides the first strong evidence from experiments on a natural ecosystem that ocean acidification is already slowing coral reef growth. 
“Ocean acidification is already taking its toll on coral reef communities. This is no longer a fear for the future; it is the reality of today.”
The research is reported in the latest issue of the journal Nature. 
Other work by Carnegie colleague Professor Ken Caldeira found that rates of reef calcification in 2008 and 2009 were 40% lower than they were in 1975 and 1976. 
He said: “The only real, lasting way to protect coral reefs is to make deep cuts in our carbon dioxide emissions. 
“If we don’t take action on this issue very rapidly, coral reefs - and everything that depends on them, including both wildlife and local communities – will not survive into the next century.”"

Our work fighting poverty, disease, climate change and conflict embodies British values, and is also in our national interest. We are writing not about the domestic political implications of Britain’s membership of the EU, but about the international implications. In our view, EU membership is a practical way to extend our reach and multiply our influence. Every pound of aid the UK spends through EU institutions is matched by £6 from other member states. This larger pool delivers better lives for the poorest people. It also helps tackle problems in areas where the UK has no large presence, for example in the Sahel and parts of west Africa. EU aid complements activities that other aid agencies cannot undertake, like police and security missions in fragile hotspots. Cooperation within the EU will be essential to tackling the humanitarian emergency in Syria, the migration crisis, and the wider issues of peace, security and development in the Middle East and north Africa.
Beyond aid, partnership within the EU helped the UK achieve an ambitious outcome at the climate talks in Paris; and provides a platform for further work on trade, financial flows, corruption and human rights. In all these areas, the EU demonstrates the value of collective action on a global scale. Of course, there are things we want to change in the way the EU works. But British engagement raises standards and improves performance. In September last year, the UK and 192 other members of the UN signed up to the new sustainable development goals. These set the whole world, rich countries and poor, on a new path towards peace, prosperity, justice and sustainability. The values underlying the global goals are shared by the UK and embedded in EU treaties. Withdrawing from the EU would diminish the UK’s role in the world and set back our efforts to end global poverty.

The letter, unlike earlier campaign letters published this week from businessmen and military chiefs, has not been coordinated by Downing Street and is aimed more at a liberal audience dubious that Britain’s internationalist role would be diminished if it left the EU.
Some in the leave camp have argued Britain could carve out a fuller role if it were liberated from the EU, and would be able to forge wider political international alliances, including with former Commonwealth countries.
Key figures in some of the biggest UK aid charities – Oxfam, Action Aid, the World Wildlife Fund, Save the Children and Christian Aid – have signed the letter in a private capacity. They make an appeal to the millions who support Britain’s leadership role on aid to support continued EU membership.
Other signatories are Lady Amos, former UN undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief, Lord Malloch Brown, former UN deputy general secretary and Sir Paul Collier, the economist at Oxford University who has heavily influenced Downing Street’s thinking on helping Syrian refugees in the region.
The signatories contend that EU membership is a practical way to extend the UK’s reach and multiply the UK’s influence, arguing that “cooperation within the EU will be essential to tackling the humanitarian emergency in Syria, the migration crisis, and the wider issues of peace, security and development in the Middle East and north Africa”.
They say: “Every pound of aid the UK spends through EU institutions is matched by £6 from other member states. This larger pool delivers better lives for the poorest people. It also helps tackle problems in areas where the UK has no large presence, for example in the Sahel and parts of west Africa. EU aid complements activities that other aid agencies cannot undertake, like police and security missions in fragile hotspots.”
The authors also say: “UK partnership with the EU helped the UK achieve an ambitious outcome at the climate talks in Paris last year and provides a platform for further work on trade, financial flows, corruption and human rights. In all these areas, the EU demonstrates the value of collective action on a global scale.”
Conceding that not everything about the EU’s delivery of its aid programme is perfect, they nevertheless argue that “British engagement raises standards and improves performance”.
They also point out: “In September last year, the UK and 192 other members of the UN signed up to the new sustainable development goals. These set the whole world, rich countries and poor, on a new path towards peace, prosperity, justice and sustainability. The values underlying the global goals are shared by the UK and embedded in EU treaties. Withdrawing from the EU would diminish the UK’s role in the world and set back our efforts to end global poverty.”
Simon Maxwell, the former director of the Overseas Development Institute who helped to organise the letter, said: “The signatories to this letter represent the UK’s global leadership in international development. As practitioners and advocates in international development, our strongly held view is that the EU needs UK heft and engagement to achieve its global goals – and that the UK multiplies its impact when it works with and through the European Union.
“We now urge the huge numbers of people who support development work in the UK, locally and nationally, to give the EU’s role in international development the profile it needs as we campaign to remain in the EU.”"

Joeri Rogelj, research scholar at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, and European and Canadian colleagues propose in Nature Climate Change that all previous estimates of the quantities of carbon dioxide that can be released into the atmosphere before the thermometer rises to potentially catastrophic levels are too generous.
Instead of a range of permissible emissions estimates that ranged up to 2,390 bn tons from 2015 onwards, the very most humans could release would be 1,240 bn tons.
Available levels
In effect, that halves the levels of diesel and petrol available for petrol tanks, coal for power stations, and natural gas for central heating and cooking available to humankind before the global average temperature – already 1C higher than it was at the start of the Industrial Revolution – reaches the notional 2C mark long agreed internationally as being the point of no return for the planet.
In fact, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change summit in Paris agreed a target “well below” 2C, in recognition of ominous projections − one of which was that, at such planetary temperatures, sea levels would rise high enough to submerge several small island states.
The Nature Climate Change paper is a restatement of a problem that has been clear for decades. Carbon dioxide proportions in the atmosphere are linked to planetary surface temperatures and, as they rise, so does average temperature. For most of human history, these proportions oscillated around 280 parts per million.
The global exploitation, on a massive scale, of fossil fuels drove the expansion of agriculture, the growth of economies, a sevenfold growth in human population, a sea level rise of 14cms, and a temperature rise of, so far, 1C.
To stop temperatures increasing another 3C or more and sea levels rising by more than a metre, humans have to reduce fossil fuel emissions. By how much these must be reduced is difficult to calculate.

The global carbon budget is really the balance between what animals emit – in this context, the word animals includes humans with cars and aeroplanes and factories – and what plants and algae can absorb. So the calculations are bedevilled by uncertainties about forests, grasslands and oceans.
To make things simpler, climate scientists translate the target into the billions of tons of carbon dioxide that, ideally, may be released into the atmosphere from 2015 onwards. Even these, however, are estimates.
There is general agreement that a limit of 590 bn tons would safely keep the world from overheating in ways that would impose ever greater strains on human society. The argument is about the upper limit of such estimates.
Dr Rogelj says: “In order to have a reasonable chance of keeping global warming below 2C, we can only emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide, ever. That’s our carbon budget.
“This has been understood for about a decade, and the physics behind this concept are well understood, but many different factors can lead to carbon budgets that are either slightly smaller or slightly larger. We wanted to understand these differences, and to provide clarity on the issue for policymakers and the public.
“This study shows that, in some cases, we have been overestimating the budget by 50 to more than 200%. At the high end, this is a difference of more than 1,000 billion tons of carbon dioxide.”
The same study takes a closer look at why estimates of the “safe” level of emissions have varied so widely.
One complicating factor has been, of course, uncertainty about what humans might do, and another has been about the other more transient greenhouse gases, such as methane and the oxides of nitrogen.
Although short-lived and released in smaller quantities, some of these are potentially far more potent than carbon dioxide as an influence on planetary temperatures.
Complex calculations
But Dr Rogelj and his colleagues found that a significant cause of variation was simply a consequence of the different assumptions and methodologies inherent in such complex calculations.
So the researchers have re-examined both the options and the approaches, and have worked out a global figure that, they suggest, could be relevant to “real-world policy”.
It takes into account the consequences of all human activity, and it embraces detailed outlines of possible low-carbon choices. It also offers, they say, a 66% chance of staying within the internationally-agreed limit.
“We now better understand the carbon budget for keeping global warming below 2C,” Dr Rogelj says. “This carbon budget is very important to know because it defines how much carbon dioxide we are allowed to release into the atmosphere, ever.
“We have figured out that this budget is at the low end of what studies indicated before, and if we don’t start reducing our emissions immediately, we will blow it in a few decades.” "

Ancient myrtle rainforests flank the slopes. In years gone by, springs and streams gushed from the soaked highlands above, feeding the ferns and tall, old trees. The track passes Norm’s spring, from which local legend holds it is good luck to drink. But in these parts the luck has run dry.
Last year Tasmania suffered its driest and hottest spring. At the nearby Miena dam, October’s rainfall was just 10.2mm, a record 65mm below average. The second driest November followed. 
For the world heritage-listed ecosystem above, these normally sodden forests are a fortification against the fires that perennially torch the lowlands. But their fluorescent mosses turned a circumspect pastel green in the heat. By the time December and January broke summer heat records, they were just waiting for a spark. 
On 13 January a huge, dry electrical storm set more than 70 fires rampaging across the island. Within days the flames tore through the dried-out defences and into the world heritage area above. For more than a month, fire has rolled back and forth across the fragile plains.
At the lip of the plateau a spectacular field of cushion plants once marked the northern edge of Tasmania’s vast world heritage area. These fragile plant communities build on the skeletal wood of their ancestors. As the centuries pass they construct huge, alien-green mounds that bulge from the peat. Today they look like a tray of burnt sponge cakes. 
The beginning of its end is a theft from us all. Two-thirds of the plant species exist nowhere else on earth
A long glacial valley stretches out below, devoid of colour, filled only with twisted black branches and burned stones; a monument to entropy. The rocks still radiate heat even though a fortuitous cloudburst put out the flames weeks before. At every step the normally spongy soil bursts into puffs of dust. The torched bark of thousand-year-old pencil pines shines iridescent black.
Only in tiny pockets has some life survived. Due to some inherent extra wetness, a protecting rock or a random swirl of the wind, here and there a few square metres of peat still shout forth little fantasias of sphagnum moss, pineapple grass, honey richea and cushion plants. Like funeral photos of a young life cut short, these still-glorious toeholds only accentuate the bitter, irredeemable tragedy of the surrounding acres of ash.
When vandals of Islamic State blew up the temples of Palmyra, the sickened world responded with appropriate and universal rage. The director general of Unesco, the UN body that oversees world heritage sites, called it a “war crime”.
As the burning of Tasmania enters its sixth week, Unesco remains silent. But if the dire warnings of forest scientists are correct, this summer heralds a new era of decline for this great Gondwana ecosystem. Unlike eucalyptus forests, these plants have not evolved to cope with regular bushfires. Once burned, they die. In a region that has rarely experienced fire, the blackened trunks of millennial trees will burn again and again. Some fire-resistant species will remain but the change will be absolute.
The beginning of its end is a theft from us all. Two-thirds of the plant species on the plateau exist nowhere else on earth but Tasmania. According to one estimate, 4% of the world’s remaining pencil pines – among the longest living of all trees – have been lost in these blazes.
The British explorer Gertrude Bell once wondered of Palmyra’s temples whether “the wide world presents a more singular landscape”. For the pilgrims who visit Tasmania’s wild sanctuary, there is only one answer. They come, from both near and far, to worship a different articulation of the divine. Or, as one local bushwalker puts it: “This is where we go to have fun.”
Away to the west, fires still burn. Tasmania’s fire service says they are contained. Thankfully, the weather failed to produce the dire northerly buster that would have sent the fires deep into the wilderness. Damage has been limited to 22,000 hectares of the vast 1.5m-hectare park. The Tasmanian government has been at pains to point out that the great majority remains intact. Rather than the final cataclysm, the ruined valleys at the northern edge are a premonition of a warmer, less wonderful world.
Unesco says it is “not in a position to speculate about the extent to which global warming is responsible for this particular fire”. Earlier this month the Tasmanian premier, Will Hodgman, attacked “activists” for “almost gleefully capitalising” on the fires, which he said were “naturally caused”.
But this ignores the unnatural rarity of these particular fires and the circumstances that preceded them. If they had been lit by arsonists, says David Bowman, a forest ecologist from the University of Tasmania, “that would be bad, but you would understand that that was preventable”.
Instead the rising background of climate change combined with a huge El Niño to create conditions in which peat bogs were dry enough to burn for the first time in perhaps a thousand years. Tasmania’s rainfall has been decreasing since the 1970s, accompanied by a rise in annual average temperature of half a degree. Last week research confirmed that even with an El Niño in effect, the occurrence of Australia’s three hottest-recorded springs in the past three years was “almost certainly” caused by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Climate scientists have also predicted that lightning strikes will happen 12% more frequently with every degree of warming. 
“It’s a historically significant event,” Bowman says. 
Deep in the valley, a tiny grove of pines is still green. From afar the trees (which look to be about 500 years old – young by pencil pine standards) appear to have been protected from the fire by a rocky slope. But closer inspection reveals that the peat burned right up to their bases. Licking flames singed the bark at the bottom of their trunks. Then, inexplicably, the fire turned away. Perhaps this was the moment the rain came to douse the flames. The chubby needles of the pines remain soft and lively. But if these trees are going to ride luck like this their end cannot be far away.
The parents of these young trees may have been young themselves when the citizens of Palmyra still walked their desert streets. The razing of these old treasures are two points on the wide spectrum of human failure. Along with the fractured temple of Baalshamin, Isis have broken the statues of Hatra in Iraq. In Afghanistan, the Taliban blasted  the great Buddhas of Bamiyan. All of these places carried the aegis of world heritage. This week news comes that the violence of climate change has turned towards another Unesco wonder, the Great Barrier Reef.
At the edge of the central plateau, a half-torched wooden signpost bears Unesco’s world heritage symbol, signifying the interdependence of nature and human ingenuity. Nothing within eyeshot is now worthy of such lofty recognition. Amid the blackened clumps of the cushion plants, the icon is a travesty."

Her poem called Mrs Midas evokes the difficulties for a wife whose husband turns things to gold when he touches them. They can’t sleep together, so she puts him in the spare room, which he turns into “the tomb of Tutankhamun”. What young mind would not be captured by an idea as dazzling as that? I know, the young mind of the boy at the back of the class who has just set fire to his desk. He’s a kind of Midas himself, but whatever he touches turns to chaos. It’s always rude to be optimistic on behalf of other people, and the teacher is facing difficulties every day that leave Mrs Midas looking genuinely well off, instead of just weighed down by useless wealth.
At our weatherboard one-room infants’ school in the bush, the memorably severe Miss Cashman had to get us to safety when the bushfire came, as it did every year, invariably threatening to burn down the building. She had a gift for discipline but no gift for tact. She gave me a note for my mother, saying that I didn’t have to come to school the next day because it had been largely destroyed by fire. My mother, once she had been assured that I had not been in danger, recovered in a matter of hours.
The bushfires were impressive, but they had nothing on the floods. One year the whole central eastern seaboard of New South Wales was underwater. The motor launch by which my mother and I were rescued from our holiday home on the Hawkesbury river was surrounded by millions of oranges dotted in the water, all torn from the orchards by a current quicker than a running man. In those days none of us realised that this was climate change, which would menace the whole world’s future. We thought it was standard-issue fire and flood menacing our bit of Australia right there in the present.
It was long ago, and I am far away; and it might snow tonight. I hope it does, because recently I wrote a poem about snow which I think might have a few Carol Ann moments in it, although her enviable knack for making an everyday phrase split light like a prism is hard to match. Miss Cashman used to make us recite Dorothea Mackellar’s famous poem My Country. “I love a sunburnt country,” I would intone, while down in the gulley below the school the eternally recurring fire was turning its first gum-trees into columns of fury."

The Queensland land clearing along with weakening land clearing laws in several other states are threatening Australia’s chances of meeting the climate change targets it pledged in Paris last year and raising questions about the Coalition’s Direct Action climate policy.
A new study of Australian tree-clearing by environmental services company CO2 Australia – obtained by Guardian Australia – has quantified the recent blow-out in greenhouse emissions from the weakened laws, after a decade in which declining tree clearing played a key role in Australia meeting its climate change commitments.
The Queensland Labor government wants to repeal laws passed by Campbell Newman’s government that led to the sudden rise in tree clearing, but may not succeed in doing so and is facing fierce resistance from the Liberal National party and others. 
Land clearing in Queensland, along with weakening land clearing laws in several other states, is threatening Australia’s chances of meeting the climate change targets it pledged in Paris last year.
Tentative moves by federal environment minister Greg Hunt’s department to assess whether the clearing contravenes federal laws have also prompted a backlash - particularly from his own National party colleagues.
But the CO2 study, commissioned by the Wilderness Society, shows the turnaround in clearing threatens to wipe out emission reductions bought by the Turnbull Government’s Direct Action scheme and jeopardise Australia’s chances of meeting its promise to reduce greenhouse emissions by 26-28% by 2030.
The study quantifies the impact on emissions of the discrepancy between the federal government’s data on Queensland land clearing and state government data, as well as the absence of accurate national data to predict land clearing emissions as NSW and Western Australia also move to relax their rules.
Part of the blow-out in emissions from land use and tree clearing was quietly acknowledged in the federal government’s latest report on Australia’s greenhouse emissions, released a few days before Christmas, which projected that emissions from land clearing would rise 24% from 2013 levels, from an average 37m tonnes to an average 46m tonnes a year up to 2020 and 44m tonnes a year between 2020 and 2030.
In 2013-14, 300,000 hectares were cleared in Queensland alone, double the rate in 2011-12. Between 2012 and 2015 land clearing emissions in Australia rose 11 times faster than any other sector.
But Queensland government data also released last year revealed a far higher rate of clearing than the federal data would suggests, a rate that would take national land clearings emissions to 55m tonnes a year between 2020 and 2030. 
At that rate land clearing would emit an additional 118m tonnes of carbon dioxide over that decade – on top of the higher rates the federal government is already factoring in – a blow out of over 10% on the reductions the government pledged to make by 2030 in the agreement forged last December in Paris. 
Professor Stuart Phinn, director of the remote sensing research centre at the University of Queensland, said Queensland’s approach was “world’s best practice.”
“The Queensland approach is based on a long time series of satellite imagery, tied to field measurements of the amount of vegetation on the ground,” he said. “It’s been developed over 15 years.” 
Both studies use Landsat satellite imagery, but in Queensland field officers drive out to check that changes in the satellite images are being correctly interpreted.
The federal government insists its national data collection system has been ticked off as compatible with the United Nations climate change accounting process.
Hunt’s office has been contacted for comment.
But Lyndon Schneiders, national campaigns director of the Wilderness Society, says the new data shows Australia is “lying to the world and lying to ourselves” about the true state of greenhouse emissions.
“Land clearing across the country has spiralled out of control in the last three years ... at exactly the same time as the national government is spending up to $2.7bn, in large part by trying to reduce land clearing,” he said.
“... the state governments, particularly in Queensland and also in NSW, are handing out tree clearing permits like confetti.
“The whole system is in disrepair. We are making commitments as a nation ... yet we are relying on data that is completely different to the data that is being generated out of the states, so we are lying to the international community and we are lying to ourselves.”
The CO2 report confirms that at the same time land clearing laws are also being weakened around the country and in many states, there is patchy data to quantify the increase in tree clearing or its impact on greenhouse emissions. It says there is no connection between what the states are doing with vegetation management laws and what the federal government is promising to achieve in reducing greenhouse emissions.
“There is a conflict between the emission reduction objectives of the Australian government ... and the recent trend for state and territory regulatory reform that has, in a number of cases, reduced barriers to vegetation clearing,” the CO2 report says.
“There currently appears to be little incentive for state and territory governments to seriously consider the greenhouse gas implications associated with vegetation management ... reform.”
In New South Wales, the Baird government is scrapping the Native Vegetation Act, which prevents the broad-scale clearing of native vegetation. Conservation groups have walked out of talks on replacement legislation because it offers what they consider to be unacceptably weak protections.
In 2013, the Western Australian native vegetation regulations were relaxed to allow up to five hectares of clearing at a time, without a permit, and the re-clearing of regrowing forests up to 20 years old.
The Queensland government, concerned about the land clearing rates, also requested that Hunt’s department write to some landholders with land clearing permits asking for information about possible breaches of the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, but those letters prompted a fierce backlash from agricultural groups and from National Party senator Barry O’Sullivan who attacked the “green activist inclinations” of the federal department.
In late December, the federal environment department wrote to the landholders saying it was “concerned” that some of the clearing could have an impact on one of the “matters of national environmental significance” the EPBC act is designed to protect. These include nationally-listed threatened species, migratory species, and the Great Barrier Reef marine park, but not greenhouse emissions.
The federal department then sent another letter to the landholders three weeks ago expressing “deep regret” if the previous letter had caused them distress.
“We are keen to ensure, at the minister’s direct request, that all assistance is provided to ensure you are able to continue your business as soon as possible, in accordance with the law,” the February 5 letter states.
Up until 2013 land clearing rates in Australia were declining and that was the primary reason Australia had been able to meet climate change goals.
Australia “overshot” the greenhouse gas reductions it promised under the Kyoto Protocol largely because of land clearing restrictions in Queensland that had already been agreed at the time. This allowed Australia to “carry over” 128m tonnes of emissions reductions into the second stage of the international process, which ends in 2020, and meant we could easily meet the target we had promised for that date. Five other big developed countries announced in Paris that they had voluntarily cancelled emission reduction “credits” achieved by overshooting their first Kyoto protocol greenhouse targets, but Australia refused to follow suit.
Over its first two auctions the emissions reduction fund has paid around $670m to buy 51m tonnes of land sector greenhouse gas abatement, according to the Clean Energy Regulator. Much of that - but not all of it - was avoided tree clearing. The blow-out in land clearing emissions contained in the national figures, but using the Queensland government figures for that state, adds 18m tonnes of emissions each year, undoing the ERF-purchased land sector emissions reductions in just three years."

Mobile phones, lifts, hair- and hand-dryers and vending machines are also on a shortlist of products for increased regulation in 2015-17. The measures had been expected to save the equivalent of 10m tonnes of CO2 emissions per year by 2030, helping EU countries to meet efficiency goals and consumers to cut their energy bills.
But EU sources say senior commission officials are stalling the draft plan, which has been ready for months and was supposed to have been published last year.
Staff were offered no explanations for the delay but an official said it was linked to the British referendum. “Brexit is mentioned all the time, as you can imagine,” one official told the Guardian. Hostile UK tabloid campaigns were “part and parcel of doing European policy in this area”, the official added.
Industry sources say they also understand that the plan has become “stuck at cabinet level” within the commission because of fears of UK tabloid attacks.
“I think it has to do with broader political context and the referendum in Britain,” said Sylvie Feindt, the director of Digital Europe, which represents companies such as Apple, Google and Microsoft in Brussels. “The ecodesign regulations have been disputed and the commission has had bad press, and maybe they are particularly sensitive about this.”
But this did not prevent negative press last week after the Ukip MEP David Coburn mistakenly tweeted that existing regulations had weakened his toaster.
Coburn alleged that it had taken his machine four attempts to satisfactorily grill bread on which to spread his marmalade. “They’ve turned [the toasters] all down, and that’s why you can’t get decent toast,” he claimed to Buzzfeed. 
Claude Turmes, a Green MEP who helped negotiate the original efficiency package, said the fear of bad headlines had stalled the measures. “I understand that behind the decision to delay this legislation lies in Brexit and newspaper populism of the kind we saw with the toaster story,” he said.
Ecodesign measures are one of the most cost-effective ways of reducing emissions and have been strongly supported by successive UK governments, including David Cameron’s, Turmes added.
The plan could force companies to improve the durability, repairability, upgradability and recyclability of their products. The coolproducts website says ecodesign legislation on lightbulbs, boilers and standby functions could save European consumers €79bn a year by 2020, an average of €350 (£275) per household."

The UN’s climate science body had predicted up to a metre of sea level rise this century - but it did not anticipate any significant contribution from Antarctica, where increasing snowfall was expected to keep the ice sheet in balance.
According a study, published in the journal Nature, collapsing Antarctic ice sheets are expected to double sea-level rise to two metres by 2100, if carbon emissions are not cut. 
Previously, only the passive melting of Antarctic ice by warmer air and seawater was considered but the new work added active processes, such as the disintegration of huge ice cliffs.
“This [doubling] could spell disaster for many low-lying cities,” said Prof Robert DeConto, at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who led the work. He said that if global warming was not halted, the rate of sea-level rise would change from millimetres per year to centimetres a year. “At that point it becomes about retreat [from cities], not engineering of defences.”
As well as rising seas, climate change is also causing storms to become fiercer, forming a highly destructive combination for low-lying cities like New York, Mumbai and Guangzhou. Many coastal cities are growing fast as populations rise and analysis by World Bank and OECD staff has shown that global flood damage could cost them $1tn a year by 2050 unless action is taken.
The cities most at risk in richer nations include Miami, Boston and Nagoya, while cities in China, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Ivory Coast are among those most in danger in less wealthy countries.
The new research follows other recent studies warning of the possibility of ice sheet collapse in Antarctica and suggesting huge sea-level rises. But the new work suggests that major rises are possible within the lifetimes of today’s children, not over centuries.
“The bad news is that in the business-as-usual, high-emissions scenario, we end up with very, very high estimates of the contribution of Antarctica to sea-level rise” by 2100, DeConto told the Guardian. But he said that if emissions were quickly slashed to zero, the rise in sea level from Antarctic ice could be reduced to almost nothing.
“This is the good news,” he said. “It is not too late and that is wonderful. But we can’t say we are 100% out of the woods.” Even if emissions are slashed, DeConto said, there remains a 10% chance that sea level will rise significantly.
Prof David Vaughan, at the British Antarctic Survey and not part of the research team, said: “The new model includes for the first time a projection of how in future, the Antarctic ice sheet may to lose ice through processes that today we only see occurring in Greenland. 
“I have no doubt that on a century to millennia timescale, warming will make these processes significant in Antarctica and drive a very significant Antarctic contribution to sea level rise. The big question for me is, how soon could this all begin. I’m not sure, but these guys are definitely asking the right questions.”
Active physical processes are well-known ways of breaking up ice sheets but had not been included in complex 3D models of the Antarctic ice sheet before. The processes include water from melting on the surface of the ice sheet to flow down into crevasses and widen them further. “Meltwater can have a really deleterious effect,” said DeConto. “It’s an attack on the ice sheet from above as well as below.”
Today, he said, summer temperatures approach or just exceed freezing point around Antarctica: “It would not take much warming to see a pretty dramatic increase [in surface melting] and it would happen very quickly.”
The new models also included the loss of floating ice shelves from the coast of Antarctica, which currently hold back the ice on land. The break-up of ice shelves can also leave huge ice cliffs 1,000m high towering over the ocean, which then collapse under their own weight, pushing up sea level even further.
The scientists calibrated their model against geological records of events 125,000 years ago and 3m years ago, when the temperature was similar to today but sea level was much higher.
Sea-level rise is also driven by the expansion of water as it gets warmer and in January scientists suggested this factor had been significantly underestimated, adding further weight to concerns about future rises.
Recent temperatures have been shattering records and on Monday, it was announced that the Arctic ice cap had been reduced to its smallest winter area since records began in 1979, although the melting of this already floating sea ice does not push up ocean levels."

What has Turnbull done? | Pia Treichel";"The Australian government pledged support for the Paris resolutions, and three months is long enough to see which voices it is - and isn’t - listening to";"Globally there are many well-known names who have raised concerns about climate change: the Pope, Barack Obama, Leonardo DiCaprio, Prince Charles, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Rockefeller Foundation. In Australia too, a broad range of voices have added their concerns and fears to the debate: firefighters who can no longer protect people or houses as we battle increasingly extreme weather conditions, 90% of Australian youth who last year said climate change was an important issue for them, farmers who see the effects of climate change on their properties every day, doctors who stress the deadly impact of heatwaves on the elderly, very young and those with existing health problems, climate scientists, David Pocock, Cate Blanchett, the tens of thousands of protestors who took to the streets in climate marches held across the country in November 2015 … the list goes on.  A global chorus of voices applauded the historic climate change agreement reached in December 2015 in Paris, including Ban Ki-moon, Francois Hollande and representatives from the nearly 200 countries who took part in the negotiations.
The deal, which agreed to limit global warming to well below 2C and eliminate the use of fossil fuels coal, oil and gas for energy, was openly adopted by the Australian Government. In Paris, foreign minister Julie Bishop said “our work here is done and now we can return home to implement this historic agreement. This is a pivotal moment.” 
Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull declared Australia’s support for this new agreement, calling it “good for our environment, good for our economies”.  So now, three months after the Paris climate summit, how has the Australian government begun “to implement this historic agreement”? Have those voices speaking out for climate reform been heard? What steps have been taken? Between December 2015 and March 2016 we’ve seen Australian government cuts result in the slashing of over 100 jobs at the government’s peak agency for climate science research, the CSIRO. The Minerals Council of Australia, which wields significant influence over Australia’s current coalition government, is still running “Coal. It’s an amazing thing’” advertisements on commercial radio and television stations across the country. 
Bipartisan support continues for the go ahead of one of the world’s largest coal mines in QLD, the Adani Carmichael mine, despite multiple protests from Indigenous and environmental groups as well as Australian Federal Court and funding setbacks – Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Standard Chartered among others have refused to fund the project.  At a time when investing in the fossil fuel sector doesn’t even make financial or business sense, $5.5 billion of financial investments have been made by the custodians of the majority of Australia’s money – Australia’s big four banks, the Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank and the ANZ. 
Australians with BHP investments by their superannuation funds were understandably worried about their retirement futures following the February announcement by the mining giant of losses totalling $7.8 billion due to the end of Australia’s mining investment boom and plummeting global oil prices.
Three months isn’t a long time, but long enough to see which voices the Australian government is listening to. Despite the broad range of voices in Australia and globally pleading for action on climate change – not to mention the science or the cold hard facts – the current Australian Government does not seem to be listening. 
Australia’s average annual temperature in 2015 was up 0.16C from 2014, with climate change a major factor. Climate scientists clearly state that our energy mix must transition away from fossil fuels to renewable forms of energy in order to keep global warning below 2C. 
How many more voices can one government ignore? If the last three months are anything to go by, a lot. 
For almost half of Australian voters, a poll launched in March indicated that climate change and renewable energy policies will influence the way they vote. This is exciting. Let’s hope the upcoming federal election provides an opportunity for the public to hold our current government to account. "

The north of England, devastated by winter floods, will get at least £150m of the new money, giving better protection for thousands of homes.
The Guardian had revealed that 294 projects in line for funding were left stranded after heavy cuts by David Cameron’s coalition government and exposed a series of places that were later flooded. These included Leeds and Kendal, which were submerged in recent winter storms. Both places will now get new defences.
The new funding, plus another £160m over the next five years for maintenance of defences, was delivered despite Cameron having long insisted the government was spending large amounts on flood defences. As recently as January, environment secretary Liz Truss said there was no more money available to protect Leeds.
But on Thursday, Truss said: “Thanks to this additional funding, communities across the north will be better protected from the devastating effects of the sort of extreme weather we saw in December. By delivering improved flood defences and looking at what more we can do to slow the flow of flood waters across whole catchments we are doing more than ever before to protect Yorkshire and Cumbria.”
The new money, funded by an increase in insurance premium tax, was widely welcomed. 
The government had been warned by a series of official bodies that flood risk was rising due to inadequate spending and was costing billions of pounds in damages. Government scientists have long warned that more severe flooding is the greatest impact of climate change in the UK. 
“It is obviously good news for those communities affected,” said Mary Creagh MP, chair of the Environmental Audit Committee. “But we knew six years ago that flood defences were needed in York, Leeds, Cumbria and Calderdale. It is tragic it has taken the government so long to wake up to this fact.”
“The scale and extent of the floods in December and January showed the gap between the government’s rhetoric and the reality on the ground,” she said. “Osborne had no choice but to act.”
Daniel Johns, head of adaptation at the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s official advisers, said: “This is a significant and unexpected boost to flood defence expenditure over the next five years, more than making up for the underinvestment over the last parliament.”
He said the rise in maintenance spending was “odd” given that the government had until now claimed there would be no benefit in increasing it. 
Johns had called previous government claims of increased spending “essentially meaningless”. But he warned that flood defences are not the whole solution: “In parallel we need to think more strategically about how to manage the landscape and river catchments in ways that hold back and store flood water where it can do least damage.”
Leeds suffered flooding in areas that would have had protection from defences that were part of the original 2011 plan. The new money means these defences, north of the railway station and protecting 579 properties, will go ahead with £35m of the £65m total being spent by 2021.
Kendal, which had been in line for a £4m scheme, has now got funding. Local MP and Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said. “The scheme has been repeatedly kicked into the long grass. The government is now announcing again that it will provide funding, but what is needed is action not words.” In total, £33m will be spent on new flood defences in Cumbria, including schemes for Appleby, Wigton and Braithwaite.
York, hard hit by recent floods, will get £45m for two schemes on the Rivers Foss and Ouse, providing better protection to 3,390 properties. The Calder Valley receives £35m including new schemes at Hebden Bridge and Mytholmroyd. Carlisle will get up to £25m after the Environment Agency has concluded a review of its needs.
The remaining £390m of the new flood defence funding is likely to be spent in other parts of the country. The Guardian has revealed projects left unbuilt in flood hit areas by cuts right across the nation, from Somerset to Dawlish in Devon, to Kent and along the Thames Valley.
“We have had severe floods almost every year since 2000 and people in almost every part of the country have been affected,” said Paul Cobbing, chief executive of the National Flood Forum, which represents community flood groups. “It is now clear that we need to raise our level of ambition significantly, so whilst this funding is welcome there is a very great deal more that needs to be done, and quickly.”
Cobbing said the impact of flooding driven by extreme weather was getting ever greater: “When you look at the scale of the high risk events, it is absolutely phenomenal.” Flood management plans, from defences to avoiding development in floodplains to slowing water flows, all need to be boosted to a level to match the risk, he said: “It’s is a long way from where we are now.”
Kerry McCarthy, Labour’s shadow environment secretary, said the government has slashed Environment Agency staff numbers and funding for research and development to improve flood management: “Ministers must drop their complacency over the need for climate change adaptation and develop a long-term strategy for protecting homes, businesses and communities from the risks of increased flooding in the future.”
The government is conducting a National Flood Resilience Review to assess how damaging the rise in extreme weather could be and is also considering how to manage river catchments better.

But we seem unable to understand that we are driving such changes";"And another one bites the dust. The year 2014 was the warmest ever recorded by humans. Then 2015 was warmer still. January 2016 broke the record for the largest monthly temperature anomaly. Then came last month.
February didn’t break climate change records – it obliterated them. Regions of the Arctic were were more than 16C warmer than normal – whatever constitutes normal now. But what is really making people stand up and notice is that the surface of the Earth north of the equator was 2C warmer than pre-industrial temperatures. This was meant to be a line that must not be crossed.
Two degrees was broadly interpreted as the temperature that could produce further, potentially runaway warming. You can think of it as a speed limit on our climate impact. But it’s not a target speed. If you are driving a car carrying a heavy load down a steep hill you’re often advised to change down from top gear and keep your speed low, as if you go too fast your brakes will fail and you will be unable to stop. Less braking means more speed which means less braking – a dangerous runaway feedback loop. Hopefully the hill flattens out and you have enough straight road ahead to recover. If you don’t then you will be stopping much more abruptly.
We are currently swamping the Earth’s ability to absorb greenhouse gases. 2015 saw the largest annual increase in carbon dioxide since records began – far higher than the Earth has experienced for hundreds of thousands of years.
More carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means higher temperatures. There is already one positive feedback loop in operation; the extra warming from our emissions is increasing the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, which further increases temperatures. Fortunately, this is not a very strong feedback loop.
Unfortunately, there seem to be other, much more powerful ones lurking in the event of further warming. Tipping points such as the thaw of permafrost and release of the very powerful greenhouse gas methane in large quantities would drive world temperatures well beyond the 2C threshold.
Even if we came to our collective senses and rapidly reduced carbon emissions at that point, we would still have to revert to drastic geoengineering to rein in further warming. There is no guarantee that such climate brakes will work. If they fail, our civilisation would be on a collision course with a much hotter planet.
The safe–unsafe threshold of 2C recognises the significant amount of uncertainty there is over where dangerous warming really begins. It could be at more than 2C. Hopefully it is. But it’s not impossible that it is less. We need to bear in mind that it was only the northern hemisphere that crossed the 2C line. Also, we need to factor in the monster El Niño that is having an effect on temperatures across the globe. In 2014, I predicted that 2015 would break record temperatures. This is not due to any psychic powers on my part, but the then very clear El Niño signal that was emerging.
So while temperature records may continue to be set for the rest of 2016, by the end of this year the situation should have cooled somewhat. Right? At times, it feels as if such statements are offered up as prayers in the hope that we are not in fact witnessing the beginning of abrupt and sustained climate change. But what’s even scarier is the political, economic and social reaction to these landmarks in climate change.
Have you heard any political speeches referring to these recent climate change records? Not one of the major Republican presidential candidates even “believes” in human-produced climate change, let alone that it is something to worry about.
How was the stock market this morning? It appears febrile enough to lurch from euphoric boom to catastrophic bust on the basis of bland statements from central bankers but proves remarkably deaf to evidence that the entire industrial and financial system is headed for disaster.
Know what’s trending on Twitter as I write? A photoshopped giant dog, the latest Game of Thrones trailer and Kim Kardashian’s naked body. Actually, it’s mainly Kim Kardashian’s naked body and people’s responses to it. Followed by people’s responses to the responses.
It would be churlish of me to deny people the pleasure of looking at pictures of a photograph of a cuddly dog adjusted in order to make it appear both cute and monstrous. But we appear uninterested, either through denial or desensitisation, in the environmental changes happening right in front of our eyes.
There are sure to be more climate records broken this year. But we treat them as we treat new fashions, phones or films. More novelty, newer features, more drama. We seem unable to understand that we are driving such changes. Record breaking changes that will ultimately break our civilisation, and so scatter all that we obsess and care about. "

The two leaders – Obama gray and nearing the end of his term, Trudeau in the first months of his prime ministership – affirmed that when it came to what they called the “big ideas” of climate change and economic inclusion the two shared a common global vision.
Just as importantly, it seemed as if Obama had found a successor to champion those liberal causes in North America and on the global stage once he leaves office: a Robin to his Batman.
“From my perspective, what’s not to like?” asked Obama at a joint news conference at the White House on Thursday morning.
He recalled that Trudeau – like Obama seven years before – had come to power on a message of hope and change. Both took office as young, good-looking and charismatic figures whose political skills were underestimated by the establishment because they lacked conventional political résumés.
Canada and the US have long claimed a special relationship – although that closeness acquired a tinge of frost under Stephen Harper, the former prime minister. But with Obama and Trudeau standing at their twin podiums under a brilliant sunshine, it seemed that the US president had found someone who would go on to champion action on climate change and the other causes that have animated his last months in the White House.
Having Trudeau by his side would help rally countries around the climate change agreement reached at Paris, Obama said. 
“On the big looming issues on the horizon it is vital for us to work together because the more aligned we are the more we can shape the international agenda,” Obama said. “Climate change is such an example.”
That shared vision applied to policies of economic inclusion and diversity, Obama suggested. The average American and Canadian worker needed to be assured of future prosperity. “If they see societies in which a very few are doing better and better and middle class and working people are falling farther and farther behind that destablises the economy,” Obama said. “It also starts destabilising our politics and our democracies.”
Obama did not refer explicitly to Trudeau’s decision to personally welcome Syrian refugees at Toronto’s airport last December, but he urged Americans not to retreat behind closed borders. “The world is big and we are going to help shape it,” Obama said. 
Trudeau agreed, saying that when it came to the “big issues”, global challenges such as climate change, the two leaders were firmly on the same side. 
“The president and I agree on many things, including of paramount importance, the directions we want to take our countries in to assure a clean and prosperous future,” the Canadian prime minister said. 
Occasions such as this one – the first state visit to Washington by a Canadian leader in nearly 20 years – were bound to veer into grandiosity about the import of matters under discussions, as well as the closeness of the understanding between the two men. The visit did not however produce hoped for resolutions of prosaic trade matters such as softwood lumber.
But it did appear to cement the mentor relationship that seems to have developed between the two leaders at their first meeting last November. 
Obama was studiously neutral on the US presidential contest. But when it came to the global stage, Obama appeared to have come close to designating a successor – at least that was how Trudeau described it. 
“I’ve learned a lot from President Obama. He is somebody who is a deep thinker. He is somebody with a big heart but also a big brain,” Trudeau told the press conference. “For me to be able to count on a friend who has lived through many of the things I am about to encounter on the political stage, on the international stage – it’s a great comfort to me.”
He went on: “It is always great to have people you can trust, people you can count on personally.”
Obama for his part seemed to relish the new role, joking that he had advised Trudeau about dying his hair before he went too obviously gray. And then, after ribbing reporters for consigning him to an elder stateman role before his time in the White House is up, the US president ushered the Canadian leader from the stage – with a protective pat on the back."

And well they might: under his leadership, Berkshire’s compounded annual growth rate from 1965 to 2015 was 20.8%, far better than the 9.7% achieved by the S&amp;P 500.
But this year, the storied “Sage of Omaha” expanded his focus to encompass larger issues. In his shareholder letter, he tackled the controversial subject of climate change, suggesting that, while it threatens the planet, it might also provide some business opportunities for Berkshire Hathaway. 
The flashpoint in this struggle is a proposal that is scheduled to be discussed at Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholder meeting on April 30. Submitted by the Nebraska Peace Foundation, which owns exactly one share of Berkshire, the proposal asks the company to “report on the dangers that this change might present to our insurance operation and explain how we are responding to these threats”. 
Buffett is quick to acknowledge the existence – and dangers – of climate change, and it has likely informed his investments in the past. As he says in the shareholder letter, “It seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet”. In fact, as he wrote in the letter, Berkshire Hathaway Energy “has invested $16bn in renewables and now owns 7% of the country’s wind generation and 6% of its solar generation”.
But Buffett also predicts that climate change will increase the profits of insurance companies underwriting catastrophic risks, therefore it will be good for Berkshire’s insurance business.
The key, Buffett suggests, is timing. Noting the concern about skyrocketing property losses from climate change, he explains that “such worries might, in fact, be warranted if we wrote ten- or twenty-year policies at fixed prices”. He says the short term nature of most policies should offset this problem: “Insurance policies are customarily written for one year and repriced annually to reflect changing exposures. Increased possibilities of loss translate promptly into increased premiums.”
There are some potential flaws in Buffett’s argument. To begin with, recent developments in climate science show an accelerating rate of climatic change that could throw his timetable into disarray. Buffett also seems to lack an understanding of the severity of climate change-related weather: he says that “up to now, climate change has not produced more frequent nor more costly hurricanes nor other weather related events covered by insurance”.
This claim flies in the face of growing scientific evidence. In 2014, the federally funded National Climate Assessment stated that: “Certain types of extreme weather events with links to climate change have become more frequent and/or intense, including prolonged periods of heat, heavy downpours, and, in some regions, floods and droughts.” 
Other insurers have already expressed concern about these changes. Carl Hedde, head of risk accumulation for insurer Munich Re America, says: “The number of loss-relevant, weather-related natural catastrophes worldwide has almost tripled since 1980 […] we do think that the warming climate – depending on region and peril concerned – does play a certain role.”
Buffett does believe the possibility of more frequent and damaging hurricanes and floods in the future. Rather than costing his company money, he expects these future catastrophes will actually raise profits. He draws an analogy with Berkshire-owned car insurance company Geico. In 1951, he explains, Geico’s “average loss-per-policy was then about $30 annually. Imagine your reaction if I had predicted then that in 2015 the loss costs would increase to about $1,000 per policy”.
But rather than destroying Geico, these rising losses were actually indicative of handsome revenues. “[T]hese increased costs have been promptly matched by increased premiums,” Buffett explains. “So, paradoxically, the upward march in loss costs has made insurance companies far more valuable.”
Buffett seems to argue that, as Geico paid out more in claims, it made more money with higher premiums. By extension, he seems to argue that increased premiums will more than balance the increased cost per policy that will come with global warming.
But cost per policy and premium per policy weren’t the only variables affecting Geico’s profitability. Over time, cars have also gotten safer: between 1994 and 2013, the number of deadly auto accidents fell from 23.21 deaths per 100,000 licensed drivers in the US to 15.42 deaths per 100,000 licensed drivers. 
This is where Buffett’s analogy breaks down. Unlike cars, the Earth isn’t getting safer; in fact, risks to insurers are increasing. A growing body of research suggests that the planet is in serious trouble. As warming melts arctic permafrost, it releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas, which further increases temperatures. Meanwhile, melting glaciers mean that the Earth can reflect less of the sun’s rays back into space, which also amplifies the warming effect. 
As the rate of global warming increases, so will the rate of climate change-related disasters – and presumably the rate of insurance payouts. It’s a lot easier to make money off of declining risks – as in the case of auto accidents – than increasing risks, as in the case of climate change.
Of course, Buffett argues that insurance prices can be adjusted upwards each year to take account of new climate information that emerges. But if climate change is accelerating, even a yearly “true-up” in insurance rates will not be enough to protect insurance company profit margins. Current rates will always lag behind accelerating growth in damages and claims. The annual adjustment will merely slow down the widening gap between them. Airlines illustrate just how hard it can be to keep rates rising in step with fluctuations in jet fuel prices.
It would be rash to prematurely write off anything Buffett does, but it’s worth noting that he is definitely hedging his bets. While Buffett seems bullish on climate change, he has also been shifting his insurance portfolio away from its catastrophic risks. 
Yet Berkshire still holds two reinsurance firms, which are the types of insurers that Buffett’s letter tells investors will insure risks that “no one else has the desire or the capital to take on”. Could the canny “Sage” be downplaying catastrophic risks because he is preparing to sell off these entities? Savvy investors will be watching his next move closely."

This weekend, fires ignited at a refugee camp in Calais, France, and countries are beginning to tighten their borders as more than 1 million people have streamed into Europe in the past year. The 1 million refugees represent just a portion of the 4.2 million that have fled Syria in all directions. And that’s on top of the 7.6 million people internally displaced in Syria who are trapped in limbo in their home country.
War has been the direct driver of the refugee flux and behind that is a complex mix of social and political factors both inside and outside the region. One fiercely studied and debated driver has been a recent dip into a series of severe droughts starting in the late 1990s.
Previous work has prescribed some of the drought — and its impact on the socioeconomic fabric in the Middle East — to climate change. New findings published in the Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres put it in even starker context, showing that the drought is likely the worst to affect the region in 900 years.
The Mediterranean as a whole has been subject to widespread drought at various points in the past 20 years. Climate models project that the region is likely to get drier in the future, which Ben Cook, a climate scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said drove the new line of inquiry.
“These recent drought events have motivated a lot of concern that this could be an indication of climate change, with the eastern Mediterranean and Syrian droughts being the most obvious,” Cook said.
Using tree ring data that covered 900 years of drought history, Cook led a team of researchers to look at drought across different regions in the Mediterranean. Dry spells in parts of the western Mediterranean have been severe but still within the range of natural variability over that 900-year span. What stands out is the drought in the eastern Mediterranean, which includes war-torn Syria.
Drought has had a firm grip on the region since 1998 and Cook’s findings show that the recent bone-dry spell is likely the driest period on record in 900 years and almost certainly the worst drought in 500 years. In either case, it’s well outside the norm of natural variability indicating that a climate change signal is likely emerging in the region.
“This is a really important study that increases our understanding of low frequency (decadal to multidecadal) natural variability over the past 900 years and provides strong evidence that the severity of the recent drying in the eastern Mediterranean/Levant is human induced,” Colin Kelley, a drought expert who authored previous research on the region, said.
Kelley’s work published last year showed that the influence of human greenhouse gas emissions had made recent drought in the region three times more likely. The new research puts that in historical context to show just how outside the norm the recent dry stretch has been.
“What we’re seeing is a convergence of evidence of the climate change impacts in the region,” Cook said.
The projections for the region show a continued drying trend throughout the coming century as climate change contributes to a shift in circulation patterns. That means what’s happening there now could just be the start of more prolonged, more severe drought. In a region already wracked by water scarcity and conflict, more drying could ratchet up tension even further.
“This evidence also strongly implies that expected future drying will further stress resource availability and the lives of people in this region,” Kelley said."

The dozen international sites facing civil disobedience from the Break Free 2016 campaign span the globe from the US to Australia and South Africa to Indonesia.
The Ffos-y-fran opencast mine, near Merthyr Tydfil in Wales, is about halfway through extracting 11m tonnes of coal. Ellie Groves, from the Reclaim the Power network, said: “The only way we can stop catastrophic climate change is taking action to keep fossil fuels in the ground.”
“The local community have battled Ffos-­y-­fran for nearly a decade and now face the threat of a new mine next door at Nant Llesg,” said Groves. “Enough is enough. We need a ban on opencast coal mining across Wales, and the rest of the UK.”
Coal is the most polluting fossil fuel and scientists estimate that 80% of current reserves must remain in the ground in order to avoid dangerous climate change. The UK government intends to phase out coal burning by 2025 but the International Energy Agency still forecasts growth in the global demand for coal.

A statement from Reclaim the Power said: “Hundreds are expected to set up camp nearby and take part in a mass action to close the mine. The action will take place a few days before the Welsh assembly elections on May 5.”
The Reclaim the Power network has held annual camps since 2013 and has conducted a series of direct actions, including blockading a World Coal Association conference and a fracking company. Ffos-y-fran supplies the Aberthaw power station, whose illegally high levels of pollution have led the EU to take the UK to court. Miller Argent, the company running Ffos-y-fran, and the local Labour MP Gerald Jones both declined to comment on the planned protests.
Campaign group 350.org, which had led the fossil fuel divestment movement, is helping to coordinate the international actions. “We’re mobilising to shut down the world’s most dangerous fossil fuel projects and support the most ambitious climate solutions,” says the Break Free 2016 website.
“We want to ensure there continues to be momentum to keep fossil fuels in the ground and to confront fossil fuel companies,” said Will Bates, global campaigns director for 350.org. 
Bates emphasised that, while involving civil disobedience, the protests would be peaceful. “Our actions must reflect the scale and urgency of this crisis,” says the website. The protests are likely to emulate a protest in Germany in August 2015 which shut down the large Garzweiler opencast coal mine for a day.
“We need to be disrupting business as usual if governments will not put in place the policies that will get the job done,” said Bates. “It is what is necessary. We think it is in everybody’s best interest.”
Benjamin Sporton, CEO of the World Coal Association, said: “It is clear that coal will be a critical energy source for the long term. The coal industry is already investing to improve the environmental performance of coal. In our view the focus should be on speeding this deployment up.”
No details have been revealed about the targets of the international campaign which will take place from 4-15 May. The countries named are Germany, Spain, Turkey, Israel and Palestine, Indonesia, Phillipines, Nigeria, South Africa, Canada, US, Brazil and Australia."

The reports included the first analysis of the economic costs of social impacts of natural disasters, and concluded they cost the economy more than tangible impacts like damage to property.
Among the tangible costs, the biggest occurred when critical infrastructure was damaged. Despite this, there was no formal requirement to consider resilience when making decisions about building infrastructure.
The reports said more investment was needed at times other than in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, with funding also required for community and infrastructure resilience, as well as longer-term social care.
The reports follow others by the Productivity Commission and Infrastructure Australia which also recommended more money be spent on resilience than recovery, which the government has been reluctant to implement.
“The reports show the long-term cost of the social impact of natural disasters on our communities and economy, and the benefits of embedding resilience into planning decisions for critical infrastructure,” said the managing director and CEO of insurer IAG, Peter Harmer, on behalf of the Roundtable.
“We need to do more to help our communities prepare for and recover from disasters. Sadly the devastation of bushfires, flood and earthquakes on our communities can last for years, if not decades.” 
One of the two Deloitte Access Economics reports examined the social impacts of disasters and focused on three case studies: the 1989 Newcastle earthquake, 2009 Black Saturday bushfires and the 2011-12 Queensland floods.
In each case it found the cost of social impacts, such as increases in family violence and mental health problems due to stress, outweighed the economic impacts of having to rebuild infrastructure. However, some social costs could not be measured, which meant that the true cost was more than the study found.
Looking at the 2011-12 Queensland floods, some of the social costs it identified included:
It also found some of the social impacts might affect women more than men, leading to the suggestion that responses should be gendered too, citing the example of Firefoxes Australia, which provided social support to women following the Black Saturday bushfires.
Noel Clement, Australian Red Cross director of Australian Services, said the costs could be reduced by investing more in community resilience before disasters, as well as on psychological and social services that extended beyond the immediate aftermath of the disaster.
He said any community program that helped neighbours to know each other could help, since they would then be more able to help one another when disaster struck.
“Governments, business and communities need to work together to address the medium and long-term social impacts of natural disasters through further investment and research into community resilience programs,” Clement said.
The second report examined the impact of natural disasters on infrastructure and how it could be avoided.
It found that about $450m was spent each year by governments restoring critical infrastructure, a figure that would rise to $17bn by 2050.
Despite $1.1tn likely to be spent on critical infrastructure between now and 2050, it said there was no formal requirement to consider resilience to disasters when making decisions about building infrastructure.
It found that government planning processes should include a requirement to consider resiliance. But that was not only the responsibility of governments.
Paul O’Sullivan, chariman of Optus, which is a member of the Roundtable, said Optus spent more than $1bn annually on infrastructure.
“As we have undertaken our own climate change review, it is clear that there is a need for stronger central coordination across government and other infrastructure providers, and an opportunity to embed resilience into government policy and planning activities. The report issues practical guidelines to address this.”
The reports warn that they have not included the effects of climate change, which is expected to increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters in Australia.
In May 2015, the Productivity Commission delivered a report into natural disaster funding, finding it was not currently “efficient, equitable or sustainable”.
“Governments overinvest in post-disaster reconstruction and underinvest in mitigation that would limit the impact of natural disasters in the first place. As such, natural disaster costs have become a growing, unfunded liability for governments,” it said.
It recommended mitigation funding be increased by $400m a year, and expressly warned against “cherry-picking” some recommendations from the report, since they formed a cohesive package.
When asked whether the government would be implementing the recommendations, a spokeswoman for the minister for justice, Michael Keenan, said the government did not plan to implement the shifting of funding from disaster recovery to disaster mitigation, which she described as “severe cuts to recovery funding”. 
“The government is consulting with the states on proposed reforms to disaster funding arrangements, in particular around a new model for funding the restoration of essential public assets.”
“As consultations are ongoing, the timing for the release of the government’s response is yet to be settled,” the spokeswoman said."

Ocean waters are rising for a number of reasons including thermal expansion of water (as water warms, it expands to a larger volume), as well as ice melt which then flows as liquid into the ocean. My next post will cover four recent studies that quantify how much ocean levels will rise in the future. However, here I will focus on the economic costs of rising seas.
A paper was just published by Drs. Boettle, Rybski and Kropp that dealt with this question. The authors of this study note that if you are concerned about societal and economic costs, the rate of sea rise isn’t the entire story. Much of the damage is caused by extreme events that are superimposed on a rising ocean. Damage is highly nonlinear with sea rise. 
To explain this, let’s think about flooding. Consider a river that has a dike system capable of confining a rise of water up to six feet. Such a system would have little or no economic/societal damage for “floods” up to six feet, but just one more foot of water rise would put the waters over the dike and could cause significant losses. So what really matters is, do events overshoot some level that commences damage?
How does this relate to climate change? Well as we warm the planet we are raising the baseline level of water from which extremes happen. Second, we are making some extreme weather events more likely. To measure the changes to extreme events in the future, the authors use a statistical method to estimate economic losses from coastal flooding. Using Copenhagen and other locations as test cases, they found that economic losses double when water rises only 11 cm. They also find that the costs rise faster than sea level rise itself. So, if we expect a linear increase in sea level over the next century, we should anticipate costs that increase more rapidly. 
The authors also look at what are called “tail events” of storm surges. These are unusual events that can cause a large fraction of losses. Superstorm Sandy is an example; the storm surge from that event was very extreme and cause more loss than the combination of many smaller storm surge events. 
I asked the authors why this study is important. They told me, 
While there is considerable progress in the understanding and projections of future sea level rise, there is little understanding about the damage costs from coastal floods which are expected to intensify with sea level rise. Most work focuses on case studies and there was no general understanding. Due to limited funds for adaptation it is very valuable to have a transferable and comparable approach for any coastal region.
I also asked how this work was novel and different from prior research.
For the first time we derive general relations on how damage from coastal floods increases with sea level rise and on how the damage decreases with the height of hypothetical protection measures such as sea walls. The results are based on mathematical proofs exploring extreme value statistics and are of universal validity. We conclude that the expected annual damage always, i.e. for an arbitrary case study, increases faster than the sea level itself. 
Additionally, despite growing awareness of sea level rise, knowledge about the economic consequences in the form of damage costs is still very limited. A concise estimation, however, is essential in order to perform a reliable cost-benefit analysis regarding potential adaptation measures. 
Our paper presents an entirely new view of the assessment of sea level rise impacts. Within a stochastic framework we provide for the first time universal expressions to describe the behavior of future damages, as well as their variability, for a varying mean sea level. Furthermore, an accurate characterization of the damage-reducing effect of coastal protection is included. All results are derived analytically and are confirmed by real-world examples (as shown in the study e.g. by two examples, however we applied the methodology already to more than 100 cities in Europe. This is, however, content of a subsequent paper). 
We prove that sea level rise leads to an increase in coastal flood damages following one of three possible patterns. Additionally, the uncertainty of the estimations is analyzed in terms of the standard deviation quantifying the enormous variability of annual damages due to the stochasticity of flood events. The generality and simplicity of our findings facilitate an easy incorporation into integrated assessment models in the context of climate impact research. 
Our work is ground-breaking since it bridges the gap between several fields of research and provides a full picture of the interplay between sea level rise, extreme events and the corresponding economic impacts. The manuscript addresses climate change, natural hazard and coastal research scientist. 
The research was performed in the broader context of a European funded research framework, namely RAMSES, which is coordinated by Dr. Kroppf.
 This work is important for a few reasons. First, we need tools to better understand what a future world will look like in a changed climate. We also need to make decisions to allocate resources toward adaption or mitigation. But how do we make decisions unless we have good information about costs and consequence? This study helps get us to an informed state."

In his annual letter to shareholders of his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett pointed out that the potential devastation caused by climate change will benefit – not harm – his insurance subsidiaries. He laid out his argument in response to a shareholder proposal asking Berkshire to assess and report the financial risks of climate change on the insurance business. The proposal reflects concerns that the insurers of homes and other properties will have to pay out big money in climate change-related claims and lose lots of money as a result.
Scientific evidence shows that excessive manmade greenhouse gas emissions are causing temperatures to rise and will, over time, increase the number and intensity of disasters, such as floods and wildfires, in communities worldwide.
“As a citizen, you may understandably find climate change keeping you up nights,” Buffett wrote. “As a homeowner in a low-lying area, you may wish to consider moving. But when you are thinking only as a shareholder of a major insurer, climate change should not be on your list of worries.”
Buffett said his shareholders’ concerns are unwarranted. Insurers will be able to react quickly to any hike in the cost of doing business because each auto or home policy typically lasts for one year, not 10 or 20 years at fixed prices, so the premiums could climb along with the cost, he said. He also cited inflation as an example of how an increase in the cost of goods and services is good for the insurance business.
“Over the years, inflation has caused a huge increase in the cost of repairing both the cars and the humans involved in accidents. But these increased costs have been promptly matched by increased premiums,” he said. “So, paradoxically, the upward march in loss costs has made insurance companies far more valuable. If costs had remained unchanged, Berkshire would now own an auto insurer doing $600m of business annually rather than one doing $23bn.” 
Naomi Ages, climate liability campaigner at Greenpeace, said Buffett is making a false comparison between inflation and climate risks, which are far more unpredictable.
 “Warren Buffett appears to assume that climate change is a manageable risk for insurers, but the damage caused by the increasing frequency and force of extreme weather events associated with a warming planet is set to become unmanageable,” she said. “And unmanageable risks bankrupt insurers.”
Ages pointed to warnings from insurers, like Lloyd’s of London, that are pushing businesses to consider the impact of climate change because “the cost of catastrophes is going up” and they “will be at the vanguard of the industries whose bottom lines are affected by climate change”.
That sentiment, Ages said, is “a nice way of saying ‘we could be bankrupted by these catastrophes first’”.
Assessing the financial impact of climate change is difficult. As Buffett pointed out his letter, the insurance premiums for covering catastrophes have fallen in recent years, making that type of coverage less lucrative than before. Indeed, global financial losses from weather events in 2015 were lower than any other year since 2009, according to reinsurance giant Munich Re. But winter storms that battered the northeastern US and Canada a year ago still resulted in huge costs to the insurance industry, with insured losses reaching $2.1bn, Munich Re said. 
While scientists say climate change will cause more severe storms, they can’t predict for certainty the number and severity at any point in future. “It is not yet possible to produce causal proof, but there is a logical chain of indices,” said Peter Höppe, head of Geo Risks Research at Munich Re, on the link between climate change and extreme weather events, in a statement. 
Robert Hartwig, president and economist at the industry group, Insurance Information Institute, said the insurance industry isn’t taking the risk of climate change lightly, and neither does it plan to lose money from covering those risks.
“We are exposed on every corner of the planet and are monitoring trends in real time,” said Hartwig. “The insurance industry is exceedingly well-capitalized and very well prepared to manage this and many other risks.”
Buffett certainly understands the danger of miscalculating risks. In his 2007 shareholder letter, he wrote that “devastating storms” like Hurricane Katrina could “rock the insurance industry”.
“We do know it would be a huge mistake to bet that evolving atmospheric changes are benign in their implications for insurers,” Buffett said then. "

The Green Investment Bank (GIB), hailed as a world first for the UK when it was set up, is expected to bring in more than £4bn for the Treasury when it is privatised, probably by the end of this year. But it may be snapped up by foreign buyers and already has plans to expand significantly overseas.
Announcing the sell-off at the lord mayor’s dinner in Mansion House, London, on Wednesday night, the business secretary, said a special share structure would ensure the company’s green mission continued.
“The Green Investment Bank was a world first, and it is a sign of its success that the idea is being copied across the world. Having proven the business model works, we now want to make an even greater impact,” Sajid Javid said.
“The challenge presented by climate change is clear – it is imperative we mobilise more funding for green energy projects. The special share structure protects the bank’s green mission meaning the Green Investment Bank will continue to do exactly what it says on the tin.”
But critics question whether this can be guaranteed and warn that the bank could now switch to funding more lucrative schemes abroad.
Shaun Kingsbury, the GIB’s chief executive, said he had received expressions of interest from private equity investors, sovereign wealth funds and large foreign investment banks.
He added that the bank wanted to borrow money, rather than just use public funds, and to expand overseas and admitted it could in future be funding windfarms in Germany and Holland or even renewable power projects in India.
Labour’s energy and climate spokeswoman criticised the sell-off plan. “Selling off the Green Investment Bank without protecting its green mandate is a reckless act that could jeopardise the crucial private investment in new clean power stations that we urgently need to power Britain,” Lisa Nandy said. “The sale should be stopped unless the bank’s special status is protected.”
Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace, added: “A Green Investment Bank that is privatised needs to have its green credentials written in stone. If it becomes just another bank with a good corporate and social responsibility officer, then it ceases to drive extra private capital investment into the green energy sector and becomes just another private sector competitor for green projects. That’s no way to support green schemes and get clean energy money into the UK, just when we are crying out for delivery on infrastructure investment.”
Lord Smith of Kelvin, chairman of the bank, said attracting new investors was vital if the bank was to fund its ambitious plans to double the size of its business, and expand into new parts of the UK green economy.
Currently the lending group is focused on British low carbon projects, although it is involved in £200m international joint venture with the Department of Energy and Climate Change.
Kingsbury dismissed fears that the bank would change its focus to “easier” projects, saying it has established a strong track record of “being green and profitable” that it wanted to capitalise on. 
“I am confident that the sale process will provide GIB with good new owners who will support GIB’s continued growth and leadership role in the global green economy long into the future,” he said.
The government plans to sell between 75% and 100% sale of the GIB , which was set up in 2012 to provide lending to green projects that would otherwise find it hard to secure finance. Since then it has invested in 66 infrastructure projects and seven funds.
The GIB says it has directly committed £2.6bn to the UK’s green economy as part of wider transactions worth £10.6bn. Among the projects it has invested in are the Galloper windfarm off the coast of Suffolk, the Wick district heating network in the north of Scotland plus an energy from waste plant in Belfast.
After the Paris climate change agreement was signed late last year, a report by the environmental audit committee recommended the British state keep a minority stake to ensure the bank’s objectives as well as its long-term strength. 
Privatisation could compromise the bank’s green credentials, as well as encouraging it to fund easier and more immediately commercial projects rather than innovative, more complex ones, warned the committee. 
The bank, which has 129 staff at its Edinburgh and London offices, said was producing an expected internal rate of return of more than 10%. “The business has strong and stable projected cash flow generation and costs are below or in line with industry benchmarks for a business of this kind.”"

New analysis written by a group of well regarded climate scientists appeared in a journal a couple of weeks ago, arguing that global warming did slowdown.
Those first two sentences are about as straightforward as this post gets. So I suggest that you either get out now while you can or you buckle in.
That’s because for us to understand this issue properly, we need more context than you could shake a contextual stick at, we need to have a bit of respect for the scientific process and we also need to embrace some nuance – three things the public conversation on climate change isn’t particularly known for.
We also need to ask the authors of the analysis some questions, which I’ve done (don’t you dare just scroll).
First, the analysis appeared in the journal Nature Climate Change and it basically argued that between 2001 and 2014, the rate of global warming slowed down a bit.
This is where we need our first injection of nuance. When we say “global warming” what we’re actually talking about here are the air temperatures which, as one of the authors told me, is a relatively “fickle” measure of climate change.
The amount of heat going into the oceans, the rate of sea level rise and the increasing heat extremes are more reliable or more relevant measures.
The authors, led by Dr John Fyfe, of the University of Victoria in British Columbia, wrote that some climate models over this period also tended to overestimate the rate of warming at the surface.
The authors say this “slowdown” was caused by a combination of natural ocean cycles, volcanoes going off, less energy coming from the sun and changes in the amounts of tiny particles in the atmosphere, mainly from industrial pollution.
Now, climate science denialists have welcomed the paper as a great big serving of “I told you so” with smug sauce and an overbearing garnish of self-satisfied rodomontade.
British climate science denier James Delingpole also delivered a pudding of chilled vexatious abuse with lumpy custard (Delingpole attacked “pause deniers” on the back of a paper that expressly says ‘we do not believe that warming has ceased’).
So as is the norm, many of those commentators have either not read the paper, have misinterpreted the paper, have cherry-picked the bits of the paper that they like, ignored context or failed to ask the authors the most simple follow-up questions.
What’s more, the analysis is extremely unlikely to be the final word on the matter in the peer reviewed literature. Criticism of the statistical methods and choices used in the paper has already begun to surface, and you can be confident there will be more to come.
Two previous papers in particular have argued that statistically and practically, the slowdown didn’t happen.
In the journal Science in June 2015, Thomas Karl and colleagues from the US government’s National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration argued the slowdown was an “illusion”.
Once biases in the data were corrected, mainly concerning ocean temperature readings taken by ships, the slowdown disappeared, the paper said 
Research published in the journal Scientific Reports and led by the University of Bristol’s Stephan Lewandowsky also argued any so-called “hiatus” did not exist in the context of longer-term trends (17 years or more). Both these papers are discussed in the latest analysis.
So the most obvious question for the authors of this latest analysis is, what does this actually mean for long-term projections of climate change, especially if we keep loading the atmosphere with greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels? 
Dr John Fyfe, of the University of Victoria in British Columbia, told me: 
Climate models did not generally simulate the slowdown because the slowdown was mainly due to random internal variability. As for policy makers, they should be aware that once the recent phase of internal variability flips – which we think is about now – global surface temperatures will rapidly rise.
It would be very wrong to interpret our paper as suggesting that global warming has stopped. Our findings show that the rate of human-caused warming over the early-2000s was about the same as before.
However, over the early 2000s human-caused warming was masked by a cooling influence from internal variability combined with cooling from a sequence of small volcanic eruptions. 
In an interview with me last year another of the authors, Prof Michael Mann, described the period of an alleged slowdown as the “faux pause”, saying that “global warming hasn’t stopped, even though you still hear those contrarian talking points.” 
Mann told me he had not changed his mind and the distinction between global warming stopping or experiencing a temporary slowdown was “critical”. 
Moreover, the slowdown is now very likely over. It was at most a temporary respite, and as we have argued in our other recent work there is a good chance we will now see the flipside. 
Internal variability will begin to work against us, and lead to even faster warming in the decade ahead. The Faux Pause may have led to False Complacency, when it comes to climate change
All this talk of a “slowdown” period, remember, overlaps a period when we saw 14 of the 16 hottest years on record all happening since 2000.
Prof Matt England, of the University of New South Wales climate change research centre, another co-author on the analysis, told me: 
The last thing we want out there is confusion in the community about what this all means. None of this calls into question the rate of global warming. 
People need to understand that long-term projections are not affected in any way by decadal variability. 
This is a very important point. This is only the global average surface temperature and it’s only one measure of the climate system – and it’s a very fickle measure.
What I mean by that is that it bounces around from year to year. People don’t wake up and say ‘oh gee, that global average air temperature that’s gone up by point zero one of degree from last year has really affected my life’. 
They are instead affected by extreme temperature change, sea level rise and all those other metrics that really matter to society. There’s an over-emphasis on the surface air temperature.
In the earlier 20th century there has been no slowdown at all in the instances of extremes. We are really exposed to these events and they have been on the rise. 
Global warming in terms of the net energy in the system has continued unabated. It’s important to point out to people that there was no pause at all in global warming when you measure it as the world’s climate system. If you look at ocean heat content, that’s gone up almost monotonically.
So really this slowdown has been a real distraction for action on climate change. But the mere fact that there are scientists looking at the record is a normal scientific debate. 
We are still sucking energy into system that goes into melting ice and sea level rise and that’s why it’s a false pause. 
But what about this issue of the climate models showing too much surface warming over that short period? Surely that’s a big deal, right? 
Several studies have found that some models were not getting the timing right of the kind of short-term natural changes in the climate system that can happen over the course of a decade or so, such as volcanic eruptions that have a cooling effect or El Niño weather patterns that have a warming effect. 
Last year in the same Nature Climate Change journal, England published research looking at this very question.
In his paper, England looked at two groups of climate models – one group that did recreate a short-term slowdown in the rise in temperatures between 1995 and 2005 and another group that didn’t. 
By the end of the century, England found it didn’t matter which group you chose – there was practically no difference in the rapidly rising temperatures as you head towards the end of this century. England told me: 
None of the models’ long-term projections are changed by this. We know that all the climate models have this capacity to vary from decade to decade. We can look at the models that happened to have slowed down at the same time as the observations and those models warm just as much as those models that had a rapid warming in the last decade.
So what have we learned?
Climate scientists are still working hard to refine our understanding of the climate system and sometimes they argue about it.
Temperatures are still going up, global warming didn’t “pause” or “stop” but continues on fast-forward and climate science denialists are still getting things horribly wrong. 
Very little, in fact, has changed, except now you know the meaning of the word rodomontade."

But avoiding them on takeoff could help cut airlines’ fuel bills and emissions by up to 10%.
It’s already an idea that NASA has explored. Last year it tested hi-tech coatings to make dead insects slide off wings, with one design delivering a 40% reduction in insect residue. 
This is just one of many attempts to meet the huge challenge of making aviation more sustainable. The sector accounts for 2% of all man-made CO2 emissions, and a recent European parliament report estimated that if climate change ambition levels don’t rise, aviation emissions could make up 22% of global emissions (pdf) by 2050.
Progress has been made though. Small, steady annual advances in fuel efficiency mean that a modern Boeing 737 burns only around half as much fuel per passenger as the first 737 did in 1967. Winglets have reduced fuel consumption by around 4%, carbon brakes save hundreds of kilos per aircraft, efficient turbofan engines produce more thrust from less fuel, economy seats are stronger and lighter, and checking an aircraft for chipped or scratched paint can reduce its fuel bill by 0.5% (pdf).
There are plenty more of these tweaks in the technology pipeline. Nasa’s project also demonstrated lightweight wing flaps that morphed shape and a new tailfin design that promises to cut fuel usage by another 0.5%.
Planes can be flown smarter too. A smooth, continuous descent can save 40% of the fuel burned during an aircraft’s final approach, while smarter air traffic control in Europe and the US – including more efficient takeoff and landing, more direct routes and less circling – could save tens of millions of tonnes of CO2 over the next decade. 
Meanwhile, on the ground, EasyJet is about to trial a hydrogen fuel-cell system to reduce emissions during taxiing, which consumes around 4% of the airline’s entire fuel budget.
But these incremental improvements pale in comparison to the challenges, especially given the industry’s growth. Over the past decade, aviation revenues have doubled, from $379bn (£270bn) in 2004 to $727bn in 2015, thanks in large part to an increase in low-cost travel.
Aviation was not included in the Paris climate agreement and has traditionally been seen as hard to regulate; international disagreements on emissions standards have also stymied progress. However, last month 23 countries, including the US and UK, agreed the first global standards to cut commercial aircraft emissions in future planes, to be achieved through innovation in aircraft design and fuel-efficient technologies.
Putting aviation on a more sustainable footing is an enormous challenge, according to Steven Barrett, director of the Laboratory for Aviation and the Environment at MIT. “Not least because the technological lifecycle for aviation isn’t far off a century,” he said. “The 747 was designed in the 1960s and the latest version, the 747-8, will be in service until the 2050s or 2060s. Something developed today can take 30 years to penetrate the fleet because old aircraft are only retired when they become uneconomic.”
A few years ago, it was expected that second-generation biofuels, made from plants that did not replace food crops, would help fill much of the gap. But the crash in the price of fossil fuels and continued difficulties in finding and producing sustainable biofuel feedstock plants has tarnished their appeal.
New wing shapes are another option. By bracing wings with struts or turning the entire plane into a giant wing – a hybrid or blended wing body – an aircraft can generate more lift and have superior fuel economy. Nasa wants to build experimental X-planes within the next 10 years, although questions remain about how to regulate such innovative designs and whether passengers will like them.
Another possibility is for air travel to go electric. Airbus has demonstrated a two-seater called the E-Fan, which can remain aloft for an hour, and is now pushing small all-electric and hybrid planes into production. And Nasa is working towards an experimental nine-passenger electric aircraft that has dozens of small propeller engines spaced out along the length of its wing, a configuration that promises a smooth, quiet and efficient ride.
Nasa hopes to have the plane, called Sceptor (scalable convergent electric propulsion technology), flying by 2019. It will have lithium-ion batteries and a 500kW power plant. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has hinted that he might be interested in designing a vertical takeoff and landing electric jet.
 “There is a chance that electric planes could be viable for short-range flights, maybe a city centre to city centre flight of about an hour,” said Barrett. 
Hybrid electric planes could even recover energy when descending to recharge their batteries, like regenerative braking in electric cars.
But to really save money and emissions, you need to slow down. Astro Teller, the captain of moonshots at Google, revealed earlier this month that the technology giant had been working on a lighter-­than-air, variable-buoyancy cargo airship: “This could get the cost of shipping closer to boats than planes, get the carbon footprint of moving cargo lower than for boats, and get speeds of transport halfway between boats and planes – all without needing runways,” he wrote.
However, Google calculated the cost of a building an initial prototype at close to $200m (£144m). “[This is] way too expensive for us to get the first data point on whether we’re on the right track,” said Teller. 
While that might sound a lot, Boeing invested around $32bn to develop the 787 Dreamliner and airlines in the US spend an estimated $50bn annually on jet fuel. "

The research is the first to assess how the impacts of global warming could affect the quality of the diets available to people and found fewer fruit and vegetables would be available as a result of climatic changes. These are vital in curbing heart disease, strokes and diet-related cancers, leading the study to conclude that the health risks of climate change are far greater than thought.
Climate change is already judged by doctors as the greatest threat to health in the 21st century, due to floods, droughts and increased infectious diseases, with the potential to roll back 50 years of progress. 
Peter Scarborough, at the University of Oxford and part of the new research, said these direct impacts would affect tens of thousands of people at particular times: “But everyone in the world eats, so small changes in diet can quickly add up” to hundreds of thousands of deaths.
“The health burden related to climate change is much bigger than we thought,” Scarborough said. But cutting carbon emissions and improving education and the availability of fruit and vegetables would reduce the number of deaths, he said.
“The Lancet [study] digs deeper, and reports the most advanced projections so far of the effects of climate change on food and health,” according to professors Alistair Woodward at the University of Auckland and John Porter at the University of Copenhagen in a commentary on the work.
They say that given the uncertainties involved in the complex analysis, it is understandable to limit projections to the next 35 years. But they warn that the worst-case impacts beyond 2050 could be even greater. 
As an example, they cite work indicating that failure of the rice crop in southern China due to heatwaves could change from a one-in-a-100-year event to a one-in-four-year event in 2100. “A worst-case analysis is not unusual in risk assessments in other areas [such as national security] when the stakes are high,” they note.
The new research involved linking a series of computer models, which covered crop production, economic development, trade and climate change, to consider a range of scenarios. The current trend in global nutrition is for fewer people to die from inadequate diets each year, due to increasing crop yields and poverty reduction. 
But a continued rapid rise in carbon emissions would cut heavily into that positive trend. Severe climate change would cause changes in food availability, leading to 529,000 more people dying in 2050 than would have without warming, the research found. Even with very ambitious climate action, including sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, there would be 154,000 extra deaths in 2050.
The research found that severe climate change would cut the fruit and vegetable available to people in 2050 by 4%, the calories available by 3% and the red and processed meat by 0.7%. By far the biggest cause of deaths was the reduction in fruit and vegetables, particularly in rich countries.
The reduction in calories resulted in more people dying from lack of food, especially in India and China. However, almost exactly the same number of deaths were prevented elsewhere by reductions in obesity. The cut in red meat eating prevented 29,000 deaths.
Nearly all nations are projected to suffer an increase in deaths due to the diet changes caused by climate change. But a few, in central America and southern Africa, could see a reduction in deaths as the reductions in obesity outweigh other factors.
Scarborough accepted there are significant uncertainties in the projections and the study says the projected deaths in 2050 ranges between 314,000 and 736,000. But he said it is the best estimate so far and clearly shows that action to tackle climate change would have large-scale health benefits.
Prof Andy Challinor, at the University of Leeds and not involved in the new work, said: “This is a valiant attempt to quantify the effects of climate change on the future of food production. It’s very difficult to estimate exactly what those impacts will be [but] what we can say for certain is that the pressures on agricultural production will certainly be greater because of climate change.”
“Year-to-year variability of food production will become greater, which will make global food markets more unpredictable,” Challinor said. “And extreme climatic events will become more common, such as the wheat harvest failure in Russia in 2010 which affected UK food prices. The effects of such events on global food availability and prices will be felt in the UK and around the world.”
The research was funded by the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food. "

Has there been progress?
The Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters and major insurance companies agree that, in 2015, figures for deaths, numbers of people affected and economic losses from disasters were below the 10-year average.
But are we getting better at managing disasters, or are we actually reducing disaster risk? There is a significant difference between the two, and addressing that difference should have a profound impact on development. 
If better disaster management is solely responsible for the drop, then we may not be addressing the underlying issues. While improved preparedness and response are both necessary and commendable, so is disaster risk reduction, particularly as the threat posed by disasters is rising.
Climate change is an increasingly potent element in the deadly brew of disaster risk. Already, at least 90% of disasters linked to natural hazards are climate related. Last year, thousands of people died from heatwaves in Europe and Asia, and droughts and floods – including those exacerbated by normal climate variability, such as the current strong El Niño phenomenon – are increasing.
Rising sea levels and warmer sea-surface temperatures result in greater moisture in the air and contribute to more intense cyclone and typhoon seasons. This was observed last year in the Indian and Pacific Oceans: Mexico was hit by the strongest cyclone ever to make landfall, and Vanuatu and other south Pacific nations were pummelled by a category five storm.
Rapid urbanisation is elevating risks from both climate and geological hazards. The potential for significant losses is increasing apace with population growth, migration and unplanned urban development.
Globally, more than half of the urban environment that will be in place by 2030 has yet to be built. If this expansion is unplanned and disregards building codes and environmental impacts, disaster risk will grow. Loss of lives, livelihoods and infrastructure will surely follow. Emphasising risk-informed urban development now has the potential to offset future losses and protect lives and resources.
While the recent Paris agreement on tackling climate change is a big step forward, it will be decades before rising temperatures and their associated impacts are sufficiently reined in. The need to prioritise climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction has never been so evident or urgent.
Mortality is declining in many places because of better disaster management and more effective use of early warning systems. But more needs to be done to reduce risk comprehensively, including by tackling the compounding factors of poverty and inequality, rapid and unplanned urbanisation, damage to eco-systems, and poor risk governance.
Better risk governance is needed, along with the policy, legal and procedural environments that facilitate action. More national disaster loss databases to guide investments should be established.
The Sendai framework for disaster risk reduction was adopted in March last year. It promotes the multi-hazard management of disaster risk in development, and addresses the complex nature of disaster risks and the interplay between them, which can create new risk and increase losses.
It was the first major development-related new agenda to be adopted in a year that also brought the adoption of the sustainable development goals, the Addis Ababa action agenda on financing for development, and the Paris agreement.
There is a golden opportunity now to ensure coherence between these agreements so that climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction work together to strengthen resilience across the full range of environmental, technological and biological hazards. "

At his recent congressional hearing, Ted Cruz presented the RSS data to incorrectly claim that there’s been no global warming in over 18 years.
As I noted at the time, RSS had the only data that could remotely support Senator Cruz’s argument. Surface and ocean temperatures have warmed, ice has melted, sea levels have risen, species have been forced to migrate, spring has begun earlier, and so on. 
Even other estimates of the atmospheric temperature, of the same satellite data by scientists at the University of Alabama at Huntsville (UAH), and by weather balloons, indicate that the atmosphere is warming. Ted Cruz cherry picked RSS because it was the lone outlier that seemed to support his preferred argument against the need to take action to mitigate the risks posed by human-caused global warming.
That’s no longer the case. In their new paper, Mears and Wentz detail the revised RSS method to account for drift in the time of day at which satellites measure the same location on Earth (known as “diurnal drift”, discussed by Mears at the 0:47 mark in the above video). They applied a method suggested by Stephen Po-Chedley and colleagues at the University of Washington in an important paper covered by John Abraham last year. As a result, the new version of RSS (v4.0) shows about 60% more warming than the previous version (v3.3) since the record began in 1979.
This new adjustment also helps to reconcile the divergence between atmospheric temperature estimates from satellites and weather balloons. Over most of the temperature record, the estimates using the two different types of instruments have been similar, and the satellite data are calibrated with the weather ballon data. However, over the past decade, the weather balloons had shown significantly more atmospheric warming than the satellite estimates. RSS v4.0 goes a long way toward bringing these measurements into closer agreement.
As Joe Romm noted at Climate Progress, Roy Spencer and John Christy at UAH speculated over 4 years ago that the RSS diurnal drift correction method was introducing a cool bias into their record.
my UAH cohort and boss John Christy, who does the detailed matching between satellites, is pretty convinced that the RSS data is undergoing spurious cooling because RSS is still using the old NOAA-15 satellite which has a decaying orbit, to which they are then applying a diurnal cycle drift correction based upon a climate model, which does not quite match reality.
This new paper and latest RSS adjustment once again highlight the challenges scientists face in converting measurements of atmospheric microwave emissions by satellites in orbit into a synthetic temperature estimate. It’s a complicated process that requires a complex model with large uncertainties involved, and as Carl Mears has noted, it’s certainly unwise to rely exclusively on these estimates of one small component of the Earth’s climate to evaluate global warming.
Nevertheless, Spencer has just reported that February 2016 was the hottest month on record in the UAH data set; the same is true of RSS, and weather balloons are also registering record hot atmospheric temperatures, as the above chart shows.
It’s now clear that Senator Cruz has been hoisted by his own petard. He and his hearing witnesses claimed that the satellite data from RSS represent our best measurement of global warming. While that’s not true, this latest correction to the RSS record shows that global warming continues, in the atmosphere as with every other component of the Earth’s climate, at record hot levels. Instead of congressional hearings denying the existence of global warming, we need hearings to debate the best way to solve the problem."

The snowy surface of Greenland started becoming significantly less reflective of solar radiation from around 1996, the analysis found, with the ice absorbing 2% more solar energy per decade from this point. At the same time, summer near-surface temperatures in Greenland have increased at a rate of around 0.74C per decade, causing the ice to melt.
This winnowing away of the ice, exacerbated by soot blown on to the ice from wildfires, means that Greenland’s ice is stuck in what is known as a “feedback loop” that will make it ever more vulnerable to warming global temperatures. The study predicts that the ice surface reflectivity, or albedo, will drop by 10% or more by the end of the century, which will trigger further melting.
“It’s melting cannibalism, basically – it’s melting that’s feeding itself,” said lead author Marco Tedesco, of Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. “Rising temperatures are promoting more melting, and that melting is reducing albedo, which in turn is increasing melting.
It’s worrying because if the ice sheet continues to get darker, it becomes more sensitive to atmospheric warming
“It’s worrying because if the ice sheet continues to get darker, it becomes more sensitive to atmospheric warming. The impact of two weeks of sunshine with no clouds, for example, is far greater than it was 20 years ago. The ice is going to melt much more quickly, with more water flowing off on to the sea.”
In recent years, scientists have began to pick apart the complex, interrelated forces at play in the Arctic, which has experienced a 13.4% drop in minimum ice extent per decade, on average, since the 1980s. More than half of the Greenland ice sheet experienced some melting last summer, the largest annual melt since 2012 and well beyond the average melting seen over the past 35 years.
Tedesco’s research shows that as the surface of Greenland’s ice melts, old impurities, such as dust from erosion or soot that has been entombed for years, start to appear, darkening the surface.
If the summer is warm enough to remove all the snow, these dark impurities begin to spread across the surface, providing a far more heat-absorbent environment. At the same time, as this snow melts and then refreezes, the grains of snow get larger. These larger grains, invisible to the eye but detected by satellite’s infrared instruments, also create a less reflective surface.
These two processes are turning Greenland into a store, rather than a reflector, of solar energy, with consequences far beyond the icy wilderness. Water from the melting flows into the sea, contributing to rising oceans around the world. This process is unlikely to reverse given the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. 
“As warming continues, the feedback from declining albedo will add up,” Tedesco said. “It’s a train running downhill, and the hill is getting steeper.”
The research, published in the European Geosciences Union journal The Cryosphere, looked at satellite data from 1981 to 2012. The drop in reflectivity from 1996 was probably due to a change in atmospheric circulation that favoured warmer, moist air from the south. The scientists found there was no significant increase in soot from forest fires since 1997 to explain the darkening of the surface."

Karl Mathiesen examines how much is down to El Niño versus manmade climate change";"Yet another global heat record has been beaten. It appears January 2016 - the most abnormally hot month in history, according to Nasa - will be comprehensively trounced once official figures come in for February. 
Initial satellite measurements, compiled by Eric Holthaus at Slate, put February’s anomaly from the pre-industrial average between 1.15C and 1.4C. The UN Paris climate agreement struck in December seeks to limit warming to 1.5C if possible.
“Even the lower part of that range is extraordinary,” said Will Steffen, an emeritus professor of climate science at Australian National University and a councillor at Australia’s Climate Council. 

It appears that on Wednesday, the northern hemisphere even slipped above the milestone 2C average for the first time in recorded history. This is the arbitrary limit above which scientists believe global temperature rise will be “dangerous”.
The Arctic in particular experienced terrific warmth throughout the winter. Temperatures at the north pole approached 0C in late December – 30C to 35C above average. 
Mark Serreze, the director of the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre, described the conditions as “absurd”.
“The heat has been unrelenting over the entire season,” he said. “I’ve been studying Arctic climate for 35 years and have never seen anything like this before”.
All this weirdness follows the record-smashing year of 2015, which was 0.9C above the 20th century average. This beat the previous record warmth of 2014 by 0.16C.
These tumbling temperature records are often accompanied in media reports by the caveat that we are experiencing a particularly strong El Niño - perhaps the largest in history. But should El Niño and climate change be given equal billing?
No, according to Professor Michael Mann, the director of Penn State Earth System Science Centre. He said it was possible to look back over the temperature records and assess the impact of an El Niño on global temperatures.
“A number of folks have done this,” he said, “and come to the conclusion it was responsible for less than 0.1C of the anomalous warmth. In other words, we would have set an all-time global temperature record [in 2015] even without any help from El Niño.”
Global surface temperature is the major yardstick used to track how we are changing the climate. It is the average the UN Paris agreement refers to.
But the atmosphere doesn’t stop at the surface. In fact 93% of the extra energy trapped by the greenhouse gases humans have emitted gets sunk into the oceans – just 1% ends up in the atmosphere where temperature is most often and most thoroughly measured. During El Niño, which occurs every three to six years, currents in the Pacific Ocean bring warm water to the surface and heat up the air.
Jeff Knight from the Met Office’s Hadley Centre, said their modelling set the additional heat from a big El Niño, like the current one, at about 0.2C. He said wind patterns in the northern hemisphere had added another 0.1C to recent monthly readings.
“The bottom line is that the contributions of the current El Niño and wind patterns to the very warm conditions globally over the last couple of months are relatively small compared to the anthropogenically driven increase in global temperature since pre-industrial times,” he added.
Steffen said the definitive assessment of this El Niño and its effect on the world’s temperature would only be possible once the event had run its course (it has now peaked and is expected to end in the second quarter of this year). But he agreed that past El Niño cycles could be an appropriate guide for the order of magnitude of the effect. 
The picture becomes less clear cut when we talk about monthly records. Even weather trends can have small effects on the monthly average temperature, said Knight. The effect of El Niño traditionally increases as it dies, so Mann believes it may have added more than the “nominal” o.1C during the past three months.
In the Arctic, the effect of El Niño is poorly understood but likely to be weak, said Knight. “Given that the Arctic has been very warm for a number of years, with record low sea ice, it is more likely that the warmth there currently is part of a long-term trend rather than the response to a episodic event like El Niño.”
Steffen says quantifying the relative contributions of El Niño and climate change on a monthly or even annual basis cannot help to answer how fast the world is warming. Only trends over 30 years really matter.
But the pile up of records we have had in the early part of this century are significant. All things being constant, record hot years should occur once every 150 years. Yet 1998, 2005, 2010, 2014 and 2015 have all been record breakers.
A study published in January found that even without last year’s mammoth anomaly such a run was 600 to 130,000 times more likely to have occurred with human interference than without.
“The fact that you are getting records so close, one after the other is really striking. And that is symptomatic of that long-term trend,” said Steffen.
But while they may be poor signals for long-term climate change, record hot months and years do have an immediate and tangible impact. 
“It’s making heat waves worse. Here in Australia it bumps up the bushfire danger weather really fast. It tends to lead to drier conditions in our part of the world. These things are exacerbated by El Niños, so I don’t want to downplay the importance of them for human suffering,” said Steffen."

Their desire to not be left behind might seem rather academic, as they already have been - both by a warming climate and countries whose embrace of renewable energy is far advanced. 
Their report on pathways to 2030 is littered with the buzzwords for a more sustainable energy system. It looks at everything from more decentralised energy generation to a “whole systems” approach, energy efficiency and even “reducing energy demand”.
Contrary to previous official expectations of rising demand, it expects demand to remain roughly stable, but describes an otherwise substantially changing energy market overseen by uncertain government policies that threaten the investment needed for transformation. 

Late in 2015 the Department for Energy and Climate Change cut its projection for new renewable energy capacity coming on stream by 2015 by more than one-third from 34 gigawatts (GW) to 22GW. It emerged around the same time that the big six energy suppliers represented by Energy UK had all dropped their green electricity tariffs.
Both the big energy companies and government seem to lack any idea of the scale and speed of transition in infrastructure that nations are capable of. Perhaps they need a reminder.
Taking a lesson from the dark side, our initial system-wide addiction to fossil fuels was a rapid affair. Starting in 1956 the US Interstate Highway System, for example, managed to build 47,000 miles of highway in just over three decades, “changing commerce and society”. 
A century earlier, Britain demonstrated the capacity for the rapid rollout of a more benign transport system when just between the years of 1845 and 1852 there were 4,400 miles of railway track laid. A single weekend in 1892 saw the upgrading of 177 miles of track on the Great Western route by 4,200 well-coordinated workers.
It is astonishing by the contemporary standards of apparent official impotence to solve the crisis in the housing market (also a key energy issue), that in Britain’s battered and far more indebted post-war condition, the number of homes built annually by local authorities in the early 1950s hit 250,000, and under a Conservative government. Under a Labour government social housing around 1967-68 still saw around 200,000 homes built with the private sector building a similar number, before such ambition fell off a cliff in the 1980s. In comparison, during 2014-15 just 1,350 homes were completed by local authorities in England and the private sector built less than half what it did during the mid 1960s.
It is possible to transform societies in response to positive visions of “homes fit for heroes”, but also to mobilise rapidly to fight against the external threats that called for the heroes in the first place. Against significant, official intransigence, from 1936–39 dozens of factories were built or repurposed around Britain as part of a “shadow factories” programme to produce the military hardware for the war effort. And, when they were bombed, as they often were, in great adversity the factories were rapidly repaired and returned to production. 
Compared to proven historical ability, even the boldest comments of the big energy companies appear tentative and insipid. Recent human migration in response to conflict and other drivers seems to stress our ability to adapt. But forms of large scale adaptation are happening all the time in response to economic and demographic change. It took an estimated 10,000 years for the world’s urban population to add up to 1 billion. Going from 2-3 billion took just 17 years, from 1985–2002. Somehow, however imperfectly and haphazardly, we adapted, responding with urban infrastructures to provide shelter and basic services. 
What’s needed now is a more conscious, bold and planned programme to achieve the rapid transition of an energy system to respond to a known challenge with clear targets. 
Denmark, as a small nation, provides in microcosm a classic example. An incentive scheme brought communities and investors together creating both grassroots support and a secure investment environment. In two decades from 1983, 3GW of wind energy capacity were installed. By 2014 wind power was providng 39% of Danish electricity. 
Internationally things are changing fast. Even in the fossil fuel-hungry US, 8GW of wind were installed in 2015. And in China, for all its problems, nearly 20GW of wind power were introduced in a single year, 2014. Which is more than the UK’s current total installed capacity, onshore and offshore, of wind energy, of just over 14GW.
We should applaud the change of tone from Energy UK, but remind them that what makes a real difference finally is: deeds not words."

At a webcast meeting of environment ministers on Friday, they criticised the European commission for advising no change was needed.
Several others spoke of the need to fully participate in the five-yearly reviews of national climate plans set out in the UN text.
Officials’ response to the historic international pact lacked “oomph”, said Austria’s Andrä Rupprechter. “We would have expected more in the way of ambition.”
Back in October 2014, members of the 28-state bloc agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions “at least 40%” from 1990 levels by 2030.
That left the door open to increasing efforts, subject to a strong international deal.
The Paris pact set a tougher global goal than many observers expected, to hold temperature rise this century “well below” 2C and aim for 1.5C.
Yet Germany’s Jochen Flasbarth noted references to “at least” had disappeared, describing the communication as “very weak” on that point.
Carole Dieschbourg, Luxembourg minister and one of the EU’s lead negotiators in Paris, called for the 2030 framework to be updated as soon as possible.
“We mustn’t waste time,” she said. “We might find that our credibility is undermined if we don’t do this.”
Other member states rejected the case for a higher target, however, with Hungary, Lithuania and Italy saying it was already hard to achieve.
“This is not a time for divisive issues such as raising ambition,” said Italy’s Gian Luca Galletti.
It comes as the EU embarks on reforms of its emissions trading scheme (ETS) and negotiations over effort-sharing between countries. Both are fiercely contentious.
On the ETS, environmentalists argue radical changes are needed to push the carbon price up from current lows of €5 (£3.9) a tonne and spur clean investment.
They face off with heavy industrial lobbies who complain this will make them uncompetitive, if not matched by similar measures overseas.
For emissions not covered by the carbon market, there will be tussles over how to allocate national responsibility for the 40% goal. Hungary argued that needed to be settled before countries could ratify the Paris deal.
Ségolène Royal, France’s environment minister and president of the climate talks since colleague Laurent Fabius stepped down last month, urged swift ratification.
France hopes to start its national process before a UN signing ceremony in New York next month and complete the formalities this summer.
It was important to reflect the 1.5C goal in revisions to the ETS, she added. “We have to ensure that we are very much at the forefront of low carbon economies.”
At the New York meeting, the World Bank will convene a high level panel on carbon pricing, Royal highlighted. By encouraging taxes and trading schemes worldwide, it could address some concerns about “carbon leakage”."

Rock-throwing students clashed with riot police firing tear gas in the University of Honduras on Thursday night amid anger over the authorities’ failure to protect a high-profile campaigner who had repeatedly received threats on her life.
International NGOs called for foreign investors and engineering companies to withdraw from the Agua Zarca hydropower project that Cáceres had been opposing at the time of her death.
The US government also came under fire for supporting a government that came to power in a coup and has since pushed forward with the controversial cascade of dams and failed to prevent Honduras from becoming the most murderous country in the world for environmental campaigners.
Amid growing criticism, President Hernández said local investigators were working with officials from the US and other countries to find the culprits and he promised the full force of the law would come down on the killers.
“Our commitment is to the truth of the facts and to serve justice, no matter who it might involve. No one is above the law. This death will not go unpunished,” he said in a televised speech. 
Local media later reported that a suspect is being questioned by police in connection with the murder, which occurred early on Thursday morning when at least two gunmen broke into the home of Cáceres and fired four shots at her sleeping body.
But supporters of Cáceres fear a possible cover-up. Dozens gathered to demand justice outside the morgue where Cáceres’ body is being examined. Some held banners reading “no more impunity”. 
The police initially reported the case as an attempted robbery, but the victim’s family believe the killing was an assassination ordered by people behind the dam project. Cáceres and other members of the group she founded – the Council of Indigenous Peoples of Honduras (Copinh) – have been in conflict with the operators Desa, the local mayor, police and soldiers. Last week, members of the group were detained and threatened, Copinh said in a statement.
The dangers faced by Cáceres were well known. Last year, the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights (IACHR) raised concerns about Cáceres’s safety with the Honduran president Hernández, and formally called on the government to apply “precautionary measures”. There were reiterated in November by the United Nations special rapporteur for indigenous rights, Victoria Tauli-Corpuz.
But the authorities failed to protect the country’s most famous campaigner, who was last year awarded the Goldman Environment Prize. 
In her acceptance speech, Cáceres appeared to foreshadow her own death, when she noted that “giving our lives in various ways for the protection of rivers is giving our lives for the well-being of humanity and of this planet”.
Environmental activists are more likely to be killed in Honduras than any other country, according to a study by the NGO Global Witness. More than 80% of murders go unpunished. Part of the problem, according to the InterIACHR, is that the military has taken on roles that should be left to a civilian police. They tend to work in conjunction with powerful interests, while human rights activists are criminalised.
“Honduras should protect defenders when they encounter risks to their life and personal integrity, by adopting an effective and comprehensive prevention strategy, with the goal of preventing attacks, and should take the necessary measures so that they can carry out their work without hindrance or risk,” the commission said lastmonth.
The utter failure to ensure the security of Cáceres has sparked international condemnation.
“The cowardly killing of Berta is a tragedy that was waiting to happen. For years, she had been the victim of a sustained campaign of harassment and threats to stop her from defending the rights of indigenous communities,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International. 
The US government added its voice to the calls for justice. “We strongly condemn this despicable crime. The United States of America calls for a prompt and thorough investigation into this crime and for the full force of the law to be brought to bear against those responsible,” US Ambassador James Nealon said in a condolence message.
But Washington’s role is also controversial because the US backed the current government, which took power after a 2009 coup that ousted the democratically elected president Manuel Zelaya. The US is now providing fund for the Honduran police force.
International Rivers, an NGO that worked with Cáceres, suggested the US government should shoulder some of the blame for the climate of violence against activists .
“We must note that during the 2009 military coup in Honduras, the US government, with Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, worked behind the scenes to keep Honduras’ elected government from being reinstated. Additionally, the US government continues to fund the Honduran military, despite the sharp rise in the homicide rate, political repression, and the murders of political opposition and peasant activists,” the group said in a statement. 
It also called for action against foreign participants in the dam project, including Siemens, Voith-Hydro, Dutch FMO and Finnfund, and said the US government, World Bank and other financial institutions should suspend loans to Honduras until justice is done.
As the political fallout widened, tributes to the dead activist continued to flow in from across the globe.
Oxfam lamented the loss of an “inspiring woman, mother, wife, activist and human rights defender”.
Jagoda Munic, chair of Friends of the Earth International, said: “This is a sad day for Honduras and the world ... international pressure is needed to bring the murderers to justice and protect those brave enough to speak out on behalf of their fellow citizens and the environment.”
The actor Leonardo Di Caprio – who used his recent Oscar acceptance speech to call for stronger action against climate change – also lamented the death of the activist. 
“Incredibly sad news out of Honduras,” he tweeted. “We should all honor the brave contributions of Cáceres. "

But that opportunity will only be realised if we follow up the good intentions of Paris with delivery in every country of the world. Paris was significant because it set out the ambition to keep global warming well below 2C, and ideally to 1.5C of warming, and it accepted that the world must get to net zero emissions in the second half of the century, in accordance with our scientific understanding. In doing so, the agreement built on the commitments by businesses and cities of the world to net zero emissions. A move driven not just by science but by the ambition for a world with cleaner air, better homes, and an improved quality of life.
The UK government deserves significant credit for having helped deliver the Paris agreement. Now we urge it to follow up its high ambition internationally, with high ambition here at home. Specifically, it can build on the momentum from Paris by supporting the idea of enshrining net zero emissions in UK domestic law, with the date to be advised by the independent committee on climate change.
Just as the 2008 UK Climate Change Act, prompted by business and civil society, and passed with all-party support, sent a signal to the world, so we would do so again. A signal that every country must raise its ambition, that business and government need the certainty to plan ahead, and that we must be serious about the scale of challenge that faces us.

The former Labour leader – alongside Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, Green MP Caroline Lucas and two Conservative MPs – has called for legislation that would significantly extend the present UK target of cutting emissions by 80% by 2050.
His intervention follows December’s Paris summit, where global leaders accepted that the world must achieve net zero emissions in the second half of the century, as recommended by scientists.
However, there is growing disquiet that even Paris’s limited aims are not being met. Last week, the Guardian revealed that the EU is expected to emit 2bn tonnes more CO2 than it promised at the Paris climate talks, threatening the agreement to cap global warming at 2C. 
In a letter published by the Guardian, Miliband calls for the British government to take the lead by drawing up plans for a new law, with an implementation date set by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), an independent body which advises the UK government and was established under the Climate Change Act 2008. 
As well as Farron and Lucas, he is also supported by Tory MPs Dan Poulter and Graham Stuart, as well as the NGOs Christian Aid, ClientEarth, ShareAction, Sandbag and WWF. 
 In his letter, Miliband states: “The UK government deserves significant credit for having helped deliver the Paris agreement. Now we urge it to follow up its high ambition internationally, with high ambition here at home. 
“Specifically, it can build on the momentum from Paris by supporting the idea of enshrining net zero emissions in UK domestic law, with the date to be advised by the independent Committee on Climate Change. 
“Just as the 2008 UK Climate Change Act, prompted by business and civil society, and passed with all-party support, sent a signal to the world, so we would do so again.”
Before Christmas, Miliband said that having stood down as Labour leader after the election in May, he had decided throw his energy behind building a “high-ambition coalition” of UK businesses, trade unions and civic society to challenge the government’s “backward” environmental policies.
“This is the thing my kids will judge me on,” he told the Guardian at the time. “Did you do something about this? Were you the last generation not to get it or the first generation to get it? I think that is in the balance now.”
EU leaders are expected to discuss the possibility of raising Europe’s 2030 target at a summit between 17-18 March. But powerful figures in the European commission will try to ensure this happens through a revision of the bloc’s carbon market rules in 2023.
The EU’s climate chief, Miguel Arias Cañete, has already signalled he would like Europe to ratify the Paris climate agreement at a conference in New York on 22 April.
A 2C rise in global temperatures could have consequences including the migration of 20% of the world’s population from cities flooded by sea level rise, such as New York, London and Cairo, according to a study published last month.
This summer, the government’s statutory climate advisers warned that the UK’s existing carbon budgets could be missed. The group’s chairman, for Tory minister Lord Gummer, took the unusual step of singling out Conservative policy changes such as scrapping a target for all new homes to be zero carbon."

The country’s emissions have fallen, partly as a result of its globally relevant economic slowdown, and partly owing to government policies to pursue a low-carbon path and reduce the rampant air pollution in its major cities.
If this trend continues it would show that the country’s emissions have already peaked, said Fergus Green, lead author of the report from the LSE.
This would be a landmark in international efforts to tackle emissions and fight climate change, formalised in last December’s breakthrough international accord on climate change signed in Paris. At the summit China, the world’s second biggest economy and the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, agreed that its emissions should peak by 2030.
In the new report, Green and Stern argue that if China’s emissions have not already peaked, then they are very likely to do so within the next decade, bringing the world’s biggest emitter to its internationally agreed target years earlier than expected.
This is an important development, as it means that the world’s biggest emitter is likely to be finally on a downward path of carbon emissions. Although there is a possibility that China’s emissions will pick up if its growth rate recovers, the reduction in emissions is likely to continue, according to Green.
“We are seeing a larger infrastructural change in China,” Green told the Guardian. This was the result of policies and changing industrial conditions, he said. A fall in China’s coal consumption in 2014 accelerated in 2015, according to government statistics published in February.
Green also discounted the idea that a reduction in emissions in China, as it moves to a higher value economy rather than the low-wage, high-production model that has fuelled in its past two decades of high growth, would be wiped out by an increase in emissions in other developing economies that are following China’s example. 
“It is almost inconceivable [that other countries would make up for these emissions], because China is so large,” he said.
Under the Paris agreement, all countries - developed and developing - are called on to review their emissions targets every five years. Green said this could be key to reducing emissions further. “One of the virtues of the current agreement is the review mechanism, so China will be in a very strong position in 2020 to ratchet up its targets,” he said.
In Europe, however, green campaigners were disappointed last week by a report from the European commission that focused on the core Paris commitment to cut emissions in line with a 2C rise in temperatures. Governments in Paris had also pledged to consider how to cut their carbon in order to limit temperature rises to no more than 1.5C , which would avoid more of the ravages of climate change, particularly on small islands at risk from rising sea levels, but which would be harder to meet.
Bram Claeys, EU climate and energy policy advisor for Greenpeace, said: “The Commission must stop pretending Paris didn’t happen. It has a responsibility to step up climate action to reflect the Paris deal in legislation on renewables and energy efficiency. People won’t trust the EU if it continues to play fast and loose with global warming and delays Europe’s shift to 100% renewable energy.”
On Friday, at a meeting of EU environment ministers, several countries pushed for a stronger 2030 emissions target from the EU than the one agreed at Paris. This was welcomed by green campaigners.
Genevieve Pons, director of the European policy office of WWF, said: “We have seen huge support from member states for increasing the EU’s 2030 climate and energy targets. Doing so is the only way of standing by our commitments in Paris, working to limit temperature rises to 1.5C. EU countries have injected a welcome dose of ambition into the climate discussion, after the Commission’s lacklustre input.”"

2015 was a banner year for climate news. February, June, October, November, and December were each their respective hottest months on record, and 2015 shattered the record for hottest year. The pope delivered a climate encyclical. Investigative journalists at Inside Climate News discovered that Exxon knew about the dangers of human-caused global warming while it funded a climate misinformation campaign, and the New York attorney general launched an investigation into the company’s behavior. President Obama’s Clean Power Plan went into effect, and he rejected the Keystone XL pipeline. And most importantly, 195 countries agreed to cut carbon pollution as much as possible to stem global warming.
Despite all these critically important stories, as in the presidential debates, climate change was largely absent from US broadcast news. Climate coverage fell in 2015. 
Most of the decline was due to ABC, which only spent 13 minutes in 2015 covering climate change – three times less than even Fox. While Fox’s coverage increased, most of the network’s climate segments featured interviews with guests who criticized efforts to address global warming.
The Sunday shows (ABC’s This Week, CBS’ Face the Nation, NBC’s Meet the Press, and Fox Broadcasting Co.’s Fox News Sunday) and the network nightly news programs (ABC’s World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, and NBC Nightly News) each aired a combined 73 minutes of climate coverage in 2015, down a total of 8 minutes (a 5% decline) from 2014. The Public Broadcasting System (PBS) NewsHour program aired more segments addressing climate change (58) than the other nightly news shows combined (48).
In particular, the award-winning Inside Climate News Exxon investigation and the launch of the Clean Power Plan were largely overlooked by the news networks. 
When it came to interviewing or quoting scientists and doing segments about climate science research, PBS NewsHour again rose above its peers, while ABC’s World News Tonight flunked science class.
Climate scientists were entirely absent from the Sunday news shows, with one exception. On CBS’ Face the Nation in December, anchor John Dickerson interviewed Dr. Marshall Shepherd, meteorologist and director of University of Georgia’s Atmospheric Sciences Program, to discuss the importance of the UN summit’s goal of limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius. This was a sharp decline from 2014, in which climate scientists were interviewed or quoted on seven Sunday news shows.
Climate change affects some of the most critical components of our society: food security, national defense, extreme weather, the economy, public health, the environment, and so on. The broadcast networks touched on some of these, like extreme weather, but largely missed others.
Rep. Steve Israel (D-NY) reacted to the Media Matters report:
As the co-founder of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, I read Media Matters’ new study and it’s a wake up call to the news networks. The most important long term global and national issue shouldn’t be getting short-thrift. People need more information, not less. 
These findings may help explain why Americans aren’t concerned about climate change. We rely on the media to inform the public, and on the most important issue of our time, the US broadcast news media are failing to adequately inform Americans. As Rep. Israel notes, they’re moving in the wrong direction and need to do much better."

Last week, the commission ruled out any increase in the bloc’s target of cutting emissions by 40% by 2030 on 1990 levels, sparking an outcry from several countries and green groups.
Ministers and environmentalists said that Europe should be increasing its ambition in light of the Paris climate deal agreed in December, where nearly 200 countries pledged to pursue efforts to keep temperature rises to 1.5C. That was a much tougher goal than the existing 2C goal which Europe’s 40% cut is based on.


On Monday, the EUdirector of climate strategy, Artur Runge-Metzger, responded to the criticism: “The question of the level of ambition for 2030 is open, as long as it is a binding EU target of at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.”
Brook Riley, a spokesman for Friends of the Earth, welcomed his comments. “It’s good to hear the commission saying that increased emission cuts are still on the table, even if this contradicts what it published last week. Without tougher targets Europe would be undermining and undoing the Paris agreement before it is even signed.”

Last Friday, the Austrian environment minister, Andrä Rupprechter, told a ministerial summit in Brussels: “We shouldn’t let our ambition droop. We should keep putting out strong signals.”
The German environment minister, Jochen Flasbarth, added: “Our decision did not say that we would stay at a 40% emissions cut. It said we will cut ‘at least 40%’. The commission was a member of the ‘high ambition coalition’ in Paris so we would like to know how they intend to stand by this commitment.”
No answer is likely before 2018. That is when the UN’s climate science panel, reports back to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, which oversees international climate negotiations, on the policy implications of faster and more far-reaching action.
The first in a five-yearly series of “global stock-takes” on emissions cuts follows in 2023, and this will be the first opportunity for the EU to increase its pledge of a 40% cut by 2030.
The EU is currently modelling the economic impacts of improved energy efficiency targets, after criticism of previous impact assessments used to set policy. 
In a sign that Brussels lobbies are beginning to see signs of change, the head of the solar photovoltaic industry’s trade association today called on the EU to set a new target of members states sourcing 35% of their energy from renewable sources by 2030.
“More ambition is needed in Europe to reach the objective of limiting global warming to just 1.5C, which the European Union signed up to in Paris,” said Oliver Schaefer, SolarPower Europe’s president. “The EU must review the targets suggested in 2014. It would be foolish to pretend that nothing has changed since COP21 [the Paris climate summit].”"

The study, led by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), says that rising temperatures and droughts will force “significant areas” to find alternative crops, improve irrigation systems or even abandon crop-based agriculture completely by the year 2100. 
The authors warn that time is running out and say delays in taking the necessary adaptive steps now will further jeopardise food security and undermine the fight against poverty.
Their report, published in Nature Climate Change, examines the likely impact that climate change will have on the nine crops that make up half of the food produced in the region: bananas; cassava; beans; groundnuts; maize; sorghum; yams; pearl millet and finger millet. 
Although six of the crops are expected to remain stable despite moderate and extreme changes, up to 60% of bean-producing areas – and up to 30% of those growing maize and bananas – are projected to become unviable by the close of this century.
Failure to switch to beans that can cope better with heat stress could prove particularly devastating: the report predicts that 1.85m hectares (4.6m acres) of bean-cropping systems in Uganda and Tanzania – which between them produce 41% of sub-Saharan Africa’s beans – will be unable to do so by 2100.
West Africa’s banana-growing countries, such as Togo, Ghana and Benin, and maize-growing areas in southern Africa – Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique among them – will also need to undergo transformation within the next 10 years before the land becomes unsuitable.
The report’s lead author, Julián Ramírez-Villegas, said the loss of bean-producing areas would have drastic consequences as beans, known as “the meat of the poor”, are a vital source of protein for many people in the region.
“Although exact figures will be difficult to determine at this point, in a scenario where we take no action, you are talking of Ugandans – and more broadly also east Africans – having less available protein,” he said. “This would likely increase stunting rates and undernourishment.”
Among the solutions the report proposes are: improving agronomy, irrigation options and agro-climatic services for farmers; breeding crops that are more resistant to heat and drought; switching to more resilient crops such as millet and sorghum; and, where necessary, moving from crops to livestock.
The authors point to the success of intercropping banana with coffee, which has been found to raise incomes by 50% and build resilience in Uganda, and to the SMS and radio broadcasts offering climate information to more than 7 million rural people in Senegal. They also note that during the drought of 2005-06, many Kenyan pastoralists switched from cattle to camels as the latter need less water, feed on arid shrubs and produce six times more milk than indigenous cows.
While the experts concede that adjusting the agricultural development and food security policies of different nations is a slow and complicated business, they warn that delays will carry a high human and economic cost.
“Agriculture and farming are critical not only for the livelihoods of farmers but also more broadly for the diets of the region’s population,” said Ramírez-Villegas.
“Unless timely adaptation actions are taken, we’re looking at a bleak picture in terms of food security and poverty throughout many areas of sub-Saharan Africa.”"

The process has been successfully trialled at a pilot plant in China and a much bigger facility is now planned.
Energy-dense liquids are vital to transport but are currently derived from oil, a fossil fuel, and transport produces about a quarter of the global carbon emissions driving climate change. Biofuels have been seen as possible replacement, but current biofuels compete with food production and have been blamed for driving up food prices.
Using waste gases to create low-carbon liquid fuels would be a major advance in the battle against global warming if they could be made at low cost and large scale. Another company expects to be using different microbes to produce fuel from steel plants in Belgium and China in 2017.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) process uses bacteria to convert the waste gases into acetic acid - vinegar - then an engineered yeast to produce an oil. “It is quite an extraordinary story,” said Prof Gregory Stephanopoulos, an expert in chemical engineering and biotechnology at MIT in the US.
“It started just four to five years ago with a post-doctoral project funded by the US Energy Department. We are looking at a very fast timescale [of development],”, he said. “We have pieced the system together into an integrated system, where you put gas in one end and get a liquid fuel out of the other end.” The research was published on Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The patents for the process are owned by MIT and have been licensed to GTL Biofuel Inc. Its pilot plant outside Shanghai ran successfully from September 2015 and a larger “semi-commercial’ demonstration plant, 20 times the size, is set to begin construction.
This will test if the process can be scaled up and evaluate its costs and carbon footprint, said Prof Stephanopoulos: “It is one thing to do it on a scale of 1-2 litres in the lab, but a different story to move up 1,000 litres and then 20,000 litres in the demonstration plant.”
“The bottom line, if one is aiming at making fuels from renewable resources, is we need to look very carefully at low-cost feed stocks,” he said. Garbage, along with manure and farm waste, is a particularly promising source of the “syngas” required, he said: “The volumes are staggering.”
Furthermore, using the gas from municipal waste reduces the carbon footprint of the liquid fuel, compared to exhaust gases from fossil fuel plants. 
Prof Stephanopoulos said there are already thousands of biogas sites across Europe, but he argues the current practice of burning this gas to produce electricity is wasteful: “It is very costly and can only survive due to subsidies.” Better, he said, is to use the gas to produce fuels that can replace gasoline or diesel.
The MIT team are not the only people developing biotechnologies to turn exhaust gases into fuels. Like MIT, the US company Lanzatech uses microbes that can ferment gases into more complex molecules, a skill originally evolved so the bacteria could thrive at bubbling, hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor.
Lanzatech’s processes aim to produce either fuel or chemicals useful in industry. The company is currently building commercial units in Belgium with ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker; in China with Capital Steel and in Taiwan with China Steel, with the first unit expected to enter service in 2017. Another US company, Catalysta, is working on converting methane into hydrocarbon fuels."

The $500m payment to the Green Climate Fund was seen as critical to shoring up international confidence in Barack Obama’s ability to deliver on the pledges made at the United Nations’ climate change conference in Paris in late 2015.
Obama is expected to announce a number of joint climate initiatives when the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, visits Washington this week, sources familiar with the plans said.
The White House is also working with United Nations officials to encourage countries to formally approve the Paris climate agreement ahead of a signing ceremony on 22 April.
At least 55 countries, representing at least 55% of global climate emissions, must ratify the agreement before it takes effect. 
Administration officials said the initial $500m payment to the Green Climate Fund demonstrated that Obama would follow through on the promises of last December’s Paris climate agreement – despite February’s setback at the supreme court and threats by Republican presidential candidates to dismantle Obama’s agenda.
 “Today, the United States provided a $500m grant to the Green Climate Fund,” a State Department official said. “This grant is the first step toward meeting the president’s commitment of $3bn to the GCF, and shows that the United States stands squarely behind our international climate commitments.”
Administration officials described the payment as an important signal to the international community that Obama was pressing ahead on his climate agenda in his remaining months in the White House.
Obama has faced a number of recent setbacks to his climate agenda.
The supreme court last month agreed to block the centerpiece of Obama’s climate plan – new rules cutting emissions from power plants – until lower courts rule on legal challenges from 29 states and dozens of industry groups. The ruling created immediate uncertainty about the fate of the power plant rules and the Paris agreement.
Obama’s climate plan is also under political attack from Republican presidential contenders who say they will scrap the rules and dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency if they take the White House next November. 
Republicans in Congress have also threatened to scrap the power plant rules and block any US contributions to the Green Climate Fund, which was set up in 2009 to help poor and vulnerable countries adopt cleaner energy technologies and protect their peoples from rising seas, droughts and other impacts of climate change.
At one point Republicans insisted that the Paris agreement be submitted to the Senate for approval before any funds were released – before quietly relenting during budget negotiations last December."

“Our reputation is now trashed, internationally,” said John Church, a CSIRO scientist who was speaking in his private capacity to a public hearing of the Senate select committee into the scrutiny of government budget measures in Hobart.
He said the CSIRO would no longer be able to recruit many of the top climate scientists, because its reputation has been so badly damaged by the announced cuts. “It would require a very significant new investment to convince leading international people to come to Australia.”
He said that not only would the country now lose top scientists but they were already losing students. 
“We had a Chinese student lined up to come in a couple of months’ time. Since this announcement, that student has decided they will not come to Australia, they will not come to Hobart, they will instead go to the USA.”
In addition, most climate scientists in the CSIRO were now looking for jobs elsewhere, said Richard Matear, another CSIRO climate scientist who appeared before the committee in a personal capacity. “Most scientists I’ve spoken to are looking in some way or another,” he said.
The cuts have also revealed an underlying problem with relying on the CSIRO to conduct “public good” research under its current model. Both researchers said a new model of funding was required for such research.
“I have grave doubts about the future of public good research in CSIRO in the current funding arrangements,” Church said. “I really think we’ve got to the stage where, at least for climate research, we need a new model to carry into the future.”
At least for climate research, we need a new model to carry into the future
Matear agreed and said the problem was wider than just climate science: “Public good research at the CSIRO at the moment looks like a non-viable way forward. Maybe it’s climate this time around but it doesn’t make you confident that CSIRO will stay in this space.”
The pair said that CSIRO required for each dollar spent on research to be matched by external funding that is brought in by the research from “customers”, which wasn’t a model for research that was required for the public good.
In another submission, the climate scientist Trevor McDougall from the University of New South Wales, who had been at the CSIRO for 28 years, said that requirement combined with a Abbott-Turnbull government cut to climate research funding was responsible for the cut to climate science.
In the 2014-2015 budget, the government combined two climate research funding programs, cutting $21.7m in the process. McDougall said climate science research needed to be excluded from the requirement to raise so much external funding, or a new public good research centre needed to be created.
Appearing before the inquiry, Alex Wonhas, the executive director of environment, energy and resources, appeared to indicate this was a factor in the cut to climate research at the CSIRO: “The customer for the climate work, that’s obviously a very difficult question. One of the proxies we use for that is ultimately the government’s investment into the space. And that’s certainly been looked at as one of different factors to inform that decision.”
Church suggested a new centre similar to the UK’s Hadley Centre for Climate Science and Services, which was housed within the Met Office – the equivalent of Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology.
In February this year, the chief executive of the CSIRO, Larry Marshall, announced he had decided to cut about 100 people from the oceans and atmosphere division, in a move away from their historical role monitoring and modelling climate change.
It was quickly revealed that the decision had been made with almost no consultation within the organisation, or with other organisations in Australia and around the world that rely on work done by the CSIRO.
Appearing before the committee, Alex Wonhas acknowledged the perception that the CSIRO was moving away from public good research. “I want to categorically say that is not the case,” he said. “Public good research has been the absolute foundation of what the CSIRO has been doing over our very long history.”"

Since 1950, daily extremes have risen 1-2% a decade, a study published in journal Nature said on Monday.
That trend is expected to last until at least 2100, prompting emergency planners to take precautions against flash flooding. Dry regions such as Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula or Australia, whose parched soil poorly absorbs excess water, would be most vulnerable.
Global warming increases the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, leading to heavier downpours.
The study led by Markus Donat at the University of New South Wales in Australia couldn’t say exactly where extreme rainfall would occur, but underlined the heightened risks. Tropical regions were most uncertain.
Floods made up almost half of all weather-related disasters in the last two decades, according to the UN office for disaster risk reduction. They affected 2.3 billion people, 95% of whom were in Asia."

Here’s why you should too | Donnachadh McCarthy";"Daily showering is expensive, polluting and unnecessary. The old-school weekly bath or shower – with a brief daily sink-wash – is healthier for the environment, and for us";"When I was a kid, bathtime was a once-a-week affair. We weren’t an unhygienic family – this is just how most of us lived in the 1960s, and I do not remember any horrific body odours resulting from it. By the time I was an adult, I was showering every day. With hindsight, I should have stuck to the old ways.
The average 10-minute shower uses 60 litres of water. A power shower uses three times that and a bath about 80 litres. So a family of four each having a daily 10-minute power shower (I know that is a very conservative estimate for some teenagers) will consume a staggering 0.25m litres of water every year. The annual average cost for electricity for four 10-minute showers per day would be up to about £400, or £1,200 if a power shower is involved. Even worse, the power-shower family would be emitting a staggering 3.5 tonnes of CO2. As we can afford only one tonne of carbon emissions per person – for everything from food to transport – if we are to keep global temperatures below the critical 2C threshold, this would consume nearly all of the family’s carbon budget.
The daily bath or shower, then, is terrible for the environment and our bank balances. That’s one reason I have reverted to a weekly shower, with a daily sink-wash that includes my underarms and privates. But there are health consequences too. I first became aware of these when I was a touring ballet dancer and met a friend whose skin had been severely damaged by excessive use of soap products. He was condemned to treat himself with medical creams for the rest of his life. According to dermatologist Joshua Zeichner, parents should stop bathing babies and toddlers daily because early exposure to dirt and bacteria may help make skin less sensitive, even preventing conditions like eczema in the long run. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends three times a week or less as toddlers’ skin is more sensitive; and as the elderly have drier skin, they should not be frequently washing all of their bodies with soap.
It is clear my daily shower habit resulted from falsely imposed cultural norms
Doctors say that overuse of soap removes the skin’s natural protective oils and good bacteria. This can exacerbate or cause complaints such as dermatitis. The longer one stays in the shower, the more of the skin’s oils are removed. The only real beneficiaries of over-frequent baths and showers are the companies that make and market soaps and shampoos.
It is clear my daily shower habit resulted from falsely imposed cultural norms, rather than any legitimate health benefits. We do need to wash our hands frequently, for obvious hygiene reasons. But our skin has its own natural cleansing mechanism and it is generally only our armpits, feet and privates that produce any odours if unwashed.
There is a similar story with frequent shampooing. When I visited the Yanomami in the heart of the Amazon in 1992, I noticed that they had lovely shiny, healthy hair, despite not using any shampoo or soap at all. Frequent shampooing, it turns out, removes the hair’s natural protective oils, damaging and drying out the hair and scalp, in turn creating a lucrative market for so-called hair “conditioners” and “anti-dandruff” shampoos. I gave up shampooing after I came back from the Yanomami and now simply wash my hair with water. I never again suffered from dandruff or dry hair.
Of course, if you are being intimate with somebody, whether it is your partner or a doctor who is examining you, it is nicer for both of you if you are fresh and clean. But that can just involve a quick sink-wash.
So let’s ignore the advertising bullies and revert to the traditional weekly shower or bath, plus a daily sink-wash. Apart from anything else, think how much time we’ll save."

The two leaders were expected to announce a number of common climate measures at a meeting at the White House this week, from a 45% cut in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry to protections for a rapidly warming Arctic.
The state visit on Thursday is seen as an important moment for Trudeau to break with his Conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper, who was accused of muzzling government scientists and backtracking on climate promises.
 The visit – four months after Trudeau’s election and 11 months before Obama leaves the White House – offered a rare window of opportunity to advance the cause that is important to both leaders, the Canadian prime minister said.
“There is a nice alignment between a Canadian prime minister who wants to get all sorts of things done right off the bat and an American president who is thinking about the legacy he is going to leave in his last year in office,” Trudeau told a Huffington Post town hall.
 “The issues that are important to him and to me are climate change … We’re talking about border issues, as well – making sure there is a smooth flow of goods and people across our shared border that isn’t putting our security at risk.”
Taking prime position among those issues was the Arctic – where winter temperatures are 7C above normal this year and the sea ice cover is also dwindling towards a new record low. In Alaska, the winter was so unseasonably warm that the authorities were forced to import freight cars full of snow for the launch of the annual Iditarod dog sledding race.
The US took over from Canada last year as leader of the Arctic Council, the group of polar regional countries.
The US and Canadian leaders were expected to use the Washington visit to announce a number of measures to protect remote communities and ecologically sensitive marine areas in the Arctic, sources familiar with the initiatives said.
Some of those initiatives involved efforts to reduce reliance on diesel fuel – which is transported by barge into remote native Alaskan villages. 
With the melting of the Arctic summer sea ice, the region faces sweeping changes in the years and decades ahead. 
Shipping traffic in the North-west Passage and the Bering Sea is projected to rise by a factor of seven over the next decade – which could disrupt hunting and fishing by native Alaskan communities. 
The two leaders are also expected to announce joint initiatives in Arctic science research. Scientists have blamed the warming of the Arctic for changes in global weather patterns.
Obama and Trudeau are also expected to announce common positions on reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. Both countries have been edging towards a common 45% target for cutting emissions from methane – which is more than 80 times as warming as carbon dioxide.
On Tuesday, the US State Department’s climate envoy, Todd Stern, told reporters that methane emissions reductions would be an area the countries could work together on.
In November last year, Alberta, Canada’s main energy-producing province, unveiled a new climate plan proposing to reduce methane emissions from oil wells by 45% from 2014 levels by 2025. Two months later, Obama proposed new rules cutting methane emissions 45% from 2012 levels by 2025.
Campaigners saw the curbs on methane as a chance to cap one of the fastest growing sources of climate pollution in recent years – because of the boom in oil and gas drilling.
“Methane is a very significant climate pollutant,” said Erin Flanagan, the federal policy director for the Pembina Institute, a Canadian environmental thinktank.

The group of 21 mayors, comprising Democrats and Republicans, has written to the moderators of the Democratic and Republican TV debates to argue it would be “unconscionable for these issues of grave concern for the people of Florida to not be addressed”.
The letter states that candidates should be asked about reductions to greenhouse gas emissions and investments in coastal infrastructure during the Miami debates. The Democratic debate, hosted by Univision and the Washington Post, will take place on Wednesday, with the Republican event, handled by CNN, Salem Radio and the Washington Times, held on Thursday.
The plea, issued from US cities acutely vulnerable to rising sea levels, follows mounting criticism of the lack of questions posed to candidates on climate change. In a televised Republican debate held just three days after the historic Paris climate deal, climate change was only mentioned once in passing by John Kasich, who argued that the summit should have been used to discuss terrorism instead.
“This is a critically important issue not just for the country but also for the world, but it isn’t even being debated,” said Jack Seiler, the mayor of Fort Lauderdale, who put his name to the letter. “Some of the topics raised in the debates are ridiculous – the personal attacks go back and forth for 20 minutes – but when you try to talk about about rising sea levels, it’s almost as if it’s too much of a mature topic for them.
“Our city is really ground zero for rising sea levels, so it’s frustrating to see this. I mean, I’d love there to be as much discussion about climate change as there is about Donald Trump’s hands. If they aren’t going to talk about it in Florida, when will they?”
During the course of the presidential race, the US has had its warmest year on record, California has been gripped by its worst drought in 1,200 years and scientists have warned of “profound effects” upon the entire Arctic ecosystem after the wilderness experienced a new low in peak ice extent. On Tuesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced the contiguous US had just had its warmest winter on record – 4.6F above the 20th century average.
However, while climate change has been discussed by Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders during debates, it has been virtually ignored by the leading Republican contenders. According to the League of Conservation Voters, there have been 14 climate questions posed to Republicans over 26 debates in the past nine months, amid an overall decline in TV news coverage of climate change over the past year.
Outside the debates, frontrunner Donald Trump has called climate science a “hoax” and “bullshit” and previously claimed “global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”. He has since said the comments about a Chinese conspiracy were a “joke”.
Texas senator Ted Cruz said last year that “climate change is not a science, it’s religion” and that people who challenge it are treated as “blasphemers”. Cruz contends there has been no global warming for the past 17 years.
Meanwhile, Marco Rubio, the Florida senator, has been a target of mayors in the state over his stance on climate change. Although Rubio has said he accepts the science that the world is warming, he has warned against any major action in response, pointing out that “America is not a planet”. OKasich, the governor of Ohio, has also said he accepts mainstream climate science, a position he recently admitted is “apostasy” within the Republican party.
According to Nasa, average global sea levels have risen by 8in (20cm) since 1870. This increase isn’t uniform around the world, however, and low-lying areas of Florida are vulnerable to a buildup of water along the eastern seaboard of the US. Over the past 20 years, sea levels around the Miami coast, where 2.4 million people live within 4ft of the high tide line, have risen by 3.7 inches.
“Some people get swept into office. I floated into office,” said Philip Levine, mayor of Miami Beach, whose election campaign video featured himself in a canoe with a dog as he navigated flooded streets of the resort city.
Levine said the city has spent $100m raising the roads, installing new water pumps and reinforcing sea walls in a bid to curb the regular flooding of the western part of Miami Beach. High tides, known as “king tides”, can inundate streets in Miami Beach when exacerbated by winds.
“We had areas that were flooding significantly, and we need another $300m to make our city resilient,” Levine said. “If you don’t have a solution in sight, it doesn’t bode well for anyone. We need both parties to work on this – the rising seas aren’t Democratic or Republican. This should be a bipartisan issue.
“We have a Florida senator in Marco Rubio that has done nothing to help. He hasn’t responded to a letter, he hasn’t raised it in the senate, he doesn’t believe it’s a problem. It comes down to special interests, the oil, gas and fossil fuel industries, that are funding his campaign. So he puts his head in the sand as we experience regular flooding.”
CNN and Univision did not respond to an inquiry on whether climate change questions will be asked during the debates. "

Jay Faison, a North Carolina businessman, said he was making a significant intervention in the 2016 elections through his ClearPath foundation, in the hopes of promoting what he called a conservative clean energy agenda.
The effort, which involves raising $5m for a Super Pac, a $1m digital ad campaign, and the hiring of a number of key staffers for a Washington DC office, represents a renewed effort by Faison to get his party to change its position on energy and climate change.
That vision would be unrecognisable to supporters of Barack Obama’s climate plan, however. Faison opposes the Environmental Protection Agency rules for clean power plants and is no fan of solar power or wind energy.
But the businessman maintained he was trying to push his fellow Republicans into a cultural shift.
 “Our mission is to make conservative clean energy a priority for the GOP,” Faison told reporters at the National Press Club in Washington. 
Faison conceded $5m for a Super Pac was small beer amid this billion-dollar US presidential election, but he said such a sum could influence congressional races. “I think we can do it. It might take some time, but I think we can do it.”
The intervention was part of a tentative effort among a very small number of Republicans to try to move the party away from a default position of climate denial and obstruction maintained since Obama’s first days in the White House.
Faison first came on the scene last June when he announced he had sold his audio visual company SnapAV and was plunging his $165m into a foundation to promote climate science and market-based solutions to global warming.
The businessman last year had focused more directly on opposing climate denial. His latest intervention, however, sidesteps the issue.
Faison said neither party offered what he called conservative, or free market, approaches to clean energy.
“We had windmills and sunshine on the left and we had ‘drill, baby, drill’ on the right,” Faison said. “I thought that was a vacuum we could fill.”
Republicans’ current posture of climate denial was hurting the party, he added.
Like his fellow Republicans in Congress, Faison admitted on Tuesday that he opposed the EPA rules cutting emissions from power plants. “We don’t think that the EPA structure, the clean power plan, is ideal,” he said.
The ClearPath vision of clean energy relies exclusively on hydro power, clean coal technology, nuclear energy, and natural gas – and omits any reference to solar or wind power.
 But Faison’s intervention, though limited, could still shake up a party whose leading presidential contenders openly deny the existence of climate change, or rely heavily on funding from the fossil fuel industry.
Faison acknowledged his $5m Super Pac was unlikely to force Donald Trump or Ted Cruz to change their positions. “I don’t think I am a big enough dog in that fight to have that kind of an outcome,” he said.
But he said he hoped to influence congressional races next November by supporting candidates who are both Republican and supporters of clean energy.
The intervention comes at a time when some Republicans are beginning to edge away from climate denial – emboldened by the pope’s embrace of the issue, or fears of losing support from younger voters and women. 
Some of the potential beneficiaries of Faison’s cash are already beginning to stick their heads above the parapets to call for action on climate change – such as the 10 Republicans who broke party ranks last September to call for movement on the issue. 
Others are trying to overcome political divisions around climate change.
Last month, two members of Congress from Miami – Carlos Curbelo, a Republican, and Ted Deutch, a Democrat – launched the Climate Solutions Caucus, in the first attempt in years to find a political consensus on climate change. 
 Faison, however, is focused on reforming his own party. He said his Super Pac would only fund Republicans, and that he is willing to overlook candidates’ positions on climate change, so long as they back his energy plan. “We support people that support conservative clean energy and we don’t have to agree on climate change,” he said."

It’s the holy grail of climate science and promises to reveal the past and future of Earth’s atmosphere. And right now, scientists are meeting in Hobart to work out a plan to dig it up.
We’re pretty sure there is ice one million years old or older towards the bottom of the Antarctic ice sheet
The time capsule is ice that froze 1.5m years ago, capturing tiny bubbles of air, bringing a sample of the ancient atmosphere through time to the present day.
There are already dozens of ice cores from Antarctica and Greenland. They are tubes of ice, sometimes several kilometres long, drilled from the ice sheet, which reveal a timeline of what the atmosphere was like over hundreds of millennia.
Together those cores paint a detailed picture of the history of our atmosphere and climate. They’ve demonstrated the tight relationship that exists between carbon dioxide concentrations and temperature, but also how unusual the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are now.


They take us back through time to about 800,000 years ago, through ice age after ice age. Although 800 millenia tells us a lot about carbon dioxide and temperature, the ice core record stops at a crucial moment.
We know what temperatures were like on Earth going back millions of years. That’s because the air temperatures leave a unique signature in the sediment at the bottom of the ocean, as well as in other “proxy” systems like ice and tree rings.
Examining that sediment, scientists have found that a strange thing happened about one million years ago. The cycle of ice ages sped up. Rather than happening every 100,000 years, they suddenly started happening every 40,000 years.
“The fact that we can’t fully explain why that change occurred tells us that we still don’t know all that we’d like to know about the climate system,” says Tas van Ommen from the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre at the University of Tasmania.
“And we think carbon dioxide could well be the key to what drove the change.”
But because the ice core record stops at 800,000 years, there is no way to tell if that’s true.
Enter the search for the million-year ice core. “The million-year ice core is a holy grail for climate science,” says van Ommen, who’s chair of the International Partnerships in Ice Core Sciences (Ipics) conference in Hobart this week.
“The scientific need to try to get an ice core record that pushes back beyond a million years is something we’ve been focussed on for 10 years,” says van Ommen. “We’re pretty sure that there exists ice that is one million years or older towards the bottom of the Antarctic ice sheet, but knowing exactly where is a big exercise.”
“And when you’re talking about a very expensive multi-year program, you want to know where,” he says.
So teams around the world have been busily modelling the flow of ice on Antarctica, to figure out a place where ice is likely to have sat undisturbed for a million years.
Other teams have been flying planes with radar over Antarctica, mapping the bottom of the ice. And yet others have been modelling the past climates of Antarctica, finding a spot where the right amount of snow is likely to have fallen each year, giving clear layers throughout the ice.
At the conference, the teams will be presenting their findings, helping narrow the search. “In the past year or two it’s become apparent there are three or four sites that are promising,” says van Ommen.
Each site is on a “dome” – peaks of ice that have remained particularly high above the land mass. Those are the most promising locations, says van Ommen. “If you think of a big mound of butter on your table on a warm day, and it all melts and oozes out, the butter at the highest point in the middle has always been at that point.”
While the conference papers themselves hash out the science of the project, meetings on the sidelines of the conference nut out the politics: which groups will take on which responsibilities, and what the priorities are for the next year or so.
Van Ommen says it could take until about 2020 for the international collaboration to actually get a drill to break ice in their search for the million-year core.
But no amount of modelling will give the scientists certainty. And so some teams are drilling already.
Yuansheng Li, from the Polar Research Institute of China, will present the results of its drilling at a site near its Kunlun Station on Dome A. During the last drilling season they reached 654m. They plan to reach the bedrock, about 3100m deep, by about 2020.
Van Ommen says there is no certainty the Chinese project will find million-year-old ice. But that is far from failure, he said.
Each ice core carries a swathe of information, adding resolution to the picture we have of the past. Small variations in things such as salt content, for example, can give an indication of local wind conditions, which can then tell scientists what the weather was like over Australia.
And that sort of information forms the basis of one of the other big targets for ice core science in the coming years: the 2000-year array.
Where the million-year-ice-core project aims to tell scientists what happened on the largest climatic timescales, the 2000-year array aims to draw the most detailed picture possible of the past two millennia.
That project is about gathering as many ice cores as possible, and painstakingly combining all the data into one picture.
“If you want to build up a good network of past climate information, you need ice cores from as many locations as you can to build up a spatial picture.”
There are about a hundred ice cores from Antarctica, but most of them only go back a few decades. Going back 2000 years, van Ommen says there’s probably about a dozen ice cores that can be used.
“That’s giving us a baseline for what we’re doing to climate now,” says van Ommen.
“We’re using that information to tell us things like how frequent droughts are in the past two thousand years. What’s the natural range of change and how have we departed from that? Are we prepared?”"

The temperature dropped to an overnight minimum of 27.7C at 8.45am Wednesday, just before the 6am cut-off for overnight temperatures.
It broke a previous record for the warmest overnight minimum of 26.5C, which was set on March 13, 2013.
However the daytime maximum of 38.9C fell short of the March record of 41.5C, set in 1940.
Sydney has also been unseasonably warm, with a record-breaking 31 days in a row above 26C. Canberra has had a daily maximum temperature of more than 30C for every day of March so far.
Alain Baillie, forecaster with the Bureau of Meteorology in Melbourne, said the uncomfortable night was the result of a low-intensity heatwave, which has hovered over south-eastern Australia for the past week.
That has been interrupted by a cool change in Melbourne, which saw the temperature drop from an expected high of 29.6C at 6am on Wednesday to 25.5C at 10am. The forecast maximum is 33C, but Baillie said it was possible that would not be reached.
The cool change did not reach the north of the state, where a severe heatwave has seen Mildura, 540km north of Melbourne, suffer maximum temperatures of more than 40C for the past four days.
Mildura has not had a daily maximum temperature below 36.7C since March began.
The forecast is for Melbourne to return to normal early autumn temperatures in the mid-to-high 20s for the rest of the week, with the exception of Friday, when it is expected to reach 33C.
The warm March temperatures follow a record-breaking heatwave in south-eastern Australia in December, which saw record high minimum overnight temperatures set in many areas of Victoria, Tasmania, eastern South Australia and southern New South Wales.
Last year was the hottest year on record with global average temperatures 0.75C higher than the long-term average, smashing the previous record of global temperatures 0.57C higher than average set in 2015. A forecast issued by the UK Met Office in January suggested that 2016 could break that record again.
Professor Will Steffan, from the Climate Council, said the heatwaves seen in south-eastern Australia “have the fingerprints of climate change all over them”.
“Without serious action on climate change, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Canberra could all experience a doubling or tripling of days over 35C by 2070,” Steffan said.
“But Australia’s emissions continue to go up in the absence of a credible plan to meet Australia’s commitments in Paris.
“We need a rapid transition away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy if we are to protect Australians from worsening heat.”"

In the wake of the Paris climate agreement last December, everyone wants advice from the Greenhouse Gas Management Institute (GHGMI) – Gillenwater’s non-profit organization based in Washington, DC – on how to step up the developing world’s capacity for counting carbon.
The institute offers online courses in greenhouse gas monitoring to practitioners around the globe, and since the Paris agreement was reached, business has been brisk. “We’re excited,” he says. “There’s a window here to make something permanent happen.”
The work of these new, green accountants may not sound very sexy – calling them “accountants” conjures up the old image of bespectacled bean counters pushing oversized calculator buttons with the back of a pencil. But this new breed of accountant is, in essence, the overseer of the planet’s new rescue mission. They are responsible for tracking not income and expenses, but factory emissions and carbon-offset credits. They are now doing everything from calculating the environmental footprint of international companies like Wal-Mart, to monitoring the carbon stored in the Amazon rainforest, to checking that China’s power plants are really emitting what the government says they are. 
The Paris agreement mandates that every nation make a commitment for its ‘nationally determined contributions’ of greenhouse gases. These have a startling array of baselines and target types. According to documents submitted before the conference, the oil-rich United Arab Emirates promises to bump up its clean energy contributions a hundredfold by 2021; South Sudan aims to plant 20 million trees; the tiny Cook Islands in the Pacific Ocean aim for an impressive 81% reduction in emissions by 2030. Mozambique has made its promise in tons of carbon rather than as a percentage of emissions; Malaysia’s target is given in terms of greenhouse gas intensity. Practically the only thing these promises have in common is a need – often a brand new need – to be able to monitor, report, and verify emissions. 
“It’s really a transformation. It’s huge,” says Gillenwater. “Before it was basically the rich countries doing the reporting; the developing countries were doing very summary, little reports every five or six years. Now, all countries need to be reporting full data using the most up-to-date technical analyses.” 
This is a big ask. But GHGMI and others are stepping up to the challenge. 
The job of assessing a country’s emissions is heinously complicated. “It’s not like the mindless carbon calculators that people have on their iPhones to calculate their carbon footprint,” says Gillenwater. 
On the most basic level, it is simply a matter of knowing how much fossil fuel is being burned by power plants and cars, and how much land is being used for forestry, crops, and livestock. But the devil, of course, is in the details. In the United States, a team of federal workers, mostly within the Environmental Protection Agency, works the equivalent of a handful of full-time jobs to take stock of greenhouse gas sources and sinks, says Gillenwater. The draft US inventory for 1990-2014, released this February, is 546 pages long and includes more than 50 source categories from cement production to landfills. 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) wrote the bible for totting up national emissions But, like the Bible, it is long, there is plenty of room for interpretation, and a need to parse finer details. 
The IPCC guidelines form a kind of “five-volume, hundreds-and-hundreds-and-hundreds of pages cookbook” for accountants to pick and choose methodologies and equations relevant to their country, says Gillenwater. For instance, should a nation’s accountants estimate greenhouse gas emissions from transport based on how much fuel is burned, or based on how far the cars are driving? And is the type of catalytic converters being used important to the result? (Answer: It depends.)
The IPCC also specifies such things as where emissions should count; if you dig up oil in Canada, for example, the emissions from the digging count for Canada, but the burning of the oil counts for whichever nation imported it. The guidelines also offer default values for such things as how much biomass is stored in the landscape of a given ecosystem, from tropical moist deciduous forest to boreal tundra woodlands. There are countless different equations and methodologies for crunching the numbers. Just within forestry, for example, there are ways of accounting for the effects of flooding, drainage, timber exports, and forest fires.
Much of the data needed for such accounting is supported by national statistics. Most countries keep track of their coal mining and wheat production, for example, for economic reasons, and that can be plugged in to some emissions calculations. But other things are more difficult to sort out. There may be no existing records of the production of fluorinated gases from the semiconductor industry, for example, as many of the chemical cocktails used by that industry are proprietary. “You really have to get on the phone, company by company,” says Gillenwater.
The GHGMI offers correspondence diplomas in emissions monitoring, each involving about 200 hours of online coursework, along with a special ‘Paris Agreement Training Package’. Since its founding in 2007, the institute has had about 3,000 people from around the world take its courses; about 60 people are currently signed up for full diplomas.
The center was born from Gillenwater’s work with the United Nations, where he trained an elite group of about 100 inspectors who audited national emissions numbers for the 1992 Kyoto Protocol. Gillenwater saw a need for lower-level practitioners – such as corporate consultants and carbon-offset market dealers – to gain the same expertise. Now there is a focus on international government workers who need to get their countries up to speed.
The GHGMI’s alumni already span about 150 nations. Among them are people like Adama Moute, who helps to count biomass for Cameroon’s Ministry of Forests. “Cameroon does not have a system in place for accounting its national emissions,” Moute says, although it does have concrete plans for improving monitoring. Moute was one of 30 students at a GHGMI five-day intensive course at the National Forestry School in Mbalmayo, Cameroon last September. “I learned so many things but the most important was the practice exercises,” he says, for data collection and analysis. 
Other programs are operating in concert. The US Agency for International Development (USAID), for example, has contracted the Virginia-based company ICF International to train Asian governments how to sustainably reduce emissions. Joshua Forgotson, senior technical officer for that program based out of Bangkok, says half a dozen countries have been sending representatives to training sessions for the past five years, including in-person classes based on GHGMI coursework. Now, he says, the Paris agreement has given many of these Asian countries the incentive they need to really invest in emissions tracking. “Lack of data is a serious issue. Population stats, fuel consumption, crops statistics – you wouldn’t expect countries in this part of the world to have had these things in their old data collection,” says Forgotson. It’s a new requirement. Paris has changed things.” 
But challenges remain. 
Even the US and Europe, where emissions reporting has been established for decades, there are still things like methane leaks from the fracking industry that people don’t have a good handle on. “People argue about 10 times of magnitude over that,” Gillenwater says. 
Philip Fearnside, an ecologist at the National Institute for Research in the Amazon (INPA) in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil – one of the countries that has done a lot to calculate its biomass and the emissions saved through prevented deforestation – argues that the IPCC guidelines don’t properly account for methane emissions from tropical hydropower dams. Research still needs to fill in the holes so the accountants know what numbers to use in their bookkeeping. 
Jerry Seager, chief program officer for Verified Carbon Standard, a registry for carbon credits, notes that things can get complicated. If you have a lot of cook stoves and diesel trucks, for example, the greenhouse effect of the emitted black carbon can be hard to quantify. “You don’t know if it’s going to fall on a glacier, for example,” he says. And in agriculture, emissions from fertilizers can depend heavily on how waterlogged the soils are.
A more flexible strategy, a willingness to accept nonbinding commitments, and smart leadership by the French all helped secure a climate deal in Paris. The real work lies ahead, but Paris created a strong, if long overdue, foundation on which to begin building a carbon-free future.
But in general, Seager adds, these are small details compared to the big picture. The challenge, he says, is not to boost the precision and accuracy of national inventories to this level of fine detail, but rather to make sure that a reasonable accounting can be done “efficiently and cost effectively”.
Groups including the United Nations are now trying to organize funding schemes to provide money and guidance to developing nations to help them build up their emissions tracking capacity. That means not just training people, but also helping to make sure that the right people are speaking to each other. For example, government employees need to forge connections with universities where researchers are collecting relevant data, and all those involved need to be using compatible methodologies. Sometimes the sticking point is simply whether someone has enough time built into his or her job to do this kind of work. “You could train people with IPCC guidelines till you’re blue in the face and you won’t improve inventories,” says Forgotson. “You need people to be compensated for the work, to have it written into their job descriptions.” 
What’s needed, says Seager, is a long-term commitment to helping the developing world with their accounting. “You have to get away from the model of consultant-flies-in, runs-workshop, consultant-flies-out,” he says. Hopefully, says Gillenwater, the Paris agreement will bring the training – and the accounting – up to a higher level."

University of Queensland and Griffith University researchers have developed a “global energy tracker” which predicts average world temperatures could climb 1.5C above pre-industrial levels by 2020.
That forecast, based on new modelling using long-term average projections on economic growth, population growth and energy use per person, points to a 2C rise by 2030.
The UN conference on climate change in Paris last year agreed to a 1.5C rise as the preferred limit to protect vulnerable island states, and a 2C rise as the absolute limit. 
The new modelling is the brainchild of Ben Hankamer from UQ’s institute for molecular bioscience and Liam Wagner from Griffith University’s department of accounting, finance and economics, whose work was published in the journal Plos One on Thursday.
It is the first model to include energy use per person – which has more than doubled since 1950 – alongside economic and population growth as a way of predicting carbon emissions and corresponding temperature increases.
The researchers said the earlier than expected advance of global warming revealed by their modelling added a newfound urgency to the switch from fossil fuels to renewables.
Hankamer said: “The more the economy grows, the more energy you use ... the conclusion really is that economists and environmentalists are on the same side and have both come to the same conclusion: we’ve got to act now and we don’t have much time.”
Wagner said the model suggested the surge in energy consumption was not offset by improvements in energy efficiency.
He said energy use per person was on track to rise sixfold by 2050, which had dire implications for temperatures when combined with economic growth of 3.9% a year (the six-decade average) and a world population of 9 billion.
“Massive increases in energy consumption would be necessary to alleviate poverty for the nearly 50% of the world’s population who live on less than $2.50 a day,” Wagner said.
“We have a choice: leave people in poverty and speed towards dangerous global warming through the increased use of fossil fuels, or transition rapidly to renewables.”
Hankamer said: “When you think about statements like ‘coal is good for humanity’ because we’re pulling people out of poverty, it’s just not true”. 
“You would have to burn so much coal in order to get the energy to provide people with a living to get them off $2.50 a day that [temperature rises] would just go through the roof very quickly.”
The researchers suggested switching $500bn in subsidies for fossil fuels worldwide to renewables as a “cost neutral” way to fast-track the energy transition.
Wagner said pulling the rug from out under the fossil fuels industry was a move of “creative destruction” and “more a political issue rather than an economic issue”.
“If we swapped those subsidies globally, of course we could have rapid improvement and deployment of renewables to cover our shift from fossil fuels,” he said.
 “You’re pushing a huge amount of capital into a different sector that requires an enormous amount of growth, so you would actually see a great deal more growth from putting it into renewables than providing it for fossil fuels.”
Hankamer said the fact that about 80% of the world’s energy was for fuel, and only 20% for electricity, meant “we don’t have any easy solutions”.
“If we want to do this, we need to do things like solar fuels, or think about how we do battery technologies and fully transition to electric,” he said.
“The things that are going to be hard to replace are aviation fuels and things for heavy machinery and probably shipping.
“We can do electric cars for short runs but those things are going to be really hard to switch.”"

He has urged voters to stand up for policies of the future, including over climate change, the National Broadband Network, renewable energy and Gonski education funding.
Windsor asked for the help of people inside and outside the electorate, characterising the deputy prime minister as a man of the last century, one of a “small group of right-wingers” including Tony Abbott and Eric Abetz, who were placing a “handbrake” on the future.
It’s not about sending Barnaby Joyce a message,” Windsor said. 
“It’s about winning the seat. I am serious ... and I’ll need the help of as many people as I can get from both within and outside the electorate,” Windsor said. 
“One thing that can happen here, though, is that people can demonstrate if they’re serious about their own futures, they can send an enormous message to this place and fight the political machines that are going to move in on this in an attempt to grind me up. 
“They might grind me up but if people are serious and it’s a challenge to the electorate and the people who live there, if you are serious, you’ve got a choice. If you are not, I would vote Joyce.”
In an hour long press conference in Canberra, Windsor faced questions regarding the sale of part of his Werris Creek family farm to Whitehaven coal for more than $4.6m - given he was opposing the $1.2bn Shenhua coalmine. 
He said legal advice suggested that Whitehaven, which owned the underground resources, had the right to mine on the land and the case would simply end up in the land and environment court.
He said the Werris Creek mine was a very different situation to the the Watermark mine proposed on the Liverpool Plains, due to the water resources under the Plains and the highly fertile black soil above.
The Werris Creek mine, he said, was on an old quarry, on “crap country, the type of land that should be mined”.
Windsor ended months of speculation by announcing his decision, first on ABC Tamworth and then in Canberra. 
Joyce had already held a press conference in New England to preempt the announcement. He told the ABC that Windsor was part of the “Labor Green independent alliance”.
“It’s a democracy and I welcome any person and there will be a number of independent candidates, Mr Windsor’s one and that’s his choice,” Joyce said. 
“There will be the Greens. I think overwhelmingly, people see Mr Windsor’s political journey as one where it started as an independent but ended up as a member of the Labor/Green/independent alliance. 
“That’s his prerogative. I’ve been overwhelmed by the support that I’m getting. So if that’s the battle we have then I look forward to it.”
While Joyce may be favourite, it presents a headache to the newly elevated Nationals leader, who is usually required to campaign across the country for other members. The competition in New England will tie him closer to home.
Joyce holds the seat on a notional margin (after electoral redistributions) of 19.9%. In 2010 at his last election, Windsor won 61.9% of first preference votes.
Windsor first held the balance of power in the NSW parliament and sided with the Liberal state government of Nick Greiner. 
He first the federal seat of New England in the 2001 election as an independent and held it for 12 years. In 2010, he had joined fellow independents Rob Oakeshott and Andrew Wilkie to back Julia Gillard’s minority Labor government. 
He retired in 2013 citing health issues.
Windsor said if he held the balance of power in parliament again, he would not formally support one side over the other as he did in 2010. He said the parliament could continue as normal.
“My leaning would be to being absolutely independent,” he said.
Windsor also said he would not be directing preferences, which he considered an “insult” to voters, even though it is highly likely that, if he wins, that he will do so on the back of preferences. 
Windsor won't be preferencing anybody. It is an ""insult"" to voters, can't tell them where to direct preferences.
Windsor: ""We need across the nation to stand up and demand things that are about the future."" #NBN, #climatechange, #Gonski, water.
“The electorate I live in, the electorate I love, the electorate I’ve worked for over many years, I see things stalling,” he told reporters.
“I’m not prepared to see regional people, people in the electorate of New England, treated as second-class citizens with their education of their kids, the Gonski [reforms], with their telecommunications ... in relation to climate change.”
Windsor criticised Joyce for doing “absolutely nothing” for the Murray-Darling basin plan and accused Joyce of ignoring climate change in the agricultural white paper.
“We’ve got a current member who thinks renewable energy is a bit of a joke,” he said.
Windsor told reporters the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, had been talking about the future a lot but had been “handbraked” on many issues.
“It is this small group of right-wingers of which Barnaby Joyce is one, Tony Abbott, [Eric] Abetz, you all know who they are, that have a handbrake on progress.”"

While the mass of children, their parents, chaperones and local activists lined up in the rain on Wednesday, trying to get in to watch the proceedings, Judge Thomas Coffin of the US district court in Eugene, Oregon, questioned the lawyers on the government’s claim that the case should be thrown out.
At issue is whether the 21 teenagers, the oldest of which is 19, have standing in the case – including whether they have or will suffer specific injuries that can be reasonably traced to government actions affecting climate change and whether the court is able to remedy those injuries.
Coffin did not issue an immediate ruling on Wednesday whether the case, Juliana et al v United States et al, will be allowed to go forward, though the plaintiffs said they expected a decision to take one to two months
If it does, the plaintiffs, brought by the environmental group Our Children’s Trust, will ask the court to hold the government responsible for violating the children’s constitutional rights to life, liberty, property and equal protection under the law as well as to benefit from the public trust, which they argue includes the atmosphere.
“What we have is not just a failure to act,” said Julia Olson, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs, after the hearing. “The government is doing everything to fuel this problem.” She pointed to the permitting of oil and gas drilling and the export of fossil fuels, including the recently approved Jordan Cove Liquefied Natural Gas terminal in Coos Bay, Oregon, which the complaint says “enhances the cumulative danger” caused by the government’s actions.
The case is part of a larger group of cases being brought across the country by Our Children’s Trust and others challenging the federal and state governments by seeking damages from climate change-related harms or citing a violation of the public trust doctrine, through which the governments owns resources in trust for public use.
Our Children’s Trust attorney Andrea Rodgers, who was not involved in Wednesday’s hearing but was in town to observe, said they had cases in every state. Rodgers had challenged the state of Washington in a similar case in 2011.
If successful, the case in Eugene would require the government to create an inventory of US carbon dioxide emissions and create “an enforceable national remedial plan to phase out fossil fuel emissions and draw down excess atmospheric CO2 so as to stabilize the climate system and protect the vital resources on which Plaintiffs now and will depend,” according to the complaint, originally filed in August.
But reaching that stage appeared unlikely. At the hearing, Coffin said he found these requested actions “troublesome” as it would require the court overseeing the actions of a number of federal agencies and potentially eroding the balance of power between government branches.
It was also not clear whether specific harm could be linked between climate change and the children. Quinn Sorenson, an attorney representing the energy industry, which intervened in the case on the government’s behalf, said the suit was an example of “archetypal generalized grievance”.
“Any person on the planet could bring a related claim based on anything in any district,” he said.
But the hundreds of children spilling down the steps outside felt otherwise. Forty middle school students from Portland’s Sunnyside Environmental School had gathered at 6am for the two-hour drive down to Eugene to watch the legal proceedings, teacher Asa Gervich said, explaining they had been studying social and environmental justice issues in class and had learned about the case from a local activist.
With the other plaintiffs and former Nasa climate scientist turned activist James Hansen lined up behind her, lead plaintiff Kelsey Cascadia Rose Juliana, 19, spoke enthusiastically to the crowd after the hearing. “Government, who do you work for– industry or us?” she said to cheers.
 “By allowing a spike in the planet’s temperature, the government is violating our rights,” said Alex Loznak, 19, who said in the complaint that his family’s farm near the proposed site of the Jordan Cove project could be threatened by increased drought and wildfire from climate change.
“The adults just haven’t done their job, so this is the kids taking over,” Hansen said.
In some ways, these cases might be ahead of their time. Jessica Wentz, associate director of Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said it’s still uncertain whether harm arising from climate change is enough to give legal standing to a plaintiff and that until there are “clear legal statutes to challenge” in court, climate change action will probably need to be left as a political matter.
Wentz, who is not involved in the Eugene case, said she likes the plaintiff’s legal arguments, “but from the perspective of a lawyer I’m skeptical it can go forward”. She thought arguing a violation of the public trust, which is usually a matter of state law, would be particularly troublesome and said the constitutional claims of rights violations are new but still doubtful to work.
“But,” she said, “I appreciate the creativity and novelty.”"

Pastureland is dwindling rapidly as the country is beset by a cycle of drought and harsh winter that is killing off livestock in droves.
“The summer ends early now and the fall is short and dry. Then there’s the long winter,” said Daashka, a 19-year-old herder who uses just one name and lives in the central Ulziit region.
The family’s herd, mostly sheep and goats, has shrunk from about 1,000 animals to 600, Daashka said, leaning against the motorbike on an exposed patch of dirt that, in other years, would have been covered by the roots of grass and other vegetation.
Mongolia is experiencing a natural disaster called a dzud. The phenomenon, unique to the country, usually occurs after a summer drought is followed by heavy winter snowfall that makes already scarce pastures inaccessible to livestock. 
In the past, the country experienced widespread dzud about once in a decade, but they have recently been occurring every few years. Experts say the rising frequency is due to a combination of climate change and human activity, which has increased the size of herds to levels the grasslands cannot sustain.
With temperatures dipping below -40C (-40F) in the evenings and extreme cold expected until April, Daashka’s family saved enough money to buy feed, which they hope will keep their herd alive until the spring. 
Other nomads have not been so fortunate. 
Half a mile away, about 100 dead goats and sheep were piled up among the rocks. The family was elsewhere with what remained of their herd, leaving one goat clinging to life near the relative warmth of a yurt, the traditional tent dwelling with a coal-burning heater inside.
Mongolia’s foreign ministry last month asked for aid to help deal with the dzud. It estimated that about $4.4m (£3.09m) is required for emergency vehicles, warm clothes, medicine and food to assist herders, in addition to hay, animal feed and vaccinations to keep livestock alive.
But the government has stopped short of declaring a state of emergency, which is required before some international agencies can allocate funding for emergency relief. 
Impassable roads covered with thick snow and ice are making it difficult for aid workers to reach herders. More than 400,000 people in the northern and western parts of the country are at risk, with millions of livestock facing starvation in the weeks and months ahead, the Red Cross said in an appeal for funds last week. 
“Global warming is causing about 50% of the problems and local forces cause the other 50%,” said Purevjav Gomboluudev, head of climate research at Mongolia’s information and research institute of meteorology, hydrology and environment. 
About half of Mongolia’s 3 million people rely on livestock production. But with oversupply, prices have plunged on animal products such as milk, wool, meat and camel hair. 
Each sheep or goat – the most common livestock – is worth about $30. A cow is worth $250-500, depending on meat quality. A camel is worth about $500, and a horse $200-250, according to the Asian Development Bank (ADB). 
“Consequently, there is an incentive to increase animal numbers, leading to the colossal numbers we see today, at over 50 million head of livestock, which degrades the precious pasturelands,” said Robert Schoellhammer, country director for the ADB.
The trend has been devastating when combined with climate change.
The average temperature in Mongolia has increased by 2.1C since 1940, more than double the rise of average global temperatures, according to the UN Environment Programme. In its 2014 global climate risk index (pdf), the advocacy group German Watch ranked Mongolia the eighth most vulnerable country to direct economic losses from weather-related events.
According to a government report, 70% of pastoral land has been degraded, with less variety of vegetation. The intensification of dry conditions has increased the frequency of forest fires, which cut total forest area by 0.46% annually. 
As more pasture is absorbed into the vast Gobi desert, the ancient herding lifestyle is disappearing with it. Paradoxically, the more their way of life is put at risk, the more herders engage in practices that put it in danger.
“Most herder families want to increase their herd so they can increase their income,” said Uranchimeg, a herder in Bayankhongor province who attended university in Russia in the 1980s but chose the fresh air and open spaces of a nomad’s life over taking a job in a city. 
“That is making things more challenging for everyone,” she said, looking out across the barren, snow-covered landscape."

The dead fish could easily fill 14 Olympic-sized swimming pools, said Jose Miguel Burgos, the head of the government’s Sernapesca fisheries body. 
Unusually high ocean temperatures, due in large part to the El Niño weather phenomenon, have fuelled the algal bloom that has affected 37 of the nearly 415 salmon farms operating in southern Chile. Most of the farms are in ocean enclosures or estuaries. 
“Temperatures are 2 to 4C above average for this time of the year, there’s a lot of sunlight, a lack of rain and very mild winds, all of which are conditions for the micro algae to appear,” said Burgos. 
El Niño leads to hotter sea temperatures in the west Pacific Ocean, which means more rain falls on South America and less in Australia and south-east Asia. But for Liesbeth van der Meer, who heads the Oceana environmental group in Chile, run-off from neighbouring livestock creates concentrations of nitrogen that when mixed with the above-normal temperatures, create the ideal scenario for the algae to grow. 
Salmon farms near the southern city of Puerto Montt and the Chiloé island have borne the brunt of the toxic algal bloom. 
Producers Marine Harvest, Australis Seafoods, Compania Pesquera Camanchaca, Blumar, Multiexport Foods, Cermaq Group AS and Empresas AquaChile have all seen some of their salmon farms affected, according to data provided by the Economy Ministry and company filings with Chile’s SVS securities regulator. 
“The loss is likely equivalent to somewhere between 15 and 20% of Chile’s total production for the year ... the forecast for 2016 was around 750,000 to 760,000 tonnes but now that’s reduced to around 650,000 tonnes,” said Burgos. 
The 100,000 tonnes in lost production, which includes Atlantic salmon, Coho and trout, is equivalent to some $800m in exports, he added. 
Chile, the second largest salmon producer after Norway, last year exported $4.5bn of farmed salmon, on 800,000 tonnes of shipments. 
Additionally, the situation will likely lead to job losses in the sector, according to industry group SalmonChile. 
Cutting their losses, producers convert fish that can be saved into fishmeal, while the fish killed by the algal bloom are not destined for human consumption, the group added. 
The latest blow to the local industry comes as Chile’s salmon farmers are using record levels of antibiotics to treat a virulent and pervasive bacteria, driving away some US retailers."

The shared vision unveiled by Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau ahead of a meeting at the White House commits the two countries to a range of actions to shore up the historic climate agreement reached in Paris last December.
The two leaders committed to rally G20 countries behind the accord, promote North American carbon markets, cap emissions from hundreds of thousands of existing oil and gas wells, and protect indigenous communities in a region which is warming beyond the point of no return, according to a statement from the White House.
The initiative announced on Thursday brings the US a big step closer to meeting its own Paris target by committing for the first time to cut emissions of methane - a powerful greenhouse gas responsible for about a quarter of warming - from existing oil and gas wells.
The biggest news however might be the final break with the policies of their predecessors who obstructed global efforts to fight climate change. In his seven years in the White House, Barack Obama has steadily transformed the US into a climate leader on the international level.
“The two leaders regard the Paris agreement as a turning point in global efforts to combat climate change and anchor economic growth in clean development,” the White House said in a statement. “They resolve that the United States and Canada must and will play a leadership role internationally in the low carbon global economy over the coming decades, including through science-based steps to protect the Arctic and its peoples.”
With Thursday’s announcement, Obama appeared to be passing the baton of climate leadership to Trudeau. Trudeau, just months into his prime ministership, has made clear he wants Canada to play a similar leadership role at home and on the global stage, White House officials told a conference call with reporters on Thursday.
“President Obama sees prime minister Trudeau as a really strong partner on these issues,” the officials said. “This is a very important moment along the way and we expect that co-operation to continue in the future.”
Under the initiative, the US and Canada will work to ratify the Paris agreement as soon as possible, lending an important symbolic boost to prospects for bringing the Paris agreement into force as soon as possible after the 22 April signing ceremony. The agreement must be ratified by at least 55 countries representing 55% of global emissions. 
Obama and Trudeau also said the leaders would move quickly to finalise their long-term emissions reductions strategies discussed at Paris, unveiling a plan by the end of 2016, and that they would lobby other major G20 industrialised countries to do the same.
An early opportunity for such lobbying comes later this year when Canada and the US will bring in Mexico to the new North American partnership on climate.
The White House statement also suggested the two leaders would try to consolidate existing regional carbon markets, in line with other provisions in the Paris agreement for encouraging the transition to a clean energy economy.
Turning closer to home, the initiative also takes a big step to curbing a powerful climate pollutant in methane, whose emissions rose rapidly with the boom in oil and gas production across much of the US and Canada.
The two countries committed to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45% below 2012 levels by 2025 - in line with previous proposed rules from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Canada’s major energy-producing province of Alberta.
On Thursday, the EPA raised the bar even farther, pledging to draft rules to cut methane from existing oil and gas wells - which had been a key demand for campaign groups. 
“We are going to have to tackle emissions from existing sources,” Gina McCarthy, the EPA administrator, told a conference call with reporters. “It has become clear that it is time for the EPA to regulate existing sources from the oil and gas sector.”
The commitment won widespread praise from environmental campaign groups who noted that tackling methane was one of the most effective ways of reducing US and Canadian emissions overall.
The US and Canada are both among the top five global emitters of methane.
“Acting fast to cut methane pollution from oil and gas operations is one of the single most important steps we can take to slow temperature rise and protect the climate,” Abigail Dillen, EarthJustice climate campaigner, said in a statement. “We applaud the president for redoubling his commitment to US climate action.”
On the Arctic, the two countries said they would convene a high-level summit next August to try and keep pace with the record temperatures, sea ice loss, permafrost thaws and wildfires, that are creating dangerous and irreversible impacts in the polar region - but also contributing to changing weather patterns and sea-level rise globally.
“There is a real need just to do more science about the speed with which the melting is occurring and what the modelling of the implications are for that,” said Angela Anderson, who directs the climate and energy programme for the Union of Concerned Scientists. “There is a lot of science to be done to really understand how what is happening in the Arctic is going to affect all of us.”
Environmentalists immediately demanded an end to Arctic drilling, and pressed Trudeau to declare a halt to pipeline projects from Alberta tar sands.
The US-Canada partnership came as data from the US science agency, Noaa, showed that atmospheric CO2 levels had jumped by the highest amount on record last year."

Fossil fuel burning and a strong El Niño weather pattern pushed CO2 levels 3.05 parts per million (ppm) on a year earlier to 402.6 ppm, as measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said on Wednesday.
“Carbon dioxide levels are increasing faster than they have in hundreds of thousands of years,” said Pieter Tans, lead scientist at Noaa’s Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network. “It’s explosive compared to natural processes.”
The big jump in CO2 broke a record held since 1998, also a powerful El Niño year.
Drought and erratic rainfall caused less carbon to be stored by parched forests and drylands, on top of the effect of fossil fuel emissions, Noaa said.
CO2 levels in the air have increased over 40% since 1880, as industry ramped up emissions. The build-up of those gases traps heat, which warm the planet and stoke extreme weather. Last year was the hottest year on record, according to multiple weather agencies.
The last time the Earth experienced such a sustained CO2 rise was between 11,000 and 17,000 years ago, in which period CO2 jumped by 80ppm. Today’s rate is 200 times faster, said Tans.
Scientists at the remote Hawaii site have plotted global CO2 levels since 1958, in what is known as the Keeling Curve."

Marco Rubio, the Florida senator fighting strongly on home ground as he sought to revive his presidential campaign, was asked: “Will you acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus of climate change?”
Rubio said: “Sure, the climate is changing … There was never a time when the climate was not changing.”
But Rubio then said flooding in south Florida was caused by the fact that it was built on a swamp. He favored mitigation measures, he said.
“As far as a law that we can pass in Washington that can change the weather?” he asked. “There’s no such thing.” 
Rubio then moved on to a familiar theme, decrying the Obama-era Environmental Protection Agency, emissions regulations and “the war on coal”.
“These laws that people are asking us to pass will do nothing for the environment and hurt the economy,” Rubio said.
The debate continued, Ohio governor John Kasich saying that “I do believe we contribute to climate change” but adding: “You can have strong environmental policy at the same time as you have strong economic growth.”
The question and the candidates’ responses may not have much impact on the race going forward, including the Florida primary on Tuesday.
A poll from Quinnipiac University last month found that 7% of Democrats rate climate change as the most important issue in determining which candidate they support for the party’s presidential nominee.
But when Republicans were asked the same question, the results were so low (less than 1%) that Quinnipiac simply reported climate change issues with “–” in the results summary.
In response to the exchanges on the Republican stage, the leader in the Democratic nomination race, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, tweeted a reference to a familiar GOP campaign line: “Republican candidates deny climate change because they’re ‘not scientists’.” 
The line was not actually used in the debate."

The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change produces the world’s most authoritative statements on the nature of climate change, its impacts, and how to adapt to and mitigate it. To do that, it combines a suite of climate models.
That process would be hampered by the CSIRO’s recent decision to shift resources away from climate modelling and monitoring, Karl Taylor, of the program for climate model diagnosis and intercomparison at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the US, told a Senate committee hearing on Friday.
“The CSIRO model ... has been involved in all of these international modelling activities that have contributed immensely to the IPCC’s understanding of climate change, and that would be cut dramatically,” he said.
The cuts would also make it hard for the government to achieve the best results for Australia at international negotiations.
“When the government prepares to go to the conferences annually where they discuss climate change policy – and negotiate, as they did in Paris this last year – they need advice,” he said.
“And I think cutting the efforts at the CSIRO will undermine the government’s ability to really represent its own self-interest at those negotiations because they would lose the advice of the experts there.”
Paul Durack, also from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, said it did not make sense to cut from work on understanding climate change in order to shift towards work on adaptation and mitigation.
He said the IPCC process demonstrated the problem with that logic. In that process, the IPCC publishes three chapters or “working groups”. The first is on the physical basis of climate change. The other two, which focus on the impacts and how to mitigate and adapt to them, are published later, and rely on the information published in the first chapter.
“The way it occurs very much highlights the dependence between these different working groups and the requirement to actually have physical information about the climate system,” Durack said. “You can’t do these things independently and they’re very much dependent on one another.”
David Karoly, from the University of Melbourne, told the committee the decision would be wasting millions of dollars of investment in expertise.
“My estimate is it is of the order of 1,000 person years of experience or more,” he said. “And that’s at least $100m of investment. And it appears to be thrown away or put into a rubbish bin.”
Snow Barlow, from the University of Melbourne, works on climate change adaptation and mitigation. He told the committee it was a mistake to take resources away from monitoring and modelling climate change to focus on adaptation and mitigation: “It’s a catastrophic failure in public policy.” 
In a hearing on Wednesday, the same committee heard the CSIRO’s international reputation had already been “trashed” by the announced cuts, and a new science body was needed.
Earlier, a report by the Climate Council said the cuts would breach Australia’s obligations under the recent Paris climate change agreement.
The CSIRO’s chief executive, Larry Marshall, said in a radio interview last month the reaction to his planned cuts was more like religion than science, and compared climate science with the oil lobby in the 1970s. He later apologised for the reference to religion."

But they have no idea what university courses are going to cost in the future or even whether they will still be offered under the Coalition’s yet-to-be-announced policy.
Universities are begging for policy certainty. The government has offered none – fuelling speculation that the Abbott government’s 20% spending cut and the resultant increase in the cost of degrees will remain when the policy is finally unveiled, maybe in the budget, or maybe during the election campaign. Labor has promised a net increase in funding, $2.5bn over the first four years and $13.8bn over the next decade. It says this means degrees should be cheaper.
Thousands of women are pregnant right now and don’t know what paid maternity leave they will be entitled to. Last December the Turnbull government tweaked the Abbott government’s already drastically revised paid parental leave policy – but it is still proposing arrangements that would cut the entitlements of mothers who get maternity leave from their employers as well as from the state, for some by $10,000 or more. The changes are supposed to come into effect in July. They have not yet been presented in legislation. Labor opposes them. Those same families are probably pretty interested to know what childcare subsidies they’ll be entitled to. That government policy – also heavily revised – is also in Senate limbo.
Hundreds of thousands of people are planning for their retirement right now. They don’t know whether the Coalition will push ahead with plans to gradually increase the pension age to 70 – still officially policy, but rejected by the Senate. And they don’t know what changes the Coalition will make to superannuation. Best guess is a reduction in the caps on contributions, but it’s still a guess. Labor will reduce tax breaks on the superannuation earnings of the wealthiest retirees.
Most Australians rely on public hospitals in a medical emergency but their future is also unclear. State governments, and now the Australian Medical Association, are warning that the $57b in cuts in Abbott’s first budget are about to create a funding “crisis”, a crisis that will mean patients wait longer for treatment and some services will have to close. As Guardian Australia revealed in February, Turnbull is in talks with premiers to offer some additional money to tide the system over while deeper changes are negotiated. But it remains unclear whether they can do a deal.
Many Australians are also concerned about climate change, but as things stand neither major party has a detailed climate policy that could meet Australia’s international greenhouse gas reduction commitments. Labor has a vague commitment to reintroduce an emissions trading scheme and reach 50% renewable energy. The Coalition continues to insist, contrary to most expert opinion, that its Direct Action policy is fit for purpose.
Political parties have always saved policies to be unveiled with great fanfare during election campaigns. But for the third election in a row the government is being led by a different prime minister than the one the public elected the last time, leaving policies and political direction uncertain. 
And that uncertainty is exacerbated by the $10b in former Abbott government policies gathering dust somewhere outside the Senate chamber – zombie policies still technically the government’s live options and still calculated into the figuring of the federal budget, but politically dead.
But these policies, critical one way or the other to the everyday lives of most Australians, are not what is causing the government to push the emergency button on Australia’s constitutional provisions to break deadlocks between the houses of parliament by calling a double dissolution election. The Turnbull government does not cite them as examples of “Senate obstruction”.
In fact it’s not clear what the government wants to do with them, whether they will live or die when the government finally gets around to telling us its priorities. And even if they live, they are not lined up as double dissolution triggers that can then be passed at a joint sitting of the houses of parliament after a double dissolution poll. And for most of them there now isn’t enough time to get into that line-up.
They are far more important to most Australians than the industrial relations laws that will be used to justify any double dissolution poll, the ones Malcolm Turnbull talked up on Sydney radio on Friday. But they seem to have been left off the list because the government hasn’t figured out its direction.
Meanwhile, the political “debate” seems fixated on the date of the budget and the related question of the date of the election, and whether it will be a double dissolution, parsing the prime minister’s language and reading deep meaning into the fact that there has been a May 3 booking in the parliament’s main function hall. Aha, the sleuths cried, that must be a post-budget function after a budget brought down a week earlier than usual, which would mean an early election, which would mean ... well, we don’t know what that means in the case of a re-elected Turnbull government because we’re still in the dark about policies – far more so than is usual for this point in the electoral cycle.
Instead of asking questions or demanding answers about what the government wants to do if it is re-elected, we are stuck on the question of when the election itself will be held.
Sure, we’d all like to know the date of the election. And yes, it would be a significant and risky tactical decision by Malcolm Turnbull to hold a double dissolution and a long campaign.
But the “what” questions and the “why” questions are far more important than the “when” question, especially since the answer to the “when” question can only possibly vary by a couple of months either way.
We have been obsessing about the wrong question."

It’s also causing the ocean waters to rise. In fact, water rise is one of the clearest signatures of a warming world. The questions we want to answer are, how much will sea levels rise, and how fast? 
The answers to this have large implications on what societies should do. It isn’t just coastal communities that will be affected. While there are approximately 150 million people worldwide that live within 3 feet of today’s water levels, because of the interconnected economies and societies, ocean rise will affect us all.
The prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recently published a series of sea level rise papers.
One paper covers the Antarctic ice sheet, and the authors look back in time at the world’ largest ice sheet. The authors use three tools to advance our knowledge of the ice. First, they use a very accurate calculation approach to quantify how the ice sheet interacts with the atmosphere. Second, they incorporate potential ice fractures into their analysis. Finally, they use information about changes to oxygen isotopes to improve their calculations. What they find is that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide will soon be at levels not encountered since the Miocene period (23 million to 5 million years ago). They also find that newer computer calculations do a better job of quantifying changes to the ice sheet.
A second paper published by Roelof Rietbroek and colleagues looked at the sources of sea level rise. They wanted to know how much of the current rise is from water that is warming and expanding, how much is from melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, how much is from melting glaciers, how much is from shifting continents, etc. 
This study measured the mass of water in various regions of the Earth through special gravity-sensitive satellites that orbit the Earth. They conclude that the sea level rise from thermal expansion is higher than previously reported. The also find the water rise from melting of ice is consistent with measurements taken of ice melt around the world. Finally, they find that while the global oceans are rising steadily, there is tremendous regional variation so that some areas have very fast ocean water rise while others have slow ocean rise (or even ocean drop). 
The third paper by Robert Kopp and his colleagues uses statistics to find the relationship between temperature and sea level for the Common Era. They find that the sea level rise accelerated in the early 19th century and the rate of water rise in the last century is likely higher than it has been in 2,700 years. Their findings were in good agreement with those of the most recent IPCC report.
The final part of the foursome was authored by Matthias Mengel and his colleagues. That study uses historical information on sea level and climate change projections to make predictions about where ocean levels will be in the next 100 years or so. This study tries to separate how much sea level will rise because of various contributors, such as thermal expansion, melting mountain glaciers, the Greenland ice sheet, and the Antarctic ice sheet. 
When projecting into the future, the authors have to make decisions about how much more heat-trapping gases will be emitted into the atmosphere. To make the projections, the authors use the IPCC scenarios (RCP2.6, 4.5, and 8.5). A comparison between the new paper and the IPCC projections show excellent agreement. 
It appears that, unless societies make significant changes, we will see approximately 3 feet of sea level rise by 2100. That may not sound like a lot, but it’s enough to cause enormous economic and societal problems. What’s great about this paper is they also include a discussion on the limitations of their work. For instance, they state that their method cannot deal with processes that are independent of the warming rate (such as a sudden collapse of an ice sheet). 
I wrote to the lead author to get his summary of the study and learn more about its importance. He told me, 
Human influence on climate pushed the world’s oceans, glaciers and ice sheets away from their equilibrium so that they now all contribute to rising seas. As they are inert, a lot of their contribution will only be realized in the future. There is knowledge on how much they will add to sea level before they reach a new equilibrium, a process that can take thousands of years. We now combined this knowledge on long-term sea level rise with past observations into a small and efficient model. This allows us to make probabilistic projections of sea level rise incorporating the main uncertainties. 
While stopping sea level rise within this century is unlikely, our projections confirm that the world can still choose from a spectrum of sea level futures. It mainly depends on how much heat-trapping gases will be emitted. To avoid the risk of 1.3 meter higher seas in 2100, mankind needs to cut its carbon emissions. 
As we saw in my last post, the actual costs to human society will depend not only on the rate and amount of seal level rise, but on how we humans adapt to this new reality."

The initiative, which roams from Arctic protection to plugging methane emissions from oil wells and pipelines to decarbonisation of the US and Canadian economies in the second half of this century, cements a new climate change partnership between neighbours after 15 years of pulling in opposite directions.
It signals once again that Obama intends to keep pushing hard on climate change in what was supposed to be the lame duck phase of his presidency.
And it improves the prospects of rallying countries to ratify the Paris climate agreement when it opens for signing on 22 April. The agreement needs to be signed by 55 countries responsible for 55% of global emissions to come into force.
“The United States and Canada are fully united in combatting climate change,” Obama told a press conference at the White House on Thursday. “We are focusing on making sure the Paris agreement is fully implemented.”
Trudeau agreed, describing the Paris agreement as an action plan, and the US and Canadian leaders as key players in ensuring its success.
“That agreement is both a symbolic declaration of global cooperation on climate change as well a practical guide for growing our economies in a responsible and sustainable way,” he told the press conference. “We know that our international partners expect and, indeed, need leadership from us on this issue.”
The US and Canada were committed to signing the Paris agreement as soon as possible, Trudeau went on, a move which could help the United Nations reach its goal of ratifying the agreement in 2016, before Obama leaves the White House.
Thursday’s declaration marks the first time in 15 years that US and Canadian leaders have been in sync on climate change.
George Bush pulled the US out of the Kyoto climate accords when he came to the White House in 2001. Stephen Harper, the Canadian prime minister, also withdrew from the agreement and pushed aggressively the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which would have ramped up production from the carbon-heavy Alberta tar sands.
The two leaders began their relationship with some friction, with Obama cancelling the Keystone XL project  last November, days after Trudeau took office. The Canadian leader did not protest, however.
But with the declaration of a shared vision on climate change, Trudeau is now cast as Obama’s heir – in terms of pressing for global actions.
 Once Obama leaves the White House, it will fall to Trudeau to maintain continuity of a North American climate plan should a Democrat takes the White House, or to help to keep the flame alive in the event a Republican wins the election and follows through on threats to overturn Obama’s policies. 
The concern for Obama’s long-term climate legacy was inherent in Thursday’s declaration, with the US and Canada pledging to deliver plans for decarbonising the post-2050 economy by the end of 2016. 
The neighbours also pledged to lobby other G20 countries to produce their long-term climate plans – a move which could boost international confidence that the Paris agreement is indeed putting the global economy on a low-carbon trajectory.
That could help box in Obama’s successor – from either party – making it difficult to overturn the Paris agreement without the risk of antagonising an important ally and neighbour.
The joint commitment to reduce methane emissions by up to 45% from 2012 by 2025 will have the most immediate impact in helping the US and Canada to hit the emissions reductions targets they offered at Paris.
Emissions from methane – a far more powerful climate pollutant than carbon dioxide – rose rapidly with the boom in fracking.
Campaigners had been pressing Obama to cut methane from existing oil and gas wells – not just future projects, warning the US had no chance of hitting its Paris targets without such measures.
Gina McCarthy, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, agreed, telling a White House conference call with reporters: “We are going to have to tackle emissions from existing sources.”
The campaign group Earthworks, which has used infrared imaging to map methane leaks, said the new methane initiative was a significant step-up in Obama’s efforts to cap emissions from oil and gas wells. “With today’s announcement, President Obama starts to get serious,” the organisation said in a statement.
But it was on the global arena, where Obama played a critical role in nudging countries towards the Paris agreement, where the renewed US-Canadian partnership on climate change could have the most impact.
“On the big looming issues on the horizon, it is vital for us to work together because the more aligned we are, the more we can shape the international agenda to meet these challenges,” Obama said. “Climate change is such an example.”
He suggested that having Trudeau on side with the two leaders’ shared liberal values would help drive solutions to help poor countries deal with climate change. 
“If we don’t agree, if we’re not aggressive, if we’re not far-sighted, if we don’t pool our resources around the research and development and clean energy agenda that’s required to solve this problem, then other countries won’t step up and it won’t get solved,” Obama said. “That’s a really important effort.” 
The two leaders also pledged to secure a deal cutting emissions from commercial air planes through the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which is based in Montreal. 
They committed to raise fuel economy standards for delivery trucks and buses, and to work to get more solar and wind power on the US and Canadian electrical grids.
On the Arctic, the two leaders pledged to take “science-based standards” into account for any future oil and gas drilling. 
Noting the rapid disappearance of the sea ice cover, the US and Canada also committed to reduce the use of heavy fuel oil, set up low-impact shipping lanes, and work for sustainable commercial fishing. 
Obama and Trudeau will have another chance to work on Arctic protections at a White House summit in the autumn and, as officials made clear in a conference call, he has no intention of reining back on climate activism any time soon. 
The president will seek out climate partnerships with other countries in the remaining months, John Morton, an adviser, told reporters. “I can tell you we are working actively on ensuring that in final year of the administration we see continued progress bilaterally and multilaterally,” he told a conference call."

Asked if he accepted the reality of human-induced climate change, Rubio, a US senator for Florida and running for his party’s presidential nomination, said: “If the climate is changing, one of the reasons is because the climate has always been changing.”
Speaking at the Republication presidential debate in Miami on Thursday, Rubio said the flooding experienced by Miami is due to the the city “largely built on land that was once a swamp”.
“And number two, because if there is higher sea levels or whatever it may be happening, we do need to deal with that through mitigation,” he told the CNN event. 
“And I have long supported mitigation efforts. But as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there’s no such thing.”
Rubio, who is badly trailing Donald Trump in the race to be the Republication nominee, said Barack Obama’s clean power plan, aimed at slashing greenhouse gas emissions, would “devastate” the American economy, all while other countries continued to pump out planet-warming gases.
“If you took the gift list of all of these groups that are asking us to pass these laws and did every single one of them, there would be no change in our environment,” he said. “Sea level would still rise. All these other things that are happening would continue to go on for a lot of different reasons.
“One, because America is not a planet. It’s a country. And number two, because these other countries like India and China are more than making up in carbon emissions for whatever we could possibly cut.”
Tomas Regalado, the Republican mayor of Miami, has endorsed Rubio but via the debate’s host Jake Tapper he questioned whether the senator accepted the mainstream scientific position on climate change and his commitment to combat the problem.
Rubio said Regalado is a “great mayor and a good friend” but said that any laws to reduce emissions would drive up power bills in Miami and cause the mayor a political headache.
Philip Levine, mayor of neighboring Miami Beach, said Rubio was “100% using the language of a climate change denier” and has overlooked the escalating problem of sea level increases for south Florida.
Miami Beach has already spent $100m on new sea defenses to curb the regular flooding of its western half. Sea levels are expected to rise in south-east Florida by six to 10 inches by 2030, with ever increasing levels throughout the century unless greenhouse gases are severely cut. These increases risk inundating large areas of the region, with 2.4 million people living within 4ft of the local high tide line.
“Unfortunately, Senator Rubio went to his usual talking points, fed to him by his donors in the sugar and energy industry,” said Levine. “According to him, America shouldn’t be a leader in the greatest challenge of our generation. If he were around during World War II, he’d want us to sit on the sidelines and leave Britain to its fate.
“He made the amazing statement that America is not a planet. I’m sure he had to go onto Wikipedia to get that information. He said he’s all for making cities resilient but he’s done absolutely nothing as a US senator for us, he’s never come to Miami Beach to meet with us. The only time he comes down here is for a fundraiser.”
Levine said he was more impressed by Ohio governor John Kasich, who said he accepts the science of climate change, but that he was disappointed that the other candidates, Trump and Ted Cruz, weren’t also asked about climate change.
A coalition of 21 Florida mayors wrote to the networks broadcasting the two Miami debates this week – the Democratic debate was on Wednesday – to demand that questions were put over sea level rise and climate change.
The US experienced its warmest year on record in 2015, with the lower 48 states emerging from the warmest winter on record this year. The leading Republican presidential candidates have pledged to scrap Obama’s plan to limit emissions from power plants and have criticized the landmark Paris climate deal, which committed 196 nations, including the US, to cut emissions."

Hundreds of objectors immediately surfaced through the web, many of them trolls. If I were out to count the percentage of violently angry people among the internet population, it would be easier than fishing with grenades.
Several of these choleric experts correctly accused me of not being a scientist. My only field of expertise is the use and abuse of language; but a trained ear for empty rhetoric is what tells me that most of them aren’t scientists, either. People who call carbon dioxide “carbon” know even less about science than I do. Their anger, I suspect, is driven by belief rather than knowledge.
Let’s be fair and say that people can harbour an irrational belief and still be rational in other respects. That’s what I would like my critics to think about me, so I strive to think the same about them; and anyway, it takes that kind of generosity to fit the historic facts. Sir Isaac Newton was rational about celestial mechanics, but quite nutty about numerology. The great poet Yeats believed in the Mystic Rose. For all I know, in order to act like Leonardo DiCaprio, you have to believe you are “fighting climate change” when you fly by private jet.
It was while receiving his Oscar that DiCaprio told the world about its duty to fight climate change. He reminded me of the radical heyday when Vanessa Redgrave used to celebrate an extra few votes for her faction in the Workers Revolutionary Party by announcing that they had “smashed capitalism”. She is still the great lyrical actress of her time, but talent can be dopey.
The vaulting eloquence with which Chris Rock hosted the Oscars proved again that satirical comedy is at its strongest when anger is expressed through reason. But there could have been several African-American actors among the nominees if the TV series The People v OJ Simpson had been eligible. Personally, however, I would have given the best actor award to John Travolta, who is monumentally good in that same show, which he helped to produce.
Travolta is a small nation, big enough to have its own air force. Let’s not forget, however, that he nurses an irrational belief powerful enough to curdle your brains along with his own. Travolta the Scientologist not only believes the Earth was colonised by refugees from outer space, he made a movie about it, Battlefield Earth, that was so dire the small crowds who saw it would rush the exits as if the ocean were rising and capitalism had been smashed."

The unprecedented leap led scientists, usually wary of highlighting a single month’s temperature, to label the new record a “shocker” and warn of a “climate emergency”.
The Nasa data shows the average global surface temperature in February was 1.35C warmer than the average temperature for the month between 1951-1980, a far bigger margin than ever seen before. The previous record, set just one month earlier in January, was 1.15C above the long-term average for that month.
“Nasa dropped a bombshell of a climate report,” said Jeff Masters and Bob Henson, who analysed the data on the Weather Underground website. “February dispensed with the one-month-old record by a full 0.21C – an extraordinary margin to beat a monthly world temperature record by.”
“This result is a true shocker, and yet another reminder of the incessant long-term rise in global temperature resulting from human-produced greenhouse gases,” said Masters and Henson. “We are now hurtling at a frightening pace toward the globally agreed maximum of 2C warming over pre-industrial levels.”
The UN climate summit in Paris in December confirmed 2C as the danger limit for global warming which should not be passed. But it also agreed agreed to “pursue efforts” to limit warming to 1.5C, a target now looking highly optimistic.
Climate change is usually assessed over years and decades, and 2015 shattered the record set in 2014 for the hottest year seen, in data stretching back to 1850. The UK Met Office also expects 2016 to set a new record, meaning the global temperature record will have been broken for three years in a row.
One of the world’s three key temperature records is kept by Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (Giss) and its director Prof Gavin Schmidt reacted to the February Giss temperature measurements with a simple “wow”. He tweeted: 
Normally I don't comment on individual months (too much weather, not enough climate), but last month was special.https://t.co/nALWMlNDcP
“We are in a kind of climate emergency now,” said Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, from the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research in Germany. He told Fairfax Media: “This is really quite stunning ... it’s completely unprecedented.”
“This is a very worrying result,” said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, noting that each of the last five months globally have been hotter than any month preceding them. 
“These results suggest that we may be even closer than we realised to breaching the [2C] limit. We have used up all of our room for manoeuvre. If we delay any longer strong cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, it looks like global mean surface temperature is likely to exceed the level beyond which the impacts of climate change are likely to be very dangerous.”
A major El Niño event, the biggest since 1998, is boosting global temperatures, but scientists are agreed that global warming driven by humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions is by far the largest factor in the astonishing run of temperature records.
Prof Adam Scaife, at the UK Met Office, said the very low levels of Arctic ice were also helping to raise temperatures: “There has been record low ice in the Arctic for two months running and that releases a lot of heat.” He said the Met Office had forecast a record-breaking 2016 in December: “It is not as if you can’t see these things coming.” 
Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the University of Reading, UK, said: “It is a pretty big jump between January and February, although this data from Nasa is only the first set of global temperature data. We will need to see what the figures from NOAA and the Met Office say. It is in line with our expectations that due to the continuing effect of greenhouse gas emissions, combined with the effects of El Niño on top, 2016 is likely to beat 2015 as the warmest year on record.”
The record for an annual increase of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, was also demolished in 2015. 
Fossil fuel-burning and the strong El Niño pushed CO2 levels up by 3.05 parts per million (ppm) to 402.6 ppm compared to 2014. “CO2 levels are increasing faster than they have in hundreds of thousands of years,” said Pieter Tans, lead scientist at Noaa’s Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network. “It’s explosive compared to natural processes.”

A bipartisan group of 21 Florida mayors wrote to the debate moderators to argue it would be “unconscionable for these issues of grave concern for the people of Florida [climate change and sea level rise] to not be addressed.” The moderators of both debates listened, and asked the candidates questions about climate change – including by far the most substantive climate question posed to the Republican candidates thus far.
The climate discussion in the Democratic debate can be viewed in the video below.
In her response (transcript available here), Hillary Clinton said that she would proceed with implementing President Obama’s Clean Power Plan, and his executive actions on climate change. She supported the use of natural gas as a “bridge fuel,” arguing:
We need to implement all of the president’s executive actions and quickly move to make a bridge from coal to natural gas to clean energy
Clinton also argued that Sanders would delay implementation of the Clean Power Plan – a statement to which Sanders reacted incredulously, and which PolitiFact rated false. However, Sanders does want to tweak the Clean Power Plan to make it tougher (for example, to incentivize renewables instead of natural gas, extend renewable tax credits to 2030, and to regulate methane emissions); it’s true that these changes could significantly delay implementation of the plan, but they would also strengthen it.
In his response to the climate question, Sanders noted that in 2013 he introduced what he described as “the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the United States.” Sanders also called for a carbon tax and regulations to end fracking in the United States.
There’s a debate amongst climate scientists about whether natural gas is a viable ‘bridge fuel’ between fossil fuels and renewables. At best, natural gas releases half the carbon pollution as burning coal. However, the amount of methane leakage during natural gas extraction is a big question mark that could erase most of its climate benefits. 
The other issue is that power plants have long lifespans, so choosing to install natural gas instead of a lower-carbon power source locks in its emissions for decades. Research by Zeke Hausfather and others has shown that for these reasons, using natural gas as a ‘bridge fuel’ could make it easier to keep global warming at less than 3°C above pre-industrial temperatures, but harder to stay below the internationally-accepted 2°C target.
Essentially, natural gas replacing coal power is an improvement. But if a coal power plant can be replaced by renewables or other low-carbon sources, that’s a much better solution. If fracking makes natural gas so cheap that it crowds out deployment of renewables, it could do more harm than good. It’s a difficult question worthy of debate, although the balance of evidence suggests that we should rely on natural gas as little as possible (fracking also causes other environmental problems).
It’s a debate that in large part can be solved by putting a price on carbon emissions, like the carbon tax that Sanders proposed. That would make energy prices reflect their true costs, including the costs of the damages they cause via climate change. A carbon price would make coal expensive, and could potentially make renewables cheaper than natural gas. 
Marco Rubio gave the worst answer to a climate question in either debate.
It was similar to the boilerplate response he gave in a previous Republican presidential debate. For example, he claimed that President Obama’s Clean Power Plan and every climate policy proposed by Democrats would cripple the economy, kill jobs, and make energy bill soar. However, studies have shown that carbon pollution pricing would have a minimal, potentially even modestly beneficial impact on the economy if the revenue is returned to taxpayers. Sanders’ proposal takes this approach, refunding 60% of the revenue generated from the carbon tax directly back to Americans.
On the other hand, failing to take action to slow climate change would have immense costs, which is why Florida’s mayors are so concerned. According to a study by scientists at Climate Central, 
2120 square miles of land lie less than 3 feet above the high tide line in Florida. Some $145 billion in property value, and 300,000 homes, sit on that land. These figures jump to $544 billion and 1.4 million homes on 4660 square miles of land under 6 feet. Every inch of sea level rise within these ranges will be more damaging than the previous inch.
Rubio also argued that America can’t slow global warming by itself, placing the blame on China and India. However, virtually every country in the world agreed to cut carbon pollution as a result of the Paris climate negotiations, including the United States, China, and India. In fact, while Rubio made comments about President Obama waging a war on coal, in reality China has been waging a fierce war on coal, and winning. 
Implementing dog-whistle politics to appeal to those in climate denial, Rubio used the popular ‘climate always changes’ logical fallacy, followed by the argument that,
If there is higher sea levels, or whatever it may be happening, we do need to deal with that through mitigation, and I have long supported mitigation efforts. But as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there is no such thing.
Of course, the only way we can mitigate the rising, accelerating sea levels that are causing flooding in Florida is by cutting the carbon pollution that’s causing it. That’s going to require the kinds of policies that Rubio opposes.
Fortunately, John Kasich followed Rubio with the most sensible climate-related comments made by a top 2016 Republican presidential candidate.
Kasich noted that humans contribute to climate change, and that we can cut carbon pollution in an economically beneficial way. He had his own climate denial dog whistle, saying we don’t know how much humans contribute to climate change (in reality, we know humans are the dominant cause of global warming over the past 50–100 years). However, Kasich is one of the few leading Republicans, and the party’s only remaining presidential candidate who supports taking some sort of action to solve the problem. He concluded his answer with an important argument directly contradicting Rubio’s economic alarmism:
The fact is that you can have a strong environmental policy at the same time that you have strong economic growth; they are not inconsistent with one another.
Donald Trump and Ted Cruz weren’t asked about climate change in this debate, but Trump has repeatedly called it a hoax, and Cruz is in denial. Rubio repeated his standard argument that we shouldn’t do anything to cut carbon pollution because it would be too expensive, and in practice, denying the solutions isn’t much better than denying the problem. Kasich refuted that argument by noting that good policies can result in a clean environment and strong economy.
Clinton and Sanders had a more substantive debate on the issue, raising specific policies about fracking, natural gas as a bridge fuel, and carbon pollution pricing. Consistent with their stances on most issues, Clinton took what she views as a more pragmatic approach (maintain and protect existing climate policies), while Sanders promoted a more idealistic view of strengthening current policies and introducing stricter new ones.
One of these candidates will be the next President of the United States. After more than a decade of foot-dragging and international obstructionism, America has finally become a leader on climate change, including reaching a critical agreement China, and recently joining forces with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau. 
In the wake of the landmark international climate agreement in Paris, we’re finally moving in the right direction to tackle climate change. The choice of the next American president will be a critical one in either maintaining this momentum, or in steering the world toward climate destabilization."

Biodiesel made from palm oil emits more than three times as much and soybean oil around twice as much, when the crops’ effects on land use are considered, the research by the Ecofys consultancy for the European commission found.
Europe’s aim of sourcing 10% of its transport fuel to “renewables” by 2020 – mostly biodiesel - will foster crop cultivation on 6.7m hectares of forests and grasslands, the paper says. When the loss of trees is factored in, such ‘first generation biofuels’ would generate around nearly 1bn tones of CO2 equivalent.
 “We need to rapidly accelerate the phase-out of first generation biofuels,” said Jos Dings, director of the green thinktank Transport and Environment (T&amp;E). “Biodiesel is a big elephant in the room. It accounts for three quarters of the biofuel we use in the EU and this report pinpoints that its emissions are much worse than fossil fuels.”
The study says that an EU decision to cap the contribution that first generation biofuels can make to the transport target at 7% will save more than 500m tonnes of CO2 – around the same amount that Europe’s cars emit each year.
But T&amp;E still estimates that, far from slowing climate change, the EU’s transport goals could add approximately 2 gigatonnes of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. On an annual basis, that would account for around 2-3% of the continent’s total carbon output.
“It is just astonishing,” Dings said.
The report’s publication was delayed for several months and its release online last week – it has since been taken down – followed an access to documents request by T&amp;E.
“It was finished ages ago but DG Ener [the commission’s energy wing] never wanted to publish it,” one EU source told the Guardian.
Internally, it was argued that the study’s publication could damage international relations with palm oil-producing states. But the official said it was “obvious” that the paper was sat on because its results were inconvenient. 
The report examines the effect of land use change on biofuel emissions. Felling a forest for a palm oil plantation has clear consequences for increasing emissions. But when existing cropland is used for more profitable energy crops, the indirect effect can be similar; new land is carved out of forests or grasslands to grow replacement food staples.
For every megajoule of energy used, the study finds that palm oil emits 231g of CO2 equivalent and soybean oil 150g/CO2e, far higher than the UN climate science panel’s estimates for any fossil fuel.
Past commission estimates pegging palm oil’s CO2 emissions at less than half that figure were criticised by industry for being exaggerated. But it now seems that they significantly under-estimated biodiesel’s climate impact by not counting carbon emissions from peatlands drained to make way for oil plantations, experts say.
“Because of the link to deforestation, peat loss to create biofuels is not just worse than fossil fuel diesels, but potentially a lot worse,” said Chris Malins, the head of the ICCT fuels programme, and an adviser on the report. “There is no case for continuing to support virgin vegetable oil-based biodiesel on climate grounds.”
 Malins said that paper found that ethanol could still deliver emissions savings but had significant indirect effects on emissions, albeit “less fatal” than biodiesel’s.
However, Robert Wright, the secretary general of the ethanol industry association ePURE said the study showed that ethanol had low land use impacts, strongly contributed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and had little effect on food prices.
“We urge European policy-makers to reflect on these findings and identify ways to promote and incentivise the use of biofuels that have high greenhouse gas savings and low land use change impacts, such as European ethanol,” he said.
Dings, an influential figure among Brussels policy-makers, said that while his organisation did not support ethanol, their priority was to push for a phase out of biodiesel.
The European Biodiesel Board was not able to comment on this story at the time of writing."

Population growth in coastal areas over the course of this century, particularly in vulnerable areas of Florida, is likely to collide with the reality of rising seas caused by melting glaciers and thermal expansion as the planet warms.
Research led by the University of Georgia has provided the first glimpse of how demographic changes in America will place greater numbers of people at the frontline of sea level rises. In a severe scenario involving a 6ft (1.8m) rise in sea levels by 2100, fuelled by the gradual collapse of the Antarctic ice sheets, a total of 13.1 million people would risk seeing their homes inundated.
A less dramatic sea level rise of 0.9m, still considered at the upper end of IPCC projections, would risk land occupied by 4.2 million people being claimed by the sea. 
The projections are based on demographic changes in the US population over this century, as well as areas forecast by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as being at risk of inundation. 
Florida would bear the brunt of this potential population displacement, with more than six million people affected by a 1.8m sea rise by 2100. In Miami alone, nearly two million people would either have to be protected or displaced under this worst-case scenario.
Other areas where significant numbers of people would be at risk include Long Island in New York; New Orleans; Charleston, South Carolina and San Mateo, California.
Should these people need to move away from the coast, rather than be protected by new sea defenses, the population movement would be on a scale similar to the Great Migration, a long-term shift of African Americans from southern to northern states during the 20th century. 
“Sea level rise is widely recognized as one of the most likely and socially disruptive consequences of future climate change,” states the study, published in Nature Climate Change. 
“Florida accounts for nearly half of the total at-risk population. Whereas other south-eastern states have substantially fewer people at risk, states such as Georgia, South Carolina and Louisiana have over 10% of future coastal populations at risk under the 1.8m scenario. 
“The south-eastern US alone represents nearly 70% of the entire projected populations at risk, suggesting the impacts of sea level rise will be highly regionalised in nature.”
The paper warns that finding new land for displaced people will be “problematic” as well as expensive, citing relocations of Alaskan villages that have cost as much as an estimated $1m per resident.
“We knew that the number of affected people had been underestimated until now, but the extent of that underestimation surprised us,” said Mathew Hauer, coauthor and demographer at the University of Georgia. 
“Adaption will be an option, such as deploying critical infrastructure, raising buildings and roads. If we don’t do anything, the migration will mimic the Great Migration from the south to the north, over similar timescales. 
“At the moment, roads and hospitals are typically being built in areas without these future projections in mind. In the future, this will need to be a factor in where we deploy roads, hospitals, people and so on.”
The global sea level has risen, on average, by around 8in (20cm) since 1880, according to Nasa. This increase is uneven around the world, however, and predicting future sea level rise is complicated by a range of factors. 
The rate of disintegration of the polar ice sheets is a key variable, as are changes to influences such as the Gulf Stream, which may be causing water to “pile up” along America’s east coast.
Sea levels are rising several times faster than they have in the past 2,800 years. German researchers recently warned that the rate of increase from thermal expansion – in which the ocean expands as it warms – has been underestimated. 
Last month, a Climate Central study found that coastal flooding days have more than doubled in the US since the 1980s. Climate change driven by human activity has been blamed for three-quarters of the flooding events that have occurred over the past decade."

But it’s also the focus of an experiment by the US space agency, Nasa, which is teaming up with the Peru-based International Potato Centre (CIP) to see if potatoes could be grown in such harsh conditions.
“The Martian is completely possible,” says astrobiologist Julio Valdivia-Silva, the principal scientist working on the experiment in Peru.
Valdivia-Silva says the technology is growing at an “exponential” rate just as efforts to learn more about Mars are gathering pace.
Valdivia-Silva and his team aim to replicate Mars-like conditions on earth using a dome to create the same atmosphere, and soil consisting of sands brought from the Pampas de la Joya desert, part of the Atacama desert in southern Peru and one of the world’s driest and most nutrient-poor ecosystems.
Why the potato? The resilience of the humble spud combined with its huge number of species, genotypes and varieties means it can be grown from sea level to 4,700 metres above sea level while resisting drought, extreme heat and cold, salinity and UV radiation. It is also pound-for-pound one of the most nutritious staples as it is packed with vitamin C, zinc, iron, proteins and carbohydrates.
But Mars may be a whole new league of inhospitability. Temperatures on the planet vary wildly, between a high of 20C (68F) at its equator in summer to a low of -153C at the poles, according to Nasa . Its atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide, 3% nitrogen and just 0.13% oxygen, which means the potatoes may grow fast but end up undersized. In addition, the dusty planet lacks ground water and there are winds of up to 60mph.
But Jan Kreuze, chief virologist at CIP, believes growing potatoes on Mars is possible. 
“Potatoes may colonise Mars before humans do,” he says. “Right now it’s science fiction … Then you do the science and it becomes a reality.” 
Another challenge is the fact that Mars’ gravity is just one-third that of the Earth. That is one thing for which the experiment cannot test, says Kreuze, but the potato has another advantage over other crop staples in that it grows underground.
CIP, a non-profit organisation, houses more than 4,500 types of potatoes, mostly Peruvian, in its propagation chambers. The centre is the custodian of the world’s largest in vitro gene bank, which contains clonal and seed collections of the tuber. There are so many varieties, some are only known by codes. One of them may just have the genetic makeup to survive on Mars.
One hundred varieties are being used in the Nasa experiment. Of those, 40 are native to the Andes mountains, the birthplace of the potato. Growing in different ecological zones, they can resist abrupt changes in climate and can grow in very dry terrain, explains Kreuze. The other 60 are improved varieties, which are immune to viruses and can survive with little water.
If the experiment is successful, the selected spuds would be cryogenically frozen – another sci-fi movie staple – to prevent them germinating on the long journey to Mars. A one-way trip would take more than nine months. They could be “cultivated by robots” in a controlled dome on Mars in advance of future missions manned by humans, says Valdivia-Silva.
The experiment has two objectives, he says: to find out which vegetable can best cope with climate change, and to identify a vegetable that can provide food for astronauts.
“The potato has colonised every ecosystem on our planet. It is the obvious choice,” he says.
The potato is second to none as a food security crop; it grows fast and produces more calories per unit of energy, land and water than any other crop. If it can grow on Mars, it can grow in the harshest conditions planet Earth can throw at it.
Kreuze says CIP will use the findings to learn how to grow potatoes “as future climates become more extreme”. Climate change is already increasing drought and flooding and making crops more vulnerable to disease and pests, particularly in regions where poverty and malnutrition are already rife.
While extraterrestrial farming for human colonies in space may still be the stuff of silver screen sci-fi, Kreuze says the experiment has a much more down-to-earth priority.
“Our main interest is not growing potatoes on Mars, but here on Earth, mostly in developing countries.”"

So why are real estate companies still doing it?";"Sea-level rise may be the most predictable outcome of climate change. Expanding warmer waters and melting land ice both contribute to flooding – and scientists agree that we are locked into sea-level rise for centuries to come. The question is not if we will retreat from the coast, but when. Still, the rush to develop the coast occurs at a maddening pace.
We now know that 13.1 million people are at risk of flooding along the US coast by the end of this century. A new study published in Nature Climate Change further suggests that massive migration will occur unless protective measures are taken. Since sea-level rise will speed up after the end of the century due to increased glacier and ice sheet melting, the flooding we face in this century is just the tip of the iceberg. 
The problem is particularly severe along our 3,000-mile low-lying sandy barrier island coast extending, with a few breaks, all the way from the South Shore of Long Island to the Mexican border. Along this long barrier island coast, Florida has the longest and most heavily developed shoreline.
In Miami, a city perilously perched atop a very porous limestone, two multibillion-dollar construction projects are under way, despite the fact that parts of the city routinely flood during high tides and that widespread flooding by the rising sea in a few decades is a virtual certainty. No sea walls, levees or dikes can stop the rising waters from flowing through the underlying spongy limestone and into the city. Miami is ultimately doomed. 
A few miles to the north, Fort Lauderdale is undergoing equally intense development and population growth. This city has more beachfront high-rise buildings per mile than any other American beach. According to Katherine Bagley of Inside Climate news “nearly 5,000 apartments or condos are or soon will be under construction” in the city, which already faces routine nuisance flooding. The city’s many canals make Fort Lauderdale all the more vulnerable to rising seas. In light of the wet future in store for the city, increased density is insane. 
 On the other side of the Florida peninsula along the Gulf of Mexico, a Fort Myers Beach developer proposes to build a massive project to include four beachfront hotels, nine restaurants and a 1,500-car parking structure; all to be protected with a soon-to-be-constructed half-mile-long seawall. If you need to build a seawall to protect your construction project, you should not be building at that site. Remember – seawalls destroy beaches.
Two barrier island communities deserve attention as the nation’s most vulnerable to sea level. On the east coast, North Topsail Beach in North Carolina is a narrow, low, rapidly-eroding island segment. In spite of the obvious natural dangers, the town has several immovable high-rises, at least one of which may soon fall in. On the Gulf coast, Dauphin Island, Alabama is an extremely low island that is frequently overwashed by storms, and repeated beach nourishment has done almost nothing to stop erosion. 
Storms have severely damaged the west end of Dauphin Island five times since 1973. While the west end has no high-rises, storms, including hurricanes Katrina and Ike have repeatedly destroyed houses. 
 And, just a few years after Hurricane Sandy flooded much of the area, New Jersey’s Gold Coast (the Hudson waterfront) is experiencing a construction boom. Developers are building numerous high-rise structures, hoping to attract commuters seeking cheaper quarters than those available in nearby New York City. 
They have taken measures to make these structures more resilient, but in this age of certain sea-level rise, it is preposterous to continue to build in areas that were previously inundated by floodwaters and will certainly be inundated in the future. 
The time has passed for such foolish projects. The frequency of super costly “natural” disasters on the coast will only increase if we continue to cram buildings up against the beach and treat storms as urban renewal projects. It is time for a profound new outlook – where we construct smaller, less expensive and perhaps mobile structures and do not replace buildings destroyed and damaged in storms. It is time we prepare to retreat from the rising sea."

In 2014, under the previous vice chancellor, ANU divested from seven resource companies, selling about $16m worth of shares. The move attracted a torrent of criticism in editorials in the Australian financial press, and even the country’s treasurer at the time, Joe Hockey, weighed in, describing ANU as “removed from the reality of what is helping to drive the Australian economy and create more employment”.
The new letter, signed by 450 academics and general staff, commends the university for withstanding that pressure, and calls on it to divest all its holdings in fossil fuel companies, which it estimates to be over $45m.
The university’s vice chancellor responded, welcoming the petition and promising to consider its argument at the next relevant meeting.
A spokesman for 350.org, which helped organise the open letter, said it was the second largest such letter in the world, after one organised at the University of California, which led to a significant divestment by the university in September last year.
When ANU divested from the seven resource companies in 2014, the then vice-chancellor Ian Young said, “We need to be able to put our hand on our heart when we talk to our students and to our alumni and to our researchers and be able to say that we’re confident that the sort of companies that we’re investing in are consistent with the broad themes that drive this university.”
The current vice-chancellor of ANU, physicist and nobel laureate Brian Schmidt, described climate change as “the great challenge for humanity over the next 100 years” and said that to keep warming below 2C, “citizens of the world need to demand it.”
Picking up on that call, the open letter said: “As citizens of this university, we demand the ANU take leadership on this issue. This includes fully breaking ties with the fossil fuel industry – the ANU must divest the rest.”
Fossil Free ANU spokesperson and ANU student Zoe Neumayer said staff wanted to send a strong message to Schmidt.
“This letter sends Prof Schmidt and the ANU Council a message they can’t ignore. ANU staff want their university to move beyond its first step and divest in full from fossil fuels.”
“As Brian Schmidt faces up to his new job, he must make sure ANU faces up to the scale of the climate challenge – and that means divesting from the fossil fuel companies that are holding back progress.”
The campaign was facilitated by 350.org, which has led divestment campaigns around the world.
In September 2015 the University of California divested from coal and tar sands. In November, just ahead of the Paris climate change negotiations, 10 universities in the UK pledged to divest from fossil fuels. Those moves follow others from universities including Syracuse University and Glasgow University, as well as many other organisations around the world.
Schmidt said in response to the petition: “Decisions on investments are matters for the ANU council, of which I am a member. The council has to balance both its fiduciary responsibilities to provide the funds for students and staff needs, such as superannuation payments and student scholarships, with that of socially responsible investments. It is a complex issue, and both the council and I welcome the views of staff and students. The letter will be tabled at council.”"

Responding to former Labour leader Ed Miliband’s call to put the target into law, energy minister Andrea Leadsom told parliament on Monday: “The government believes that we will need to take the step of enshrining the Paris goal for net zero emissions in UK law. The question is not whether but how we do it.”
The UK is already legally bound by the Climate Change Act to reduce emissions 80% by 2050, but a law mandating a 100% cut would mark a dramatic increase in ambition. The final 20% is seen as the most difficult to cut, as it would have to come from sectors such as farming, which are not as easy to decarbonise as power plants.
Miliband, who played a key role in legislating the Climate Change Act and who called for zero emissions to be enshrined in law ahead of the Paris climate summit in December, welcomed Leadsom’s comments.
“It is the right thing to do because the science demands it, it makes economic sense and will build momentum in the fight against climate change,” said Miliband, who had tabled an amendment on zero emissions to the energy bill that won cross-party backing.
“It is essential we build on the success of the Paris agreement and do not squander it, and I hope other countries will now follow the example of the UK.”
The announcement by Leadsom follows months of criticism of the government’s green record by businesses and civil society after a series of cuts to subsidies for renewable energy, the axing of zero carbon homes regulations and a strong push for fracking.
At Paris, nearly 200 countries promised to try to bring global emissions down from peak levels as soon as possible. More significantly, they pledged “to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century”.
Experts say that means getting to “net zero emissions” between 2050 and 2100. The UN’s climate science panel says net zero emissions must happen by 2070 to avoid dangerous warming.
The commitment by ministers today to legislating for such a target comes as a series of climate milestones were passed.
February was abnormally hot by a record amount globally, driven by climate change and El Niño, with scientists saying the anomaly was shocking and showed there is a climate emergency that gives added impetus to the Paris deal. Last year also saw atmospheric concentrations of CO2 jump by the highest amount on record.
Ministers later this year will have to decide whether to accept the recommendation of the Committee on Climate Change, their statutory climate advisers, of a carbon cut of 57% by 2032, the so-called fifth carbon budget. The setting of the fourth carbon budget sparked a political row in 2011, with George Osborne and other ministers opposing it before David Cameron stepped in to agree to the targets.
The Committee on Climate Change concluded in January that the Paris deal, which contained a tougher temperature target than previously agreed, did not merit a change to the proposed fifth carbon budget, a decision branded “desperately disappointing” by green campaigners.
Leadsom said the CCC would be reporting back on the implications of the Paris agreement in the autumn and said that before a zero emissions goal was made law there was “an important set of questions to be answered”."

But it’s now entering a more critical phase than ever before. The mismatch between the conclusions of the Paris agreement in December last year and the failure of Australia’s political establishment to understand what’s going on “out there in the rest of the world” is putting Australia’s entire economy at risk.
When the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, wrested the prime ministership from Tony Abbott in September last year, the international climate community breathed a deep sigh of relief. With the former Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, Abbott was seen as the most egregiously pig-headed climate-change denier in western world had ever thrown up. By contrast, Turnbull had done OK on climate change as a previous leader of the Liberal party, so it was assumed he would do a lot better second time round.
Nothing could be further from the truth. As I discovered on my latest visit, Turnbull has been utterly pusillanimous in pursuing any kind of progressive climate agenda. As part of his “oil on troubled waters” strategy, he apparently decided not to take on Abbott’s climate-denying guerilla fighters, and has offered zero leadership to Australia’s confused and polarised citizenry either before or after Paris.
For instance, he stood idly by as Australia’s world-renowned science agency, the CSIRO, announced it would cut 80% of its climate scientists, effectively ending Australia’s climate research program.
No surprise then that the New South Wales Liberals recently passed a motion, with the support of more than 70% of delegates, calling on the federal government to hold public debates between scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and independent climate scientists. Basically, they are still refusing to accept that the science of climate change is settled, and are fighting an obstinate rearguard action to keep mining and burning as much coal and gas as possible.
You can see why Turnbull might be a bit nervous about confronting such a monumentally ignorant faction in his party. And he may even be reassured that such deniers still hang on elsewhere in the world. There are, after all, still more than 100 Conservative MPs in the UK who do not subscribe to today’s consensus around the science of climate change. And a recent survey conducted by the Center for American Progress found there are still 144 climate-change deniers in the House of Representatives and 38 in the Senate. That means more than six in 10 US citizens are represented by people who think that climate change is a hoax perpetrated either by communists or doped-up greenies.
And that’s before we even start on the horror story that is Donald Trump. My favourite tweet from Trump the Denier is this: “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non–competitive.” Just how many conspiracy theories can one person pack into just one tweet?
So Turnbull is not the only politician having to deal with totally unreasonable flat-earthers. But that’s no excuse. Has he bothered to work out what the real implications of the Paris Agreement look like for Australia?
What he needs to know is that it’s all so much worse (and moving so much faster) than anyone imagined even five years ago. Instead of having decades to do what needs to be done to set the global economy on a genuinely low-carbon trajectory (as in net zero emissions by 2050, which is what Turnbull’s government signed up to in Paris), we now have little more than a decade.
Australia is uniquely vulnerable in this respect. The damage that will be done to the Australian economy as the world decarbonises at speed, leaving billions of dollars stranded in fossil-fuel assets that can no longer be developed, is almost impossible to imagine. And to rub salt into that already inflamed wound, there are few countries that will suffer more from rising average temperatures (as in forest fires, increasingly inhospitable cities, and drought-devastated rural economies) and rising sea levels.
I’m in Australia every year for the Prince of Wales’ business and sustainability program, and I know only too well that this kind of apocalyptic stuff simply doesn’t do it for most Aussies. So now let’s turn it all on its head – as in enabling Turnbull to stiffen his flaccid sinews and seize this whole low-carbon agenda as the massive opportunity it is. For, as it happens, not only is Australia uniquely vulnerable to the consequences of runaway climate change, it’s also extraordinarily well-placed to navigate its way through to the kind of ultra-low-carbon prosperity on which the destiny of all nations now depends.
 In January a blockbuster report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) identified Australia as one of the most significant beneficiaries of this kind of accelerated shift to renewables by 2030, providing significant gains in GDP (up 1.7%) and employment, as well as socioeconomic and other environmental benefits.
As an accompanying article in the Singapore-based Eco-Business newsletter put it: “The study also found that a shift to renewable power could cut water use by more than a quarter in Australia. This is because solar and wind generation uses up to 200 times less water than natural gas or coal.”
 For those aforementioned NSW Liberals: “This would be an important development for Australia, which is experiencing a long-term drought in many parts of the country.”
So my suggestions last week to a group of senior business people convened by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage could not have been simpler: Get on the right page, Mr Turnbull.
You’ll achieve nothing by seeking to placate those whose minds are permanently closed, who think the science of climate change is something you either “believe in” or not, and whose self-interest (as in their links to Australia’s fossil-fuel and extractive industries) is so palpably prominent. Australia’s citizens deserve a lot better than that."

In February, CSIRO chief executive Larry Marshall announced the agency would halve its commitment to climate change modelling and measurement.
In his new role as Australia’s ambassador to the US, Hockey took umbrage at an editorial the newspaper published, titled “Australia turns its back on climate science”.
But in defending Australia’s role, he appears to shine a light on budget cuts he made while treasurer, which are now considered partly to blame for the cuts CSIRO’s chief executive has made.
His first line of defence in the letter is to point out that there continues to be funding for climate science under the National Environmental Science Program, commonly referred to as Nesp.
Hockey created Nesp in his now notorious 2014-2015 budget. But rather than boosting climate science, it was a budget-saving measure. Nesp was created by amalgamating two other programs and cutting $21.7m in the process.
This fact was raised in a recent Senate inquiry, which examined the cuts.
World-leading CSIRO climate scientist John Church told the Senate in most research programs CSIRO is required to match the funding they receive with revenue from external “clients”. But often that client is the government, with money coming from funding programs.
Church said that since CSIRO relied on external funding streams, and the government had shrunk those streams for climate science, it was predictable that CSIRO would move away from conducting climate science research.
“Effectively, at this time we were in a weak position in terms of external earnings,” he said.
In his letter, Hockey also said the Australian Antarctic Division and the Bureau of Meteorology would continue to conduct the sort of work that was being cut at CSIRO.
Let’s look at the Australian Antarctic Division first. The chief scientist of the Australian Antarctic Division, Gwen Fenton, told a Senate inquiry that about a quarter of their programs rely on the CSIRO in some capacity, and that if CSIRO programs were cut, that would affect their research.
Fenton couldn’t quantify the effect, since no details of the cuts have yet been announced. “It is hard to know exactly,” she said. “It is hard to conclude that reducing the number of people overall would not reduce the total capability. It is the capability we need in the program.”
Then Hockey mentioned the Bureau of Meteorology. That’s the bureau that was not told about the cuts more than 24 hours before they were publicly announced. In that hearing, head of the BoM, Rob Vertessy, said there were several joint programs between the two programs and it wasn’t clear yet which would be affected. “I am drawing attention to several areas where we are working together, where we are dependent on CSIRO collaboration, and which could be impacted. There are many areas, and it will depend on which of those areas are actually changed.”
Hockey’s next line was to point out that Australia is “renowned in international climate change forums for contributing a uniquely southern hemisphere perspective”. It is the loss of that very reputation – and indeed capability – that has troubled climate scientists in Australia and abroad.
The CSIRO has revealed it is trying to strike a deal with the UK’s Met Office to move its unique and highly regarded climate model there, where it is unlikely to get the continued focus on southern hemisphere climate science.
In terms of international reputation, Church told the Senate inquiry it was “already trashed”.
Finally, Hockey says “Australia will continue to meet its international climate change obligations and commitments, including those made in the Paris agreement”. Indeed, Australia’s Climate Council – the reincarnation of the formerly government-run Climate Commission, which Hockey and his government axed – declared in a report that the cuts to climate research at the CSIRO were already in breach of that agreement."

The UK Committee on Climate Change (UKCCC) said that cutting emissions that deeply would mirror the Scottish parliament’s existing goal of reducing emissions by 42% by 2020: both targets would outstrip the UK government’s current pledges.
In its annual report to Holyrood, the committee urged it to adopt “stretching” targets to install low carbon heating in 30% of homes by 2030; increase electric vehicle sales to 65% of new car and van sales by 2030, and cut emissions from electricity production from 220 gCO2/kWh to below Scotland’s legislated target of 50 gCO2/kWh, by greatly expanding renewables.
Lord Deben, its chair, said: “There is a lot of positive action already under way in Scotland, driven by both its vibrant renewable sector and its bold policy approaches. This must now be accelerated.”
The UKCCC said Scotland was already very close to achieving that 2020 target, with current cuts at 38% against 1990 levels. The UK government, however, is planning more radical plans than those set by Holyrood by enshrining a zero emissions target required by the Paris climate agreement into UK law.
The UK government is already legally bound to cut emissions by 80% by 2050, but Andrea Leadsom, the UK energy minister, told Westminster on Monday: “The question is not whether but how we do it.”
Environment campaigners welcomed the committee’s proposals but warned that substantial policy changes were needed from the Scottish government, which is pressing ahead with plans to cut air passenger duty in Scotland by at least 50% from April 2018 and continues to heavily invest in roadbuilding.
Campaigners said that plan, outlined in a consultation paper on Monday, was deeply misguided. They pointed to new data from Nasa showing that February’s global temperature had smashed records as the warmest yet recorded, at +1.35C.
It followed cuts in Scottish government funding for climate change reduction measures in its latest budget, said Mike Robinson, from the Stop Climate Chaos Scotland umbrella group of environment groups, anti-poverty charities and civic organisations.
“Air travel has the highest climate emissions per km of any form of transport and emissions from the sector have risen significantly over the past 20 years,” he said.
It would increase emissions by one of the UK’s least-taxed transport sectors after the government in Edinburgh had repeatedly missed its annual emissions reductions targets, mandated by Holyrood’s Climate Change (Scotland) Act. It requires annual cuts of 3% from 2020 onwards.
Jim Densham, also from Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, said ministers would need “strong action and new policies” from ministers in Edinburgh. “The advice from the UKCCC describes a rapid transition away from fossil fuels towards a clean, renewable energy future,” he said. 
“This is a massive opportunity to not only cut emissions but also deliver new jobs in sectors like home insulation and renewable energy across Scotland, improve public health, create investment in new industry and help tackle fuel poverty.”
The UKCCC also recommended that Holyrood amend its remaining annual emissions targets from 2017 to 2020 to take account of changes in EU emissions measurement techniques, introduced after the climate act was written, which had increased overall emissions. 
Those changes had led Scotland to miss its targets. Aileen McLeod, the Scottish climate minister, said despite that, Scotland was second only to Sweden in the scale of its reductions to date. 
“I welcome this new advice from the Committee on Climate Change. Scotland is a world leader in tackling climate change, with our approach being described as ‘exemplary’ by Christiana Figueres, the head of the UN climate body, during her visit to Scotland last week,” McLeod said.
“Looking to the future, I recognise the need to need to maintain our high ambition – especially following the global agreement reached, as we hoped and argued for, in Paris. The committee’s current advice on how best to maintain our high-ambition approach will be taken into account when Scotland’s next batch of targets are set in October.”"

“When I was a kid I used to do trapping in the back,” he said, gesturing towards the back of the small, one-story house that stands elevated on stilts to escape the floods that roll in from the bayou after nearly every storm. “You could walk for a long time. Now, nothing but water.”
The back balcony overlooks a vast expanse of water leading to Terrebonne Bay and, further, the Gulf of Mexico – that now lies in his backyard.
Billiot and his equally sprightly 91-year-old wife, Denecia Naquin, are among the last remaining residents of this island, which has lost 98% of its land and most of its population to coastal erosion and rising sea levels since 1955. The population, which peaked at around 400, is now down to around 85. 
As in other areas of southern Louisiana, the loss of once-vast tracts of marshland and trees has left the island exposed to hurricanes and frequent flooding has stripped the land, made farming impossible and forced residents into an annual ritual of rebuilding.
The couple, like nearly everyone on the island, belong to the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw tribe, and can trace their roots to the early 1800s when Native Americans fleeing forced relocation under the Indian Removal Act first settled the island. The tribe was quickly intertwined with the local French Cajun influence, which can still be heard in the lilting accent of Billiot and Naquin’s generation. 
Billiot recalls going to school in a pirogue, a traditional Cajun boat. His wife once grew vegetables and kept chickens in the backyard. Today, it’s hard to imagine cattle roaming this scraggly, narrow patch of land, as they once did when the island was much larger. 
“If my grandparents would have been here now, they would say ‘Oh, lord’,” imagined Billiot, shaking his head. 
Now, with new federal funding, the Isle de Jean Charles tribe will be part of the first program in the lower 48 states to address an entire community’s resettlement needs due to climate change and increased natural disasters.
“If it passes a hurricane, it’s gonna wash everything away,” said Billiot. “That’s why they want us to move.” His skin is weathered from a life spent on the water, first as an oyster fishermen then as a tugboat captain. The couple is clearly reticent to leave. “We’ll stay here as long as we can,” added Denicia with a polite smile. 
In January the tribe was awarded $52m for resettlement from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as part of its $1bn Natural Disaster Resiliency Competition. The money will fund a new sustainably designed development to provide housing to up to 400 tribe members on a new plot inland. Planning is in the early stages, but officials hope to choose a site likely somewhere north of Houma, the closest city, later this year. 
The project will be watched closely as a testing ground for the resettlement of whole communities – culturally sensitive ones, in particular – as the effects of climate change begin to be felt more acutely along the coasts of North America and indigenous communities in Alaska face similar prospects of disappearing land.
On Isle de Jean Charles, the new funding is being met with a mix of appreciation and apprehension. The tribe has twice before voted against relocation – once in 2002 and again in 2009 – and it is still unclear how many residents will ultimately choose to move (they are not required to leave). But many here have finally become resigned to the fact that in a state pursuing a $50bn Coastal Master Plan to shore up the disappearing coast, their island could be gone within 50 years. 
The project has sparked some to place Isle de Jean Charles tribe the among the country’s first “climate refugees”, a term Chief Albert Paul Naquin, the tribe’s official leader, rejects. “We consider ourselves lucky because we want to put our community together again,” said Naquin, who has been seeking resettlement funding for more than 15 years. “We know that nobody wants to leave, but it’s about staying together.” 
Louisiana has one of the fastest rates of land loss in the country, due to the twin problems of land loss and sea level rise. Since the 1930s, the state has lost nearly 2,000 square miles of land, equivalent to roughly one football field every 45 minutes. 
“The land is sinking for a variety of reasons,” said Alex Kolker, a professor of earth sciences at Tulane University. Natural land loss has been compounded by the thousands of canals dredged by oil and gas companies drilling in the area and levees built along the Mississippi River have stopped the natural process of sediment that would otherwise replenish coastal land. “Climate change is becoming a big issue,” he said, and the increasing rate of sea level rise could soon overtake the rate of land loss, which has historically been greater. 
In the future, a lot of the rest of the world could look like what Louisiana looks like now, Kolker added. 
On Isle de Jean Charles, the storms have made life difficult, if not untenable. Chris Brunet, who lives on the island with his two young children, says he “can’t even count” the number of times he has had to clean layers of mud out of his house following a storm. Long-term mold and mildew problems can persist and Chief Naquin reports that many on the island have health problems as a result. 
“Boyo” Naquin, the son of Denecia and Billiot, reluctantly moved to Houma, about 25 miles north, in 1985 after his house flooded twice in one year. “I didn’t want to go but every time a hurricane would pass through you lose everything you have,” he said. 
Since 1998, Terrebonne Parish has been hit by a presidentially declared disaster every two to three years. This has led to major population shifts within the parish, and some bayou communities have lost 20% or more of their population to towns north of Houma since 2010.
While the state attempts to move forward with its $50bn master plan, there are complicated decisions to be made over where to focus adaptation and restoration efforts, and some communities will inevitably be left out. 
“We are going to be able to save some large areas,” said Kolker, who is on the framework development team for the coastal master plan update, due to come out next year. “One of the tricky questions is deciding which areas to change.” He points to a complicated cost-benefit analysis that takes into account the ecological value of the land and the feasibility of adaptive measures like rebuilding the land. 
Isle de Jean Charles, he says, lies in a particularly difficult area because it is so far from sediment sources in the Mississippi River and Atchafalaya basin that could be brought in to rebuild the land. 
In 2002, the Army Corps of Engineers made changes to the original planned route of the 72-mile Morganza to Gulf Hurricane Protection System due to cost constraints, causing Isle de Jean Charles to become excluded from the protected zone. At the time, the ACE offered resettlement assistance to those on the island, but without unanimous agreement from residents, the offer was ultimately dropped. 
“When your state and your government excludes you from the master plan, you can pretty much say, OK we are going to be the next barrier reef,” said Chantel Comardelle, Tribal Executive Secretary and the granddaughter of Billiot and Denecia Naquin. “At some point you just become a number.”
Some here look to the oil companies for blame, but Isle de Jean Charles residents, like many in coastal Louisiana, also have a fraught relationship with the industry. It is essentially the sole provider of employment to locals – either directly or indirectly through shipbuilding and service industries – but has also greatly exacerbated land erosion by dredging (and often failing to fill in) innumerable canals in the area. 
“You can blame them, but not in total because we do depend on them. We are oil and gas,” said Brunet. 
“I guess its kind of a shame on us that we didn’t think through all the ramifications,” of drilling, reflected Comardelle. “But at that time nobody could have known really known what would happen or that we would be sitting here today having these conversations.” 
Comardelle, 34, has scant memories of growing up on the island. She left as a small child to Houma, where she still lives today with her husband and three children, but still visits the island regularly. 
She says that while she is only a short drive from the island, she and many of her generation still missed out on the tight-knit community life described by her father and grandparents. 
“You could walk from one end of the island to the other and stop and people’s houses to get food and water,” her dad recalled. Others describe the self-sufficiency of previous generations that lived mostly off the land. Today, most of the tribe’s 600 members are scattered around southern Louisiana.
Reversing the mini diaspora of tribe members in southern Louisiana is one of the primary goals of the resettlement project. 
 “We’re getting more and more people that want to move back because those that left, when they were living back here there had no rent, no mortgage. And now, they are living poor and have to have two families living together to make ends meet,” he said. “This is going to put them in a good position to get back on their feet.” 
This was echoed by Katrina Peterson of the Lowlander Center, a non-profit working closely with the tribe on resettlement: “This community not only signed up to be the guinea pig, they also signed up to be the teachers”, she said.
 According to Peterson, project planners will emphasize long-term environmental sustainability, from housing design to land use practices. Even with plans to settle 30 miles inland from where the water stands today, there is recognition that the coastline is a moving target. She says native plants transferred from the island will act as a bulwark against future land erosion and also provide a habitat for the migratory birds and other animals they expect to move northward with the shifting coastline. 
 “Its not going to be just a subdivision, it’s going to be a web of life,” she said, that will echo Native American beliefs of interconnectivity with nature. 
While the project plans are ambitious, mistrust of official intervention still lingers on the island. “I think that might be some of the issue of people being standoffish, like, ‘Well, we’ve heard this before,’” says Comardelle. “Even in the back of my mind, I’m waiting to see the check.”
For now, tribal leaders are making plans to bring as much of the island with them as possible. They have begun to collect seeds and plant cuttings, and are interviewing older community members about what life was like when the island was fully populated. There are even plans to recreate the façade of a long-shuttered general store that was once on the island. 
 “If you ask us, it’s worth saving. But is it possible at this point? I think it is just beyond,” Comardelle said. “We’re trying to replace what has been lost. And we’re trying to pave the way so other communities can have a smoother ride.”"

Last month’s high temperatures – up to 16C (29F) above normal in some parts of the Arctic – flummoxed scientists, and are redefining life in the Arctic, especially for the indigenous people who live close to the land.
In Fort Yukon, an indigenous Gwich’in community eight miles inside the Arctic Circle, the freakishly warm weather is forcing people off the rivers that are their main transport corridors in the winter time. 
“You can’t trust the ice,” said Ed Alexander, Yukon Flats centre coordinator for the University of Alaska at Fairbanks. “This is the warmest winter that we have ever seen up here. We have had less snow. We have had real thin ice. We have had an explosion of growth in the brush clogging up trails and that kind of thing. It makes everything dangerous.”
Other communities downriver lost a number of people this winter when their snowmobiles fell through soft ice – and these were experienced hunters and trappers, he said.
Alexander said he and his wife had a narrow escape when they went out for a Sunday drive on their snowmobile. “I noticed there was water all the way across the river and I went to stop my snow machine and say: ‘Oh maybe we should turn around and go back a different way’.”
By the time he turned around to his wife, Alexander saw the back of the snowmobile was already sinking into snow and soft ice. “We just took off and there was as rooster tail of water coming out 30ft behind us,” he said. “We made it back to shore but that will wake you up.”
Warm is a relative term in Fort Yukon. The community nestled between the Yukon and Porcupine rivers lays claim to the coldest – and hottest – temperatures ever recorded in Alaska.
Temperatures at the start of this week were well within the boundaries of what most of the world would describe as very cold at –6C (20F), but that was still up to 10C (18F) warmer than expected for this time of year. 
“When I was growing up it would warm up from 60 below to 20 below and we would be walking around with T-shirts on,” said Craig Fleener, a Fort Yukon native who advises the governor on climate change. “It’s all a matter of perspective.”
This year, the backwaters were already slushy by early March – so much so that Fort Yukon had to start their dog sled races in the middle of town rather than on the ice. The smell of sap was already coming off the willows, and some plants were budding up, Alexander said.
Winter was almost over – without ever getting cold enough to create the conditions Arctic villagers rely on for their way of life.
In Fort Yukon, many people depend on wood for heating in the winter months.
Come freeze-up, they are out with heavy equipment on the river hauling timber. But without a consistent run of extremely cold days – about two weeks of temperatures approaching -51C (-60F) – the snow never gets hard enough to pack into ramps or roads.

The ice over the river never gets thick enough for heavy equipment, said Dacho Alexander, a local magistrate and Ed’s brother. 
“I normally like to have an ice thickness of between 24 and 36 inches and generally up here we have about 34 to 36 inches,” Dacho Alexander said. The ice this year never made it beyond 20 inches, at the points where he drew core samples. 
“We really need 50-60 below in order for the ice to thicken up. Even if it is a week or two weeks that gives us really good ice thickness. It’s not the same to have two months of 10 below. The ice doesn’t get any thicker.”
January and February obliterated global temperature records, and nowhere more so than in the Arctic which saw some locations 16C (29F) warmer than normal. In late December, temperatures at the North Pole rose to a balmy 0C.
“You can’t overestimate how big the changes in warming we saw in January and February in the Arctic,” James Overland, an Arctic and climate change researcher at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told reporters covering the Arctic science summit in Fairbanks. 
“Not only have we beaten the record, we have beaten it by an unbelievably large amount, when you think of it in relation to how Arctic temperatures changed in the past.”
The Arctic had already been warming twice as fast as anywhere else over the last 30 years but scientists were still taken aback by the February records.
“We would never have expected such a jump in one year,” Overland said. “It sends us into a new temperature place that we have never seen before.”
The record temperatures are already resounding across the Arctic and beyond – melting the sea ice cover, thawing the permafrost and soil, and shaking up the orderly patterns of the jet stream.
 Researchers are already beginning to connect such changes in the jet stream to weather effects in mid-latitudes such as the unseasonable blasts of cold Arctic air known as the polar vortex.
From where Ed Alexander sees it, they had better get moving. “To put it in context: I tell people to imagine what if Los Angeles was 60 [F] degrees warmer than it was supposed to be – because Fort Yukon is 60 degrees warmer than it’s supposed to be. 
“People think the changes up here are invisible … but if it only changes half as much down there as it has changed up here you guys are in for a hell of a lot of trouble.”"

The announcement from Sally Jewell, the interior secretary, to bar drilling across the length of the mid-Atlantic seaboard reverses Obama’s decision just a year ago to open up the east coast to oil and gas exploration, and consolidates his record for environmental protection.
In a conference call with reporters, Jewell said Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida would remain off-limits for drilling until 2022 because of coastal communities’ concerns about risks to their fishing and tourist industries from an oil and gas spill, and warnings from the navy about interference with its systems. 
“We heard from many corners that now is not the time to offer oil and gas leasing off the Atlantic coast,” Jewell said. “When you factor in conflicts with national defense, economic activities such as fishing and tourism, and opposition from many local communities, it simply doesn’t make sense to move forward with lease sales in the coming five years.”
Jewell left open a small possibility for future drilling in the Arctic, saying officials would still consider leases at three locations within the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, and Cook inlet. 
“We know the Arctic is a unique place of critical importance to many – including Alaska Natives who rely on the ocean for subsistence,” Jewell said. “We want to hear from the public to help determine whether these areas are appropriate for future leasing and how we can protect environmental, cultural and subsistence resources.”
 But with limited industry interest in hunting for oil in Arctic waters at today’s low oil prices, the consensus from environmental campaigners was that, outside the concentration of industry in the Gulf of Mexico, America’s waters remain safe from oil and gas drilling. 
“With the offshore Atlantic now closed to new exploration, it is hard to see where growth for big oil in North America is going to come from. Unimaginable even a few years ago, we are now seeing the beginning of the end of the oil age,” Greepeace said in a statement.
There was never any consideration of drilling off the Pacific coasts, because of local opposition. 
Environmental advocates called the Atlantic drilling plan  an outsize victory for reducing climate change. “It will prevent oil spills and coastal industrialization, it makes seismic testing unnecessary and it will help promote the clean energy solutions that we so desperately need,” said Jacqueline Savitz, Oceana’s vice-president for the US. “With this decision coastal communities have won a ‘David v Goliath’ fight against the richest companies on the planet, and that is a cause for tremendous optimism for the wellbeing of future generations.”
Sierra Weaver, an attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Centre, said the decision was a victory for more than 100 towns that had protested against the drilling plan. 
“The hero in this fight is not one person or one city or one group,” Weaver said. “It is a collection of determined communities and elected leaders from both parties that banded together to protect their coasts.”
The American Petroleum Institute, the main industry lobby group, condemned the move as “extreme”. “This is not how you harness America’s economic and diplomatic potential,” Jack Gerard, API’s president, said in a statement.
Despite the three leases, the Arctic was expected to remain off-limits to oil companies, in part because of low industry interest. Shell pulled out of its Alaska operations last year. Obama cancelled a number of Arctic leases last October.
In a joint declaration last week, Obama and Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, committed to follow “science-based standards” when it came to sanctioning new oil and gas drilling in the Arctic.
 Obama had faced strong pressure from industry and state governors to open up the Atlantic to drilling. 
However, there was a backlash from coastal communities, who feared a repeat of BP’s disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. The Democratic presidential contenders, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, were also opposed to drilling. 


Obama has given a number of indications in the past six months that he is becoming more responsive to campaigners’ arguments that if he is serious about fighting climate change he must stop the extraction of coal, oil, and gas – not just put curbs on emissions.
Obama and Trudeau took a big step towards protecting the Arctic last week, declaring that any future oil and gas exploration in the polar region “must align with science-based standards between the two nations that ensure appropriate preparation for operating in Arctic conditions, including robust and effective well control and emergency response measures”.
The Interior Department cancelled lease sales in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas last October.
The strictures against future Arctic drilling are unlikely to inflict an immediate political toll on Obama. Oil companies have grown more reluctant to invest the huge sums required to operate off the north coast of Alaska, given current low prices and the disappointing results that led Shell to give up on its exploratory well in the region."

He cranks the screws until the foundation flattens out, level with the ground. At least for now. 
Andrew’s house, on a small island traditionally inhabited by indigenous Alaskans, is a prototype modular home designed by the Fairbanks-based nonprofit Cold Climate Housing Research Center (CCHRC) to be resistant to harsh weather and a quickly changing climate, while still being affordable and easy to build.
These are the challenges of housing design in the far north, where seasonal variability is exacerbated by climate change – like the heave and twitch of permafrost and the slow creep landward of the edge of the sea ice – adds to the challenge of building in an already brutal environment. Pipes freeze, walls molder. It can be prohibitively expensive, if not impossible, to get labor and supplies, which has led to a huge shortage of housing. And then there’s the social challenge associated with providing permanent housing for population groups that have been living nomadic subsistence lifestyles for generations. 
This winter, both January and February brought record low coverage of arctic sea ice. And, as the ice surface contracts, so does the oil money that funds many northern communities. Populations are increasing in places like Iqaluit, Canada, and towns like Newtok, Alaska need to be moved to avoid falling into the sea as the ice recedes. So city planners, architects, and tribal groups, in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, from Newtok to Nunuvut, are trying to answer the question of how to live in the changing north, and how to do it now. It’s a technical, cultural, financial and environmental puzzle. And as the Arctic warms faster than predicted, it’s becoming increasingly urgent.
There are 40 different indigenous groups that live within the Arctic Circle, from the Inuit to the Saami in Finland and Norway. For millenia, most of these groups were semi-nomadic, moving to hunt or fish, tracking the edge of the sea ice. It’s only in the last half a decade that more permanent structures have become part of the Arctic infrastructure, and they haven’t settled particularly well. Part of learning to design for a changing Arctic is amending what’s already been done.
Molly Rettig, communications coordinator at CCHRC, explains that the federal government made a big effort to develop the Alaskan tundra in the 70s and 80s. Awarding contracts to the lowest bidder, the government’s housing push resulted in “cookie cutter pre-fab houses that look like they should be in Texas or North Carolina”, she says. “That means they’re not designed for permafrost. The houses have no eaves, and there’s no building envelope, so they’re falling apart and rotting, battered by storms and snow and wind. Plus, these are subsistence people, and there’s no space built in for skins or for working on snow machines.” She says it’s typical of government funding in these parts: “These agencies parachute in and say, ‘We’re going to give you plumbing’, and then the pipes freeze. They’re not engaged with it at all.”
To design for the culture and climate, and to build in sustainable ways, CCHRC tries to meld building practices that have worked in the Arctic for centuries with technology and technique that can make structures affordable and easy to build in remote villages. “We try to flip it around and ask what their traditional housing was like,” Rettig says. “Fifty years ago they were in sod huts or skin tents, and you’ll still see the ruins of sod igloos around, so we try to use the pieces of that design and architecture that worked and that you could mimic.” 
They’ve designed houses with super-insulated walls to imitate traditional sod, and built composting, waterless toilets that dry out waste so it can be burned for heat – crucial in places where sewers don’t make sense and sky-high fuel costs account for much of household spending. This spring, in Newtok, the nonprofit is working on a prototype house built on skis, so it can be towed across the tundra as the ocean encroaches. 
But environmentally appropriate design is only part of the process. In environmentally risky locations it can be hard to get funding and impossible to get insurance. Just getting building materials to towns on the tundra can account for a significant portion of the building cost. 
“The building season is short, especially for communities off the road system, which is 80% of communities in Alaska,” Rettig says. “We have to barge materials in, so by July you have to be ready. If you forget something you’re waiting another year.” 
To get around this, CCHRC designs houses as easy-to-assemble kits that a crew of six relatively untrained carpenters can build it in eight weeks.
In Atmautluak, population 277, CCHRC required Andrew to participate in the construction of his new house, in hopes that the process would also educate the community in how to construct more sustainable structures. 
There is both a lack of housing and a lack of jobs in far northern aboriginal communities, which leads to overcrowding and hidden homelessness. Traditional practices, like hunting, have been physically squeezed out, setting off a cultural disconnect and a lack of food and supplies. “They’ve been in that area for thousands of years, but they’ve never had that permanent infrastructure. We came in, changed culture and changed land, and now it’s falling apart,” Rettig says. 
A group of architects at the Toronto-based firm Lateral is approaching design in the far north from the perspective of sustaining and preserving culture. “For years we imported southern models of planning, food, education, just about everything,” says Lola Sheppard, a partner at Lateral. “That’s has failed dramatically in almost every sense, technologically and culturally, so we need to reimagine how we design in the north.” 
Lateral has been working on a project called Arctic Adaptations, which tries to find design-based solutions to issues like overcrowding and the degredation of traditional hunting grounds. She says there have been huge failures in designing for northern climates because architects and planners haven’t taken culture into account. “We’re looking at how people move, how people hunt, how healthcare is provided, as well as the size of families and how they share food,” Sheppard says. “We want to look at how architecture can be a tool for cultural empowerment.” 
They’ve designed a network of food storage hubs, and they’re working on ways to make buildings multifunctional, like a caribou research station that also serves as a shelter for hunters.
The research is important for future design, but there’s also a need for immediate solutions. In Iqaluit, Nunavut, the capitol of Canada’s newest province, Mélodie Simard, the director of planning and development, is struggling to find land to build housing for the city’s burgeoning population. Located on the south coast of Baffin Island, Iqaluit is only 17 years old, but the government center now offers public services and a chance for employment. 
Iqaluit was first established as an Army Base and now faces growing pains as aboriginal people from smaller more remote communities in Nunavut and residents from the south arrive for jobs in the growing economy. According to the Standards Council of Canada, in the Northwest Territories alone, estimates suggest it could cost as much as $230m to adapt existing buildings, or more than $5,000 for each of the 7,000 residents.
Simard says they want to build a new, 500-unit housing development, and that they’re working within newly adapted infrastructure standards that were put in place to address climate change, but that she’s struggling to find both land and capital. “Right now my focus is trying to address the housing crisis. Our rental price is very, very, very steep,” she says. “We’re trying to make more land available as soon as possible within our constraints.”
Iqaluit has developed a sustainability plan to reflect the Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, or the Inuit way of life, and the new housing development is built accordingly. To soak up maximum light and heat from the sun, all the houses face the south, regardless of their orientation to the street. Thermosyphons, low-tech heat pumps have been installed into the foundations of larger buildings, to draw heat out of the land to keep the permafrost cold and less likely to move.
Across northern latitudes, environmental changes are increasingly forcing communities to adapt more quickly than expected. In Kiruna, the northernmost town in Sweden, the land under the town has started to collapse due to mining. The town is slowly being rebuilt three kilometers away, and planners and architects are being more conscious of the community’s environment and the cultural context. The contractors are building around traditional reindeer herding grounds, instead of through them, and the new structures are ultra insulated and designed to harvest heat and shed wind. It hasn’t been cheap, but they’ve managed to find a way to adapt. 
Rettig says there are some solutions coming out of Alaska, too. In the coastal city of Bethel, where they predict needing 2,000 homes in the next 10 years, the community has started a small-scale logging industry, reducing housing costs, and built a truss plant, creating both jobs and houses. 
“Everyone keeps saying the next few years are going to be really telling,” Rettig says. “We are at a major pivot point: is this culture is going to keep going or disappear?”"

Achieving the Paris goals requires leaving most of the world’s fossil fuel reserves in the ground. A first step must be to stop subsidising fossil fuel production. Wednesday’s budget is an acid test of the government’s Paris commitment. In last year’s budget, the chancellor gave £1.3bn in new tax breaks and direct funding to the oil industry. The UK Treasury receives a smaller share of oil revenues than most other comparable countries. Meanwhile, the government has exempted a whole new fossil-fuel industry – fracking – from half of its tax, despite huge local opposition wherever it is proposed.
The government has slashed support for wind and solar energy, costing thousands of jobs. Yet its free-market rationale does not apply when it comes to the oil and gas industry, which has received continued government support even in times of super-normal profits. The chancellor has to change course. He should scrap subsidies that keep the British economy hooked on fossil fuels, and instead set out a strategy to help communities currently dependent on fossil fuel jobs to diversify and to rebuild around world-leading clean technology.Craig Bennett CEO, Friends of the Earth, England, Wales &amp; Northern Ireland Marc Stears Chief executive, New Economics FoundationElizabeth Bast Acting executive director, Oil Change InternationalPeter Wooders Programme leader, Global Subsidies Initiative, International Institute for Sustainable Development Mika Minio-Paluello Coordinator, Platform
• In your article on the alarming rise in global temperatures, you quote Professor Rahmstorf from the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research, who said that “we are in a kind of climate emergency now” (February global temperature ‘shockingly’ high, say scientists, 15 March). He is, of course, correct, and so we urgently need to implement an effective response.
The obvious way to do this would be to cut global greenhouse emissions now, but electorates are still utterly unwilling to accept the radical lifestyle changes we need to achieve this. No western government would dare double petrol prices or remove our ability to repeatedly fly abroad for holidays. No developing-country leaders are going to tell their people they can never have a western lifestyle.
The only politically feasible solutions are technological ones, such as carbon scrubbing and geoengineering. Therefore, David Cameron and other world leaders need to start making a massive investment in those areas now, possibly funded by an international financial transactions tax. Otherwise, we do face disaster.Richard MountfordTonbridge, Kent
• The chief executive of the Road Haulage Association (Budget 2016: Osborne to cut an extra £4bn, 14 March) is guilty of some very selective arithmetic. If an RPI increase in fuel duty represents an increase of £450 per truck per year, then the 40p drop in fuel prices we have enjoyed over the last few years represents a decrease of £24,000 per truck. I wonder how many hauliers have reduced their prices to reflect this.
The low fuel prices are a heaven-sent opportunity for the chancellor to raise some serious revenue. If the RPI 0.75p rise would bring in £345.5m, then a 20p rise could raise over £9bn with motorists and hauliers still better off than when prices reached their peak. That would save a great deal of pain elsewhere in the economy.Keith PotterGunnislake, Cornwall
• The proposed CMA reforms in the gas and electricity distribution sector are a grave disappointment (Report, 11 March); its intention to “enable competition to grow further” may be misguided. We don’t need another layer of expensive administration the costs of which will inevitably be passed on to consumers. And it will take too long to implement.
Since nationalisation, this industry has lost its moral compass and become more concerned with maximising shareholder profit than providing a minimal cost reliable service. The intention of encouraging consumers to migrate to cheaper deals is admirable, but it is optimistic to believe that this will lead to lower overall costs rather than merely redistributing the same total billing charges over the same customers.
Would it not have been simpler, easier and quicker to make each major supplier improve the lot of their own existing customers that have been on a standard variable tariff (SVT) for say more than two years by moving them on to that company’s best fixed one-year tariff? The suppliers could be mandated to make this move within six months and to maintain such customers on a similarly priced fixed tariff for at least four further years. The current practice of migrating customers at the termination of a fixed price period on to a SVT unless the customer makes an effort to stay on a better tariff should be banned. The default should be to move them to another reasonably priced term tariff.Iain Oldcorn Ascot, Berkshire
• It has been said that the Hinkley Point imbroglio has led to a missed opportunity to install the equivalent capacity over the period up to 2024, probably at lower cost as with power actually becoming steadily available over the construction period (Hinkley Point is a costly mistake, but only France can pull the plug, 14 March).
As it happens, the current cost per megawatt of providing wind and solar power is about the same as that for building Hinkley Point. But as the sale price for Hinkley Point output is inflation-proofed by the government up to 2092, wind and solar power are certain to continue coming down from today’s prices.
It is of course true that wind and solar cannot be relied on for continuous electricity in all weather conditions. But nuclear power has consistently failed to function at the levels of baseload for which it has been designed. And that also requires back-up reserve plants, thus improving the relative performance of the alternative fuels.
Wind and solar power consume fuel that is cost-free, and therefore uses 100% of its potential, whereas nuclear and fossil power wastes about a third of its fuel. They also lose a large proportion of the remaining two thirds in transmission costs from generating plants over long distance to connect with the grid. Wind and solar power coming from smaller generating plants can and should be connected to local networks and will therefore be able to reduce losses in transmission. This will also reduce the length, cost and viability of any new pylon lines.
Thus, had we committed ourselves to a 10-year programme of non-nuclear electricity, we would have achieved a steady increase in output and eliminated the risk of the lights going out with the stubborn persistence in choosing Hinkley Point.Harvey ColeWinchester, Hampshire

But no country, least of all the UK, can afford to";"“Normally I don’t comment on individual months,” tweeted Gavin Schmidt of Nasa on Sunday. “Too much weather, not enough climate. But last month was special.” And so it was: February’s global surface temperature was 1.35C warmer than the average temperature for the month between 1951-1980, a bigger margin than ever seen before.
In the pressing confusion of world affairs, civil war, refugees, terrorism and even the workings of democracy, it can be hard to keep a focus on even greater long-term threats. Yet the consequences of climate change – sometimes drought, sometimes extreme weather events – already contribute to political instability, to pushing hard lives over the border into intolerable, fuelling the great flows of humanity across continents.
Sceptics hide behind El Niño’s unusual warming effect, but climate scientists estimate it can play only a small role. With February as well as January setting new records, the nearly 200 countries that signed up to national targets for the reduction of carbon emissions in Paris last December surely need look no further for reasons to ratchet up their ambitions. Indeed, most experts hold that the Paris aspiration to keep warming to 1.5C rather than 2C is already beginning to look as if it is too little, too late.
The US, still the leading carbon emitter among the larger nations if units per capita are counted, is stuttering in the right direction under the leadership of President Barack Obama, who has made action on climate change a legacy issue – on Tuesday the possibility of drilling in Arctic waters was tightly restricted to “science-based standards” in a significant deal struck with Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau. But only one of the Republican candidates in the race to succeed the president – the outsider John Kasich – accepts that global warming has a significant man-made element, while Hillary Clinton’s bald commitment this week that she would put “a lot of miners and a lot of coal companies out of business” will have gone down well in Florida where rising sea levels are a reality, but not so much among the Donald Trump-leaning blue-collar workers in the midwest.
Against this background, the stalling and reverses of the UK government, which has killed off at least nine different green policies in less than a year, can look like the small change of a global crisis. But Britain has played an important role in the world’s attempts to negotiate a way through to a sustainable deal, a role it will struggle to play in the future. A small cheer, then, for the announcement on Monday that there would be legislation to enact a zero-carbon emissions target. Yet the pledge was made by a government with a well-established record for preferring style over substance and during the debate on the latest energy bill, which ends onshore wind and solar subsidies, restricts those for offshore wind and boosts long-term support for North Sea oil and gas. As the former energy secretary Ed Davey observed, the Conservatives seem determined to cross out all the options for promoting renewables. Meanwhile, the ambitious plan for the Hinkley Point C nuclear reactor, on which all current carbon emission reduction targets depend, looks increasingly fragile. The longer it is protected, the harder it will be to replace its output in time. The chancellor might yet surprise in Wednesday’s budget with creative new ideas. But probably don’t count on it."

Speaking to Guardian Australia, she also urged rich countries to contribute to sustainable development in poor countries and to do so in their own self-interest.
Her former role as UN special envoy for climate change meant she had heard the pleas from developing countries for more action and Australia was urged to do more. 
“I listened to the presidents and senior politicians and civil society of these Pacific island countries and I have to say they were very critical of Australia. Genuinely very critical,” she said of her time at the Pacific Island Development Forum in Fiji in 2015.
“I was very struck by the fact that they did not consider that Australia or New Zealand, but more Australia, good leaders.
“Australia was engaged in a fossil-fuel powering of its economy, which was hurting their economies and indeed their future. And it was said over and over again.”
By that time, Australia had dismantled its carbon tax, was reviewing its renewable energy target and had axed or was planning to axe the majority of its government climate change bodies.
“And when your neighbours think that of you – and that was an intimate forum for me to hear that – you need to think about what that means.”
Robinson, who now heads her own organisation called the Mary Robinson Foundation – Climate Justice, had been invited to Australia by the University of Melbourne, where she delivered a lecture on sustainability on Tuesday night.
She said Australia and other countries needed to work harder to lower emissions and stop climate change and emphasised the role of climate financing – a process whereby rich countries fund low-emissions development in poor countries. But she emphasised that it was not a form of aid.
“It is not aid to developing countries. It is the means by which we secure a safe world for all our children and grandchildren,” she said.
“The vast growth in infrastructure will have to be in developing countries. They have to build up their economies. And if we don’t help them with clean energy they will go the dirty route – they will go with coal – and then we will not have a safe world.”
Robinson, who has also been UN high commissioner for human rights, said it was in the west’s interest to secure climate financing for developing nations.
“It is human solidarity but it is also collective self-interest,” she said. “It’s in our self-interest to ensure that developing countries go clean because if they don’t they will lock in so much fossil fuel that we can’t have a safe world for anyone.
“It’s like the Titanic. When the Titanic hit that iceberg, it wasn’t just those in steerage that went down, it was the first-class as well.
“There is a real sense of interdependence and a need for human solidarity to realise we are all in this together.”
When it comes to helping developing nations with the effects of climate change, that ship had already sailed, Robinson said. 
“[Fiji] was hit by this awful cyclone Winston. Luckily not so many people were killed but it devastated their economy.
“We can’t have this being the reality for very poor coutnries. We must ensure we move to a new pattern.
“The reality is that we’re running out of time. Everyone is shocked by what is happening – we had the announcement that in February we had the greatest increase in heat, that it jumped more than scientists thought it would.
“We have to be self-preserving and sensible. And, as a grandmother of five who will be in their 40s in 2050 and share the world with 9 billion others ... they will criticise us so harshly if we don’t get things right now.
“We just have to get our minds right that we have a responsibility to move in the direction that Paris has given us – well below 2C as far as possible to 1.5C – a world that leaves no one behind. A world that is fair and inclusive … We can do it. And we will have a much better and more equal world if we do.”"

But nothing really beats the satisfaction available today from downloading in just three or four clicks the entire import-export database for the same country. Yet, it can be tempting to make Wikipedia or Google the default for research. So, here are some gems which make international development research better, easier and more productive. 
What’s it good for? If you like data visualisations and are interested in analysing trade flows and the sectoral composition of an economy, you can’t beat this website from Harvard. Cesar A. Hidalgo and Ricardo Hausmann have done some amazing work in the past few years conceptualising the enormous quantity of data on world trade to help us understand the processes of export diversification and industrialisation. This has developed further and the Atlas  and Globe are probably the best visualisations of any dataset I’ve seen yet.
The cons: The product classifications can be difficult to understand, as can the product space concept. 
What’s it good for? To see how we are causing average CO2 levels to rise with the most consistent and accurate dataset available, see the Earth System Research Laboratory. But the real cause of climate change is obviously the emissions of fossil fuels either through industry, transportation, electricity production or indirectly via forest depletion. The IEA provides excellent data on how each country produces and consumes energy. Its energy statistics report is excellent, as is its energy atlas data tool. For energy statistics as well as projections up to 2035, the BP Energy Outlook is also very useful.
The cons: I’ve tried to calculate the CO2 implications of energy production and consumption figures in the past, but it is very difficult as the conversion factors used seem to vary from agency to agency. This is the best I’ve found.
What’s it good for? International transactions in land have been called land grabs by some NGOs and the media. A meticulously developed database of international land transactions is available, called the Land Matrix, with plenty of useful visualisation tools.
The cons: The site admits itself the data is inherently unreliable. As I understand it this is because the information on such deals is often private and commercially sensitive. 
What’s it good for? The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Article IV reports are unbeatable as a free and up-to-date source of information on all major economic indicators for every country in the world; this includes debt and capital flows, as well as a treasure trove of qualitative information about the key developments, political and economic, from foreign direct investment (FDI) project progress to conflict and instability. The IMF World Economic Outlook data site and data mapper are very good as well, but if I’m researching any country I’ll always start with the Article IV report.
The cons: The annex tables within each report can sometimes be difficult to read and interpret, and it is not always apparent which statistics come directly from the government in question and how many are estimates made by the IMF. It is worth reading the small print. In particular, if you need FDI information it is worth comparing the IMF estimates with those provided by UNCTAD.
What’s it good for?  If you are trying to analyse fragile and conflict-affected states as opposed to other countries, you need clear definitions of which countries fit in and when. The Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) has recorded ongoing violent conflicts since the 1970s, defining countries which had more than 25 battle deaths per year as experiencing minor conflicts and those with more than 1,000 as major conflicts. For fragility, try the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), a series of 16 measures on countries’ performance in implementing policies that promote economic growth and poverty reduction, where the World Bank classify a country as fragile if scoring 3.2 on the CPIA. You can also try the Fragile States Index, which is easier to use.
The cons: Conflict can be a highly contested term. In addition, the data does not distinguish terrorism as a separate category. 
What’s it good for? I’ve found this an extremely useful and easy-to-use source of information on a broad range of business environment indicators, as well as excellent comparable data on the actual costs of trade. You do have to get into the sub-indicator information for it to be really useful though but the survey is annual so you can easily look for trends over time. 
The cons: The Doing Business data collection process is often based on formal laws and procedures rather than those actually experienced by businesses in operation. As a result there is a case that it can be misleading on the true business environment – for example a formal process to start a business might take four days on paper but in reality would require a bribe to an official to be done in that timeframe. As a result I would also suggest using this data alongside Transparency International’s Corruption Perception index, which gives a measure of corruption based on surveys with real businesses and investors.
What’s it good for? Absolutely everything. The World Development Indicators (WDI) is a huge collection of national data on hundreds of indicators, from the number of mobile phones per 1,000 people to the number of children out of school. It goes back a long way and has data on every country in the world. 
The cons: As well as being prone to crash Microsoft Excel at 84MB for the full sheet, the database is a collation of a huge range of sources. It is important to understand the real source when evaluating the quality and consistency of the data used, but unfortunately the dataset itself is not clearly labelled so you don’t know the source for a lot of the information. You are also liable to drown a bit in the quantity here. So, if I was after agricultural data I would actually go first to the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), for education data Unesco’s Global Education Digest and for economic indicators I’d probably start with the IMF’s World Economic Outlook. 
What’s it good for? If you want a holistic ranking of progress of a country on human development, the HDI still provides a good benchmark. It brings together gross national income (GNI) per capita with life expectancy, and high-level education indicators, into a useful index for international comparisons. But the dataset behind the high-level index is much more detailed, including information from the HIV prevalence rates to primary school drop-out rates.
The cons: The HDI draws on a range of other sources. Read the small print.
What’s it good for? For raw data on high-level trade, I would go to COMTRADE. They do visualisations but you can also download large amounts of data, although for this you need to know the commodity codes you are interested in. However, if you can get yourself a login for the World Bank’s World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS), do so, it’s by far the easiest way to search COMTRADE data. 
The cons: There are a few different categories used for classifying product types. I would always use SITC ver.3, which I’ve found has the largest amount of data available and it is easier to analyse. As you can go right down to very fine product categories, you need to know what level of detail you are interested in, otherwise you can end up with an unmanageable amount of information.
What’s it good for? If you are doing any analysis in which aid itself is a key variable, then there is no better source than the OECD aid database. It is the only really consistent data source on aid I’ve seen. 
The cons: The aid data is collected from governments, which may have different definitions both of Official Development Assistance (ODA) and of what constitutes sectoral focus – I’ve found it particularly difficult to classify how much money is given to private sector development interventions, for example. In addition the split between budget support and sector programmes is not always clearly specified. It is useful to cross-check the figures with the IMF Article IV balance of payments stats if you can.

Renewable power played a “critical role” in holding CO2 emissions to around 32bn tonnes, the International Energy Agency said in a statement.
The Paris-based thinktank also cited falling coal use in top carbon polluters China and the United States in its preliminary data.
The figures mark the first period in 40 years that a halt or reduction was not tied to an economic downturn. The data does not account for pollution from transport or changes in land use.
“The new figures confirm last year’s surprising but welcome news: we now have seen two straight years of greenhouse gas emissions decoupling from economic growth,” IEA head, Fatih Birol said.
“Coming just a few months after the landmark COP21 agreement in Paris, this is yet another boost to the global fight against climate change.”
Carbon dioxide is the most durable greenhouse gas, with a lifetime of up to 200 years. Since 1990, CO2 levels have soared over 60%, driven in part by China’s rapid growth.
The IEA said surging deployment of renewable power, especially wind drove the plateau, with renewables accounting for 90% of new electricity generation in 2015.
Emissions in China, the world’s largest carbon polluter, fell 1.5% on receding coal consumption as it restructured its economy away from energy-intensive industries and ramped up clean energy.
In the US, the next largest polluter, a switch from coal to natural gas drove a 2% fall in emissions.
Yet rising pollution in other Asian developing economies, the Middle East and Europe, offset those reductions.
“It’s very encouraging to see energy-related CO2 emissions growth stall, but few steps have been taken to accelerate clean energy deployment so emissions start to decline,” said Greenpeace energy strategist, Emily Rochon.
“As we are witnessing alarming temperature increases, this is no time to sit back and enjoy the ride. World leaders in Paris agreed to limit global warming to 1.5C, which requires unprecedented efforts today, not tomorrow, to scale up renewable energy and reduce energy consumption globally.”
Last month was the hottest February on record, with global surface temperatures rising perilously close to that 1.5C threshold, while annual CO2 levels rose the fastest in 56 years."

Preliminary data for 2015 from the International Energy Agency (IEA) showed that carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector have levelled off at 32.1bn tonnes even as the global economy grew over 3% .
Electricity generated by renewable sources played a critical role, having accounted for around 90% of new electricity generation in 2015. Wind power produced more than half of all new electricity generation, said the IEA. 
The figures are significant because they prove to traditionally sceptical treasuries that it is possible to grow economies without increasing climate emissions. 
“The new figures confirm last year’s surprising but welcome news: we now have seen two straight years of greenhouse gas emissions decoupling from economic growth. Coming just a few months after the landmark COP21 agreement in Paris, this is yet another boost to the global fight against climate changem” said IEA director, Fatih Birol.
The two largest emitters, China and the US, both reduced energy-related emmisions in 2015. In China, they declined 1.5%, as coal use dropped for the second year running and in the US they declined 2%, as a large switch from coal to natural gas use in electricity generation took place.
However, these declines were offset by increasing emissions in most other Asian developing economies and the Middle East, said the IEA.
In the 40 years in which the IEA has reported on CO2 emissions, there have been only four short periods in which emissions stood still or fell compared to the previous year. Three of those — the early 1980s, 1992 and 2009 — came in periods of economic crisis. 
But the new stall in emissions comes amid economic expansion. According to the International Monetary Fund, global GDP grew by 3.4% in 2014 and 3.1% in 2015.
“When the IEA said last year that global emissions had stalled whilst economic growth had continued, they understandably sounded a note of caution; was this a one-off, or the start of something major?” said Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU).
“The sense of excitement as they report similar findings this year therefore is palpable, because in essence they’re showing that combating climate change is perfectly compatible with continuing economic growth, and that’s hugely significant,” said Black.
 A seperate report by the European Environment agency (EEA) shows that the EU-wide share of renewable energy has increased from 14.3% in 2012 to 15% in 2013. This allowed the EU to cut its demand for fossil fuels by 110m tonnes of oil equivalent in 2013. This, said the EEA, is the equivalent of a gross reduction of CO2 emissions of 362m tonnes in 2013."

The immediate cause of the drought which has crippled countries from Ethiopia to Zimbabwe is one of the strongest El Niño events ever recorded. It has turned normal weather patterns upside down around the globe, climate scientists say.
But with the world still reeling from record-high temperatures in February, there are fears that the long-term impacts of climate change are also undermining the region’s ability to endure extremes in weather, leaving huge numbers of people vulnerable to hunger and disease.
The worst hit country in the current crisis is Ethiopia, where rains vital to four-fifths of the country’s crops have failed. Unicef has said it is making plans to treat more than 2 million children for malnutrition, and says more than 10 million people will need food aid.
“Ethiopia has been hit by a double blow, both from a change to the rainy seasons that have been linked to long-term climate change and now from El Niño, which has potentially led the country to one of the worst droughts in decades,” said Gillian Mellsop, Unicef representative to Ethiopia.
The crisis has been damaging even to Ethiopians not at immediate risk of going hungry. It has truncated the education of 3.9 million children and teenagers, who “are unable to access quality education opportunities because of the drought”, she said.
Neighbouring countries grappling with hunger after crops failed include Somalia, Sudan and Kenya, and altogether the failed rains have left more than 20 million people “food insecure” in the region. 
The drought caught many officials by surprise, because although El Niño was forecast, the weather event normally brings more rain to the region, not less.
“The typical pattern that you would expect with El Niño is very dry weather in southern Africa, but slightly wetter than normal in eastern Africa,” said Dr Linda Hirons, a research scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science.
“So the fact that we have had parts of eastern Africa experiencing drought is unusual … but every single El Niño event manifests itself differently.”
In southern Africa, the drought caused by El Niño was expected, but it has been even more severe than feared, with rains failing two years in a row. 
Overall nearly 16 million people in southern Africa are already going hungry, and that number could rise fast. “More than 40 million rural and 9 million poor urban people are at risk due to the impacts of El Niño’s related drought and erratic rainfall,” the World Food Programme has warned.
Zimbabwe, once the region’s bread basket, is one of the worst hit countries. In February, the country’s president Robert Mugabe declared a state of disaster due to the drought, and in less than a month official estimates of people needing food aid has risen from 3 million to 4 million.
Neighbouring countries are also scrambling to find food aid, including South Africa, whose ports are the main entry point for relief across the region.
“We are seeing this as a regional crisis, a cross-country humanitarian crisis,” said Victor Chinyama. “In each country maybe the numbers [of hungry people] are nowhere near as much as Ethiopia, but if you put these numbers together as a whole region, you get a sense of how large a crisis this is.”
More than a third of households are now going hungry, he said. Families that used to eat two meals a day are cutting back to one, and those who could once provide a single meal for their dependents are now entirely reliant on food aid, he said.
Beyond the immediate scramble to get food to those who need it, aid workers in the region say the drought has served as reminder that communities vulnerable to changing weather patterns need longer-term help adapting.
“It’s becoming common knowledge now that we will experience droughts much more,” said Beatrice Mwangi, resilience and livelihoods director, southern Africa region, World Vision, who said she is focused on medium- and long-term responses.
“In the past it was one big drought every 10 years, then it came to one drought every five years, and now the trends are showing that it will be one every three to five years. So we are in a crisis alright, that is true.
“But it’s going to be the new norm. So our responses need to appreciate that … there is climate change, and it’s going to affect the people that we work with, the communities we serve.”"

But his lack of action in the face of global warming indicates the opposite";"“Doing the right thing for the next generation is what the government and this budget is about,” chancellor George Osborne told parliament on Wednesday. “I am not prepared to look back at my time here in this parliament, doing this job and say to my children’s generation: I’m sorry. We knew there was a problem … but we ducked the difficult decisions and we did nothing.”
However, despite rising global temperatures now shattering all records, the issue of climate change did not get a single mention in his speech. Worse than the missing words, the budget did almost nothing to support the clean energy economy the UK needs to develop for the 21st century, and did a lot to block it.
Osborne and David Cameron talk tough on climate change, citing it as “one of the most serious threats facing our world ... a threat to our national security and economic prosperity” and promising a zero-carbon Britain . So to ignore the climate crisis, in a speech centred on “doing the right thing for the next generation”, is bewildering. Or, as Green MP Caroline Lucas bluntly puts it, “sheer hypocrisy”.
Let’s start with the one unalloyed piece of good news: the £700m more for flood defences. Flooding is the UK’s number one threat from global warming and Cameron and Osborne had — until now — ignored a torrent of warnings about the idiocy of earlier budget cuts. But finally realising this folly doesn’t really warrant huge praise.
Nonetheless, common sense prevailed, unlike elsewhere. After Wednesday’s budget, renewable energy faces an even higher “climate change levy”, despite being part of the solution not the problem.
Most fossil fuels must be kept in the ground if global warming is to be tamed, but Osborne renewed his zeal to squeeze every last drop out of the North Sea. The oil and gas industry’s pleading was rewarded with a £1bn tax break handout: it got the same in 2015 too. Overall, the Treasury looks likely to be paying the oil industry in the next five years, not the other way around, as crazy as that sounds.
The UK is struggling to meet green targets, particularly in cutting emissions from transport. The answer, according to this budget, is to build more roads and freeze fuel duty as petrol prices plummet. Meanwhile, illegal levels of air pollution will continue to cause tens of thousands of premature deaths a year.
Osborne did announce “up to” £730m of support for offshore wind and other “less established” renewables, to be delivered from 2021-22 onwards via auctions. But there will have to be far, far more investment to keep the lights on in a sustainable, affordable way in the 2020s. At the moment, the uncertainty for investors means consumers will pay more.
There was no support at all for the established, cost-effective renewables that the government has slashed: solar power and onshore wind. It admits thousands of jobs are being lost in this sector but, unlike oil and gas jobs, these seem not to matter. Energy efficiency programmes, which should always be the first choice in tackling energy and climate problems, are being cut 80% by Osborne.
Small modular nuclear reactors got a modest £30m boost, which might bear useful fruit in 2030 or so. But the UK needs clean energy now. Perhaps the most intriguing of Osborne’s words were the blink-and-you-missed-it reference to National Infrastructure Commission: “I am also accepting [its] recommendations on energy.”
The NIC backed a smart and flexible vision of energy supply — saving consumers £8bn a year by 2030 — that contrasts starkly with Osborne’s current plans, which are founded on fossil fuels and massive “white elephant” nuclear plants. Perhaps Osborne hasn’t actually read the NIC report. Nonetheless, there’s £50m for storage and other smart energy technologies over the next five years.
Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, sums up Osborne’s doublethink budget: “The chancellor said several times that this was a budget for future generations, [but] it’s not evident that he has internalised the implications of the recent Paris climate summit. The concrete measures he’s announced barely make a difference to this generation.”
“We’re not afraid to put the next generation first,” Osborne said. We are fast running out of time for him to prove it."

The nationwide poll of 1,048 people over the weekend found 47% of people agreed or strongly agreed that “climate change and renewable energy will influence the way I vote at this year’s federal election”.
That was more than twice as many as the 22% who disagreed with the statement, according to the survey conducted by Lonergan Research and commissioned by Future Super.
Similarly, 44% of respondents said they either agreed or strongly agreed that measures to protect the Great Barrier Reef would influence their vote – again, more than double the 20% who disagreed.
And voters appeared particularly concerned about the impact of the Carmichael coalmine, which will be the biggest in the country if it goes ahead. In all, 65% said they were quite worried, very worried or extremely worried about the impact the mine would have on climate change and the Great Barrier Reef. Only 15% said they were not worried at all and 20% were not aware of the plans.
“Today’s polling shows that, when voters go to the polls in the second half of the year, they’ll be concerned about climate change,” said Simon Sheikh, the founder and managing director of Future Super. “That should be an extraordinary wake-up call for the government.
“In the last few months the government has tried ignoring the issue of climate change. It has undermined the jobs of climate scientists at the CSIRO and thrown its support behind polluting projects like the Adani coalmine. Today’s polling reveals they are on the wrong side of every one of those issues.”
Sheikh said the number of people who were switching to Future Super, which is the only super fund in Australia that avoids all investments in fossil fuels, is further evidence for how much people care about the issue. He said the fund reached $130m under management, within 18 months of launching.
The Australian Conservation Foundation is fighting the federal government’s approval of Adani’s Carmichael coalmine in court, arguing the carbon emissions from the coal it produces will put the Great Barrier Reef at risk. It will create more annual emissions than New York City, according to calculations done last year.
“Any politician who wants to be taken seriously on climate change and Great Barrier Reef protection cannot support Adani’s proposal to dig the biggest coalmine in Australia’s history,” said Kelly O’Shanassy, the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation.
“What’s clear from this polling is Australians care about the Great Barrier Reef, they are increasingly worried about the damage climate change is doing to it and they will use their votes in this year’s federal election to demand a better deal for the reef.
“Burning coal is warming the planet and warmer oceans are bleaching the reef. People can see the connection and they want better from their government.”
The Queensland parliament, with the support of both Labor and the Liberal-National party, recently passed a motion supporting Adani’s efforts to get the required regulatory approvals passed, Sheikh said.
“With 65% of Australians expressing their concerns over the impact the mine will have on our climate and on the Great Barrier Reef, both Labor and the Coalition appear to be on the wrong side of this issue,” he said.
The survey also asked respondents what they thought of the statement: “The federal government was right to cut jobs, including those of climate scientists at the CSIRO.” A total of 49% disagreed or strongly disagreed, with only 20% agreeing or strongly agreeing.
“With temperature records being smashed in 2014, 2015 and in the first two months of 2016, it’s little wonder that voters are deeply concerned about the issue once again,” Sheikh said."

The assessment has prompted the Senate committee examining CSIRO job cuts to signal it will ask the auditor general to investigate senior officers’ use of private email.
On Friday, Peter Craig, the director of the CSIRO’s weather research collaboration with the bureau of meteorology, told a Senate committee at least seven people in the CSIRO’s ocean and atmosphere division had used private emails to discuss job cuts because they were directed to do so.
In response to a question on notice he added that it was the oceans and atmosphere division director, Ken Lee, and the deputy director, Andreas Schiller, who had given the verbal direction on 28 November.
The CSIRO claimed it was meeting record-keeping obligations despite use of private email because it would ensure the emails were entered into its system.
In a letter released on Thursday, the Senate clerk, Rosemary Laing, wrote to the Senate committee investigating CSIRO cuts raising concerns about the propriety of using private emails, even if later entered into records.
“Although this subsequent ‘capture’ of the records originally conveyed by private email may not be contrary to the requirements of the Archives Act (or national security), it looks like dubious administration and may be a breach of the organisation’s code of conduct by senior staff,” she said.
The code states CSIRO staff must maintain “complete, reliable and accurate records of the performance of your work-related decisions and activities” and “ensure the proper storage of, and access to, records, including the confidentiality and security of information”.
Laing said: “Furthermore, it has understandably led to concerns that it may create difficulties for the Senate or its committees to seek information.”
The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson, chair of the Senate budget scrutiny committee, raised that concern at its 8 February hearing. He said “clearly, if private emails have been used, it is going to be very difficult for us to access information” about an executive meeting that decided to make 350 positions redundant. 
“It is very concerning that there is no transparency around this if private emails have been used.”
On Wednesday, Whish-Wilson told the Senate full production of documents was needed to assess CSIRO’s restructure and reprioritisation and “to reverse these cuts to the best climate scientists in the world and to increase funding to this critical area of public good science”.
The opposition’s innovation, industry and science spokesman, Kim Carr, told Guardian Australia he was “deeply concerned that there is a case to answer as to why CSIRO staff were directed to use private emails”. He said this arguably breached two record-keeping laws and the CSIRO code of conduct.
“Given the Senate clerk’s assessment that this action is ‘dubious administration’ the Senate committee will now seek to have the auditor general investigate the matter.”
Carr said: “There are still serious questions of public-sector administration that CSIRO needs to answer. 
“How many people were involved? Who issued the directive? What access was there by third parties? How can we be certain the information has been returned to the CSIRO and is secure?”
CSIRO denied there was a directive to use private emails.
At an earlier Senate committee hearing Alex Wonhas, the CSIRO’s environment, energy and resources executive director, said private emails were used to plan job cuts to ensure “information stays within a small group of people to not cause distress and concern among staff”.
On Wednesday the cabinet secretary, Arthur Sinodinos, told the Senate he had advice from the attorney general’s office and finance department that CSIRO officials had not breached their obligations.
“CSIRO senior staff have been reminded of the policy regarding the private use of emails,” he said. “If there are further concerns, these are best raised directly with the CSIRO, who are an independent authority with full responsibility for these matters.” "

 Renewable sources, such as wind and solar, accounted for around 18% of global energy consumption in 2014. Under existing national policies, the share of renewables is forecast to reach 21% by 2030.
 Doubling the current share would help achieve a global target to limit the rise in the global average temperature to below 2C above pre-industrial levels, which was agreed at a summit in Paris last year.
 Irena is an intergovernmental organisation that focuses on realising the potential of renewables.
 The report said the cost of doubling the renewable share by 2030 would be $290bn a year, but the annual net savings from reducing pollution and emissions on human health and agriculture would be between $1.2tn and $4.2tn.
 “Achieving a doubling is not only feasible, it is cheaper than not doing so,” Irena’s director general Adnan Amin said in a statement.
 “It would create more jobs, save millions of lives from reduced air pollution and set us on a pathway to limit global temperature rise to two degrees as agreed in Paris,” he added.
 Separately on Wednesday, the European Environment Agency said the share of renewable energy in the European Union inched up to 15.2% in 2014 from 15% in 2013, according to preliminary data for 2014, the latest year available."

Scientists meeting in Fairbanks for the Arctic Science Summit warned this week that the area covered by this winter’s Arctic sea ice could be the lowest ever recorded, after three months of extremely warm temperatures and above freezing days at the North Pole.
The international research cruise will set out for the Laptev sea off Siberia, aiming to monitor the sea ice across its entire life cycle – from the time new ice forms in autumn, through the utter darkness of winter, to the melting of ice in the early summer.
Most research voyages in the Arctic take place in the summer months, but this voyage will also operate during the dark winter months, when temperatures plunge to 40F or even 50F below.
“We are going to stick with that piece of ice and track it, as it grows and as it shrinks,” said Matthew Shupe, a researcher at the University of Colorado, who is leading the Mosaic voyage. “The goal is to integrate into the system and see what happens to the ice for an entire year.”
The Mosaic research project will look at the behaviour of the ice – from metre thick chunks of ice that have remained frozen for years to thin sheets that grow and melt within a single season – to try to understand how the winds, clouds, snow and sun are affecting the ice melt. 
“The ice is so diverse. Some of it is thick and rough and dirty, and some of it is very thin,” Shupe said. “And then you have lots of melt ponds.”
The $60m (£41m) research project, involving 40 scientists from the US, Germany and Russia, is expected to launch in October 2019.
In a separate initiative, the World Climate Research Programme and the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, this week offered a 500,000 Swiss franc prize to the team of scientists building an autonomous underwater vehicle (UAV) capable of travelling for 2,000km under the surface of the Arctic or Antarctic sea ice.
The rapid melting of the polar ice caps has injected new urgency into scientists’ efforts to understand the climate systems operating in the Arctic. The bright white ice floating over the Arctic is an important driver of weather in the lower latitudes, according to scientists. 
The loss of Arctic sea ice has already been linked by some scientists to disruptions in the jet stream, and the extreme cold blasts of the “polar vortex”.
 Researchers now anticipate that the Arctic will be open water in the summer months by 2030 or 2040 – although it will continue to freeze over in the winter months.
“Sometime in the 2030s or 2040s time frame, at least for a few days you won’t have ice out there in the dead of summer,” said John Walsh, chief scientist of the International Arctic Research Centre. "

We knew there was a problem … but we ducked the difficult decisions and we did nothing.”
Was the man previously known as the architect of the government’s anti-climate policies about to undergo a dramatic conversion to the green cause? 
No. Osborne’s soaring commitment to future generations heralded only the announcement of a sugar tax. But crunch time is nevertheless coming for the government’s climate policies, and the chancellor will have to decide which side he is on. 
Within the next few weeks, the government must announce the so-called “fifth carbon budget”, the total level of greenhouse gas emissions which the UK will generate in the period 2028-32. 
Under the 2008 Climate Change Act, every five years the government must set a legally-binding cap on the nation’s total emissions for a five-year period, 10-15 years ahead. The aim is to provide certainty to businesses and consumers, to encourage low-carbon investment. The Act requires the government to take the advice of the independent Committee on Climate Change on the appropriate carbon budget level.
The Committee gave its advice on the fifth carbon budget in November, calling on the government to set an emissions target 57% below 1990 levels. This, it argued, would be the cost-effective budget to keep the UK on track towards its statutory goal of an 80% reduction by 2050. 
The government does not have to follow the Committee’s advice. Last time round, in 2011, it did so only after an intense fight between Osborne – who regarded the Committee’s recommendation of a 52% cut by 2025 as economically damaging – and Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrat secretary of state for energy and climate change. The result was an uneasy compromise, in which the advice was provisionally accepted, but was to be reviewed in 2014. In the event, the budget’s 52% reduction was confirmed; but the process had the unsurprising effect of damaging investor confidence in the government’s ambitions. 
That confidence has been rattled even further by the bonfire of climate policies enacted by the Conservative government since the election last year. 
Seventeen separate measures have weakened or reversed previous emissions reductions policies, including the blocking of new onshore windfarms, dramatic reductions in subsidies for solar power, the abolition of the zero carbon homes standard and the ending of the carbon capture and storage programme. 
These measures have pushed the UK even further behind the emissions trajectory required to meet the fourth carbon budget in the 2020s, as the Department of Energy and Climate Change was forced to admit in its recent report to Parliament, and are likely to slash investment in renewables this year. 
For this reason it is pretty certain that, left to his own devices, George Osborne would not wish to accept the Committee on Climate Change’s carbon budget advice this time. With the government already well off track to meet its current targets, a 57% reduction target by 2030 looks even harder to achieve. 
Yet two factors are likely to thwart the Chancellor’s desires. The first is that the carbon budget has to be approved by the House of Lords as well as the Commons. As the government found again only this week when it lost a vote on solar policy, getting its way in the Lords is not guaranteed, and on climate change there is a solid majority in favour of stronger action. 
Second, there is the Paris climate agreement. Last December’s accord adopted a radical new long-term goal to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero in the second half of this century. This makes the case for ambitious medium-term targets even stronger. 
Rather remarkably, the government this week – responding to a cross-party campaign led by Ed Miliband – committed to enshrining the net zero target into British law. It would be accused of rank hypocrisy now if its next act were to resile from the proposed fifth carbon budget. 
So attention is now focused on the forthcoming announcement. Yet in many ways this is not the key moment. The Climate Change Act requires the government not just to adopt a budget, but to publish a plan showing how it will be met. This means the government must come up with a new set of much more ambitious climate policies by the end of the year.
It is testament to the enduring effectiveness of the Climate Change Act – now supported by an ambitious international agreement – that despite the chancellor’s success in repealing previous policies, the government is still going to have to commit to stronger climate action. Poor George will find that he just has to grin and bear it."

 Gore said there was a “tremendous push” for heads of government to formally ink the accord, to keep up momentum for the deal struck by nearly 200 countries in December and to avert the worst impacts of climate change on vulnerable nations.
 “There is an overwhelming amount of hope that the Paris climate agreement could be a turning point towards a more resilient, low-carbon future,” Gore told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. “While the deal is not enough by itself, it is a major step forward.”
 At the Paris climate talks, governments agreed to limit global temperature rise to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial times and pursue efforts to keep it to 1.5C.
 Ségolène Royal, France’s environment minister who recently took over as chair of the UN-led climate negotiations, has said that between 80 and 100 countries are expected to sign the agreement in New York on 22 April.
 The agreement is due to take effect in 2020, but requires at least 55 countries representing at least 55% of global emissions to ratify it first.
 Gore, who was in Manila to lead training for more than 700 local advocates for climate action under an international programme he launched in 2006, praised the efforts of countries at high risk of climate impacts that had pressed for the lower 1.5C cap in Paris, led by the Philippines.
 “I certainly hope that we can meet that 1.5C goal, and I am very grateful to the Philippines for helping to include that goal in the Paris agreement,” Gore said.
 “Conventional economic analysis has convinced many people that it’s not a realistic goal,” he added.
 But “non-conventional analysis that takes into account the unconventional dramatic change in renewable energy competitiveness has convinced others that actually we may have a chance to meet that goal,” he said.
 The key is for countries to switch to renewable energy, Gore said. “With the Paris agreement, we send a signal to the business community that the way to a low-carbon future is going solar or wind or geothermal,” he said.
 As more and more people become aware of the challenges posed by the “climate crisis”, more legal changes can be expected that support action, he noted, citing moves by China to adopt a national carbon emissions trading scheme next year.
 “If you and I had been told three or four years ago that China would have a nationwide cap-and-trade programme, it would have been hard to believe - but they will, and many other countries are moving in the same direction.“
Philippine climate change commission secretary Emmanuel de Guzman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation his country would sign the Paris agreement in April.
 The Philippines has pledged to cut its carbon emissions by 70% from business as usual by 2030, conditional on international financial support, as part of the Paris deal.
 “The agreement tells the world that human rights will be upheld, that the big and powerful have stood up for the small, poor and vulnerable, and that the world is determined to rise to this great challenge,” de Guzman said.
 The Paris accord promises $100bn per year from 2020 to fund projects enabling vulnerable countries to adopt clean energy and adjust to the impacts of climate change such as rising seas and fiercer droughts, floods and storms.
 Gore said rich nations “must do more in helping poor nations to adapt to the changing climate”.
 The Green Climate Fund (GCF), which was set up under the UN talks to support climate action in the developing world, “still needs to be completely funded and I will be among those working to make sure that it is”, Gore added.
 The Nobel Peace Prize winner, who gave an hour-long presentation on climate disruption and its solutions in Manila this week, said there was “basis for genuine hope” that the world can curb climate change.
 “It matters a lot how long it takes to prevail, because we are programming into the Earth’s system a lot of distractive changes every day, so the sooner we make the transition, the less damage we will do,” he said. “But I am filled with hope that we actually will win this struggle.”

To choose the most inappropriate metaphor possible, February 2016 would have been enough to bring a lot of climate watchers out in a cold sweat.
Figures from Nasa using thermometers and ocean temperature readings showed February was the hottest month on record, by quite a margin.
According to satellite data, the amount of Arctic sea ice also hit an all-time low for this time of year since measurements began in 1979.
Scientists also use satellite data to calculate air temperatures. Climate science contrarians and denialists like these readings because they have not shown as much warming as the more reliable readings on the surface. 
But February also set a new record for global temperatures from satellites. As Joe Romm at Climate Progress noted, “climate science deniers need a new meme”.
These heat records have been variously described as “terrifying”, “jawdropping” and “shocking”.
One climate scientist in particular, Professor Stefan Rahmstorf, appeared to capture the mood with a quote repeated in stories around the world, including here on the Guardian.
“We are in a kind of climate emergency now,” said Rahmstorf, of Germany’s Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. 
But here’s the rub. 
Global warming is proceeding pretty much exactly as predicted
To climate scientists like Rahmstorf, the temperature records being broken right now are not a surprise and, at least according to Rahmstorf, they shouldn’t be seen as an entry point to some terrifying new era (at least not as terrifying as things already are). 
“The media’s view is too short-term,” he told me. “As scientists we want to keep an overview of all the data and the knowledge of how the whole system works.”
What we are seeing is a continuous process of global warming that is superimposed on to the natural variability.
Just like a few cooler years were no reason to talk about a ‘slowdown’ in global warming, it would be wrong to conclude now that a few very hot years are acceleration. Global warming is proceeding pretty much exactly as predicted. 
The fact that temperatures have now shot up again shows that those people who said global warming had stopped were wrong – we said all along that was nonsense.
It is becoming more and more urgent. Time has almost run out to get emissions down. That’s the real emergency.
Rahmstorf does think there is a climate emergency, but he would have made the same assessment at any point in time stretching back many years. The record-breaking February doesn’t change that.
The vast majority of the extra carbon dioxide and heat being added into the Earth’s biosphere ends up in the oceans, where heat has been building up since the early 1970s. 
What the ocean doesn’t take up, is left to accumulate in the atmosphere.
There are two long-term records of the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, measures as parts of CO2 per million parts of the atmosphere (ppm). 
Instruments at Mauna Loa in Hawaii have been showing the accumulation of CO2 since the 1950s.
Last year though saw the biggest jump ever since records started. CO2 is now above 400ppm there.
Australia holds the other long-term record of CO2 in the atmosphere – taken at the aptly-named Cape Grim, in Tasmania. 
Here, the very latest readings for February 2016 show CO2 at 398.71ppm. At some point in the coming months, the Cape Grim data will also tip above 400 ppm.
If you want records, then these readings in Hawaii and Tasmania have been breaking them pretty much year on year for decades. 
According to the Geological Society, there is no known precedent in the history of the Earth for the rate at which we are now liberating CO2, chiefly from burning fossil fuels.
The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has also been sending out warnings since the 1990s. 
Since the early 1990s, there has also been an industry driven by ideologies and fossil fuel interests to convince the public and policy-makers that there is no climate emergency, that global warming might not be happening and, if it is, that it might not be caused by humans.
Recent studies suggest that the “thinktanks” central to this effort continue to challenge the science using their suite of fake experts and cherry-picked pseudo-science.
But there was another chunk of data released in Australia this week suggesting the Australian public might be getting the message that not only is it getting bloody warm out there, but that human activity is behind it. 
For seven years, the polling and communications agency Essential Media Communications has been asking Australians about their views on climate change. 
EMC has asked the public if they think there is “fairly conclusive evidence” that climate change is happening and – more to the point – that it is caused by humans, or if they think it’s all just a “normal fluctuation”. 
This week, the level of acceptance that climate change is happening and is human caused hit an all-time high of 63% in the EMC poll.
Public acceptance that #climate change is human-caused at highest point in 7yrs of polling, says @EssentialVision https://t.co/fHNM0DE4bN
EMC director Peter Lewis says the question of whether the public accepts the evidence that humans are the cause of climate change is “one of the most important indicators in the climate debate”.
He says a low point for this indicator was around late 2010 when Tony Abbott took over the Liberal party leadership from Malcolm Turnbull.
Tony Abbott saw climate change as an opportunity to run an agenda against action. Now we have a better quality of debate.
Lewis thinks that while climate change campaigners will be disappointed at the lack of policy change since Turnbull became prime minister, the “conditions for some sort of action are more conducive now than they were under Abbott”.
“The heat has gone out of the political debate on climate change now, as far as belief is concerned,” says Lewis.
As for the tumbling heat records, Lewis says: “For those that want action on climate change, all this heat becomes a pressure point.”"

The former Labour leader said that the many cuts to green policies enacted since the Conservatives came to power were “deeply, deeply disappointing” and the government had felt “far too able to do the wrong things on climate change”.
The cutting of a pioneering £1bn carbon capture and storage competition last year was one of the worst things the government had done, as well as hasty cuts to solar power subsidies, he said. 
“The truth is the consensus has frayed,” the former energy and climate secretary told an audience at a Guardian Live event in London on Thursday. “That has really accelerated since the general election with many of the things the government has done and they are deeply, deeply disappointing.” 
He said that there was a need to engage with Tories to rebuild that consensus, which helped bring about the Climate Change Act nearly a decade ago.
Unlike the US, where climate change is a politically polarising issue, in the UK there is cross-party agreement about the need to drive down the emissions that drive global warming. “I think most Tory MPs are not climate deniers,” he said.
Miliband admitted that despite international agreements such as the Paris climate deal last December, governments and civil society had collectively failed to mobilise enough action. Acting on air pollution – much of which is caused by the burning of fossil fuels – was one way to tackle climate change more effectively, he said.
“This is a daily killer. We’re allowing it to happen,” said Miliband, before adding that the government’s air clean-up plan published in December was useless. “[Pollution has] got to be made into a political issue.” 
The government is facing an imminent legal challenge to its clean-up plan from the environmental law group, ClientEarth, which is expected to be heard this summer. 
Miliband said he was concerned at the high pollution his children were exposed to at their local school in London. “There should be a ‘million mums and dads march’ about what is happening to our kids,” he said. “If this [were] any other issue, people would be up in arms and on the streets about it.”
The Labour MP said that one thing individuals could do to act on climate change was to ask their pension funds whether they were invested in fossil fuels. “Contact your pension fund … ask them about what they’re doing with your money,” he said. “It might well be that pension is doing disastrous things to your kid’s future.”
Miliband also praised the international campaign to keep fossil fuels buried to avoid dangerous global warming. “I think ‘keep it in the ground’, not just the Guardian but the international campaign, is a major step forward. The interesting and exciting thing about it … is it is a direct challenge to big corporate interests who are ... creating problems for us.”
He said the Paris climate deal agreed last December had gone far beyond his expectations but it was only “the beginning of the beginning”."

The Kon-Tiki 1 and 2 rafts set sail in early January from Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean toward the Chilean port city of Valparaiso with the aim of documenting climate change, pollution and marine life.
But strong currents pulled them far off course and the group sent out a distress signal on Wednesday asking for assistance.
The Chilean navy said in a statement that the rafts were about 1,600km (994 miles) west of Puerto Montt in southern Chile.
The navy sent a merchant ship about 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers) away from the rafts plus a plane to track them from the sky. 
In a statement, Kon-Tiki expedition leader Torgeir Higraff said they were aborting the voyage for safety reasons.
“In a normal year, we would have reached South America by now,” said Higraff. “Instead, we are still 900 nautical miles (1,667 kilometers) from land and the weather forecasts are not promising. The crew is in good health and spirit, and there is no emergency situation.”
The crews include citizens of Norway, Peru, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia and Sweden.
The original Kon Tiki set sail in 1947 from Peru. The expedition was led by Norwegian Thor Heyerdahl, who was seeking to prove his theory that winds and marine currents allowed for prehistoric sailing trips between South America and Polynesia.
After 101 days, Heyerdahl and five crew members reached the island of Raroia in the Tuamoto Archipelago. A book about the expedition was translated into dozens of languages. In 1951, Heyerdahl’s film about the journey won an Oscar."

While this will make for a nice romantic meal, if you truly want to combat climate change, cross off meat, eggs and dairy foods from your shopping list. Foods derived from animals, whether eaten by candlelight or not, require more resources and cause more greenhouse gas emissions than plant-based foods do. Each year, humans kill 60 billion land animals for food – that’s about 7 million animals every hour. All these animals produce massive amounts of waste, which releases powerful greenhouse gases into our atmosphere. The livestock sector is the single largest source of both methane and nitrous oxide, greenhouses gases that are 25 and 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide, respectively. A person who follows a vegan lifestyle produces the equivalent of 50% less carbon dioxide than a meat-eater and uses 1/11th of the oil, 1/13th of the water and 1/18th of the land, which is why the United Nations has stated that a global shift towards a vegan diet is essential to combat the worst effects of climate change. So blow out the candle, turn on the lights and get into the kitchen and cook a vegan meal this Earth Hour.

The science is pretty clear that in some parts of the world, drought and heat waves have and will continue to increase. In other areas, more severe storms along with precipitation and flooding have increased. Drought, heat waves, and floods are examples of changes to weather and climate patterns that will have costs for human society. 
It’s tricky to discern not only whether past extreme weather have changed, but also whether human-caused global warming is a factor. Scientists need high-quality records that go back many decades to see if there is any trend towards increasing or decreasing extreme weather. But weather is quite variable. We can see a rise or fall in extreme weather events with no apparent cause, human or natural. 
While these trends tend to be shorter (over days, weeks, or perhaps months), some trends can have longer durations. How can we identify trends prior to high-quality instrumentation and how can we discern whether the extreme weather we see now is within natural variability? Those are the questions addressed in a new publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research by lead author Dr. Benjamin Cook and his colleagues. 
The title of the article, “Spatiotemporal drought variability in the Mediterranean over the last 900 years” clearly indicates that this study considers almost a millennium of drought records and focuses attention on the Mediterranean region.
The authors use a powerful database called the Old World Drought Atlas to look back in time prior to modern instruments. This atlas is a collection of tree-ring data that measures drought using the Palmer Drought Severity Index. Within the Mediterranean region, there are 106 different tree-ring datasets. These datasets go back various lengths of time but since 1100 CE, the region is accurately sampled. 
The Palmer Drought Severity Index accounts for changes in precipitation as well as changes in evaporation and storage of water within soils. By using this measurement, the authors are able to find multiple droughts throughout the Mediterranean region. Often times, the droughts occur simultaneously in different parts of the region. For instance, droughts are likely to occur at the same in in both the Western Mediterranean (Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia) and in the east (e.g. Greece and Turkey).
What did the authors find regarding the recent droughts in the Mediterranean? Well in recent decades, there has been a persistent and long-duration drought in the regions of Greece and the Levant region. The authors found that although the Greek droughts have been severe, they do not deviate from droughts that have been observed in the past. 
In the Levant region, the recent drought (1998–2012) exceeds what they have seen in the past 900 years. In fact, the recent drought is likely the driest period in the last 900 years and very likely the driest period in the last 500 years.
Here is what Dr. Cook told me: 
To really understand the extent to which climate change is affecting extreme events, like droughts, you need to understand the full range of natural variability. This is why paleoclimate is so important - it gives us a way to extend our understanding way past the relatively short instrumental record of the last 100 to 150 years. In this study, we found that the recent drought in the Levant region of the eastern Mediterranean is likely worse than any comparable period of the last 900 years. This provides some independent support for other studies that have argued that climate change is intensifying drying in the region.
To be clear, this study doesn’t prove that droughts are getting worse, and it doesn’t prove that human emissions of greenhouse gases are making droughts more severe. In fact, proving such statements would be nearly impossible. What this study does is put recent extreme weather into historical context. 
We know human carbon emissions will warm the world. We know that a warmer world affects precipitation and evaporation and this should affect droughts. We are observing that recent droughts are likely to worst on record. We also know that droughts and other extreme weather events have tremendous societal and economic consequences.
Was the recent extreme Mediterranean drought caused by us? Probably. Or, if not caused by us, certainly made worse. Can we prove it? Probably not. However, it is clear to people like myself that study this topic that we have enough information to make decisions about the future planet we want to live in. It is clear that if we want to avoid further increases in extreme weather, we need to reduce our emissions of global-warming gases."

“I think a shift in public opinion and consciousness has been underway for several years now,” Michael Mann, a prominent climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, told the Guardian. 
A spokesman for 350 Action, the political arm of climate activist group 350.org, said meanwhile that politicians who cast doubt on climate science would soon have to take such polling into account. Republicans, he said, “are going to be screwed if they don’t change their tune”.
Polling firm Gallup, which has been tracking public sentiment on the topic annually since 1997, found that 41% of US adults feel warming will pose a “serious threat” to them during their lifetimes. This is the highest level recorded by Gallup, a 4% increase on 2015.
A total of 64% of those polled said they worried about global warming a “great deal” or a “fair amount”, the highest level of recorded concern since 2008. Just 36% of Americans said they did not fret about it, or only worried a little.
The results show a solidifying belief that changes in the climate are under way, with 59% of people thinking so. A record 65% of Americans said global warming was down to greenhouse gases released by human activity – a 10% leap on last year. 
Just 31% said the warming was due to natural causes, the lowest level of such skepticism in 15 years. The March polling involved more than 1,000 adults in all 50 states. 
“I suspect it is a confluence of multiple factors,” said Mann. “The overall warmth in recent years here in the US, Europe and worldwide is part of it. 
“But so too are the increasing number of destructive extreme weather events – floods, droughts, massive wildfires, extreme heat, unprecedented hurricanes … This puts a human face on the issue of climate change.”
Climate change denial is simply no longer plausible, and the American people are recognizing that
Strikingly, concern over global warming has grown across the political divide, with 9% more Republicans saying they worry about the issue “a great deal” compared to last year. 
There remains a partisan divide, however, with just 35% of Republicans blaming human activity for global warming, compared to 85% of Democrats. Among independents, 68% accept humans are the main cause of warming, with 64% saying they worry a lot about the topic.
The surge in public concern over rising temperatures following an abnormally warm winter in the US and the historic Paris climate deal in December, in which nearly 200 nations agreed to curb their emissions in order to avoid dangerous sea level rises, droughts, extreme weather events and food insecurity.
The failed Copenhagen climate talks of 2009, along with with what has been called a “constant barrage” of climate science denial in the media, had made the American public increasingly skeptical of the issue. Polling by Gallup from 2014 found that more than 40% of Americans felt that the seriousness of global warming was exaggerated by the media.
But climate campaigners claim the sheer weight of evidence of a warming world is now beginning to overwhelm the messages of doubt put forward by fossil fuel-aligned groups such as the Heartland Institute and conservative media outlets.
Mann said climate scientists were doing well to get their findings heard “despite the fierce headwind of a millions of dollars fossil fuel-industry funded disinformation campaign we have been fighting for years”.
 “I also think that the profound impacts that climate change is already having and which people are experiencing, has impaired the climate change disinformation machine,” he said. “Climate change denial is simply no longer plausible, and the American people are recognizing that.”
February smashed a century of monthly global temperature records by a “stunning” margin, according to data released by Nasa this week. On Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the US has just experienced its warmest winter on record, with scientists calling the recent heat “staggering” and similar to “something out of a sci-fi movie”.
The warmth, aided by a strong El Niño event, has essentially robbed the Arctic of its winter, reducing ice thickness. In Washington DC, pink cherry blossoms are blooming unusually early; heat sucked up by the oceans is causing havoc for wildlife off the west coast.
Last year was the warmest year on record globally; scientists forecast this record to fall again in 2016. Despite this, climate change has barely featured in the Republican presidential debates. Frontrunner Donald Trump has derided the science as “bullshit” and called climate change a “hoax” invented by the Chinese.
“Sadly, I think that the current Republican party including their likely presidential nominee are entrenched in their climate change denialism,” Mann said. “Only a major political shakeup and realignment is likely to change that. But we might very well see that realignment in this election.”
A spokesman for 350 Action said: “Climate change is no longer a distant threat, but a clear and present danger. People can see the changes underway right in their neighborhood, whether it’s a forest fire bearing down on their backyard or rising seas lapping at their doorstep. 
“I think we’re reaching a tipping point where that concern manifests into an even stronger demand for immediate action from politicians. Republicans are going to be screwed if they don’t change their tune.”"

The Quarterly Update of the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report, which counts emissions in Australia up to September 2015,says greenhouse gas emissions from land clearing have fallen to record lows.
But Guardian Australia reported last month that a report commissioned by the Wilderness Society showed a land clearing surge in Queensland since 2012 has been so big that it would create emissions roughly equal to those saved by the federal government’s emissions reduction scheme, where they paid other farmers more than $670m to stop cutting down trees.
The amount the Queensland government said was cleared in that state alone was almost twice what the federal government said was cleared nationwide in 2014. Queensland reported that almost 300,000ha were cleared in the 2013-14 financial year, while the federal government says less than 170,000ha were cleared nationwide.
Looking at the emissions arising from land clearing, the federal government’s report says there have been only 10.8m tonnes of C02 emitted in 2014 and 2015, and just slightly more in 2013. But the Queensland figures say that state alone produced 38m tonnes of CO2 from land clearing in 2015, up from 25m tonnes in 2013.
In response to those alleged discrepancies reported by Guardian Australia, the Department of Environment added a new explanatory section to the quarterly report.
It raised seven differences in the ways Queensland and the federal government measure land clearing, and concluded that “it is not appropriate to compare the two data sets directly without adjusting the data for these differences”. 
But the report does not explain how those differences could explain such a vastly contrasting result.
“It defies logic. This is a major discrepancy that can’t be brushed off with the same inadequate explanations used so far,” the Wilderness Society’s climate campaign manager, Glenn Walker, said.
 “The government “is either using very creative arithmetic or expects us to believe that the rest of Australia has planted enough trees to suck up the equivalent of about 20 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere,” he said. “That’s more than the emissions from Australia’s dirtiest coal power station Hazelwood.”
Senator Larissa Waters, the Australian Greens climate change spokeswoman, said: “The Turnbull government is using dodgy numbers so it can allow its big fossil fuel donors to keep polluting while claiming to be meeting its woefully inadequate reduction targets set by Tony Abbott.”
Even with the contested drops in emissions from land clearing, the report shows that emissions have risen.
“In a sign of just how dodgy the accounting behind their climate targets is, the government is claiming to be meeting its 2020 target even though climate pollution is up,” Waters said.
The report does not include any projections to 2020 or beyond, and so is unable to back up the government’s claims that Australia’s emissions peaked in 2005. And the government’s own projections from 2015 found they would be much higher by 2035.
“We continue to see emissions steadily growing all the way to 2030, despite current policy,” said Hugh Grossman, the chief executive of the environmental consulting company RepuTex.
“That’s cause for concern, in that current policy – even the [Emissions Reduction Fund] – is not curbing our national emissions growth. If the argument is about how much emissions are growing, we’re a long way from seeing emissions reductions.”
A spokeswoman for Hunt said: “The emissions projections already fully take into account the Queensland government’s land clearing laws and practice.”
“The advice from the Department of the Environment is clear, categorical and absolute,” she said, alleging that the Wilderness Society “wilfully misinterpreted data”.
She said Australia’s accounting system was subject to external scrutiny by a panel of international experts appointed by the UN framework convention on climate change. 
“Is the Wilderness Society now questioning the authority of the UNFCCC?” she asked."

Climate experts revealed that February was the warmest month in recorded history, surpassing the previous global monthly record – set in December. An unprecedented heating of our world is now under way.
With the current El Niño weather event only now beginning to tail off, meteorologists believe that this year is destined to be the hottest on record, warmer even than 2015.
Nor is this jump in global temperature a freak triggered by an unusually severe El Niño, say researchers. “It is the opposite,” said Professor David Vaughan of the British Antarctic Survey. “This is a catch-up of a recent hiatus that has occurred in rising global temperatures. We are returning to normality: rising temperatures. This is an absolute warning of the dangers that lie ahead.”
Those dangers are now being dramatically demonstrated around the globe: drought in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific, which has forced the government there to issue a state of emergency warning; France observed its warmest winter since records began; while the sea ice that has formed in the Arctic this winter is about a million square kilometres less than its average for this time of year.
This latter feature is likely to have particularly profound consequences. “A low sea-ice level in winter will definitely promote a low level of sea ice next summer,” said Vaughan. “Arctic summer ice – which is dwindling dramatically – is changing the region.”
In particular, disappearing sea ice allows more and more ships to get to once unreachable regions in high latitudes. As a result, plans to drill for oil and gas in the Arctic – a prospect that horrifies many scientists and environmental groups – are being prepared by most major oil companies.
Last month’s jump in global temperatures represents an increase of 1.35C above the average temperature level for the period 1951-80 and 1.63C above pre-industrial levels, taking global temperature for the month above the 1.5C rise that last year’s Paris climate was supposed to prevent. However, Professor Richard Betts, head of climate impact research at Exeter University, sounded a note of caution. “Last month’s figure is a one-off and it remains to be seen if temperatures are going to continue to rise this steeply,” he said. “We are still not at an established 1.5C rise, but there is no doubt this is a worrying sign.”
Scientists and politicians are keen to hold global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels because they fear that a world that warms to such a level will experience severe loss of ice, particularly from Greenland’s massive shield of glaciers, and that the melting will in turn trigger considerable rises in sea levels.
Scientists warn there are many island states in the Pacific that will simply disappear if the planet undergoes that sort of warming. In addition, if the temperature increases to 1.5C, it will combine with ocean acidification driven by rising carbon dioxide emissions to dissolve the world’s already threatened coral reefs. “That is why last month’s temperature level was so significant – and worrying,” added Betts.
The Indonesian government announced last week it was taking emergency action to deal with an alarming rise in the number of fire-risk danger spots across the country. Last October forest fires blanketed Indonesia and neighbouring Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines in smoke and haze. Dozens died from burns or toxic fumes. The fires were initially triggered by farmers clearing land but spread uncontrollably because vegetation had dried with the advent of El Niño last October. This, in turn, occurred against a background of global warming linked to rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. The result was a conflagration that cost Indonesia billions of dollars. Now some of the worst affected regions, East Kalimantan and Riau, have reported a worrying return in numbers of fires and hotspots. As a result, the government has announced that it is gearing up to deal with outbreaks of fire.
“With rising global temperatures caused by carbon emissions, El Niño helped to turn Indonesia into a tinder box,” said Professor Richard Betts, head of climate impact research at Exeter University. “That threat could soon return.”
Gillian Mellsop, Unicef representative to Ethiopia, is under no illusions about what is happening to the country: it is experiencing one of the worst droughts in its history. More than 10 million people need emergency food assistance, she told the Observer. In particular, an estimated 435,000 children under five will need treatment for severe acute malnutrition. Nor is Mellsop in any doubt about the reason for this crisis. “Ethiopia has been hit by a double blow, both from a change to the rainy seasons that have been linked to long-term climate change and now from El Niño, which has potentially led the country to one of the worst droughts in decades,” she said.
“As carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere, background temperatures rise. Each new El Niño then superimposes itself at a hotter level and so triggers more and more damage.”
Last year, with the rise of El Niño, Ethiopia’s rains failed. Crops withered and cattle died. One estimate suggests that 5.8 million people now need help with water and sanitation provision, and 3.9 million children and adolescents cannot get access to education because of the drought.
No region on the planet has warmed as much as the Arctic. In some areas temperatures almost 7C above average have been recorded. Sea ice cover in the Arctic – which should be reaching its maximum in a couple of weeks – last month stood at a record low for the second consecutive month. Similarly in summer, sea ice cover has dwindled. Overall, the Arctic’s sea ice cap has shrunk by nearly a third since 1979, according to the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre. And that is a real problem. Ice is the life support platform on which Inuit and local wildlife depend.
Sea ice allows indigenous people to travel on snowmobiles to visit relatives in winter. Last week the Guardian reported on one couple in Alaska who narrowly escaped when their snowmobile plunged into soft ice that would normally have been frozen hard. Similarly, permafrost is melting and buildings are collapsing while wildlife species– including polar bears – are suffering from the disappearance of the ice platforms on which they once relied for hunting or protection.
Across the Arctic, the fabric of life is disintegrating.
Across the planet, nations have experienced a wide variety of impacts as the world has gone through unprecedented heating. According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, most of Earth’s land surfaces were warmer than average, with record warmth notable across various areas of South America, much of southern Africa, southern and eastern Europe, around the Urals of Russia, and most of south-east Asia, down to northern Australia.
A vast region stretching from central Russia into eastern Europe, along with most of Alaska, experienced February temperatures more than 5C above the average for 1981 to 2010.
New Zealand (1) observed its second warmest month since national records began while in Toronto, Canada, (2)temperatures reached 16C, the highest temperature ever for February. Similarly, the average February temperature in Venezuela and northern Colombia (3) was about 3C higher than the 1981-2010 average. Not every nation enjoyed the heat, however. Temperatures were below average in southern Argentina (4), for example. Similarly, all official reporting stations in Iceland recorded below average temperatures for the month. The average sea surface temperature for December to February was 0.84C above the 20th century average of 15.8C, with record highs for large swaths of the tropical Pacific Ocean (5), various regions of the North and South Atlantic, much of the Indian Ocean, and the Barents Sea in the Arctic (6).
Meteorologists noted strong El Niño conditions across equatorial Pacific in February although temperatures began to drop from the highs of 2015 suggesting it was coming to an end."

The first four days of March saw maximum temperatures in much of the country 4C above average – and 8C to 12C above average in most of southeastern Australia – the report said.
Despite summer being over, the New South Wales/Victorian border towns of Echuca and Tocumwal suffered the longest, hottest spell in their recorded history, with eight consecutive days of 38C or above.
It follows a summer that delivered Perth more 40C days than ever before and 39 consecutive days over 26C for Sydney, a record that more than doubled the previous high.
The Climate Council said the Australian findings reflected worldwide heat records that, among other impacts, threatened the Great Barrier Reef with widespread coral bleaching and drove a record low in Arctic sea ice cover last month.
The report linked prolonged local heat to destructive fires in Tasmania’s world heritage forests and a major algae outbreak in the Murray river. 
It argued that evidence of escalating heat impacts lent urgency to climate mitigation efforts that remain politically contentious in Australia, including a moratorium on new coalmines.
“As Australians continue to suffer from more frequent and worsening extreme heat events, the path to tackling climate change is becoming more urgent: no new coalmines can be built, existing coalmines and coal-fired power stations must be phased out and renewable energy must be scaled up rapidly,” the report said.
The report’s release on Sunday came as the federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, took an aerial tour over the Great Barrier Reef to inspect the impact of coral bleaching.
Hunt was due to address reporters after the flyover with the chief executive of the Great Barrier Reef marine park authority, Russell Reichelt. 
Tim Flannery, the former Australian climate commissioner who helped found the Climate Council after the commission was abolished by the Abbott government in 2013, said world heat records were an ominous sign the world had shifted from “climate change concern to climate change consequences”.
“Scientists have been voicing their concerns for decades and now we are seeing the consequences,” Flannery said. “Our internationally renowned Great Barrier Reef is already experiencing widespread coral bleaching due to record sea surface temperatures. 
“Our world heritage ancient forests in Tasmania have been razed by bushfires sparked by tinderbox conditions driven by climate change.
“And, just weeks after health experts warned of the grave dangers posed to Australians through more frequent and severe heatwaves, we’ve seen hospitals in Perth overwhelmed after four consecutive days over 40°C. 
“The window of time we have to act is closing. The world is acting but Australia is so far behind.”
The Climate Council’s chief executive, Amanda McKenzie, said there had been no “substantive policy announcements” by the federal government since a UN summit in Paris agreed to rapidly cut fossil fuel emissions.
She called for an “orderly closure of our ageing and polluting coal-fired power plants” to make way for renewables.
McKenzie said extreme heat events affected farmers’ harvests and pushed Australia’s bushfire season “well into autumn”.
 Heat records this month included 10 consecutive days above 30C for Canberra and Melbourne’s hottest March night on record at 38.6C.
Brisbane researchers this month predicted the world economy was on track to produce enough carbon emissions by 2020 to lock in a 1.5C rise above pre-industrial levels, and enough by 2030 to lock in a 2C rise."

But Apple’s recent decision to issue its first green bond suggests that this type of investment could play a key role in reining in global warming.
Apple’s $1.5bn green bond, announced last month, will fund several initiatives, including the company’s conversion to 100% renewable energy, installation of more energy efficient heating and cooling systems and an increase in the company’s use of biodegradable materials. A green bond, like a typical bond, is simply a way to borrow money, but it’s issued specifically to fund environmental projects. 
Apple’s green bond reflects a growing corporate concern about the economic impact of climate change. Businesses are responsible for the majority of manmade greenhouse gas emissions, which are driving up average temperatures worldwide and affecting many companies’ bottom lines. Some, including Apple, are realizing the need to invest in environmental resources, such as watersheds or forests, to protect the sources of their products.
Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, told Reuters that the company decided to issue its green bond after December’s UN Climate Summit in Paris, during which hundreds of companies pledged to fight climate change. With its bond sale, Apple has become the largest US company to have issued a green bond – although Toyota still holds the crown for the largest corporate green bond ever offered in the US with its $1.75bn green bond issued in 2014.
The green bond market is still in its infancy. According to Climate Bonds Initiative, a UK nonprofit that tracks the market, the first green bond was issued in 2007, and the first corporate issuance didn’t come along until 2013. Since then, a handful of high profile companies have jumped on the bandwagon, including EDF, a French power company, and Bank of America, which used the proceeds to loan money to cities and other businesses for installing solar panels, wind turbines and LED lighting.
For global companies, changing operations to deal with the impact of climate change requires a lot of time and money. As a result, many companies have traditionally been unwilling to invest in renewable energy or other climate projects without a significant return on investment. For example, Apple will need to raise billions of dollars to achieve its ambitious plans to reduce its environmental impact. Last year, it committed to spend $848m over 25 years to buy enough solar-generated electricity to offset all the electricity used in its corporate and retail operations in California.
While green bonds have commonly been used to fund renewable energy projects, an increasing amount of money is going to projects that help offices and other buildings use water and other energy more efficiently, said Andrew Whiley, a spokesman for Climate Bonds Initiative. Electric cars and low-carbon transportation also are becoming popular, he added. 
Globally, the green bond market is expected to keep growing. According to Climate Bonds Initiative, the market, including government-issued bonds, reached an all-time high of $41.8bn in 2015, up from $36.6bn in 2014 and $11bn in 2013. Financial services company HSBC predicts between $55bn and $80bn worth of green bonds will be issued around the world in 2016, while the Climate Bonds Initiative believes sales will exceed $100bn.
Toyota’s green bonds demonstrate a growing investor interest in transportation in particular. The company has issued two green bonds totaling $3bn since 2014, and has used the money to fund leases and loans for its fuel efficient cars, which it defines as those that get 35 miles per gallon or use hybrid engines.
Clinton Moloney, sustainability advisory leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that as the effects of climate change become more devastating and widespread, green bond projects could grow more complex. For instance, proceeds can be used to build a seawall to help protect the San Francisco Bay from rising sea levels, or to restore marshlands that help to soak up runoffs during a big storm.
“We can do environmental projects that use concrete and steel, or we can think of nature based solutions as well,” Moloney said. “Evaluating those projects needs to be more sophisticated. That’s where we’re headed.”
Another issue facing green bonds is transparency. For investors who aren’t only interested in making money, figuring out the environmental impact of their investments while ensuring that the money is spent as promised can be difficult to accomplish. As a result, a number of organizations have come up with rules and metrics to help both corporate borrowers and investors track and understand how the money is spent.
One such effort comes from the International Market Association, which has worked with investment banks or other investment firms such as JPMorgan Chase, BlackRock and World Bank to create a set of guidelines called the Green Bond Principles. The guidelines define the types of environmental benefits that could be covered by a green bond, such as reducing pollution or conserving wildlife. They also recommend an annual reporting by the bond issuers on how they use the proceeds.
“The more confidence investors can feel in the green bona fides of a project, the better the marketplace will operate,” said PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Moloney.
For its part, Toyota is communicating directly with investors to keep its green bonds transparent. To show investors that the money from its green loans is being spent properly, it publishes a monthly report to show the amount spent on financing leases and loans for qualifying models, such as the Prius.
“Investors were able to see how the funds were being deployed and make their own determination, [and] whether it was consistent with what we had promised,” said Adam Stam, national manager of secured funding at Toyota Financial Services."

It’s difficult to see any ‘pause’ or slowdown in the global warming over the past 50 years.
To put the current temperatures into context, prior to last October, monthly global surface temperatures had not been more than 0.96°C hotter than the 1951–1980 average, according to Nasa. The past 5 months have been 1.06°C, 1.03°C, 1.10°C, 1.14°C, and 1.35°C hotter than that average, absolutely destroying previous records. Estimates from Noaa are in broad agreement with those from Nasa.
Right now, the Earth’s average surface temperature is hotter than it’s been in thousands of years; potentially even longer.
We’re currently at the peak of a very strong El Niño event, which has brought warm water up to the ocean surface. That’s certainly played a major role in the current record-breaking temperatures. The hottest years are almost invariably years with El Niño events, although 2014 was the first year in decades to set a temperature record without an El Niño.
For comparison, the current El Niño event is very similar to a previous one in 1997–1998. That event made 1998 by far the hottest year on record at the time, and it’s why contrarians often cherry pick temperatures over the past 18 years – the abnormally hot 1998 was 18 years ago.
However, the past 6 months have been 0.43°C hotter than the corresponding months in 1997–1998. So clearly, while El Niño is a big contributor to the current record-shattering temperatures, human-caused global warming is playing a major role as well. Climate scientist Michael Mann attributed the record to approximately 50% human influences, and 50% a combination of El Niño and natural weather fluctuations.
Last December, 195 countries signed the COP21 international climate agreement in Paris. Graham Readfearn summarized the agreement for The Guardian:
The guts of the agreement hang off the so-called “long-term goal” that commits almost 200 countries to hold the global average temperature to “well below 2°C” above pre-industrial levels and to “pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C”.
Depending on how exactly we define “pre-industrial,” February temperatures were between 1.5 and 2°C hotter than those in pre-industrial times. So, we’re already starting to tread on thin ice, in the range that the global community has deemed dangerously hot.
However, since we’re at the peak of an El Niño, as they did after 1998, global surface temperatures will temporarily go back down once this event is over. That is, until human-caused global warming pushes them up to and beyond these temperatures once again in the near future. As climate scientists Steve Sherwood and Stefan Rahmstorf wrote,
This is the true climate emergency: it is getting more difficult with each passing year for humanity to prevent temperatures from rising above 2℃. February should remind us how pressing the situation is.
In the meantime, we’re getting a glimpse at the future climate consequences of our carbon pollution. Just to name a few, Africa is being battered by heat and drought, with more than 36 million people facing hunger across the southern and eastern parts of the continent as a result. Droughts in Vietnam and Zimbabwe have cost these countries 4% and 12% of their GDP, respectively. Arctic ice is in poor shape as a result of the region’s warmest-recorded winter. Australia has been breaking heat records as well, with 39 consecutive days in Sydney above 26℃ (double the previous record). And a massive coral bleaching event appears likely on the Great Barrier Reef.
Arctic heat so extreme this winter that govt. mappers ran out of colors https://t.co/Ne9igrf9VD pic.twitter.com/5DHkUmsfPK
These are some of the reasons why temperatures 1.5–2°C above pre-industrial levels are considered dangerous. This intense heat is not good for agriculture, ice, sea levels, or coral reefs. There’s still time for us to prevent such high temperatures from becoming the norm, but that time is running out. 
Fortunately there’s been some good news that we may be on the verge of getting carbon pollution and global warming under control, but we have to continue with this progress and avoid reversing it. People seem to be grasping the problem just in time: a record number of Americans (41%) now see global warming as a threat, and almost two-thirds realize that humans are responsible. California is providing a blueprint for solving the problem, as the state’s carbon pollution has fallen despite a growing population, as its economy has thrived.
We’re capable of solving the climate problem, but with temperatures already approaching dangerous thresholds, the time to act is now."

 The “alarming” and “unprecedented” rate of climate change is “sending a powerful message to world leaders”, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has warned.
Releasing its Status of the Global Climate report, the WMO – a United Nations body – detailed the string of climate and weather records that were broken in 2015, including global temperature records, exceptional rainfall, devastating droughts, unusual cyclone activity and intense heatwaves.
“The year 2015 will stand out in the historical record of the global climate in many ways,” said WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas in the report.
“The future is happening now,” he said in a statement released alongside the report. “The alarming rate of change we are now witnessing in our climate as a result of greenhouse gas emission is unprecedented in modern records.”
Global surface temperatures in 2015 shattered all previous records by a wide margin, the report shows, sitting 0.76C above the 1961-90 average. Temperatures over land, over the ocean and in the top 700 and 2,000 metres of the ocean all set new records.
“Our planet is sending a powerful message to world leaders to sign and implement the Paris agreement on climate change and cut greenhouse gases now before we pass the point of no return,” Taalas said.
Dr Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick from the University of New South Wales in Australia said the language was very strong for the WMO. “They are usually very conservative,” she said.
“We have to put this report in context. 2014 was the hottest year on record to date too. We’ve had something like 15 out of the 16 hottest years on record since the turn of the millennium,” she said. “Things aren’t getting better, they’re getting much much worse, and the tone of the report reflects this.”
Perkins-Kirkpatrick said the statistics revealed an emergency. “We haven’t experienced a month that has been below average for over 30 years … I think people forget climate change started happening a long time ago, before a lot of us were even born. Honestly, it’s frightening.”
The report follows Nasa figures showing that February 2016 was the most unseasonably hot month on record by a massive margin, which climate scientists described as “shocking”. 
Although a strong El Niño was pushing temperatures up, it was only part of the story, since the temperatures were much higher than in 1998, when the world went through a comparable or even stronger El Niño.
Dr Wenju Cai, from the CSIRO in Melbourne, said the El Niño was probably releasing some of the temperature that had been stored in the ocean during the so-called hiatus. “If you have a hiatus in previous years, more heat is stored in the ocean and that could make it a bigger release.” 
The world was playing catch-up for the warming that had been less visible since about 1998, he said.
“The startlingly high temperatures so far in 2016 have sent shockwaves around the climate science community,” said David Carlson, director of the World Climate Research Programme.
Taalas said “urgent and far-reaching measures to cut carbon dioxide emissions” were needed to avoid temperature rises of 3C. He said investment in disaster early warning systems was essential to help communities adapt to climate change."

We’d love to hear your responses to these stories, and any others you’ve read recently: share your thoughts in the comments below.
Seattle’s mayor Ed Murray wants to dramatically increase electric vehicle (EV) use in the city – by 15,000 cars by 2025 – in order to halve greenhouse-gas emissions from the city’s vehicle fleet. The so-called “aggressive plan”, which was announced at the Climate Leadership Conference earlier this month, responds to the fact that transportation makes up the largest share (65%) of Seattle’s greenhouse gas emissions – and aims to significantly improve the city’s air quality. 
The strategy, termed “Drive Clean”, involves electrifying more of the city’s public transport vehicles as well as promoting the use of private EVs – and relies on the use of Seattle City Light’s carbon-neutral electric energy. Murray hopes that about 120,000 gallons of gas burned in the city fleet each year will be replaced with electricity. 
As Sydney Brownstone writes in The Stranger, Seattle will also “make sure the project is equitable – meaning that the benefits of the program are distributed to the communities that are most adversely impacted by pollution.” 
Fictional it may be, but Batman’s hometown has a powerful place in our collective imaginary, the ultimate future metropolis. Writing in uncube, Elvia Wilk explores the birth of Gotham – from the its genesis as the nickname for New York to the manifestation of Hugh Ferriss’s dark and spellbinding drawings of the future city. “The effect of Ferriss’ aesthetic cannot be underestimated,” writes Wilk, “not just on the DC Comics universe, but on urbanism itself.” Nevertheless, writes Wilk, there are distinctions between his visions and the Caped Crusader’s city:
Batman’s Gotham is no modernist city of glass and steel. It’s uneven and post-industrial, with neoclassical remnants of crested, crumbling brick façades wedged alongside gleaming skyscrapers. It is undoubtedly a city where the authorities haven’t been able to control growth, and the modernists haven’t won out against the rise and decline of industry or managed to erase the layers of architectural history. Batman’s Gotham may be highly futuristic, but it’s also deeply nostalgic.
Ever thought your city skyline could do with the addition of a skyscraper shaped like a woman’s leg wearing fishnets and heels, called “Top Sexy Tower”? If so, Vasily Klyukin might be the architect for you. CityLab takes a look at the wacky, tacky architecture of this Russian billionaire – who has also designed buildings shaped as ships, cobras and rockets. Tellingly, none of these projects have actually broken ground. 
We also recommend heading to Klyukin’s website to read his descriptions of his own designs. Regarding Top Sexy Tower, a putative Manhattan project: “The entire NY is beautified with skyscrapers that look like the long sexy legs of those top models who live and work here ... The higher it gets, the more breathtaking it is and this is applicable to the skyscrapers, as well as to the models’ legs.”
Also in CityLab, there’s a great gallery of another kind of kitsch (and in this case largely inoffensive) architecture known as “Cinderella homes”, which gained popularity across the US in the 1950s. Now, however, many stand looking forlorn and forgotten in suburban neighbourhoods – so much for happy ever after.
Old Nokia mobiles may be the butt of jokes in this smartphone-reliant era, but the company’s decline hasn’t just changed what we clutch in our hands. As the BBC World Service reports, the Finnish city of Tampere – which once benefitted from the firm’s role in turning the country’s economy into one of the most prosperous in the world – has been hit hard by the shifting industry.
“It was the backbone of everything here,” says Kari Kankaala, director of economic and urban development for the city of Tampere. “The universities relied on collaboration with Nokia, the subcontractors depended on Nokia, the kids relied on being employed by Nokia. Now we have an horrendous unemployment situation.” Meanwhile the small town of Nokia – which gave the tech firm its name – can be found 15 minutes down the road from Tampere, just a quiet backwater with a pub and discount supermarket.
“Inequality is enforced in Memphis, and it always has been,” writes Preston Lauterbach in a powerful Places essay, which traces the history of racial segregation in Tennessee’s largest city through the lens of housing. 
Among large US metro areas, Memphis ranks first in both overall and child poverty – and nearly 80% of the poor are black. From decades of biased housing policy that targeted homes for demolition under the banner of “slum clearances” to the burning of a house with cultural significance for the city’s black community, Lauterbach analyses how racial inequality has played out in Memphis at a neighbourhood level. 
Can we plan our cities to improve mental wellbeing? Writing in the Journal of Urban Design and Mental Health, Rhiannon Corcoran and Graham Marshall argue that there has been little considered thinking on the design of cities and neighbourhoods to match people’s needs, with urban development focusing instead on quotas and profit. 
As the NHS seeks to create 10 new “healthy towns” across the UK, the article suggests that prioritising community wellbeing can transform the planning and development of the places we live in – but that we should reconsider the simplistic garden city approach, which promised healthy designs and didn’t fully deliver.

Alejandro González Iñárritu’s stark and harrowing western scored a hugely impressive $33m on debut at the Chinese box office this weekend, pushing the film’s worldwide debut close to $500m. At a Beijing news conference to promote the film, DiCaprio praised China for moving towards renewable energy in order to reduce carbon emissions.
“As we all know, the United States and China are the two biggest contributors, and I think that China has made radical movements forward as far as alternative energy and ways to be sustainable,” said the actor and green campaigner. “I really think that China can be the hero of the environmental movement, they can be the hero of the climate change movement.
“They have an opportunity to change the world and I have all the confidence in the world that that is their intention.”
DiCaprio is a popular figure in China, largely due to local filmgoers’ fondness for James Cameron’s 1997 romantic disaster epic Titanic. He is known there as Xiao Li, or Little Lee. 
The world’s second largest box office after North America, China is one of the final territories to see Iñárritu’s Oscar-winning film. DiCaprio won the best actor prize at February’s Academy Awards, with the Mexican film-maker taking his second best director prize in a row and Emmanuel Lubezki taking his third consecutive best cinematography Oscar.
In related news, China has begun cracking down on box office fraud in the wake of reports last year that the record-breaking homegrown animation Monster Hunt cheated its way to the top of the 2015 annual chart (figures have since been revised downwards). Authorities have banned distributors of the martial arts movie Ip Man 3 from releasing movies for an entire month after a government investigation revealed the firm inflated ticket sales by as much as $8.7m.
The Chinese box office is on course to overtake North America as early as next year, but a series of scandals involving fake reporting of sales have convinced regulators that reform is needed to ensure figures are genuine."

Higher temperatures in France are producing exceptional vintages, but scientists have warned that if the trend continues too long, the current run of outstanding grape harvests could end.
Records dating back more than 500 years show that wine grapes across France are now being harvested two weeks earlier on average than they were in the past.
Wine grape maturation is accelerated by warmer temperatures and delayed by rain, and earlier harvests are generally associated with higher quality wines.
The main reason for the change is climate change pushing up temperatures in the absence of drought, it is claimed.
Dr Elizabeth Wolkovich, from Harvard University in the US, who took part in the research published in the journal Nature Climate Change, said: “There are two big points in this paper. The first is that harvest dates are getting much earlier, and all the evidence points to it being linked to climate change. Especially since 1980, when we see a major turning point for temperatures in the northern hemisphere, we see harvest dates across France getting earlier and earlier.
“The bad news is that if we keep warming the globe we will reach a tipping point.
“The trend, in general, is that earlier harvests lead to higher-quality wine, but you can connect the dots here ... we have several data points that tell us there is a threshold we will probably cross in the future where higher temperatures will not produce higher quality.”
There is a French word, “terroir”, that vintners use to describe the set of environmental factors affecting wine grape quality.
It is because of terroir that the wine grape is one of the best barometers of climate change, say the scientists.
“At the heart of a good wine is climate,” said Wolkovich. “So the grapes are a very good canary in the coal mine.
“You want to harvest when the grapes are perfectly ripe, when they’ve had enough time to accumulate just the right balance between acid and sugar.
“For much of France, there have been times when it’s difficult to get the exact harvest date growers want because the climate wasn’t warm enough that year. But climate change means the grapes are maturing faster.”
In the past, early wine grape harvests have always required both above-average air temperatures and the added kick of a late-season drought, leading to warmer, drier soils and rapidly-maturing grapes.
Prior to the 1980s, droughts were necessary for early harvests - without them, vineyards could not quite get hot enough.
Since then, overall air warming alone has pushed summer temperatures over the early harvest threshold, the research shows. Throughout the 20th century France warmed by about 1.5C, and the upward climb has continued.
Lead author Dr Benjamin Cook, of the US space agency Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said: “Now, it’s become so warm thanks to climate change, grape growers don’t need drought to get these very warm temperatures.
“After 1980, the drought signal effectively disappears. That means there’s been a fundamental shift in the large-scale climate under which other, local factors operate.”
The wine-growing regions affected included some familiar names, among them Alsace, Champagne, Burgundy and Languedoc.
Vineyards in these areas grow finicky pinot noirs, chardonnays and other varieties that thrive within specific climate niches and are especially good when they can be harvested early.
“So far, a good year is a hot year,” said Wolkovich. But she pointed out that a foretaste of what might be to come occurred in 2003 when a searing heat wave led to the earliest French grape harvest ever recorded.
In that year, grapes were picked a full month ahead of their usual time. However, the wines they produced were mediocre.
Wolkovich added: “That may be a good indicator of where we’re headed. If we keep pushing the heat up, vineyards can’t maintain that forever.”
Across the world, experts have found that each 1C of warming brings grape harvests forward roughly six or seven days.
A 2011 study led by Dr Yves Tourre, from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, suggested that a combination of natural climate variability and human-induced warming could force pinot noir grapes out of many parts of Burgundy.
Other reports indicated that Bordeaux might lose its cabernets and merlots.
One controversial study published in 2013 predicted that by 2050 some two-thirds of today’s wine regions may no longer have climates suitable for the grapes they now grow.
As the world gets hotter, famous-name wine grapes might find unlikely new homes, possibly even making southern England the new Champagne region, according to some experts."

A widespread switch to vegetarianism would cut emissions by nearly two-thirds, it said.
In three decades, emissions related to agriculture and food production are likely to account for about half of the world’s available “carbon budget” - the limited amount of carbon dioxide and its equivalents that can be poured into the atmosphere if we are to hold global warming to no more than 2C.
While energy generation, transport and buildings have long been a target for governments, businesses and campaigners looking to reduce emissions, the impact from food production has often been left out. But on current trends, with intensive agriculture increasingly geared towards livestock rearing, food production will be a major concern.
The research, led by scientists at the Oxford Martin School, found that shifting to a mostly vegetarian diet, or even simply cutting down meat consumption to within accepted health guidelines, would make a large dent in greenhouse gases. 
Adhering to health guidelines on meat consumption could cut global food-related emissions by nearly a third by 2050, the study found, while widespread adoption of a vegetarian diet would bring down emissions by 63%.
The additional benefit of going further, with the widespread adoption of veganism, brought a smaller incremental benefit, with emissions falling by about 70% in the projections.
Such steps would also save lives, argued Dr Marco Springmann, lead author of the study, entitled Analysis and valuation of the health and climate change co-benefits of dietary change, and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Tuesday. 
“Imbalanced diets, such as diets low in fruits and vegetables and high in red and processed meat, are responsible for the greatest health burden globally and in most regions,” he said. “At the same time, the food system is responsible [currently] for more than a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore a major driver of climate change.”
More than 5m premature deaths could be avoided globally by 2050 if health guidelines on meat consumption were followed, rising to more than 7m with a vegetarian diet and 8m on veganism. These steps, if widely followed, could also reduce global healthcare costs by $1bn a year by mid-century.
Intensive livestock-rearing is a major cause of greenhouse gases, in part because of the methane produced by the animals and the massive slurry pits that accompany large farms. It also diverts water and grains to animal-rearing, which is less efficient than directing the grains towards direct human consumption.
Non-intensive rearing of livestock, such as raising animals on marginal land, could be “an interesting proposal” that would allow meat-eating at lower levels with less environmental harm, said Springmann. “That is one of the discussions that could spring up as a result of our research.”
Individuals were often confused by health messaging, food labelling and the availability of foodstuffs, he added, meaning that many people do not realise the harm that over-consumption of meat may be doing them. As populations around the world have grown more prosperous, with the rise of middle class societies in areas that have emerged from poverty, people have tended to switch their diets to include more meat as they have grown richer.
Governments agreed at a landmark climate conference in Paris in December to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration of an even lower target, of 1.5C. However, the exact measures that will be required to meet the global goal, and nationally set emissions targets, have yet to be fully worked out.
Linking health and climate change in challenging our eating habits could have more effect than focusing on each of these issues alone, said Springmann. “By combining the two benefits, you have a more powerful impact. I think this will make more of an impression,” he said.
“We do not expect everybody to become vegan. But the climate change impacts of the food system will require more than just technological changes. Adopting healthier and more environmentally sustainable diets can be a large stop in the right direction. 
“The size of the projected benefits should encourage individuals, industry and policymakers to act decisively to make sure that what we eat preserves our environment and health,” he said."

The revelation shows the world has entered “uncharted territory” and that the consequences for life on land and in the oceans may be more severe than at any time since the extinction of the dinosaurs.
It comes as the World Meteorological Organisation released its Status of the Climate Report detailing a string of weather and climate records that were broken in 2015. 
“The future is happening now,” said WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas in a statement released alongside the report. “The alarming rate of change we are now witnessing in our climate as a result of greenhouse gas emission is unprecedented in modern records.”
Scientists have already warned that unchecked global warming will inflict “severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts” on people and the natural world.
But the new research shows how unprecedented the current rate of carbon emissions is, meaning geological records are unable to help predict the impacts of current climate change. Scientists have recently expressed alarm at the heat records shattered in the first months of 2016.
“Our carbon release rate is unprecedented over such a long time period in Earth’s history, [that] it means that we have effectively entered a ‘no-analogue’ state,” said Prof Richard Zeebe, at the University of Hawaii, who led the new work. “The present and future rate of climate change and ocean acidification is too fast for many species to adapt, which is likely to result in widespread future extinctions.”
Many researchers think the human impacts on the planet has already pushed it into a new geological era, dubbed the Anthropocene. Wildlife is already being lost at rates similar to past mass extinctions, driven in part by the destruction of habitats.
“The new results indicate that the current rate of carbon emissions is unprecedented … the most extreme global warming event of the past 66m years, by at least an order of magnitude,” said Peter Stassen, a geologist at the University of Leuven in Belgium, and who was not involved in the work.
The new research, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, examined an event 56m years ago believed to be the biggest release of carbon into the atmosphere since the dinosaur extinction 66m years ago. The so-called Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) saw temperatures rise by 5C over a few thousand years.
But until now, it had been impossible to determine how rapidly the carbon had been released at the start of the event because dating using radiometry and geological strata lacks sufficient resolution. Zeebe and colleagues developed a new method to determine the rate of temperature and carbon changes, using the stable isotopes of oxygen and carbon.
It revealed that at the start of the PETM, no more than 1bn tonnes of carbon was being released into the atmosphere each year. In stark contrast, 10bn tonnes of carbon are released into the atmosphere every year by fossil fuel-burning and other human activity. 
“The consequences are likely to be much more severe,” said Zeebe. “If you kick a system very fast, it usually responds differently than if you nudge it slowly but steadily.”
Scientists have warned that climate change may not cause temperature to rise steadily, but that “tipping points” - such as the loss of all Arctic ice or the mass release of methane from permafrost - could see much sharper and more dangerous changes. “If anthropogenic emissions rates have no analogue in Earth’s recent history, then unforeseeable future responses of the climate system are possible,” the researchers concluded.
“In studying one of the most dramatic episodes of global change since the end of the age of the dinosaurs, these scientists show that we are currently in uncharted territory in the rate carbon is being released into the atmosphere and oceans,” said Candace Major, from the US National Science Foundation, which funded the research.
The source of the PETM carbon emissions is thought to be the mass release of methane which had been frozen as hydrates on the ocean floor. It may have been triggered by a smaller initial release of carbon resulting from hot magma pushing into and melting large limestone deposits."

The option – to be considered by the expenditure review committee of cabinet as soon as Tuesday – would provide some certainty to the organisations after the Abbott government sought to abolish them, and then to ban the CEFC from wind farm investments and to cut Arena’s funding and make no new appointments to its board.
Soon after his election in 2013 Abbott said: “The Coalition does not support the CEFC nor its expenditure of $10bn of borrowed money on projects that the private sector deems too risky to invest in” and former treasurer Joe Hockey labelled the CEFC a “giant $10bn slush fund”.
The legislation to abolish the CEFC has been twice rejected by the Senate and is, technically, a double dissolution trigger, but Malcolm Turnbull said on Monday he would not use the bill as a trigger and the government has indicated it will keep the CEFC in some form.
After Turnbull became prime minister the anti-wind farm directive was softened to a request that the CEFC focus on “offshore wind technologies” as well as cities and the built environment. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, has said abolishing the investment bank is still the government’s “long-term” policy but was not likely to pass the Senate.
The CEFC was always been “off balance sheet” – set up as part of the former Labor government’s carbon pricing package effectively as a bank to finance, at commercial rates, proven clean energy projects that the major banks were not funding. 
Arena has been funded by the budget and provides grants to emerging renewable technologies.
In its first budget, the Abbott government announced it would axe Arena, but in a deal with the Palmer United party to get its Direct Action climate policy through the Senate, announced it would keep the agency, but cut or defer almost $1bn of its funding.
The terms of all appointed board members of Arena have now expired and they have not been replaced, leaving it governed by the secretary of the Department of the Environment. 
Hunt has said the new Office of Climate Change and Renewables Innovation, inside the Department of the Environment, “will bring a fresh focus to the role of innovation in supporting emerging renewable and low emissions technologies that will drive down emissions”."

The research, published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, references past climatic conditions, recent observations and future models to warn the melting of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets will contribute to a far worse sea level increase than previously thought.
Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the global sea level is likely to increase “several meters over a timescale of 50 to 150 years”, the paper states, warning that the Earth’s oceans were six to nine meters higher during the Eemian period – an interglacial phase about 120,000 years ago that was less than 1C warmer than it is today.

Global warming of 2C above pre-industrial times – the world is already halfway to this mark – would be “dangerous” and risk submerging cities, the paper said. A separate study, released in February, warned that New York, London, Rio de Janeiro and Shanghai will be among the cities at risk from flooding by 2100.
Hansen’s research, written with 18 international colleagues, warns that humanity would not be able to properly adapt to such changes, although the paper concedes its conclusions “differ fundamentally from existing climate change assessments”.
The IPCC has predicted a sea level rise of up to one meter by 2100, if emissions are not constrained. Hansen, and other scientists, have argued the UN body’s assessment is too conservative as it doesn’t factor in the potential disintegration of the polar ice sheets.
Hansen’s latest work has proved controversial because it was initially published in draft form last July without undergoing a peer review process. Some scientists have questioned the assumptions made by Hansen and the soaring rate of sea level rise envisioned by his research, which has now been peer-reviewed and published.
Michael Mann, a prominent climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, said the revised paper still has the same issues that initially “caused me concern”.
“Namely, the projected amounts of meltwater seem … large, and the ocean component of their model doesn’t resolve key wind-driven current systems (e.g. the Gulf Stream) which help transport heat poleward,” Mann said in an email to the Guardian.
“I’m always hesitant to ignore the findings and warnings of James Hansen; he has proven to be so very prescient when it comes to his early prediction about global warming. That having been said, I’m unconvinced that we could see melting rates over the next few decades anywhere near his exponential predictions, and everything else is contingent upon those melting rates being reasonable.”
Hansen was one of the first scientists to push climate change into the public’s consciousness, following a series of appearances before Congress in the 1980s. He retired from his role at Nasa in 2013 and has become increasingly outspoken about the need to slash emissions, criticizing last year’s Paris climate deal as a “fraud” because it didn’t go far enough.
His new research warns that water gushing from melted glaciers is already influencing important ocean circulations near both poles. The added cold water risks “shutting down” the North Atlantic heat circulation, triggering a series of storms similar to Hurricane Sandy, which hobbled New York City in 2012.
“If the ocean continues to accumulate heat and increase melting of marine-terminating ice shelves of Antarctica and Greenland, a point will be reached at which it is impossible to avoid large-scale ice sheet disintegration with sea level rise of at least several meters,” the paper states. “The economic and social cost of losing functionality of all coastal cities is practically incalculable.”
Hansen said the world was “pretty darned close” to the point of no return, warning that emissions need to be cut by about 6% a year in order to stabilize the climate.
“What we are threatening to do to young people is irreversible, it’s irreparable harm,” he said. “This is something they didn’t cause but will be out of their control. Among the top experts, there’s agreement that this is very urgent, we can’t continue on this path hoping that emissions will go down, we have to take actions.”
Hansen reiterated his call for a global tax on carbon, denying that the roles of scientist and advocate for change are conflicted.
“This isn’t advocacy, this is what is needed,” he said. “We are allowing fossil fuel companies to use the atmosphere as a free waste dump. If scientists don’t say it then politicians will tell you what’s needed and that will be based upon politics rather than science. I don’t see any reason to not make the whole story clear, or to draw a line and say ‘I’m not going to step beyond this.’”
Tom Wagner, Nasa’s program scientist for the cryosphere, said Hansen has done an “amazing job” in providing a “provocative” piece of research on sea level rise.
“It’s an interesting paper as it’s one of the few times when all of these different fields have been combined,” he said. “It is at odds with some research from other places. He’s made a great effort to combine the Eemian period to what is happening today, which is hard to do. It’s a tough one.
“We know that our knowledge of ice sheet behavior is imperfect, and this is a paper that really gets into that question. We are narrowing down the error bars all the time.”
Scientists recently expressed alarm at the record heat that has baked the planet in the first few months of 2016, which follows a year that was the warmest on record. 
These record temperatures, aided by a strong El Niño event, come as nations appear to be slowing the growth of the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing the excess heat. Recent figures show the world emitted 32.1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide from energy in 2015, on a par with 2014, while accelerating the shift to renewable energy.
Nevertheless, humanity is still pumping out CO2 into the atmosphere at a rate 10 times faster than at any point in the past 66m years, with the resulting sea level rises, extreme weather events, coral bleaching and drought already evidenced around the globe. "

The rolling underwater heatwave has now arrived upon the Great Barrier Reef, with mass die-offs expected along the northern quarter of the world’s preeminent coral ecosystem. 
Professor Nick Graham of Lancaster University said the devastation worldwide was probably now on the same scale as the worst ever bleaching on record, which occurred during 1997-98 and wiped out 16% of the world’s reefs in a single year.
“This is the big one that we’ve been waiting for. This is the 1997-98 equivalent, which we’ve been anticipating for a long time,” said the coral scientist. The full impact could not be known until the event had finally ended, added Graham. Models predict it will now head west into the Indian Ocean and could continue in the Pacific until early 2017.
Dr Mark Eakin, the head of the US government’s Coral Reef Watch programme, said this year’s massive bleach conformed with a prediction made by Australian scientist Ove Hoegh-Guldberg in the wake of the 1998 event. Back then, Hoegh-Guldberg predicted coral reefs would catastrophically decline by the middle to end of this century as oceans warmed and bleaching events became an annual occurrence on most reefs.
“What we’re seeing now is unfortunately saying that Ove’s paper was not alarmist,” said Eakin. “This year is especially telling. In the past, big bleaching events happened pretty much during the course of a year. This current bleaching event started in mid-2014.”
Eakin said many scientist had predicted two or three-year-long events would not begin occurring until the 2020s: “Yet here we are now with back-to-back to sometimes-back-again bleaching.”
Coral bleaching occurs when the ocean temperature surpasses a natural threshold causing the tiny animals, called zooxanthellae, that give coral its brilliance to desert their polyp homes – leaving them bone white. Recovery tends to be patchy and slow. The concern that coral scientists hold for the future is that bleaching events will pile one atop the other, giving reefs no time to rebuild.
But Graham held out some hope for the resilience of the reefs. He said that despite smaller bleaching events occurring throughout the past two decades, the next really massive event hadn’t come “as soon as Ove feared it would”. This had allowed some reefs time to bounce back.
“After 1998 we were worried that they were going to become frequent quite quickly,” he said. “It’s been 18 years until this event which has been a blessing.” 
Robbed of the zooxanthellae that clear the corals of intrusive plants, some of the reefs bleached in the past two years will be taken over by weeds and algae, strangling any hope they can return.
“But others will [recover],” said Graham. “Then the real question mark is how frequent these events are going to be. If it’s another 18 to 20 years until we get the next one, then a lot of reefs will have time to bounce back.”
Both the 1998 event and this year have been related to very strong El Niño patterns – which wash warm water across the Pacific Ocean and trigger increased heat around the world. El Niño cycles are fickle, but turn roughly every two to seven years. But the last huge one was in 1998.
“If these super El Niños occur on timescales shorter than a decade then I think that’s when we’re really going to start seeing the ratcheting down of a lot more reefs,” said Graham.
Great uncertainty exists around the effect climate change will have on El Niño. Mat Collins, joint chair in climate change at the UK’s Met Office, said current models showed no consensus over whether the frequency or intensity of the cycle would increase, decrease or remain the same. 
However, predicting the behaviour of El Niño was incredibly complex and “we might see differences in future climate models as they improve”.
Even so, El Niño is no longer the only cause of bleaching. In 2005 and 2010, large coral bleaching events occurred independently of the Pacific warming cycle.
“As the temperature is creeping upwards [because of climate change], it takes less of an El Niño ... to cause a lot of bleaching,” said Eakin. “What we would have considered stressful temperatures back in the 1980s have become relatively normal summer temperatures now. That doesn’t mean the corals don’t mind it because a lot of them in fact are bleaching repeatedly.”
The threat of an increasingly hot world has driven some adaptation among coral species and communities. Counterintuitively, being exposed to bleaching has actually made some reefs more resilient. This is because in some circumstances, the most fragile species of coral are killed off and stronger ones take over. 
“But in the process, you’re losing biodiversity, which is a big problem,” said Eakin. “The whole question is: are temperatures rising faster than corals are able to adapt? And the answer so far seems to be ‘yes’.”
Ultimately, he said, the determining factor for reefs would be human efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If the world could limit warming to 1.5C above normal, the toughest target outlined by the recent Paris climate agreement, then reefs could stand a chance.
“Even at 2C [which governments have agreed to hold temperatures to] we are going to be seeing the loss of a lot of coral reefs around the world,” he said."

It’s true: despite decades of warnings from top scientists, ecocide remains an unfashionable issue, thanks in no small part to intensive lobbying and spin from agribusiness, biotech corporations and carbon barons, who use art world patronage to create an illusion of benevolence.
Musicians across genres and generations are calling time on this lie, from Neil Young’s furious Monsanto Years album and Greenpeace’s striking Requiem for Arctic Ice to THEEsatisfaction’s lush, eco-conscious odyssey, EarthEE. “We want to start a conversation about climate change,” the Sub Pop duo told the Guardian last year. “Because it’s a real issue, a problem many try to avoid.” 
Hopelessness, Anohni’s forthcoming album, is a stunning response to this inaction, joining journalist Rebecca Solnit’s call to label climate change “extreme, horrific, long-term, widespread violence”. The songs are sublime in their movement, devastating in their truth-telling – war, surveillance, American imperialism, the slow murder of the Earth and its inhabitants not just by men with machines, but by all of us who are complicit in the planet’s devastation. It is, to quote Elizabeth Barrett Browning, a curse from the depths of womanhood: “salt, and bitter, and good” – a sonic extension of Anohni’s work in the Future Feminists collective. 
Fear and rage are powerful tools for change, but delight and pleasure are equally formidable. These things are in abundance on THEEsatisfaction’s limber, Afrofuturist poetry (on the aforementioned EarthEE, or their debut, AwE NaturalE, and their catalogue of mixtapes) – heady, rich, semi-mystical music that traces symbiotic lines between earth and body, music and mind, lineage and land.
Brooklyn-based rapper Junglepussy has a similar, pesticide-free MO on her excellent second album, Pregnant with Success, a record ripe with carefree confidence, black love and green metaphors – witty, salacious and earthy in equal measure. In JP’s world, merch is a line of organic beverages (Junglepussy Juice), self-love is paramount (“I seen you eating Mickey D’s, knew you ain’t love yourself / I’m up in Trader Joes, shopping cart full of health”) and would-be lovers are advised to woo her not with popping bottles (“that’s not impressive”) but freshly picked fruit. 
It makes sense that artists like Junglepussy, Anohni and THEEsatisfaction are at the forefront of green music, since it’s marginal communities – oppressed, poor, BAME, “other” – who are, and will continue to be, the first and worst affected by ecocide, while the 1% holiday in the sun. Ask the black, working-class people of Flint, Michigan, who are forced to drink and bathe in lead-contaminated water; the victims of developing countries devastated by the droughts and famines that follow extreme weather; the many indigenous peoples across the globe fighting oil spills and pipelines, land grabs and deforestation.
And yet, as Anohni points out, identity politics in this “tipping point” era are increasingly used against us by big business as smokescreens to distract us from a culture of wealth extraction:
They are going to try to convince us that they have our best interests at heart by waving flags for identity politics and fake moral issues. But don’t forget that many of these [award show] celebrities are the trophies of billionaire corporations whose only intention it is to manipulate you into giving them your consent and the last of your money. They have been paid to do a little tap dance to occupy you while Rome burns.
Hopelessness works because it articulates the despair so many of us feel on our worst days – that we’re all doomed, that the world is past saving, that we’re all to blame. But it also speaks to defiance and refusal, joining a growing resistance that is starting to take root across the globe: in Sudha Kheterpal’s SPARK technology, in Björk’s tireless activist-art, in the healing, pleasure-filled rhythms and melodies of THEEsatisfaction and Junglepussy."

In the last 10 years, the growing season, measured according to the central England temperature daily record, which stretches back hundreds of years, has been on average 29 days longer than in the period 1961-1990, the data show. And while more of the year is warm enough for plants to grow, there has also been a decline in the number of frosty days in recent decades, the Met Office said.
Between 2006 and 2015, the plant growing season, which begins and ends with periods of consecutive days where daily temperatures average more than 5C (41F) and is without any five-day spells of temperatures below 5C, averaged 280 days.
Figures also reveal that six of the 10 longest growing seasons have occurred in the last 30 years, with 2014 topping the list at 336 days, or about 11 months of the year, while 2015 was 10th, with 303 days – about 10 months.
Only three of the 10 shortest growing seasons have taken place in the last century – in 1979, 1941 and 1922 – while the years with the shortest season were in 1782 and 1859, at just 181 days.
Mark McCarthy, manager of the Met Office’s national climate information centre, said: “Between 1861 and 1890, the average growing season by this measure was 244 days, and measuring the same period a century later, the average growing season had extended by just over a week. For the most recent 10 years, between 2006 and 2015, the average growing season has been 29 days longer at 280 days, when compared with the period between 1961 and 1990.”
Days gripped by air frost, when the daily minimum temperature dips below 0C, also declined, with just seven years since 1990 when the number of frost days exceeded the 1961-1990 average. The frostier-than-average years include 2010, when the bitter winter had the most days of frost since 1917.
McCarthy added: “Although we have fewer air frost days on average than we experienced a few decades ago, the numbers can still fluctuate from year to year. Many people will remember vividly the cold spells during 2010 and 2013. In contrast, 2014 recorded very few days of air frost and was the lowest in the UK series from 1961.”"

The good news is the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is safe. The $10bn CEFC was derided by the former prime minister Tony Abbott as “Bob Brown’s bank” and was so despised by the Abbott government that trying to stop its lending was one of the Coalition’s first acts after it was elected in 2013.
Now the CEFC can continue its highly successful work, which has so far provided $1.4bn in loans to projects worth $3.5bn while at the same time generating a 6.1% return on the lending. It will no longer labour under the uncertainty of a government determined to abolish it, or a government periodically bending to the pressure from climate sceptics or anti-windfarm advocates by seeking to limit its investment mandate.
The bad news is the Turnbull government seems to be cementing in the $1.3bn in cuts that the Abbott government factored in to its 2014 budget from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency although it was never able to legislate them. 
Because those cuts were not legislated, despite being accounted for in the budget bottom line, Arena still has a legislated spending program with $1.3bn in uncommitted funding over the next six years. Presumably the Turnbull government believes it will be able to legislate to change that after the federal election. By retaining it as government policy it can continue to book the saving.
The ideological change comes in Arena’s new role. It is effectively being subsumed into the CEFC, becoming the administrator of the new Clean Energy Innovation Fund, a subsidiary fund of the CEFC, lending money from the CEFC’s allocation. And the final decision on that lending will be made by the CEFC board.
In the short term it will finish doling out the grants programs it has already announced. In the longer term, instead of giving out grants, Arena will be simply be administering the new fund, which will make loans at a lower rate of return to earlier stage clean energy projects.
Clean energy groups are concerned at the abolition of grants funding, saying grants are essential at the earliest stages of technology development. Turnbull says this is a deliberate change in direction. 
“This reflects a very big change in the way the government ... is now approaching this type of investment,” he said on Wednesday. “Historically ... the federal government has been very much like an ATM, it’s been making grants ... without, frankly, a lot of follow-up as to whether it’s effective.
“We believe ... the government should seek to be a partner and investor, seek to get a return. It doesn’t have to get the same high return that a private venture capital firm or a private bank would seek to get. It can get a very long-term return but, in doing that, by ensuring that you take a more economic approach, you will ensure that you have a much more rigorous analysis and that you will get a better quality of investment and a better quality of project.”
And then the shell game. The “new” Clean Energy Innovation Fund is not “entirely new”, as billed by the government and enthusiastically accepted by some media reporting, but is in fact funded entirely from the CEFCs existing borrowings and is more like another of the subsidiary funds the CEFC has set up – this time with the leeway of achieving a slightly lower rate of return so it can take on slightly higher levels of risk.
And despite the government’s insistence that Arena has been “retained” as a separate agency, and that it has not been merged with the CEFC, that appears to be the case only in name, if it now functions as a subset of the CEFC and very soon will no longer be making grants with its own money. 
Turnbull’s attitude to the CEFC is big shift from his predecessor – in real terms and symbolically – but Arena appears to have been “retained” in name only."

A photosynthesising microbe from a genus called Phormidesmis has been identified as the guilty party behind the darkening of Greenland.
It glues soot and dust together to form a grainy substance known as cryoconite. As the surface darkens, the Greenland ice becomes less reflective, more likely to absorb summer sunlight and more likely to melt.
And, Dr Arwyn Edwards, a biologist at Aberystwyth University tells the Microbiology Society’s annual conference in Liverpool today, cryoconite holes now pockmark 200,000 square kilometres of the Greenland ice sheet. 
“I think this is going to contribute to the overall picture of Greenland melting. Greenland holds about seven metres of sea level rise,” said Edwards.
“There is considerable uncertainty over the rates and timings of that melt. However it seems more likely that we will commit to a longer-term melting of the ice sheet within our century. The question is: how much are these bacterial processes contributing?”
Two things keep the Arctic ice sheets stable: one is the temperature, the other the albedo, or reflectivity of the ice. Clean polar ice bounces two-thirds of sunlight back into space. But the Arctic region is the fastest warming on the planet and the cryoconite effect has reduced the albedo of the ice sheet dramatically: where the microbes have been at work, four-fifths of the radiation is now absorbed, and the ice is melting faster. 
Scientists have known about the cryoconite phenomenon for more than a century – the word was coined during an expedition to Greenland by Nils Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld in 1870 – but not the identity of the culprit. Britain’s Natural Environment Research Council has now put £2.4m into such research and working in Svalbard, Edwards and colleagues identified the species that triggers the process of microbial change on the ice sheet. They confirmed its presence in western Greenland and on the Petermann Glacier in north-west Greenland. 
“If we recognize ice species as a living landscape we can see that the microbes themselves are able to change the glacial surface,” Edwards said. “It’s only recently that we’ve begun to understand that these cryoconite holes are dynamic, changing in size and shape. Microbes are capable of ecosystem engineering and respond to changes in their environment all the time.”
Researchers have repeatedly confirmed an acceleration of glacial melting rates on the biggest body of ice in the northern hemisphere. They have also identified a pattern of darkening. What the new study reveals is the important role of one microbial species among many that have adapted to snow and ice. The researchers cannot yet put a measure to the microbial contribution. However, they now have evidence that one member of the cyanobacteria family is working in the dust and soot to form granules which darken the ice, cause it to melt into holes maximized to catch sunlight, to fill with water, to release nutrients frozen in the ice, and create conditions for other microbes to join in the process. 
The culprit might be microscopic, but the impact is visible. And not just visible.
“It is very difficult to walk around on the ice surface without tripping into one of these cryoconite holes. I have done that myself. These are not small entities we are talking about, they are pothole size to dinner plate size to bin lid size. They are literally pockmarking the ice surface itself,” Dr Edwards said."

They agreed to limit global warming to well below 2C to avoid extremely dangerous and irreversible climate change.
The international community’s remaining emission “budget” is less than 1,000 gigatonnes of CO2. The Paris agreement is intended to ensure as quickly as possible that the annual global emissions go down, the budget is stretched, and the net emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced to zero over a few decades. 
The challenge of limiting the combustion of oil, coal and gas to this budget is enormous in view of the fossil reserves still underground. If we were to use all the known and probable reserves to generate energy, global emissions would amount to around 15,000 gigatonnes of CO2. So limiting global warming to 2C means this: of the 15,000 thousand gigatonnes of CO2, we need to leave at least 14,000 underground.
Truly, our problem is not a scarcity of fossil resources, it is the exact opposite. We lack an exit strategy for oil, coal and gas. Energy efficiency and renewable energy are indispensable parts of a response to climate change, but they do not tell us why private companies and private individuals should stop extracting, marketing and consuming fossil fuels.
In fact, the progress made on energy efficiency and renewables can actually exacerbate the problem. An oversupply of fossil resources lowers the price and makes it even more tempting to use them. And the temptation is great: the fossil energy industry offers profits, jobs and low energy prices. 
The Paris agreement says this to our children and grandchildren: “We promise not to expose you to the dangers of climate change.” If we are to keep our word, we have no alternative to decarbonisation. Our production and consumption must become carbon-neutral. There is an international consensus that the industrialised countries need to lead the way. 
Germany does not need to change its climate and energy transition targets in view of the decisions made in Paris. There is a consensus amongst the political parties represented in the Bundestag that Germany will reduce greenhouse gases by 80-95% by 2050 from the 1990 baseline. The Federal government and the Bundestag have decided on the following interim goals: greenhouse gas emissions are to be down 40% by 2020, 55% by 2030, and 70% by 2040.
We should regard this challenge as an opportunity for a comprehensive modernisation of our economy. The fossil fuels are being substituted by investment in efficiency technologies and renewable energy. Here, a key role will be played by digitisation. In short: we will replace oil, coal and gas with intelligence and sustainable investment by 2050 at the latest. By doing this, we will be creating high-quality growth and jobs. 
If this transformation is to become a success story not only in climate terms, but also in economic terms, in the coming decades, we will need a paradigm shift. 
The most important aspect is to avoid misallocated investments. We want to complete the switch by 2050, which gives us three-and-a-half decades. Investments in fossil structures with a lifespan extending beyond 2050 will become stranded assets of the respective companies, and will require us to undertake expensive repairs in future. A forward-looking approach to modernisation which avoids lock-in effects, subsequent destruction of capital, and job losses, must put the right policies in place right now. 
We should therefore declare efficiency and renewable energy to be the new “rule”, the new standard investment. Investments in fossil structures must become the exception. We should only undertake them in cases where we have no alternative technologies or where the alternatives are disproportionately expensive. We need to reverse the rule-exception relationship: that is the paradigm shift.
What does the new “rule” – investment in energy efficiency and renewables – mean for the various sectors? 
Power generation still accounts for by far the largest proportion of greenhouse gases. The sector is also set to grow as the decarbonisation of the heating and transport sectors will only be possible if we use more electricity. This electricity needs to stem from zero-carbon renewable sources, particularly wind and photovoltaics. We need to keep investing in these technologies. 
Fossil fuel power stations have a lifespan of 40 years or more. To avoid misallocated investment which reach far beyond 2050 and to avoid lock-in effects, we should urgently dispense with new coal-fired power plants and extensions to opencast mines. Gas-fired power stations with comparatively small carbon emissions fall into the “exceptions” category, because we need them as controllable power stations for our energy security; however, natural gas will have to be replaced gradually by zero-carbon. 
Of all CO2-relevant emissions, buildings have the longest lifespans, at around 100 years. We should therefore define an efficiency standard for all new buildings which, when coupled with the direct use of renewable energy and electricity, results in zero carbon emissions. We already have the necessary technologies and they are already affordable, so that this new standard can be introduced with just a few years’ notice. 
The challenges in the existing building stock are far greater. These buildings are dominated by gas-fired and oil-fired combustion systems which mostly heat buildings which are only moderately insulated. In the short term, a switch to using efficient condensing boilers can save a lot of CO2 emissions. As heating systems have a lifespan of 20 years, from 2030 investment in fossil fuel heating systems should stop so that we can finish the transition by 2050. The only cost-efficient way to do this is to combine it with appropriate insulation of the building envelope.
The transport sector may pose the greatest challenge. Most of the rail system has already been electrified, but almost all passenger and freight traffic on the road, in the air and on water is almost entirely dependent on fossil fuels. Electric mobility offers us the chance to achieve the energy transition in the field of private transport. With an average lifespan of 20 years we need to have switched from fossil-based to renewables-based engines by 2030 if we are to stop using gasoline and diesel on our roads in 2050. The emissions of newly bought vehicles must then amount to zero. We need a road map which enables the state and the automotive industry to draw up an ambitious investment strategy for the transport sector. 
The paradigm shift in the energy transition cannot be applied to all sectors. The process-related industrial emissions, and the methane emissions from agriculture, cannot be avoided by higher efficiency or a switch to renewable energy. These emissions will continue unless we manage to develop alternative technologies. But by far the largest proportion of our emissions is produced by burning oil, coal and gas. 
For this reason, a cost-efficient energy transition should be oriented to investment cycles with a view to a far-reaching decarbonisation by the middle of the century. Investments in efficiency and renewable energy must become the rule, and investment in fossil structures the exception with clearly defined timelines for an exit. 
By adopting this forward-looking policy, we will avoid misallocations of investment and lock-in effects. It will enable Germany to follow a sustainable path of growth– whereas a continuation of investment in fossil fuels brings incalculable economic risks.
In the aftermath of Paris, we are now seeing a race between nations to adopt the smartest and most cost-efficient modernisation policies. Thanks to its energy transition, Germany has a lead. We will have to work hard if we are to maintain this lead."

There was a a fall in the proportion finding it difficult to get by, which the ONS said was a sign that Britons were less worried about their finances. Healthy life expectancy continued, although at the same time satisfaction with health fell sharply from 66.3% to 57.8%.
“The majority of improvements relate to objective measures of national wellbeing such as the unemployment rate, while the majority of measures assessed as deteriorated are subjective measures, such as satisfaction with health,” the ONS said.
It added that between 2012 and 2014 crimes against the person dropped by a third, from 82 per 1,000 adults to 57 per 1,000 adults in the financial year ending 2015.
Net national disposable income per head rose modestly from £22,487 to £22,786 and the proportion finding it difficult to cope financially fell from 11.6% to 9.1%. 
More energy was produced from renewable sources, but at 7% was less than halfway towards the government’s target of 15% by 2020. Waste recycling rates increased slightly to just under 45%, closing in on the EU target of 50% by 2020. Between 2011 and 2014, greenhouse gas emissions fell from 553.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent to 514.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.
But the ONS said not all areas of life in the UK were getting better, adding that the proportions satisfied with accommodation, household income and leisure time had all fallen over the three-year period. Mental wellbeing scores also fell over the period as did the proportion who had a spouse or partner, family member or friend to rely on if they had a serious problem. Adult participation in sport has also fallen.
The latest data showed few changes in children’s overall wellbeing, with children reporting relatively high levels of personal wellbeing and positive relationships with parents. “However, there are still areas of concern, such as the proportion of children who report being bullied frequently and the proportion of children reporting symptoms of mental ill-health.”
 The ONS study also looked at whether the UK had a sustainable future.
“Looking at national stocks of things such as education, skills and competencies in the labour market (human capital) and the value of natural resources such as woodlands and rivers (natural capital), there is a mixed message about sustainability for the future. Human capital rose between 2013 and 2014, but remains below levels seen before the financial crisis and latest data for natural capital shows long term decline.”"

But other indigenous Americans have no way out";"The tiny Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw tribe has called the coastal marshlands of southern Louisiana home ever since their ancestors settled there to avoid forced relocation under the Indian Removal Act of 1830. But the close-knit community of Isle de Jean Charles has grown increasingly fragmented as their island slowly disappears beneath their feet and powerful storms ravage their homes and crops.
A potent combination of accelerating sea level rise, salt water intrusion and subsidence of the land has caused devastating erosion and flooding, exacerbated further by regional oil and gas development and the shipping industry. Today, less than a quarter of the original inhabitants still live on the island, which has lost 98% of its landmass since the 1950s. Most inhabitants resettled in nearby parishes, but even the few miles distance have diminished cultural knowledge long nurtured by the relative isolation of island life.
As the waters swallowed Isle de Jean Charles decade by decade, the tribe reluctantly began to face the possibility of another relocation. Only this time, they would set the terms. In 2000, they began drafting a plan to resettle on the mainland, in a location that would offer protection from hurricanes and flooding yet allow them to maintain their cultural identity, including access to traditional fishing and agriculture. The plan doesn’t force anyone to leave the island. Some residents say they won’t go, although it’s unclear how much longer their homes will remain standing before the water completely consumes the land.
In January, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded $48m for a resettlement plan, part of an initiative to help communities stricken by natural disasters. It makes Isle de Jean Charles one of the first communities in the lower 48 states to undertake a complete relocation due to climate change. HUD, the state and the tribe hope the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw plan will become a model for other tribes and communities facing imminent climate threats.
But while the relocation plan and funding are celebrated as an important precedent and possible roadmap for future relocation projects, this level of support isn’t likely to be available to other tribes seeking funding and guidance for climate-related displacement and resettlement.
The HUD grant was a one-time award, part of a $1bn Natural Disaster Resiliency Competition. While the agency has other programs for federally-recognized tribes to undertake relocation, they are not intended to cover resettlement of an entire community, says Marion McFadden, deputy assistant secretary of grants at HUD. 
Government disaster programs generally support individual, not collective, relocation projects. But this approach doesn’t consider the cultural disruptions that occur when native peoples must relocate in a piecemeal manner, says Julie Maldonado, an anthropologist and lecturer at the University of California, Santa Barbara and a lead author of the 2014 National Climate Assessment chapter on indigenous peoples.
In fact, she says, there is no single government entity or framework designated to provide tribes imminently threatened by climate change with support navigating the complex, costly process of community relocation.
From Alaska to the Pacific Northwest to the Gulf Coast, hundreds of tribal communities are now grappling with how to protect their safety, economic sustainability and cultural integrity as climate change combines with other social, economic and environmental factors to threaten their way of life.
In Oregon and Washington, warming streams and changes in the seasonal water cycle threaten traditional salmon grounds, and coastal tribes like the Tulalip, Swinomish and Hoh also face recurring damage from flooding and sea level rise. In the Southwest, Pueblos like Santo Domingo are altering their traditional irrigation methods in the face of prolonged drought, while some wells and livestock watering holes on the Navajo Nation have gone dry. Meanwhile, Florida’s Seminole and Miccosukee tribes are confronting a future of sea level rise in the Everglades that threatens homes, drinking water and cultural resources.
Traditionally, many tribes adapted to weather extremes and seasonal patterns by migrating temporarily. But reservation boundaries and encroaching development make that virtually impossible today, which can prompt urban migration that further weakens connections to traditional culture and community.
“Often climate change is impacting people who have already been placed in vulnerable situations, who have already been marginalized and pushed to the fringes,” says Maldonado. “They’ve still been able to adapt and cope and make changes and survive. And what happens is that climate change can act as a kind of a tipping point in that scenario.”
Most tribes are opting to adapt by reinforcing existing infrastructure: building seawalls, elevating their homes, combining traditional ecological knowledge and scientific modeling to anticipate how their lands, culture, economy and public services are likely to be affected.
But those who make the difficult decision to relocate are entering largely uncharted territory. State and federal programs, where they exist at all, concentrate on disaster relief and rebuilding. There is no clear government funding mechanism to preemptively relocate an entire community or partner with tribal counterparts in the way that HUD and Louisiana are doing with Isle de Jean Charles. 
Further complicating matters, many federal programs require applicants to be federally-recognized tribes. For the approximately 400 tribes, including the Biloxi-Chitmacha-Choctaw, that are not officially recognized by the federal government, funding options are much more limited. When Isle de Jean Charles first began exploring avenues to fund their resettlement plan, it soon became a complex patchwork of funding sources, each with its own distinct – and sometimes competing – requirements.
“You can apply for a Department of Energy grant for your solar system,” says Chantel Comardelle, the tribe’s executive secretary. “But you need different funders for purchasing the land and having the infrastructure for your solar, so it’s a lot of putting in for different resources to pay for different things.”
Receiving the HUD grant allowed the Biloxi-Chitmacha-Choctaw to quickly move ahead with their plan without worrying about stitching together disparate sources of funding. Even though other tribes aren’t likely to receive full funding from a single source, Comardelle thinks some – particularly smaller tribes like hers – could benefit from more centralized support.
“I think you would almost have to create a sort of climate change resettlement division, to where they could say, ‘OK, you bring us your plan, and we will help you find the resources – this is the funding for this, this is the funding for that, and help give clarity with this process’,” says Comardelle.
That’s something that would help Native American villages in Alaska struggling through a long, fraught relocation process. In Alaska, warming is occurring at more than twice the rate of the US mainland, causing earlier snow melt, vanishing sea ice and rising ocean temperatures. Dozens of indigenous communities are in imminent danger from coastal flooding and erosion, according to a 2009 report by the US Government Accountability Office.
One of the most threatened is the Yup’ik village of Newtok in western Alaska, where the combination of diminishing Arctic sea ice, thawing permafrost and extreme weather events are causing severe erosion and flooding that threatens homes and their drinking water. It is increasingly difficult to get essential supplies like fuel into the village, which is only accessible by plane and boat.
“It’s very scary right now,” says Andy Patrick, former president of the Newtok Traditional Council. “We’ve got the flooding, eroding and sinking of the community. The village is sinking very fast, the permafrost is melting and there’s no way that we can prevent this happening.”
Newtok voted 20 years ago to relocate. The village secured a piece of land on higher bedrock ground through a land swap with the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 2003, still within reasonable proximity to their traditional hunting lands. Since then, however, there’s been scant progress.
Its lack of roads makes moving the village difficult – and expensive. Discrete funding programs are available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and other federal entities. But there is no dedicated, comprehensive program to pay for relocation or help coordinate the process. A tribal leadership struggle further complicated the relocation effort.
In Washington, the Quinault Indian Nation is also planning to relocate a major population center in the face of sea level rise, warmer temperatures and increasingly destructive storms. The tribe occupies more than 200,000 acres and 23 miles of Pacific coastline on the southwestern end of the Olympic Peninsula.
In 2014, a storm surge breached a seawall and flooded the historic lower village of Taholah, which lies at the confluence of the Pacific Ocean and the Quinault River. Some 700 people – about 20% of the tribe’s population – live in lower Taholah, which is also the site of a tribal school and Head Start, senior housing center and a jail.
Quinault received a $700,000 grant from a tribal program at the US Department Health and Human Services to develop a relocation plan. The grant is a drop in the bucket compared to estimated $65m needed to develop the new village over the next decade.
Last week, Quinault President Fawn Sharp testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior and Environment that the federal government had fallen short of its treaty obligations when it came to tribal funding. Quinault, she said, had spent $4.4m of its own money to compensate for federal funding lapses – money it needed for other pressing matters, including climate adaptation and relocation.
“It would be helpful for the entire federal government to elevate the need to respond to climate change to the top of its priority list, and to assure, without question, that the resources are available – directly to tribes – to adapt to its impacts,” Sharp told the Guardian in an email this week. Sharp is also vice president of the National Congress of American Indians, an indigenous rights organization.
Back in Louisiana, the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw reject the label of “climate refugees” that some have attached to them. They consider themselves a forward-looking, sovereign people taking charge of their destiny in the face of significant environmental change – something others might learn from, says Maldonado.
“You’re talking about people who are employing a sense of agency, who still are empowered in their decision-making and are working to stay together. These terms get thrown out there and there’s this idea of the canary in the coal mine, but they’re not the canary in the coal mine – they’re showing us how to get out.”

Whether you look at the hard science, the perils of political interference or modern day activism, Dr Hansen is there as a central character.
In a 1988 US Senate hearing, Hansen famously declared that the “greenhouse effect has been detected and is changing our climate now”. 
Towards the end of his time as the director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Hansen described how government officials had on other occasions changed his testimony, filtered scientific findings and controlled what scientists could and couldn’t say to the media – all to underplay the impact of fossil fuel emissions on the climate.
In recent years, the so-called “grandfather of climate science” has added to his CV the roles of author and twice-arrested climate activist and anti-coal campaigner. He still holds a position at Columbia University.
So when Hansen’s latest piece of blockbuster climate research was finalized and released earlier this week, there was understandable global interest, not least because it mapped a potential path to the “loss of all coastal cities” from rising sea levels and the onset of “super storms” previously unseen in the modern era.
So what is Hansen claiming?
Well, the first thing to understand is that Hansen’s paper, written with 18 other co-authors, many of them highly-reputable names in climate science in their own right, is far from conventional. 
Most scientific papers only take up four or five pages in a journal. Hansen’s paper - in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics - grabs 52 pages (although it’s hard to quibble over space when you’re laying out a possible path to widespread global disruption and the complete reshaping of coastlines). 
Nor was the paper published in a conventional way. If you’re getting a faint sense of déjà vu about Hansen’s findings, then that could be down to how a draft version of the study was published and widely covered in July last year. 
The journal runs an unconventional interactive system of peer review where comments and criticisms from other scientists are published for everyone to see, as are the responses from Hansen and his colleagues. 
This is arguably a more transparent way of conducting the scientific process of peer review - something usually carried out privately and anonymously. 
None of this should really detract from Hansen and his co-author’s central claims. 
All hell will break loose in the North Atlantic and neighbouring lands
Firstly, Hansen says they may have uncovered a mechanism in the Earth’s climate system not previously understood that could point to a much more rapid rise in sea levels. 
When the Earth’s ice sheets melt, they place a freshwater lens over neighboring oceans. This lens, argues Hansen, causes the ocean to retain extra heat, which then goes to melting the underside of large ice sheets that fringe the ocean, causing them to add more freshwater to the lens (this is what’s known as a “positive feedback” and is not to be confused with the sort of positive feedback you may have got at school for that cracking fifth grade science assignment).
Secondly, according to the paper, all this added water could first slow and then shut down two key ocean currents – and Hansen points to two unusually cold blobs of ocean water off Greenland and off Antarctica as evidence that this process may already be starting. 
If these ocean conveyors were to be impacted, this could create much greater temperature differences between the tropics and the north Atlantic, driving “super storms stronger than any in modern times”, he argues.
“All hell will break loose in the North Atlantic and neighbouring lands,” he says in a video summary.
Hansen points to evidence from ancient climates (known as paleoclimate data) to suggest this has previously happened on Earth – an interpretation that was challenged during the interactive peer review process. 
Now, according to the IPCC, global sea levels will only rise a maximum of not quite a metre by the end of the century.
But Hansen says this is too conservative. His paper claims that climate models, including those used for his paper, don’t properly capture the consequences from adding freshwater from melting ice sheets. Sea levels could rise several metres beyond the IPCC’s estimates, and the rise would be much faster. 
So what’s the upshot? According to Hansen: 
These feedbacks raise questions about how soon we will pass points of no return in which we will lock-in consequences that cannot be reversed on any time scale that people care about. 
Consequences include sea level rise of several metres, which we estimate could occur this century or at the latest next century if fossil fuel emissions continue at a high level. 
That would mean the loss of all coastal cities, most of the world’s largest cities and all of their history.
The idea that ice sheets are becoming unstable and could raise sea levels several metres is not as controversial as you might think. There is good evidence that sea levels have been many metres higher in earth’s history, well before humans came along. 
A May 2015 study covered here on Planet Oz found Antarctica’s ice sheet alone could have pushed sea levels as much as 17 metres higher, but it would have taken thousands of years.
Commenting on Hansen’s study, Dr John Church, a sea level rise expert at Australia’s CSIRO, says multimeter sea level rises are consistent with current research, but where Hansen departs is on claiming it could all happen before the end of this century.
But Church says that as fossil fuel emissions grow, the world is committing future generations to much higher sea levels. 
“Even with the lower emission scenarios we have committed the world to ongoing sea level rise for centuries,” he says.
Other scientists have already challenged many of Hansen’s conclusions, as Hansen himself predicted would happen.
“You can be sure that many scientists – indeed most scientists – will find some aspects in our long paper that they would interpret differently,” Hansen says. 
But he also commented that these disagreements shouldn’t be misinterpreted.
I find that the public sometimes misinterprets our science discussions – how research is done. Scepticism is the lifeblood of science. It takes time for conclusions to be agreed upon and details sorted out. 
And so it’s in this spirit that I think Hansen’s paper should be taken. 
Hansen and his co-authors have laid out their science and are proposing an idea that will live, die or evolve through the scientific method.
Whether or not March 2016 becomes another seminal moment in Hansen’s storied climate career only time, and a failure to reign in fossil fuel emissions, will likely tell.
One final point.
Hansen has long called for a straightforward rising price on greenhouse gas emissions, which he argues would “quicken the transition to cleaner energy.” 
“This is a tragic situation, because it is unnecessary,” he says.
We could already be phasing out fossil fuel emissions if only we stopped allowing the fossil fuel industry to use the atmosphere as a free dumping ground for their waste."

ANZ announced to the Australian stock exchange on Thursday that over the past month, conditions have changed such that expected costs associated with lending to the mining and resources sector would increase from a projected $800m to more than $900m.
The bank said the change was caused by the “evolving position with a small number of Australian and multi-national resources-related exposures”.
“While the overall credit environment remains broadly stable, we are continuing to see pockets of weakness associated with low commodity prices in the resources sector and in related industries,” said ANZ’s acting chief financial officer, Graham Hodges.
The bank did not disclose which companies or loans caused the writedown, but Tim Buckley, a former Citibank analyst who is now with the anti-fossil fuel Institute for Energy Economics &amp; Financial Analysis, said there were two new developments that could be linked to the move.
The first was the warning by coal giant Peabody Energy that it was on the brink of bankruptcy after finding itself unable to pay an interest payment of US$70m.
Buckley said if ANZ had lent to Peabody – which would not be known unless the company filed for bankruptcy – that would have put a dent the bank’s balance sheet.
And on Wednesday the Australian Financial Review reported the owners of a coal export facility in Queensland, WICET, was struggling with its loans because of falling coal prices, and may be seeking a debt-for-equity swap, where the company exchanges debt for a pre-determined amount of equity or stock. A report in the AFR said ANZ was set to lose money on a loan associated with WICET’s coal export facility.
Buckley said ANZ had previously been a lender to both these companies and it would not be surprising if they were still involved with them.
“These are likely two triggering events,” he said. “We know ANZ was exposed to both these corporates and both have seen defining negative financial stress events in the last week or two. Have they traded out? Who knows? That’s not public information, but we know they were exposed to both.
“I’d say this is the absolute tip of the iceberg. There are hundreds of billions of dollars that are being invested in new fossil fuel assets and infrastructure assets associated with that.” 
Buckley said the risks associated with those investments were now coming to the fore, as foreshadowed last year by the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney.
Julien Vincent from the financial activist group Market Forces agrees: “The coal industry is in structural decline, and it’s taking the bank industry with it, which means it’s taking shareholder value and customer value along with it.”
“It means other banks are in the same position, and there are probably a whole bunch of other debt products that haven’t been put in this category but wouldn’t be far away.
“We often think, ‘Oh look what’s happening to ANZ,’ but we’re all exposed to ANZ through our super or direct shares or by being a customer. The same goes for the other banks.”
In February Guardian Australia reported analysis showing the big four banks, including ANZ, had signed off on $5.5bn of loans to the fossil fuel industry in Australia. Many commentators have warned these assets will become “stranded” if the world moves to avoid dangerous climate change, and keeps many of the known fossil fuel reserves in the ground."

The actor and environmentalist, in Tokyo to promote the local release of Alejandro G Iñárritu’s 19th century frontier epic, said the next leader of the world’s most powerful nation should not be someone who refused to listen to reason. 
“We should not have a candidate who doesn’t believe in modern science to be leading our country,” he said. “Climate change is one of the most concerning issues facing all humanity and the United States needs to do its part.”
The two leading Republican candidates for the presidency, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, have both dismissed climate change out of hand. Cruz has referred to it as “pseudo-scientific theory”, while Trump said earlier this week that he was “not a big believer in man-made climate change”. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, has called climate change denial a “charade”.
DiCaprio, who signed a multi-year partnership deal to make green-themed films with Netflix in March last year, also expressed hope that an upcoming documentary about climate change might raise awareness ahead of the November presidential election. “We’ve been travelling around the world documenting climate change,” he said, confirming that film-makers visited China, India and the North and South Poles. 
The actor was greeted by hundreds of fans, some dressed as bears in a reference to The Revenant’s key plot line, as he made his first trip to Tokyo in two years to promote the film. He told reporters it was “gratifying and feels fantastic” to have won the best actor prize for his role as fur trapper Hugh Glass, but added: “You hope to remain with your initial ideals and dreams of what you want to be as an actor, and all I can hope for is that I’ll continue to keep trying to make the best movies I possibly can.”
Later, DiCaprio told an audience at the Japanese premiere for The Revenant at Roppongi Hills in Tokyo that he was “privileged to be a part of cinema history that I think is very ground breaking”, adding: “It was a huge honour for all of us the night of the Oscars, to be awarded the way we were.”"

The nearly 1,000-mile endurance race across the wilderness officially concluded with the dogs sprawled out on a snow ramp in the centre of Nome, an old gold rush town just below the Arctic Circle. Musher Marie Helwig, who finished in 71st place, posed with the red lantern given to last-place finishers as a salute to their perseverance. 
It’s been 43 years since a kennel owner named Joe Redington seized on the idea of reviving the winter sport of dog sledding by paying homage to one of the most heroic tales from Alaska’s pre-statehood days – an epic journey by dog sled that brought  a life-saving serum to the remote town of Nome, where children were dying from a diptheria epidemic.
The running of the Iditarod has turned dog sledding into Alaska’s most popular winter sport. But after this winter’s record high temperatures  – and a decade of perilously declining sea ice and permafrost across the Arctic, the question is now unavoidable: has the great dog sledding race had its day?
The Iditarod is still about grit. Helwig, a first-time competitor, nearly dropped out of the competition after her house was destroyed in one of the climate-inflected wildfires that burned across Alaska last summer. On the trail, she made a painful choice to leave one of her dogs behind – after the animal ran off. (Fellow mushers later found him.) And two of the original Redington’s grandsons were forced to scratch.
But this year’s Iditarod was less about snow and subzero temperatures than sickness and speed. Dogs slipped and slid their way across barren tundra and iced-up trails at breakneck pace. Mushers worried about keeping their teams healthy on afternoons so warm and sunny that dogs vomited from overheating.
“There was just no snow. We were running on ice and dirt,” Helwig said. That made the course fast – but also more dangerous. “You can’t really control a sled when there is no snow,” Helwig said.
Eight finishers completed the course in eight days – faster than any of the winners in some recent years. Even Helwig’s 71st-place time of 13 days would have put her in the top 10 in the 1980 and 1990s.
A number of this year’s racers spoke about moving the Iditarod to January or February – when there is a greater chance of snow. Some no longer counted on training their dogs in Anchorage, because it was too warm, but were decamping for Fairbanks or even lower 48 states such as Idaho. 
On several of the two dozen checkpoints on the trail, finishers of this year’s Iditarod reported high temperatures and low snow, slim ribbons of hard-packed sled trails against vast swaths of exposed tundra.
 Climate change stole the winter from the Arctic this year: pushing temperatures up above zero at the North Pole, opening up treacherous black water on the Yukon river, and turning up the speed on the northbound trek to Nome. 
“As far as this winter goes, my hunch is that there is essentially zero probability of that happening without climate change,” John Walsh, chief scientist at the International Arctic Research Centre in Fairbanks, said. “If your question is, ‘What are the odds of getting this warm a winter without climate change,’ I would wager that it would be zero.”
 Warming is occurring twice as fast in the Arctic as anywhere else. On the Bering Sea, the ice cover is in rapid retreat. In the interior, thawing permafrost is draining lakes and raising the risks of wildfire on bone dry forests. Anchorage, the traditional starting point for the Iditarod, has to make contingences for a lack of snow.
What are the odds of getting this warm a winter without climate change? I would wager that it would be zero
 Sled dog races and ski events were rerouted for the last three years. The local ski resort is considering investing in a snow-making machine to keep the season going. After the start of the Iditarod was moved last year for lack of snow, organisers this year arranged to ship in 11 rail cars of the white stuff.
The low snow conditions persisted in the early stages of the race – and so did the unusually warm temperatures.
“For me, the race was tough from the beginning because it was so warm and I have some really big dogs that are furry. They were not handling it so well. It was too hot for them,” said Helwig. “They were sluggish. A few of them threw up because they were dipping for snow so much – they ingested so much air and water.”
Others found the warm temperatures a relief. Mushers ordinarily expect bitter -20F (-29C) cold in the interior of Alaska – but that did not materialise this year.
“I don’t think it ever got colder than five below. It was super comfortable for us,” said Trent Herbst, a fourth-grade teacher from Ketchum, Idaho, running his eighth Iditarod.
The days and nights were so warm he dispensed with a face mask or sleeping bag, curling up in the straw with the dogs. It was even warm enough to harness the dogs with bare hands.
But Herbst also admitted being rattled by the absence of snow or ice. On some stretches of trail, there was no snow at all – just lots of gravel and tree stumps for distances of more than 20 miles, according to some competitors. 
At Rainy Pass, the creek was strangely ice-free, a torrent of fast-moving water. Deep in the interior, it was so dry competitors were afraid their cook stoves would start a wildfire on the exposed tundra. From Galena to Nulato, dog teams were forced to change course away from the the Yukon river avoiding dark cracks which had opened in the ice. Up the Bering Sea coast, the last stretch of the race, the terrain was scoured clear of snow by strong winds.
“There was absolutely no fresh snow anywhere on the trail. It was hard-packed snow and ice,” Herbst said. He spent a considerable amount of energy just trying to slow the team down. 
Some sections of the route were as slippery as a skating rink. Others, especially the 70-mile traverse of an area destroyed by wildfire the mushers know as The Burn, were a bone-jarring, sled-wrecking obstacle course, Iditarod competitors said.
Too much snow slows the race. The Iditarod rules require mushers to pack snowshoes to stomp out a trail for their dogs, if needed. Too much ice and the dogs slide all over the track: their paws can’t get a grip.
New snow isn’t optimal either, according to Linwood Fiedler, who ran his 23rd Iditarod this year. “Fresh snow takes a while to set up. It’s all fluffy. It’s like putting your brake into whipped cream,” he said. “But after a while it will settle. With dog teams and snow machines running over it, it will set up and be firm.”
Old snow, especially if it’s well travelled, means top speed – provided of course that mushers can hold on to their dogs and their sleds. “If you can imagine being pulled by 16 huskies all wanting to run and you are doing it on dirt and snow and ice – you are lucky you don’t bounce off trees,” Fielder said.
If you are Alaskan, you are used to change – and yeah, even climate change. People will change with it
His team fell several times on the most brutal section of the course, The Burn. That area typically does not get much snow, leaving a barren, scoured course. “We’ve got plenty of black and blue marks to prove it,” Fiedler said. “It was a hard, fast trail. It was hard to go slow.”
 It was as hard on the dogs as the humans. Alaskan huskies were bred for performance in the north – smaller than Siberian huskies with a faster trot, thick coats to keep them warm, and fur between the toes to protect their feet from abrasive snow.
Several racers said they adjusted their strategy – making sure to finish their runs by 11am or 12pm, allowing the dogs to nap in the warmest part of the day. Helwig ran her dogs at night, as much as she could. In some places even the dogs’ feed was at risk. At almost every checkpoint, the food drops of frozen dog meat thawed and refroze by the time some competitors checked in. Helwig said she was forced to throw out food because it had spoiled in the sun.
Competing in the Iditarod – and finishing the race – takes a peculiar combination of dog-loving softy and mental discipline. For racers, it was unthinkable that warmer temperatures could ever put the Iditarod out of business.
“You could go into the doom-and-gloom route and say we’re all done,” Herbst said. But he argued that would not be the Alaska way. The lower 48 might see Alaska only as a cold and lonely place – but they failed to see the whole picture.
“For me Alaska, really is the last frontier. It’s about people being resilient,” Herbst said. “If you are Alaskan, you are used to change – and yeah, even climate change. People will change with it.” "

Advocates generate reams of numbers to substantiate their preferred outcome.
I would be an idiot to argue against numbers as part of the toolbox to help us understand difficult challenges. But numbers can be misleading, especially if you don’t know how they were derived. Bear in mind these are numbers that purport to predict the future. 
This is especially true when it comes to climate change, where numbers paper over a lot of philosophy and assumptions. We are wading in to an uncertain climate future, yet many experts are happy to offer fascinatingly precise-looking numbers telling us exactly what to expect and how to act. 
On the one hand, the numbers from opponents of climate action show, say, how the House of Representative’s 2009 Waxman-Markey bill or the EPA’s Clean Power Plan regulation will kill jobs. Whatever their accuracy, their immediacy feeds the election-to-election perspective of most elected officials despite longer-term evidence that the earth is warming, and that this warming will have dire consequences. 
But even those who support climate change action and have the numbers to prove it aren’t necessarily doing us a favor. Their elaborate cost-benefit models calculate the “real” costs imposed by warming to decide what warrants action – and by definition, what does not. They come up with specific figures that can be spent without running the economy into the ground, where the benefits of action exceed the costs.
The sheer impossibility of writing a model that can capture every potential impact of climate change means that modelers decide what to quantify – and what not to. Among their choices are damage to agriculture, forestry, water resources, energy consumption, sea level, ocean acidification, ecosystems and health. On top of that, the model should – but often does not – account for a dynamic unfolding process including the possibility of abrupt, catastrophic changes. Each decision requires an assigned number.
There is a tendency to steer away from parts that are really hard. These are often, as risk-perception researcher Paul Slovic says, the indirect consequences of unexpected events.
Some models assume that agriculture can tolerate temperature swings of 30.6F above and below historical levels, or that it is easy for farmers to adjust to warming by modifying tilling, irrigation, planting and harvesting decisions.
The result is a neat-looking package on what is reasonable to spend to control emissions. One used by the US government gave its blessing to spending $42 in 2020 to eliminate a metric ton of carbon dioxide  and $69 for 2050. Meanwhile, the last time carbon emissions were as high as they are now, dinosaurs roamed the Earth. There are actually economists whose math advises us not to worry about climate change because the US will benefit (in part because most people prefer warm to cold weather). Or that ocean acidification is OK because a massive extinction of marine life will likely occur over many generations of people who will increasingly grow up without experiencing what has been lost.
When models steer the climate conversation, it inverts priorities in two ways: it allows the modelers to decide which climate damages are important and which are not – and how to value them. And it diverts attention from the real issue – what level of risk we are willing to tolerate. But there are other ways to formulate policy.
One was offered by 11 retired admirals and generals who advise that climate change “should be addressed now because [it] will almost certainly get worse if we delay.” Policy rooted in risk would balance math with unfiltered science, arguing for acting now and spending more. It would front-load the response rather than leave it to future generations. After all, it is hard to see how anyone down the road might replace the Greenland ice sheet once it’s melted. 
We think about risk every day when we consider crossing a busy street or purchasing insurance against the outside chance of being hit by disease or a devastating fire – all risks we can easily imagine. A risk approach for climate policy would put front and center the science telling us that humans are releasing carbon at a rate unprecedented during the past 66m years with “unforeseeable” changes to the earth on the horizon rather than instant-gratification-based policymaking.
Another, better approach to climate change is to recognize that there is no single answer. Numbers provide clues, but it is critical to understand where they came from. Facing the existential threat of climate change, humanity and policymakers cannot afford simplistic answers, developed in defiance of scientific truths. We must always question the numbers before us."

And now we’re meant to panic because it’s boiling in Australia. It’s called weather, people. El Niño mean anything? Thought not. It was hot here in 1976, wasn’t it? Nobody went mental, said our kids would all fry if we didn’t give up lawnmowers, or whatever it is now – yoghurt, probably. You know they’re trying to blame cows, as well as anybody evil enough to boil a kettle?
No, because there weren’t any renewables in 1976. Ask yourself, who’s making a profit, it’s all about power and money, wind farms and solar panels – and batshit crazy catastrophists lying about extinct polar bears. Complete myth. Fact: they’re all going in your lasagne. It’s just being covered up. So where are the polar bear bodies then? Just do the math.
If it’s really warming, how come we still have to fly abroad on holiday? You know what the temperature is in the North Sea today? In March? Oh, yes, very globally warmed. Definitely throwing away my wetsuit. Fact: the whole planet is cooling. Well, once the consensus was, the Earth is flat. If I’m wrong, why don’t we have vineyards like in medieval times? A lot of people would love a vineyard, but oh no, hysteria’s a better earner.
I don’t care about the 1950s! Why don’t they compare it with what it was like for the dinosaurs? It’s the alarmists getting desperate, churning this stuff out, they’re terrified – they can’t admit it’s the coldest March in years and there are more penguins around than at any time in human history. It’s all being hushed up.
Why do we never hear about it? Go figure. This brilliant scientist, Professor Delingpole, he’s proved we’re entering a new Ice Age – human survival literally depends on us in the developed world flying and burning fossil fuels, but the treehuggers would rather we all went extinct than admit they’re wrong. So why does he have to write it in the Spectator? The greenies make him. Fact."

“I’m looking out of the window here in Anchorage and I can just see grass instead of snow,” said Andy Moderow, state director of not-for-profit group Alaska Wilderness Action. 
Moderow grew up dog-sledding but said record temperatures have effectively wiped out Alaska’s winter, meaning a miserable time for those who enjoy snow sports.
“There has basically been no snow on the ground all winter in Anchorage. When I was younger, the Iditarod sled race went from Anchorage to Wasilla but there’s no snow there now. 
“The changes are all around us. It’s very rare to have multiple winters like this in a row. When you see ski races not take place, grass instead of snow, villages falling into the oceans, you realise the impacts are real.”
But while Alaska is clearly on the melting edge of climate change, this fundamental shift barely registered in the Republican caucus held earlier in March and won by Ted Cruz. Even though Democratic candidates have been more willing to discuss climate change, the topic hasn’t been front and centre ahead of Saturday’s caucus.
It is an absence that has been felt in presidential primaries and caucuses across the US, including states that have been ravaged by drought or sea level rise. In a desperate attempt to reverse the lack of environmental focus, a group of Florida mayors begged CNN to quiz Republicans about sea level rise at a debate held in Miami. 
In the event, Florida senator Marco Rubio’s response, like those of many of his fellow candidates, was light on science and heavy on equivocation.
“I suppose the American media has to shoulder some of the blame,” said Michael Mann, a leading climate scientist. “Both Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, consistently emphasise climate change as being one of our greatest challenges.
“They mention it in nearly every speech they give. So the candidates themselves seem to be doing their part. Yet when American journalists have had an opportunity to question the candidates, in the various debates that have been held for example, the topic is rarely mentioned.”
Several factors are tamping down debate over climate change and other environmental issues such as land use, pollution and mining. One is a lack of disagreement between candidates within the parties; another is the feeling that despite record numbers of Americans believing climate change is human-caused and a looming problem, it will not drive voters to the polls in a panic.
For most Americans, climate change is not a crisis. Terrorist attacks and Isis are closer to crises
“For most Americans, climate change is not a crisis,” said Bill Schneider, a veteran political analyst who has covered every presidential election since 1976. “Terrorist attacks and Isis are closer to crises. 
“Unless a problem becomes a crisis, most Americans don’t want to talk or think about it. The only way our country deals with problems is when they become absolutely critical, that’s the way the government is set up. Everything gets blocked otherwise.
“If the city of Miami became hopelessly flooded, maybe it would be an issue. But, like many elections, long-term issues take a back seat. Remember Ebola? It’s not an issue. It’s now Zika. Politics is a short-term game.”
Republican candidates have generally avoided climate change or called the science behind it “bullshit” or a “religion”. Even the Ohio governor, John Kasich, who accepts the world is warming due to human activity, has steered clear of the topic, seemingly out of a sense of political self-preservation. Kasich recently admitted his lack of climate denialism was “apostasy” within the current Republican party.
But even Clinton and Sanders, who both advocate sharp reductions in greenhouse gases and the phasing out of fossil fuels, rarely lead on the issue of climate.
“They want to reassure liberal Democrats that they are thinking about it, but then Sanders instantly changes the topic to inequality and Hillary switches to terrorism,” Schneider said.
“They talk about what they want to talk about. If she’s the nominee, Clinton will talk about climate change, but not too much because it may hurt her in parts of the country reliant on the auto industry or coal. 
“Democrats say climate change is a serious problem, much like Republicans say the national debt is a problem. But neither are seen as a crisis. When Republicans are asked if they will cut programs and raise taxes to deal with the debt, they won’t do it. Climate change is the same. There’s not an immediate requirement to deal with it.”
Much like everything in this election, the spectre of Donald Trump looms large. Last week, the Republican frontrunner said: “I am not a great believer in manmade climate change. I’m not a great believer.” 
To now customary bemusement, he added: “I think our biggest form of climate change we should worry about is nuclear weapons.”
Trump’s denial of the science – he regularly conflates climate with the weather – has helped suck oxygen out of the issue.
“With Trump being the dominant news story, it’s hard to hear anything about any of the Democratic priorities,” said Professor Christopher Anderson, a climate scientist at Iowa State University who was part of an effort to get the issue on the political radar ahead of the state’s curtain-raising caucuses.
“In years to come, 2016 will be called the Trump election, all about him,” Schneider said. “He’s driving the Republican race and he’s also driving the Democratic race.”
While the spectacular rise of Trump will live long in the memory, future generations may well be astonished that climate change wasn’t top of the agenda when Americans took to the polls after the world’s warmest year on record, with parts of the country in their worst drought in 1,200 years and millions of people at risk of being swamped by ballooning sea level increases.
“I think historians will be befuddled by the fact that the greatest challenge we face as a civilization was all but ignored by the media and political class,” said Mann. 
“But give the two Democratic candidates their due credit. They’re trying.”"

Elected by governments five years before to chair the small independent organisation charged with informing them on the state of global climate science, Pachauri had seen off the Bush administration, which loathed the IPCC for not taking its line on climate change. He had weathered vicious attacks by sceptics and steered the IPCC to worldwide acclaim.
The award, which the IPCC shared with Al Gore, was, he said, “a rare triumph for science” and for the many scientists who had been relentlessly attacked in the rightwing press.
Nine years on, this international figure, who was named Indian of the year and has received major awards from dozens of countries, is lying low in Delhi. He is accused of sexual harassment, stalking and criminal intimidation of a young colleague whom he had employed as a researcher while he travelled the world seeking governmental support for action on climate change.
Faced with prison, ruin and disgrace when his case comes before the Delhi courts next month, Pachauri has resigned from the IPCC and stepped back from Teri, the huge energy research institute that he founded and which has taken solar lighting to hundreds of millions of Indians. Meanwhile, his many enemies are revelling in his discomfort, his health has suffered and he has been subject to death threats and demonstrations by women’s groups.
His accuser, who cannot be named, is a science graduate. She says he besieged her with offensive messages, emails and texts in the 16 months she spent working with him. In February 2015, she gave police a cache of several thousand electronic messages as evidence.
She says she rejected Pachauri’s “carnal and perverted” advances. “On many occasions, Dr Pachauri forcibly grabbed my body, hugged me, held my hands, kissed me and touched my body in an inappropriate manner,” she told police.
From the emails, Pachauri appears enamoured of the woman. “I am yours for life,” he writes at one point; “I have never felt so overwhelmingly in love as I have been with you, and even though you gave me so much pain, I will always be your well-wisher and carry beautiful memories of the joyous moments between us, limited as they might have been,” he says in another.
In emails, poems and messages, he professes undying love for her “in soul, mind and heart”.
“I will go on a fast after a cricket match … I will break the fast only when you believe I love you with sincerity and unfathomable depth,” he wrote.
“Please you are not to grab me and or kiss me,” the woman told Pachauri in one text. He replied: “I wish you would see the difference between something tender and loving and something crass and vulgar.”
Until now, Pachauri has said nothing about the case beyond denying all the charges, and claiming that his emails and computers had been hacked or misused. Now, however, in a series of emails with the Observer and in one meeting in London, he claims that his accuser was acting for money, and was probably set up to trap him by persons unknown.
He claims that she had access to all his five email accounts, and to his electronic files which included personal correspondence and many poems that he had written over the years.
“What is disturbing [is] that right from the first day over a period of about 16 months she was creating and assembling an archive of messages, which to anyone would seem very unusual. As far as I know, the emails, text messages etc that she collected were personal, semi-personal and only in a few cases official,” he says.
He claims it would have been easy for someone to have assumed his identity and sent messages seemingly from him to her, without his knowledge.
“I was, during that period, extremely busy and carrying out email communications on six different email accounts. These included my Yale, IPCC, Teri official, Hotmail as well as Gmail accounts. I generally corresponded with her on my Gmail account, but since I had a huge volume of messages to deal with I did not frequently read my messages, except when I was alerted about a message waiting for me. When I did access this account, I would only read unread messages. Honestly, how many of us check our sent items regularly?”
In what would have been a sophisticated sting, he argues that his poems were taken and turned round to make it seem they were addressed to her. In one he wrote: “She’s so cold! Unrequited stays my love and arms empty and bare!/Yet in this poor man’s heart love for her incessantly grows/But she’s cold and for this love of mine Ms. ___ would never care.” The original name would then be changed.
“The poems I have written and saved electronically all have some names or the other, particularly in the case of romantic poems, and these can be easily altered by replacing the name that is mentioned with anybody else’s name.”
Through her lawyers, the woman has told the Observer that there is no truth in Pachauri’s claim that computers were hacked, and that the Delhi police are also convinced there is no truth in it.
“There are emails, SMS messages and WhatsApp messages which categorically prove to the contradictory. It is a blatant lie being stated by Mr Pachauri,” said her lawyer, Prashant Mendiratta.
But Pachauri counters that, far from him chasing her, the correspondence shows that she had approached him. “She actively flirted with me and aggressively encouraged a deeper relationship between us.”
Documents filed with the court by Pachauri’s lawyer are said to show that, on 29 September 2013, just weeks after she went to work with him, the woman wrote in an email: “I am learning as I always say and if I may, please allow me to hug you when deem[ed] appropriate if you cannot seem to hug me and rightly so. I hold nothing against you at all and never will.”
In another, she says: “Remember how I first met you and what followed next? It was all the inside of me telling me that I must pursue it with this particular man. I will be happy with what makes you happy as long as that brings you satisfaction and sense of belonging.”
And again, she writes: “Yes, I may not have taken a step towards you in the direction you want me to but I think I did take a few so as to always ensure that I am around and there for you even if silently. You have no idea how much I value you and how weird it feels when you are on travel or not in office; the invigoration that you bring, is so missing.”
But the woman’s lawyer denies that she was flirting. “My client was not flirting with him or making advances to him. At no point did she encourage him or give him any reason to make inappropriate physical contact or demand sexual favours.”
Pachauri is adamant: “From my perspective this was nothing but a very cordial and mutual relationship. There was a light and friendly tone to our correspondence, but at no stage did I ever hint at having a physical relationship nor did I in any way engage in sexual harassment.”
With others, they travelled to cities around the world together during which time he says she never complained or said anything to him or any other member of the Teri staff. He claims to have been staggered when, after 16 months, out of the blue, she complained and went to the police: “She gave me absolutely no warning that she was going to file a complaint with Teri or with the police, or ever brought up that she had any issues of the kind. I, on the other hand, unwittingly gave her a contract for employment for three years, which she gladly accepted. But soon after she started lobbying for a higher position which would have involved two promotions.”
Although a second woman has appeared on TV complaining of Pachauri’s advances in 2002, one woman spoken to at Teri says the institute is the “safest place for women to work”, and that “Patchy”, as he is widely known, is seen as one of the family. “I fail to understand that if she had any problem, why she waited for so long. Apart from HR, there were a large number of female senior colleagues to whom she could have spoken. Also, why [if she was being harassed] she accompanied him on foreign trips,” she said.
Pachauri says his computers and telephone were hacked. In February 2015 he received an email on his Gmail account. It read: “U bludy climate clown,,,v got ur email n now v will us!!!! 2 hack ur mail n u in peeses.”
He says: “I have repeatedly received death threats anonymously over the years. In recent months I have received these threats over the telephone from numbers that were valid when East Germany was a nation. I am not sure how these people have numbers pertaining to that defunct international code.”
He says he suspects strongly, but cannot prove, that there has been a coordinated attempt to destroy him professionally and personally and that money may also be involved. Ever since he was elected to lead the IPCC in 2002, he says the IPCC has been vilified by climate sceptics and rightwing free-market thinktanks, often known to have been funded by powerful fossil-fuel interests.
‘My client was not flirting with him. At no point did she encourage him or give him reason to demand sexual favours’
For sceptics to force the resignation of the head of the UN’s climate panel would be a coup, undermining its scientific credibility and possibly derailing global agreement, he says.
In 2009 he survived strong calls for his resignation when he took responsibility for an error in the IPCC’s fourth assessment report. In 2010 he was investigated by British journalists who alleged potential conflicts of interest with his advisory roles. Pachauri sued the Sunday Telegraph, which was forced to apologise and pay £53,000 costs.
But Pachauri points to a blog by one of the journalists, Richard North, and suggests that there could have been a conspiracy to bring him down. North wrote in August 2010: “Pachauri is on the ropes but he ain’t down yet. The view is it will take one more ‘killer blow’ to fell him … and it looks as if it’s been found!”
North said last week that he was referring only to his financial investigation of Pachauri but adds that many people – possibly in the Indian government or within Teri – would like to bring him down.
“More than a few people would think he is too big for his boots,” said North. “He treated Teri as his personal fiefdom. Obviously she was leaned on. This is straight out of All the President’s Men. It’s about ‘rat-fucking’. Black politics to undermine Pachauri’s reputation. I can see people using her. But there has to be someone at the head of it.”
The next stage of the trial is set for April, after which Pachauri will be summoned to appear in the Delhi court. Until then, the man who as much as anyone persuaded the world to act on climate change is unable to act himself."

They will drill deep into the Col du Dôme glacier on Mont Blanc and remove a 130 metre core of ice. Then they will fly it, in sections, by helicopter to a laboratory in Grenoble before shipping it to Antarctica. There the ice core will be placed in a specially constructed vault at the French-Italian Concordia research base, 1,000 miles from the south pole.
The Col du Dôme ice will become the first of several dozen other cores, extracted from glaciers around the world, that will be added to the repository over the next few years. The idea of importing ice to the south pole may seem odd – the polar equivalent of taking coals to Newcastle – but the project has a very serious aim, researchers insist.
Earth’s glaciers are now melting at a unprecedented rate as a result of global warming – and that poses a serious scientific problem. As ice forms on a glacier, it encloses small bubbles of air that contain a sample of the atmosphere at that time. From these samples, scientists can measure atmospheric concentrations of gases such as carbon dioxide and methane over periods that range from hundreds to tens of thousands of years into the past.
“Ice cores are like books,” said project leader Jérôme Chappellaz, of the Glaciology Laboratory in Grenoble. “Each year a new layer of ice is put down and adds a page to that book, one that records data from a particular year of the glacier’s life. It tells us what concentration of gases and pollutants were in the atmosphere at a particular time. And the deeper we go down into the glacier, the further back in time we travel. Unfortunately, as our glaciers melt, the pages of these books – both the ancient and the more recent ones – are being destroyed.”
As a result, Chappellaz has set up the Saving Ice in Danger project [PDF], which aims to collect ice core samples and keep them for future analyses. “We are setting up the archive to prevent precious information about past climate change from being wiped from the face of the planet,” he added. “This is a race against time.”
An indication of the rate at which glaciers have been warming in recent years is provided by measurements that were taken between 1994 and 2005 on the Col du Dôme glacier. Researchers found that temperatures at the heart of the glacier rose by 1.5C in that decade, a rate that would melt the glacier totally in a few decades.
Nor is the problem confined to Europe. Across the globe, ice is disappearing at a staggering rate as rising carbon emissions bring global temperatures to record levels. The snows of Kilimanjaro have melted more than 80% since 1912, for example, while researchers fear most central and eastern Himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035. Glacier National Park in Montana once contained 150 glaciers. Today there are only a couple of dozen and in a few decades nearly all the park’s glaciers are likely to have disappeared, scientists have warned.
The need to protect the precious information locked into the ice of these glaciers has become urgent, said Chappellaz. In a few weeks, he will co-ordinate the removal of the first ice core – from Col du Dôme, 4,350 metres high on the Mont Blanc massif – that will be taken to the Saving Ice in Danger vault in Antarctica. Next year, a core will be extracted from the Illimani glacier in Bolivia – which has been identified as the most threatened glacier in the Andes – and sent to Concordia.
“Speed will be critically important,” said Chappellaz. “We have to ensure there is minimal thawing before getting a core to a freezer. In the case of the Col du Dome core, we will helicopter it straight down the mountain to a cold store at ground level before shipping it to Antarctica.
“Illimani is too high for helicopters so we will have to employ porters to carry sections down – but only at night when temperatures are low enough to prevent thawing.”
Other glacier sites that have been targeted by Saving Ice in Danger include the Colle Gniffetti glacier on the Swiss-Italian border; the Huascaran glacier in the Andes; the Guliya glacier on the Tibetan plateau; the East Rongbuk near Mount Everest; and Mount Cook in New Zealand.
“With the exception of glaciers in the Western Himalayas, all the world’s great ice sheets are losing ice at an alarming rate and we are to have to act very quickly,” said Chappellaz.
The problem for the project is funding, however. “We cannot apply for standard science funding because we are not carrying out research,” he added. “We are trying to preserve a source of data for future research and so we are having to apply to private donors – fortunately with some success. The Prince Albert of Monaco Foundation has given us €2m to begin the project.”
As a result, scientists hope that in three or four years, a steady supply of ice core samples will be arriving in the vault at Concordia. And given that the average temperature at the site is around minus 50C, there is little danger that a power failure might lead to catastrophic thawing of samples. “This is one of the coldest places on Earth,” said Chappellaz. “We should be safe there for a while.”
Studies of ice cores have played a key role in demonstrating that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have a strong influence on climate change. They have shown that low concentrations occur during cold times and high concentrations in warm periods. This is entirely consistent with the idea that temperature and carbon dioxide levels are intimately linked and that each acts to amplify changes in the other.
“We see no examples in the ice-core record of a major increase in carbon dioxide that was not accompanied by an increase in temperature,” says the British Antarctic Survey on its webpage on ice cores and climate change.
As ice cores provide the data that has established this link, they have therefore played a key role in understanding how carbon emissions are driving global warming. Ironically, it is the impact of these emissions that now threatens this crucial source of data about our climate."

Globally, chocolate consumption is on the rise and the majority of this demand is met by cocoa farmers in southern West Africa. Now there are concerns that pollution in the region could interfere with the West African monsoon, potentially drying up the world’s main supply of cocoa beans.
Like many other cities in southern West Africa, Abidjan on the Côte d’Ivoire, is growing fast, and with the expansion comes increasing air pollution. So will these extra particulates and gases change the weather?
Already scientists have shown that the increased emissions of sulphates over India has led to more sunlight being reflected back up to space. Consequently land in India has remained cooler, reducing the land-sea contrast in temperature, resulting in diminished Indian monsoon rainfall in recent years.
Could West Africa be about to suffer a similar fate? The West African monsoon, which brings moist air from the Gulf of Guinea during northern hemisphere summer, is already very variable already, but scientists are now concerned that the extra pollution might really mess it up. This summer an EU funded project – Dynamics-Aerosols-Chemistry-Cloud Interaction in West Africa – is flying scientists into the clouds to take measurements across the region, and assess what impact pollution is having on the monsoon. If emissions from cities like Abidjan are damping down the West African monsoon then chocoholics may have to pay significantly more for their favourite sweet treat, until the skies are cleaned and optimal chocolate-weather returns."

I recently wrote about this here, where I reviewed the studies. It turns out that the more scientists know about climate change, the more they are convinced that humans are warming the planet. In fact, the consensus is extraordinarily strong. But it isn’t just that the vast majority of scientists agree; it’s that the best scientist agree. We find that the contrarian scientists tend to be less accomplished, have had their research found to be incorrect time after time, and they produce less science. 
But very recently, a study from the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication was completed that adds to our knowledge on the consensus. Lead author Ed Maibach and his colleagues are very well-respected surveyors and scientists who study this topic. The study didn’t focus on what we think of as climate scientists – rather they polled meteorologists. 
There were actually two surveys that were merged. In one, the authors identified 1038 professionals currently working in broadcast meteorology from the American Meteorological Society (AMS). In a concurrent study, the authors obtained a list of members from the AMS who were not broadcast meteorologists. The two groups were asked a series of questions on whether climate change is occurring, the degree to which respondents felt humans were responsible, what could be done to minimize climate change, among others. The authors also asked about the educational background of the respondents.
Not all members of the AMS are meteorologists. Additionally, someone working in meteorology is not necessarily a climate scientist. Similarly, a climate scientist is not necessarily a meteorologist. Sometimes these populations overlap but in many cases they do not. 
One thing that tends to differentiate practicing meteorologists from climate scientists is that meteorologists tend to observe short-term weather more, while climate scientists tend to look at long-term trends. While this difference may sound trivially obvious, it’s an important distinction to keep in mind because it suggests meteorologists may be more likely to see differences in observed weather patterns. Climate scientists would be less likely to be swayed by changes in weather patterns.
So what did the survey find? First, nearly every meteorologist (96%) agrees that climate change is happening, and the vast majority are confident in their opinion. Only 1% felt that climate change isn’t happening (3% did not know). Next, a large majority feel that climate change is being caused by humans. For instance, 29% believe that the change is largely or entirely human caused; 38% think most of the change is from humans; 14% answered that humans and natural factors are about equally responsible. Only 5% felt that climate change is mainly natural.
Another important finding is that most meteorologists feel that some of the change can be averted, based on how we react. Small minorities felt that a large amount of change can be averted or that climate change cannot be averted.
These views have changed over the years. For instance, almost 20% of meteorologists say their opinion on climate has changed over the past five years. Of that group, the vast majority are more convinced that the climate is changing and they cite a variety of reasons including new research, seeing first-hand evidence, the consensus amongst climate scientists, or from interactions with climate scientists. A final important result is that only 37% of the AMS respondents consider themselves climate experts.
Speaking more broadly about the meteorology community beyond the AMS, that population tends to be more skeptical that the Earth’s climate is changing. I tend to believe that the skepticism is partly because meteorologists in general focus on short-term events and also because a great many non-experts are counted as meteorologists (including people who do not have degrees in any science, let alone a meteorological science). Despite this, meteorologists’ views are important not only because they are a consistent scientific presence in many households, but also because the collective weather observation record from the meteorological community is a resource that is unmatched.
With this new study, the meteorological consensus is seen to be nearly as strong as that in the climate science community. I asked author Ed Maibach for a summary and he told me: 
It is not surprising that more meteorologists are now more convinced that human-caused climate change is happening. That is how science works. As the scientific evidence becomes more irrefutable, which is the case with harmful, human-caused climate change, more scientists of all types will become convinced."

Scientists at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre said on Monday that the sea ice cover attained an average maximum extent of 14.52m sq km (5.607m sq miles) on 24 March, the lowest winter maximum since records began in 1979. 
The low beats a record set only last year of 14.54m sq km (5.612m sq miles), reached on 25 February 2015. 
“I’ve never seen such a warm, crazy winter in the Arctic,” said NSIDC director Mark Serreze. “The heat was relentless.”
It was the third straight month of record lows in the sea ice cover, after extreme temperatures in January and February stunned scientists.
The winter months of utter darkness and extreme cold are typically the time of maximum growth in the ice cap, until it begins its seasonal decline in spring.
With the ice cover down to 14.54m sq km, scientists now believe the Arctic is locked onto a course of continually shrinking sea ice – and that is before the 2016 melt season gets underway.
“If we are starting out very low that gives a jump on the melt season,” said Rick Thoman, the climate science manager for the National Weather Service’s Alaska region. 
“For the last few years, we have had extremely low ice cover in the summer. That means a lot more solar energy absorbed by the darker open water. That heat tends to carry over from year to year.”
After this winter’s record ice lows, scientists now expect more than ever that the Arctic will be entirely ice-free in the summer months within 20 or 25 years.
“Sometime in the 2030s or 2040s time frame, at least for a few days, you won’t have ice out there in the dead of summer,” said Dr John Walsh, chief scientist of the International Arctic Research Centre. 
Those changes are already evident on the ground. In 1975, there were only a few days a year when ships could move from Barrow to Prudhoe Bay off the north coast of Alaska. Now that window lasts months. 
The Arctic will always have ice in the winter months, Walsh said. But it will be thinner and more fragile than the multi-year ice, and less reliable for indigenous peoples who rely on the ice as winter transport routes or hunting platforms.
“It’s not just about how many hundreds of thousands of square kilometres covered by the ice. It’s about the quality of that ice,” Thoman said.
The extent of ice cover is a critical indicator of the changes taking place in the Arctic – but the shrinking of the polar ice carries sweeping consequences for lower latitudes as well.
 The bright white snow-covered ice reflects about 85% of sunlight back into the atmosphere, compared to the dark surfaces of the open water which absorb most of the heat energy.
“Basically the polar regions are the refrigerator for the Earth,” said Dr Donald Perovich, a researcher at Dartmouth University. “They are extremely important for being able to keep the Arctic colder, and in turn help keep the rest of the planet colder.”
Since 1980, however, the summer sea ice cover over the Arctic has gone into a drastic decline, from 7.8m sq km to 4.4m sq km in 2012, before rebounding slightly. “It would be as if the entire United States east of the Mississippi melted away plus the states from Minnesota down to Louisiana, past North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma. It’s huge,” Perovich said. 
 This winter scientists said the Arctic freeze stalled early on, across the polar seas. The sea ice extent was exceptionally low both in the Barents and the Bering seas – which in past years has been one of the most prolific producers of ice. And it was thinner, especially in the Beaufort sea north of Alaska, scientists said.
There were a number of causes, in addition to the record high temperatures and carry-over effects of earlier ice loss.
The El Niño weather system produced more warming, and the Arctic saw influxes of exceptionally warm water from the Pacific as well as the Atlantic side.
In any event, Walsh said it was becoming increasingly clear the Arctic would never return to its previous frozen state, even if there are small gains in ice cover in a single year.
“The balance is shifting to the point where we are not going back to the old regime of the 1980s and 1990s,” he said. “Every year has had less ice cover than any summer since 2007. That is nine years in a row that you would call unprecedented. When that happens you have to start thinking that something is going on that is not letting the system go back to where it used to be.”"

The jet stream is expected to become more powerful as the climate warms, and that means flights to America battling against fiercer headwinds.
Flights from New York to London, on the other hand, will probably speed up as they ride on the faster jet stream, although this won’t balance the slower flights and a round trip will still be longer. That means more fuel used by the aircraft, more air pollution and possibly higher fares, according to researchers at the University of Reading in a study published in the journal “Environmental Research Letters”.
And the effect of a powerful jet stream was brought home in a remarkable flight in January last year, when a British Airways flight from New York to London reached 745mph, near supersonic speed, by riding on an exceptionally fast jet stream of around 250mph.
Airlines face other troubles as the climate warms. Planes taking off in hot weather need to reach higher speeds, because warm air is less dense than cold air. That means aircraft having to travel lighter, with fewer passengers or less cargo. Since 1980, the number of flights forced to cut their loads increased at four airports studied in the US, as average temperatures rose at each location.
Alternatively, aircraft will have to use more fuel, but either way it’s likely to mean higher fares. The only other options are more take-offs at night, early mornings or evenings when it’s usually cooler, or building longer runways, none of which is good news."

Corals in the northern section of Australia’s vast Great Barrier Reef – a length of more than 1000km or so – have become the latest and most famous victims of the third global “mass bleaching” of corals since 1998.
“It’s pretty confronting,” says Prof Terry Hughes, a leading coral scientist who has been spending recent days in a helicopter surveying the reef.
Of the 520 reefs he flew over, only four have managed to retain their colour. He’s back in the skies to look further south in the coming days.
“The Great Barrier Reef is today a diminished place from what it was a month ago,” Hughes, of James Cook University, told me.
“We can’t climate proof this reef. We have seen the most pristine part of the reef take a direct hit.”
As Hughes travelled further north to parts of the reef outside the boundaries of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, he saw corals “blitzed” in the Torres Strait.
For &gt;1000km of the #GreatBarrierReef, corals are severely bleached and dying, yet our government wants more #coal pic.twitter.com/LrtVA41Htj
Corals get their striking colours thanks to the zooxanthellae algae that they live with. 
But when the corals and the algae are stressed, they separate, leaving a bare white skeleton behind.
In mass bleaching events, the stress comes when corals bathe for too long in unusually warm ocean waters.
This is the point at which the Great Barrier Reef and the world’s fossil fuel industry come into direct conflict. 
So far, the reef is losing.
According to the Bureau of Meteorology, the sea surface temperatures (SST) in the Coral Sea region have been the highest on record for this most recent summer wet season.
The BoM’s ocean temperature record goes back to the year 1900. As this chart shows, SSTs overlapping the northern parts of the reef have been the highest of any summer (December to February) on record.
Hughes said that in 1998, 2002 and this current GBR bleaching event, the areas of the reef that bleached matched “perfectly” the areas with unusually high SST.
The record warm oceans that have been stressing the corals in recent weeks are part of a long-term trend of warming ocean temperatures around the globe, including the waters off Australia.
The cause of that warming trend is the extra heat being retained by the Earth’s climate system thanks to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas that add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and the oceans.
Not surprisingly, the coal industry has tried to muddy the scientific waters on this key point.
As I’ve written here before, the fact that Australia’s expansion of its coal export industry takes ships on a route straight through the reef could be seen as something of a sick joke.
If all the corals are bleaching, then there are no winners.
When I asked Hughes about the cause of the bleaching, he replied simply: “Global warming – the link is incontrovertible.”
What’s also important to understand is that the corals in the north that have been bleached, are probably the least impacted by human activity across the GBR.
Current and previous governments at state and federal levels, of both stripes, have increased investments to cut the amount of nutrient-rich waters and pollution running into the reef from farms and development along the coast. 
But scientists, including the government’s own, have been warning for years now that the most important threat to the reef is from climate change. 
Hughes says that while it is true that some coral species are more resilient to bleaching than others, this gives him little comfort when he had witnessed even the most resilient species bleached in recent days.
“If half the corals bleach you will sea a pattern of winners and losers. But if all the corals are bleaching, then there are no winners. And they are all bleaching,” he says. 
Hughes says it’s also misleading to pin the blame for the current bleaching event on the El Niño climate pattern. 
Evidence from long term coral records did not show the signatures of coral bleaching, even though those corals would have been through many El Niño events. Hughes explains: 
It’s only since 1998 that the extra spikes [from El Niño] cause problems. We had El Niños for centuries but they don’t show bleaching.
Because it’s pristine [in the reef’s north], it’s not got the issues with run-off [from agriculture and coastal development] and it should better be able to bounce back.
But if it takes 10 years, what’s the chance of getting another El Nino before 2026? It’s high. We will be in trouble if the return time is less than the recovery time. 
In another bitter slice of irony, Hughes says that the central and southern sections of the reef probably “dodged a bullet” but this was only thanks to the cooling influence of the tail-end of the same weather system that caused the devastating cyclone in Fiji.
When in November 2014 the US president, Barack Obama, told a crowd at the University of Queensland that the “incredible natural glory of the GBR is threatened”, Australia’s foreign minister, Julie Bishop, ignored the advice of her government scientists to lead a chorus of correction. 
“Of course the Great Barrier Reef will be conserved for generations to come and we do not believe that it is in danger,” she said.
In 2015, the Australian government spent $100,000 flying officials around the world to convince members of the World Heritage Committee not to place the reef on the “in danger” list. 
The lobbying effort was a “success” but the victory must surely now be ringing hollow. 
Hughes and other coral scientists are angry that years of warnings about the reef’s future have gone unheeded. 
Hughes said there was a “disconnect” between the science and Australia’s policies of developing coalmines.
Another world-leading coral scientist is Prof John Pandolfi, of the University of Queensland, who told me he had “several reactions all at once” to the bleaching playing out on the reef. 
Sadness for the reef. Anger at the government for the lack of consistent policy to minimise emissions locally, and inability to lead globally. Embarrassment that this is happening to such a national and international icon, in one of the wealthiest countries on Earth – if we can’t stop it here, who can? 
However, even though my immediate reaction is oriented toward policy, my measured scientific reaction is that this is a consequence of thermal stress, and we must use this event to further understand the thermal and other constraints under which corals survive. 
Pandolfi says the link between carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels and the bleaching of the reef is clear.
These hotter SSTs have caused a global mass bleaching event on the scale of which we have only witnessed two other times – 1998, 2010 – and the 2014-2016 event is now the longest on record. The Great Barrier Reef itself has suffered mass bleaching in 1998 and 2002. 
Regardless, the link between high SSTs and global bleaching is very clear, and the link between climate change and SSTs is very clear. Finally the link between global emissions and the rise of CO2 and SSTs is very clear. 
This all adds up to the human-caused element for this bleaching episode. It seems clear that if the ocean’s SST were not rising so fast we would not be experiencing these several bleaching events on a global scale. 
So what needs to happen? Both Hughes and Pandolfi, and do doubt a great many other coral scientists, are in pretty strong agreement. You can’t keep the reef healthy while emissions from fossil fuels continue to grow. Pandolfi has another suggestion. I’ll leave you with it.
I think it’s important for people to understand what they can do to help the situation. I grew up in a time when everyone thought it was impossible to ‘free South Africa’ but we all did what we could: we wrote to politicians, we personally divested from SA corporations and demanded our social institutions (e.g Universities) to do the same. 
Ultimately the strategy worked. We can do the same thing here – personal and social divestment of non-sustainable energy companies and sources, switching ourselves to such energy sources where and how we can. 
Emissions must come down sharply – the COP21 meeting has given the go ahead for this to become a reality. The coral bleaching on the GBR and elsewhere provides the prima facie evidence for pursuing this line of action. "

As extreme weather events such as flooding or heatwaves become more common, the UK Health Alliance on Climate Change urged ministers not to “wait for disaster” before acting.
The new alliance, made up of leading health bodies including royal colleges, medical faculties, medical publications and doctors’ organisations, called on the government to be “properly prepared”.
The group, launched on Wednesday, said the health service is ill-prepared for dealing with the effects of climate change such as the extreme weather seen this winter.
In a letter to the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, the alliance wrote: “More work is urgently needed to prepare the personnel, the systems and the facilities of the NHS, as well as other institutions involved in health care, for the implications of climate change.”
It points out that only a minority of local health bodies have plans in place which “adequately prepare their organisation to respond to climate change”, adding that almost one in 10 healthcare buildings in England are currently operating in flood risk zones.
John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health, said: “Ensuring that our NHS doesn’t fail as a result of the threats we face is vital.
“The Zika virus epidemic in South America and the impact of heatwaves in Europe, including in the UK, clearly demonstrate the devastating effects that result when the public and the health systems they rely on are unprepared for and overwhelmed by new challenges.
“Let’s not wait for disaster on this scale to strike the UK before we are properly prepared.”
The alliance said climate change is “very much a UK health issue” because of factors such as the impact of flooding on mental health to the spread of new infectious diseases.
Dr Clifford Mann, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: “We see firsthand what happens in A&amp;E departments when severe weather hits. Elderly people, pregnant women and children can be especially vulnerable and are often the first to get into difficulty. Flooding in particular makes homes uninhabitable and displaces large numbers of people. Even temporary displacement can result in long term physical and psychological damage.”
The alliance highlighted the severe floods this winter that disabled major infrastructure in northern England. Army trucks were stationed at a hospital in Lancaster to act as ambulances after flooding at an electricity sub-station and the closure of all the road bridges cut the city off from the power grid.
The group’s aim is to raise awareness of the health risks associated with climate change and promoting approaches to tackling the issue that also benefit public health, such as reducing air pollution, encouraging more active transport options, healthier diets and warmer homes."

The scientists said they took the unusual step of releasing the work prior to peer-review, because the methods used to reach the findings are now accepted in the climate science community and the alarming results needed to be released as quickly as possible. 
“We are confident in the results because these kind of attribution studies are well established but what we found demands urgent action if we are to preserve the reef,” said Andrew King, a lead author of the study from the University of Melbourne.
They found the record warm temperatures in the Coral Sea that drove the bleaching this year were driven by a combination of 1C of warming since 1900 caused by greenhouse gas emissions, and about a 0.5C jump in temperature driven by natural variability.
Using climate model simulations, the team found such an event was incredibly unusual in models that did not include the effects of greenhouse gasses. But when those effects were put back in, temperatures such as those seen this March were 175 times more likely.
Moreover, despite most of the current temperature record being driven by natural changes in temperature, they found that once greenhouse gasses reach levels expected in 2034, temperatures seen this March will be the new average for the Coral Sea.
“In a world without humans, it’s not quite impossible that you’d get March sea surface temperatures as warm as this year but it’s extremely unlikely,” King told Guardian Australia. “Whereas in the current climate it’s unusual but not exceptional. By the mid 2030s it will be average. And beyond that it will be cooler than normal if it was as warm as this year.”
The increase in regularity of bleaching events is worrying news, since reefs can often recover, so long as they are not being repeatedly affected by bleaching or other harms. Other research has shown coral reefs need around 15 years to recover from serious bleaching events, and only then recover if they are protected from fishing and poor water quality.
Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, another author on the paper and director of the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland, predicted a similar outcome for the reef in a paper from 1999. He said coral dominated reefs will be gone from the Great Barrier Reef by the middle of the century.
“The current bleaching event and this attribution study leads me to believe that my highly controversial predictions in 1999 were actually conservative,” he said. “Being right – in this case – is hardly cause for celebration.”
“Recovery rates are being overwhelmed by more frequent and severe mass coral bleaching.”
Wenju Cai, a world-leading climate scientist at the CSIRO, told Guardian Australia the findings could be very important. “The result is very significant if it turns out to be robust,” he said. “We never thought the Great Barrier Reef is going to die completely by the 2030s. If that’s true it’s a lot faster than we thought.”
Terry Hughes, a coral reef biologist at James Cook University and head of the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce, said the concerning results were not surprising – noting Hoegh-Guldberg had predicted similar results 17 years ago.
Further independent expert views on the research is being sought."

The prime minister also denied accusations that his decision to sign a contract guaranteeing that 12 submarines would be built in South Australia was a consequence of an agreement he made with federal MP for SA Christopher Pyne and senator Simon Birmingham in exchange for their support when he challenged Tony Abbott for the leadership.
“I’m not going to go into the ins and outs of the change of leadership,” he said.
Speaking on ABC radio in Adelaide on Wednesday, Turnbull said the $50bn submarines deal his government has struck with French company DCNS  would be signed by the end of the year.
The deal would allow for all the submarines to be built in Australia, rather than overseas. While it was a more expensive option, it was important for local jobs, he said.
“The difference between the cost of building all the submarines in France and all the submarines in Australia ... is a very manageable one,” he said. “It’s not the huge figure that people have speculated about.
“It is [also] critically important that with a sovereign defence capability we have the skills in Australia to build it, to maintain it, to sustain it. It is important that it is built in Australia ... as a matter of national security.”
He denied speculation he was keen to sign such a contract to hold up his end of a deal with his South Australian colleagues.
“I honestly think you’re trying to turn a great opportunity ... for Adelaide and South Australia into a debate about politics,” he said.
Abbott had pushed strongly for the submarines contract to be awarded to Japan ahead of France when he was in office.
After the French-won submarines contract was announced on Tuesday, Abbott sent a letter to Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, thanking him for trying to win the contract, according to reports.
On climate change policy, Turnbull said Labor’s new proposal to introduce two emissions trading schemes if it wins the election would “double the burden” on Australia relative to other countries.
The first scheme, for big industrial polluters, would force power generators to pay for the closure of a competitor’s dirty brown-coal-fired plant, while the second scheme, an electricity industry-specific “intensity based” trading scheme, is similar to one once backed by Turnbull himself.
Labor says the policy would minimise the hit on household power bills but it has left important details to be determined after the election.
Turnbull said the Coalition already had a strong climate change policy and he criticised Labor for wanting to run too far ahead of the rest of the world.
“We agreed with the rest of the global community on emissions reduction targets by 2030 ... our commitment is very substantial – it’s to reduce our emissions by 26-28% on a per-capita basis,” he said.
“Labor is proposing nearly twice as much: 45%. That is well above what we committed to at Paris and will put a very big burden on Australians.
“What they’re proposing is to double the burden on Australia, relative to other countries ... When a similar target was modelled on the basis of Labor’s previous scheme, it would have required a very substantial increase in electricity prices.”
Turnbull then warned the rest of the world would not be inspired to follow Labor’s lead.
“The key thing with climate change is to ensure that you get global action and so if one country decides to – just say there’s a change of government and they double their particular cut in emissions – that’s not going to motivate others to do any more,” he said. “Others will just say thanks very much.”
At a later press conference, Turnbull again attacked Labor’s plan for its likely economic consequences. “This is yet another economic handbrake that Labor is putting on our economy, another restraint on jobs to add to all the other job-destroying measures they’re proposing,” he said.
The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said unlike the Coalition, Labor accepts climate science and is prepared to avoid the high costs of inaction.
“We do not consider climate change a question of ‘belief’, we know it is an economic and environmental reality ... The cost of inaction, to our economy and the environment, will be profound. This is not a price Labor is prepared to make the next generation of Australians pay,” Shorten said."

Sea level forecasts by a coalition of scientists show that the Silicon Valley bases for Facebook, Google and Cisco are at risk of being cut off or even flooded, even under optimistic scenarios where rapid cuts in greenhouse gas emissions avoid the most severe sea level increases.
Without significant adaptation, Facebook’s new campus appears most at risk. The 430,000 sq ft complex – topped with a nine-acre garden rooftop – is an extension of its Menlo Park base and was crafted by architect Frank Gehry. Located near the San Francisco Bay shoreline, the offices are designed to house 2,800 staff.
“Facebook is very vulnerable,” said Lindy Lowe, a senior planner at California’s Bay Conservation and Development Commission. “They built on a very low site – I don’t know why they chose to build there. Facebook thinks they can pay enough to protect themselves. 
Facebook thinks they can pay enough to protect themselves
“The temporary flooding within the campus can probably be addressed, but the temporary flooding onto the roadway can’t be addressed by them. I think they realize that is the weakest link for them. We’ll see how dedicated they are to that facility.”
Facebook has elevated its office to spare it from flooding, but even with a 1.6ft rise in sea levels by the end of the century – which is towards the lower end of projections – the area around it will be inundated. Much sooner, within the coming decades, the roads leading into the complex will flood so regularly that major adaptions will be required to keep the site viable. Facebook didn’t respond to repeated requests to comment on the issue. 
The situation is a little better for Google, located in Mountain View and also unwilling to discuss sea level rise, and Cisco, headquartered in San Jose. But should the Antarctic ice sheet disintegrate, as outlined in a recent scientific paper, seas will be pushed up beyond 6ft and swamp both businesses. 
The situation is similarly stark for Salesforce, which would see its San Francisco base submerged under the worst sea level rise scenario. Meanwhile, Airbnb, located near the vulnerable Mission Bay area, will have its headquarters gain a much closer bayside view simply by staying put.
“Even with a small increase, the sea comes into the 101 highway by the Googleplex – whole areas could be screwed up,” said professor Kristina Hill, an environmental planning and urban design expert at UC Berkeley. “Google and Facebook will have to redo their campuses. I don’t think there’s been much success in getting Google to support adaption, it’s not really on their radar.”
Nearly $100bn in commercial and residential property around the Bay Area is at risk from sea level rises and severe storms without adaption, with an estimated $21bn in new developments planned for areas vulnerable to inundation and storm surges. San Francisco’s airport, the new $1bn stadium for the Golden State Warriors, the Giants’ baseball stadium AT&amp;T Park and sections of the Union Pacific railroad – a vital artery for the region – face significant long-term peril.
“There are projects that are problematic that are being approved,” Lowe said. “We have a lot of infrastructure pushed right up against the shoreline. There are parts of the shoreline in trouble at a 2-3ft (increase). When you get to 4-5ft, things start to go, significantly. Like, everything. It’s a tipping point.”
While not facing as severe a situation as Miami Beach, the Bay Area has some major challenges. Much of the region’s key infrastructure has been built upon low-lying wetlands that have been filled in. Liquefaction – a process where the earthquakes can weaken soils, turning them to “Jello”, according to BCDC coastal planner Wendy Goodfriend – risks water spouting up from underground onto the streets.
“The geological basis of the area is a lot of loose material, such as gravel and sand,” Hill said. “Underground freshwater could be pushed up into pipes that are typically cracked due to seismic activity. When those pipes fill up, rainwater won’t drain away properly and you’ll get basements filling up with sewage.
“Areas of land have subsided after they were filled in. San Jose has sunk by 15ft since it was a peach orchard. This isn’t a great combination with sea level rises and means that we are in a vulnerable situation.”
Several recent reports have warned that San Francisco is unprepared for sea level rise and some critics, including Hill, have accused the city of prizing investment in its booming property market – where house prices have leapt 62% in the past four years – over all else.
“People’s lives and property are at stake and we’ve been doing some fairly insane things in developing these areas,” Hill said.
She said plans for Mission Bay (soon to be home of the Warriors) and Treasure Island (a chunk of land near the Golden Gate Bridge earmarked for 8,000 homes and three hotels) were “fantasy projects”.
“The developers’ interest is to sell the properties, ideally before they open,” she said. “Everyone is invested in a quick turnaround, including the developers and the government. The people who are on the hook are those who will buy or rent these places for the next 25 years.”
The city of San Francisco insists it is taking sea level rise seriously and is putting serious mitigation measures in place. Its own planning documents show it expects parts of the bay shoreline to be submerged, as well as strips of the western coast to be eaten up by the rising Pacific Ocean. Public assets including the airport, fire department and port are at risk.
Without adaptation measures, the frequency of temporary flooding will increase with rising seas in low-lying areas
“Without adaptation measures, the frequency of temporary flooding will increase with rising seas in low-lying bayshore areas, until permanent inundation is reached,” the document states, warning there could be up to an extra 108 inches of water if dire sea level rises are temporarily exacerbated by an extremely strong storm.
“We know sea level rise isn’t going to stop at 2100 so we are focused on adaptive solutions, such as earth berms, landscape solutions and levees that can be raised in the future,” said Gil Kelley, director of citywide planning for San Francisco.
“Some of the early planning done in the Mission Bay district was done without much attention to sea level rise and they will need some sort of perimeter fence. We are open to protection, adaption or retreat – all three approaches are valid.”
Kelley said new developments have to provide environmental plans that include sea level concerns and insists that areas such as Treasure Island will be safe. But even if buildings are raised, the areas around them remain vulnerable. There is no comprehensive plan to deal with this yet, so later this year San Francisco will hold the Bay Area Resiliency Design Challenge, inspired by New York’s response to Hurricane Sandy in 2013.
“We don’t have the solutions yet, which is why we are trying to learn,” Kelley said. “We can plan for this. We have a big scientific community and can engage them through a global design challenge.”
Ideas already abound, including Hill’s proposal to dump dredged material into the edge of the bay to make it shallower, thereby reducing the impact of waves and storms. More outlandishly, some call for the Golden Gate Bridge to be complemented by an underwater barrier to completely shut off water flowing into the bay. Whatever the solution, it needs to happen soon.
“There are some areas that just won’t be defendable; it will be hard to adapt because the water will come from everywhere,” Lowe said. “The longer we wait to come up with an approach, the more likely we’ll be in retreat mode. Retreat is usually not intentional.”"

But much more money will have to be be found by the world’s poorest countries to hold global temperatures enough to avoid catastrophic climate change, say British and Australian researchers who have analysed the financial implications of the pledges made to the UN last December and the money so far offered by rich countries. 
As 170 countries meet on Friday in New York to sign the Paris agreement and potentially set the world on a low-carbon development path from 2020, developing country negotiators called for a reality check, saying there was a vast financial gap between the world’s climate change ambition and the reality of funding the emissions reductions needed to avoid catastrophic warming. 
To date, rich countries have only agreed to mobilise $100bn a year for developing countries to act on climate after 2020. They have also pledged $10.3bn to the Green Climate Fund, the UN-backed mechanism that will disburse money for climate change adaptation and mitigation.
“Mobilising trillions of dollars of climate finance, not hundreds of billions, is the new business as usual,” said Seyni Nafo, chair of the African group of 54 countries.
The new analysis, based on earlier work by Carbon Brief, shows that about $4.1tn will be needed to fund the emission cuts of the 70-odd countries that have so far identified how much it will cost them. These countries together emit only about 25% of total developing country emissions. 
India has said it will need nearly $1tn to meet its pledge, but China and many other large developing countries have not published their estimates. This, say negotiators, suggests the real cost for poor countries to meet the obligations they signed up to in Paris will be far higher than $4.1tn.
For years, developing countries have argued strongly that the financial burden of reducing emissions should fall largely on the rich, industrialised countries responsible for the bulk of historical climate change emissions. To reach agreement in Paris, developing countries softened their stance. But the question of who should pay for climate change still rankles deeply. 
How the money will be found to cut developing country emissions is unclear. Nearly $500bn of the $4,000 billion needed has been explicitly requested by developing countries to come from international sources of finance, including public money, private investments and carbon markets. Developing countries have pledged to spend $81bn from their domestic budgets.
“Ramping up finance is the most important aspect. It is clear that we are still far from where we need to be. Even the staggering new figures cited in this report may still fall short of where we need to be,” said Thoriq Ibrahim, minister of environment and energy for the Maldives and chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, a UN grouping of 43 countries.
“The Paris agreement was a resounding success for the multilateralism. But the ambition gap that remains is huge. Countries must now put their money where their mouth is and close the gap,” said Tosi Mpanu-Mpanu, chair of the 43-strong least developed country group.
According to the UN Environment Programme, the world is on a path for a potentially catastrophic 3-3.5C of warming. 
“The $4tn is a wake-up call. [It] dwarfs the figures that the Paris agreement or the Green Climate Fund are talking about. We’ve been saying all along that $100bn is a floor, a target that has to be met by 2020 and scaled up massively thereafter – without using dodgy accounting tricks to make smaller amounts of real money look big”, said Brandon Wu, policy analyst at ActionAid.
Alison Woodhead of Oxfam said: “If all of today’s public funding for climate adaptation were to be divided among the world’s 1.5 billion smallholder farmers in developing countries, they would get just over £2 a year to cope with climate change.”
Mohamed Adow of Christian Aid said: “Governments are aware their current mitigation and finance pledges fall short of what is required. No one is pretending that climate change and finance is yet solved. The job is not over, in fact, it has just started.”"

While more than 170 countries converged at the United Nations on Friday to demonstrate their support for the landmark deal to fight climate change reached at Paris last December, economists and scientists warned the accord’s goal of keeping temperatures below 1.5-2C may already be slipping beyond reach.
So far, the commitments covered by the Paris agreement would allow warming of about 2.7C, according to the UN’s own estimates – which would unleash rising seas, extreme heat and other upheavals.
“While we should be celebrating the signing ceremony on Friday we need to be aware of the gap, where the current contributions add up to and where we need to go,” said Shane Tomlinson, a senior research fellow in energy and climate change at Chatham House. 
Countries have to operate on two distinct time lines as they put the promises of Paris into action. First is the next five years, when they will need to radically increase emissions cuts to avoid locking out a 2C future.Second is the long term, when they must put plans in place for a late 21st-century economy powered almost entirely by clean energy, the experts said.
The US – despite Barack Obama’s strong advocacy for climate action and a flurry of climate initiatives over the past two and a half years – has yet to engage in the long-term thinking needed for a historic economic transition, according to Jeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia University’s Earth Institute and a special advisor to Ban Ki-moon.
“Why is it that with an administration that is gung-ho on climate we are in the eighth year and there is no plan at all? No sketch, no white paper, no scenario to 2050?” Sachs told a gathering this week.
 Most countries’ plans do not look beyond 2030 – despite agreement in Paris to begin phasing out greenhouse gas emissions completely by the middle of the century.
 Planning for a zero-carbon economy by mid-century demands long lead times, decades even, because it involves major decisions about power plants and transmission lines, building codes and vehicle standards, Sachs said.
 But most countries were still not looking as far down the road as 2050 – including the US. Obama, despite a flurry of climate initiatives since 2013, had yet to produce a coherent long-term plan for a 21st-century post-carbon economy, Sachs said.
At the start of his presidency, Obama pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions 80% by 2050. “The goal has been around since the beginning of the Obama administration. But as far as I know you can’t find out even one document that sketches out how this would be accomplished,” Sachs said.
The near-universal support for the Paris agreement would avoid the backsliding that followed the Kyoto protocol of the 1990s, experts said.
But the very nature of the deal – which gained widespread support precisely because its decentralised structure allows countries to set their own emissions cutting targets – makes it difficult to make big changes fast. 
Leaders would need the support of business and campaign groups to turn economies around swiftly.
Some countries, including the US, face multiple challenges to their leaders’ efforts to cut emissions. Obama’s rules cutting carbon pollution from power plants face a legal challenge from states and industry groups. Donald Trump, the leading Republican presidential candidate, has expressed doubts even about the existence of climate change.
China and India, while committing publicly to cut emissions, have also cracked down on campaign groups that would keep them to account, Tomlinson said.
And climate pollution continued to rise in the 25 years it took negotiators to reach a deal.
“The problem is that over the last decade we haven’t decarbonised our energy system. We have carbonised our energy system,” said Ottmar Edenhofer, chief economist at the Potsdam Institute for climate change research.
Countries needed to radically ramp up ambition now – before 2020 – to avoid locking out the future of a 2C future, he said. 
If countries wait until 2030, the date envisaged in the Paris agreement, they would have to cut global emissions by 6% a year to keep the 2c goal in sight. 
 “The longer we wait for effective climate policy, the more severe and the more traumatic will be the emissions reductions in the future,” he said."

The outpouring of support – the largest ever single-day turn-out for a signing ceremony – underscored strong international commitment to deliver on the promises made in Paris last December to avoid a climate catastrophe, the leaders said.
“There is no turning back,” François Hollande, the French president, told the United Nations assembly.
The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said signatories to the deal were embracing “a new covenant of the future”. Leonardo DiCaprio, a UN climate ambassador, likened efforts against climate change to the campaign to end slavery. 
Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, an indigenous women’s leader from Chad, called on countries to following through on their promises. Temperatures in her country were already a blistering 48C (118F), she said, and climate change threatened to obliterate billions spent on development aid over recent decades. 
“Climate change is adding to poverty every day,” she said.
Friday’s gathering was entirely ceremonial, with schoolchildren and brass bands filling out the UN hall, and John Kerry, the secretary of state, toting his granddaughter in his arms when it came his turn to sign the agreement.
But the turnout – including the presence of about 60 presidents and prime ministers – and stirring rhetoric were seen as an important measure of the momentum behind efforts to bring the Paris agreement into force earlier than originally thought, possibly even this year.
Leaders also reaffirmed previous commitments to help poor countries protect their people from climate change.
Early implementation would prevent the drift that set in with the Kyoto protocol in the 1990s and – crucially with Donald Trump’s ascendancy in the Republican presidential primaries – impose a four-year delay on any future leaders seeking to exit the agreement.
But as the leaders noted, events on the ground are moving fast. Last year was the hottest year on record – and so were the first three months of this year. Temperatures at the North Pole rose above freezing last December, the depths of the polar night; and temperatures there were 30C (54F) above normal. 
“Today is a day to mark and to celebrate the hard work done by so many to win the battle of securing the Paris agreement,” Kerry said. “But knowing what we know, this is also a day to recommit ourselves to actually win this war.”
On Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, some 93% of coral showed evidence of bleaching, because of long-term ocean warming due to carbon emissions, and the El Niño weather phenomenon. 
If countries do not make deep emissions cuts by 2020, they will miss their chance to hit the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5-2C (2.7-3.6F), leaders and campaign groups warned.
Campaign groups called on governments and businesses to follow through on the rhetoric by ramping up emissions cuts, and protecting vulnerable populations from rising seas, extreme temperatures and other effects of climate change. 
 “The decisions in the Paris agreement now need to be incorporated into government and corporate decisions by breaking free from fossil fuels,” Jennifer Morgan, the director of Greenpeace, said. “Nature is telling us that time is running out, and running out fast.”
The first hurdle was making the agreement operational by winning approval from 55 countries representing 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
That critical threshold moved closer into reach after the world’s biggest climate polluters reiterated their promises to approve the deal – with some committing to a specific time line.
China, the world’s biggest climate polluter, said it would formally approve the agreement before the G20 meeting in September. The US and India, the second and third biggest emitters, also reaffirmed their intention to approve the deal this year. Canada’s Justin Trudeau said he would present the agreement to approval by parliament next month. 
Brazil’s Dilma Rousseff, engulfed in a fight for her political survival after being impeached earlier this week, made a personal promise to help bring the agreement into force.
“I take on the commitment to ensure the prompt entering into effect of this agreement in Brazil,” she told the UN.
However, the European Union is unlikely to be in a position to join the agreement at an early date.
Miguel Arias Cañete, the EU climate commissioner, admitted that internal processes, under which the individual countries must first sign off on proposals to achieve the common goal for 2030 of a 40% emissions cut measured against 1990 levels, would make it difficult to keep pace. 
More climate-concerned governments such as France and Germany are thought likely to move quickly. But there are still concerns about the response that can be expected in Poland and some other central and eastern European countries.
“This will take some time,” he said in a statement, “but it will ensure that when we act, we will act on a solid legal basis. And let me assure you: it will be done as soon as possible.”
 In a pointer to battles ahead, Arias Cañete said that his office was preparing new legislation on renewable energy, electricity markets, energy efficiency and a mid-century low greenhouse gas emissions strategy to be unveiled in 2020.
Fifteen countries – mainly small islands such as Fiji and the Maldives but also Palestine and Somalia – formally joined the agreement on Friday.
The next phase is even more challenging as governments and businesses move to phase out carbon emissions from the global economy – first by targeting economic sectors that were left out of the Paris agreement.
Jonathan Pershing, the State Department climate envoy, told reporters that the US and other countries would now focus on cutting emissions from shipping and aviation, as well as the climate super pollutants, known as HFCs, used in cooling. 
“From now we have to ensure that we have a green economic model, one that is no longer based on carbon emissions,” Hollande said."

But since coming to power, his government has dropped or watered down a succession of green policies";"It is one of the most successful political reinventions ever. In just a few years as its new leader, David Cameron turned around the Tories’ toxic “nasty party” image - at least with enough voters to form a coalition government.
One of the most eye-catching moments came 10 years ago today with his “hug a husky” trip to the Arctic to highlight the impact of climate change. It was followed by Cameron’s commitment to lead the “greenest government ever”.
Yet with a succession of green policies now dropped or watered down, those environmental promises are now ringing hollow with many voters.
Cameron rarely missed a chance in parliament or a UN stage to say that he launched the world’s first Green Investment Bank. Yet he is selling it just four years on — and there’s a big question mark over whether it will be required to make “green” investments.
Cameron wasn’t exaggerating during PMQs recently when he said that 99% of the UK’s solar had been installed while he’s been prime minister, though he failed to mention the scheme that drove that boom was set up under Labour. In opposition, he was an enthusiastic backer of solar incentives, saying: “Imagine a Britain where each community is able to meet its own energy requirements instead of relying on a few huge power stations.” But his ministers recently cut solar incentives by 65%, with a corresponding crash in installations.
Once upon a time, Cameron said carbon capture and storage (CCS) was “absolutely critical” for cutting carbon emissions. Now he says it’s too expensive, and his government binned a £1bn competition to fund a trial CCS plant.
A few months after Cameron hugged a husky, plans were announced to make all new homes zero-carbon by 2016. After a decade in the making - during which time housebuilders were more or less resigned to having to meet the standards - Cameron’s government axed the plan. His ministers also scrapped the flagship energy efficiency scheme to bring down household bills, and still have nothing to replace it. The amount of insulation installed through government schemes is massively down since 2012.
Last year Cameron’s government changed the rules to make renewable energy generators pay a carbon tax. The boss of Britain’s biggest coal power plant operator, Drax, which is converting to biomass and was hit by the change to the climate change levy, said it was like “putting an alcohol tax on apple juice”.
Building new onshore windfarms is now pretty much uneconomical in the UK because of changes since the election last year. While subsidies were removed and planning made harder for turbines on land, tax breaks have been given to the shale gas industry and ministers’ letters revealed they are considering taking fracking planning decisions out of the hands of local authorities.
While Cameron has backed more progress against air pollution, his government has lobbied in Europe to undermine pollution caps for cars, to water down air pollution rules, and sought to block legislation that would force member states to carry out surprise checks on the emissions of cars.
While Barack Obama has played a huge role in bringing together countries to increase their climate change ambition in international negotiations, Cameron has been largely absent from the process. Though he showed his face at the Paris climate summit, and a UN summit hosted by Ban Ki-moon, he has never made a major intervention on the need for greater international action. He has decided to do without a climate change envoy, a role he himself created.
On his Arctic trip a decade ago, the then leader of the opposition argued: “Climate change is one of the biggest threats facing the world and we must have a much greater sense of urgency about tackling it.” But halfway through his leadership of the coalition, the rhetoric had change markedly. The prime minister reportedly told aides to “get rid of all the green crap” on energy bills.
Under Cameron’s leadership, exemptions have been ended for community energy; subsidies cut or ended for renewable heat at home; green cars no longer get favourable taxation; a climate change advice service has been dropped; a unit that advised on sustainable timber disbanded; plans for a new tidal power lagoon at Swansea appear to have been kicked into the long grass and a target to keep increasing the proportion of revenue from environmental taxes was dropped.

But warm water driven by El Niño is bleaching the reef, and a recent report calls for it to be listed as in danger";"I pulled on my mask and dropped off the back of the boat into the warm water above Nursery Bommie, a dive site at Agincourt Reef more than 70km offshore from Port Douglas, in far-north Queensland, Australia. It is widely regarded as one of the most spectacular tourist reefs in the area.
As soon as I could start to make out the immense shadow of the bommie (an outcrop of coral reef) looming before me I could see that all around its flanks and on the summit, covered in just a metre of water in some places, were blemishes of white.
The closer I got, and the more I looked, it was clear there were white patches everywhere. The bleached colonies ranged from tiny plates, shaped like an upturned hand, to areas the size of a table top. Even more striking than the snow white corals was that all around them were other corals coloured in gaudy fluorescent hues that I had never before seen on such a scale. It was as if a masterpiece of nature had been repainted with a colour scheme more befitting a pound shop.
What I was seeing beneath me was evidence of an environmental disaster that has been unfolding over the past few months – the largest mass coral bleaching event ever recorded in this region. This bleaching is the result of a huge El Niño that has driven warm water into the western Pacific Ocean, smothering coral with temperatures beyond their tolerance.
I have dived hundreds of times, with different teams of scientists, along the reef. I have seen the aftermath of other mass coral bleaching episodes such as the most recent major event in 2002.
In my past experiences of bleached corals, the effect is patchy and, while one area is devastated, another will be mysteriously untouched. Yet the scale of this bleaching event has even the most sober and senior coral reef scientists worried. If the rhetoric from marine biologists is to be believed, then the Great Barrier Reef is now in the grip of a “bommie apocalypse”.
As I continued to dive the Nursery Bommie, the fluorescent pinks, blues, purples and greens became more abundant. While these colours might look striking, they signify that the symbiotic relationship between corals and their zooxanthellae, the photosynthetic algae, has broken down.
The fluorescent colours are always there but in healthy coral colonies the colours of the algae overwhelm those of the host coral, giving them their more typical reddish and brown hue. It is true that not all corals fluoresce, but if they have to survive for too long without the algae then bleaching becomes a death sentence.
Put simply, the majority of the corals on this bommie – bleached or fluorescent – were clearly dead or dying. And it was not only the hard corals. All around were soft corals, still swaying like spaghetti in the ebb and flow of the ocean, that were white and ghostly. Most striking was that the bleaching was not just near the surface, where the water is warmest, but at depths of tens of metres where huge colonies of coral were white as well.
I swam towards a wall of reef off the stern of the boat. As I approached I saw that the seafloor was covered in fragile staghorn corals. Such a patch would normally have been the highlight of any dive to this area but now, bleached white, it was merely more evidence that a catastrophe was under way. Dismayed, I swam back to the boat.
On board was an eclectic collection of reef stakeholders including Imogen Zethoven, the director of the Great Barrier Reef campaign for the Australian Marine Conservation Society, who had also made the dive.
“I was shocked,” she said. “I had expected some patches of bleaching surrounded by mainly healthy, colourful corals. I saw the opposite.
“For decades, scientists and conservationists have been warning that climate change is an existential threat to the Great Barrier Reef and all the world’s corals. We know what needs to be done: a rapid transition to 100% renewable energy; an end to fossil fuel subsidies; the phasing out of coal-fired power stations; and keeping coal in the ground.”
While the mass bleaching is caused directly by an El Niño, which pushes warm water to the east Australian coastline, many scientists believe climate change is making the El Niño worse and more frequent, and this is coupled with a general rise in sea temperatures caused by global warming.
Also on board the dive boat was the chief executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council, Daniel Gschwind. The reaction of his organisation to the current bleaching requires a balancing act – on one hand, highlighting the need to protect the enormous value of the reef to the Australian economy, worth a conservative AU$6bn (about £3.25bn) a year, while on the other, making sure that tourists are not scared off by alarming news. “The Great Barrier Reef is Australia’s most important tourism asset,” he said.
We dived at a second site at Agincourt Reef that day, at Castle Rock. Again, the underwater seascape was devastated by bleaching, and the scale of the devastation was beginning to sink in.
Scientists report that the same scenes are being replicated along a 1,000km section of the reef, more than a third of its total expanse. Of 500 reefs between Cairns and Papua New Guinea surveyed during this current episode, 95% have experienced significant coral bleaching – only four reefs showed no impact.
Prof David Booth, head of the Australian Coral Reef Society, the world’s oldest coral reef society, and representing some of the nation’s most respected marine biologists, said he had never seen scientists so worried.
“The visual is shocking but so is the disconnect between the severity of the bleaching and the decisions by governments to approve coalmines and coal infrastructure,” he said. “Australia is like a drug dealer for climate change – selling all this coal, but all the while knowing the harm we are doing.”
This particular bleaching event will end once the waters begin to cool. What scientists don’t know yet is how many of the corals will die, quickly being covered in a brown algae that tourists will not want to pay to see.
But there is still room for optimism. These areas can and will recover as long as the scale and frequency of bleaching does not increase. And some other areas that have been devastated in the past decade by destructive threats – such as cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish – are now recovering well. The reef is always a mosaic of damaged, recovering and stable areas that are constantly changing with environmental conditions.
Coral has evolved to deal with attacks from nature. The question is: can it survive all the cumulative assaults from humans?

Authors of seven previous climate consensus studies — including Naomi Oreskes, Peter Doran, William Anderegg, Bart Verheggen, Ed Maibach, J. Stuart Carlton, John Cook, myself, and six of our colleagues — have co-authored a new paper that should settle this question once and for all. The two key conclusions from the paper are:
1) Depending on exactly how you measure the expert consensus, it’s somewhere between 90% and 100% that agree humans are responsible for climate change, with most of our studies finding 97% consensus among publishing climate scientists.
2) The greater the climate expertise among those surveyed, the higher the consensus on human-caused global warming.
Expert consensus is a powerful thing. People know we don’t have the time or capacity to learn about everything, and so we frequently defer to the conclusions of experts. It’s why we visit doctors when we’re ill. The same is true of climate change: most people defer to the expert consensus of climate scientists. Crucially, as we note in our paper:
Public perception of the scientific consensus has been found to be a gateway belief, affecting other climate beliefs and attitudes including policy support.
That’s why those who oppose taking action to curb climate change have engaged in a misinformation campaign to deny the existence of the expert consensus. They’ve been largely successful, as the public badly underestimate the expert consensus, in what we call the “consensus gap.” Only 12% of Americans realize that the consensus is above 90%.
Our latest paper was written in response to a critique published by Richard Tol in Environmental Research Letters, commenting on the 2013 paper published in the same journal by John Cook, myself, and colleagues finding a 97% consensus on human-caused global warming in the peer-reviewed literature. 
Tol argues that when considering results from previous consensus studies, the Cook 97% figure is an outlier, which he claims is much higher than most other climate consensus estimates. He makes this argument by looking at sub-samples from previous surveys. For example, Doran’s 2009 study broke down the survey data by profession – the consensus was 47% among economic geologists, 64% among meteorologists, 82% among all Earth scientists, and 97% among publishing climate scientists. The lower the climate expertise in each group, the lower the consensus.
Like several of these consensus surveys, Doran cast a wide net and included responses from many non-experts, but among the experts, the consensus is consistently between 90% and 100%. However, by including the non-expert samples, it’s possible to find low “consensus” values.
The flaw in this approach is especially clear when we consider the most ridiculous sub-sample included in Tol’s critique: Verheggen’s 2015 study included a grouping of predominantly non-experts who were “unconvinced” by human-caused global warming, among whom the consensus was 7%. The only surprising thing about this number is that more than zero of those “unconvinced” by human-caused global warming agree that humans are the main cause of global warming. In his paper, Tol included this 7% “unconvinced,” non-expert sub-sample as a data point in his argument that the 97% consensus result is unusually high.
By breaking out all of these sub-samples of non-experts, the critique thus misrepresented a number of previous consensus studies in an effort to paint our 97% result as an outlier. The authors of those misrepresented studies were not impressed with this approach, denouncing the misrepresentations of their work in no uncertain terms. 
We subsequently collaborated with those authors in this newly-published scholarly response, bringing together an all-star lineup of climate consensus experts. The following quote from the paper sums up our feelings about the critique’s treatment of our research:
Tol’s (2016) conflation of unrepresentative non-expert sub-samples and samples of climate experts is a misrepresentation of the results of previous studies, including those published by a number of coauthors of this paper.
In our paper, we show that including non-experts is the only way to argue for a consensus below 90–100%. The greater the climate expertise among those included in the survey sample, the higher the consensus on human-caused global warming. Similarly, if you want to know if you need open heart surgery, you’ll get much more consistent answers (higher consensus) if you only ask cardiologists than if you also survey podiatrists, neurologists, and dentists.
That’s because, as we all know, expertise matters. It’s easy to manufacture a smaller non-expert “consensus” number and argue that it contradicts the 97% figure. As our new paper shows, when you ask the climate experts, the consensus on human-caused global warming is between 90% and 100%, with several studies finding 97% consensus among publishing climate scientists.
There’s some variation in the percentage, depending on exactly how the survey is done and how the question is worded, but ultimately it’s still true that there’s a 97% consensus in the peer-reviewed scientific literature on human-caused global warming. In fact, even Richard Tol has agreed:
The consensus is of course in the high nineties.
In fact, some believe our 97% consensus estimate was too low. These claims are usually based on an analysis done by James Powell, and the difference simply boils down to how “consensus” is defined. Powell evaluated the percentage of papers that don’t explicitly reject human-caused global warming in their abstracts. That includes 99.83% of papers published between 1991 and 2012, and 99.96% of papers published in 2013.
In short, 97% of peer-reviewed climate research that states a position on human-caused warming endorses the consensus, and about 99.9% of the total climate research doesn’t explicitly reject human-caused global warming. Our two analyses simply answer different questions. The percentage of experts and their research that endorse the theory is a better description of “consensus.” However, Powell’s analysis is useful in showing how few peer-reviewed scientific papers explicitly reject human-caused global warming.
In any case, there’s really no question that humans are the driving force causing global warming. The experts are almost universally convinced because the scientific evidence is overwhelming. Denying the consensus by misrepresenting the research won’t change that reality. 
With all of the consensus authors teaming up to show the 90–100% expert consensus on human-caused global warming, and most finding 97% consensus among publishing climate scientists, this paper should be the final word on the subject.
• This footnote was appended on 22 April 2016: Professor Richard Tol disputes a number of assertions made in this article, in particular the claims that he makes his argument by looking at sub-samples from previous surveys (he says his argument is based on whole samples) and that his critique misrepresents previous consensus studies (as earlier results are reproduced exactly). He has also asked us to clarify that the sub-sample referred to above as “ridiculous” is from Verheggen’s 2015 study; it was not created by Tol, though it was used in his critique. He writes more about this on his blog here and here, and his comment in Environmental Research Letters, published in the same edition as the paper described above, can be read here."

 Up to 14% of emissions from agriculture in 2050 could be avoided by managing food use and distribution better, according to a new study from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).
 “Agriculture is a major driver of climate change, accounting for more than 20% of overall global greenhouse gas emissions in 2010,” said co-author Prajal Pradhan.
 “Avoiding food loss and waste would therefore avoid unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions and help mitigate climate change.”
 Between 30 and 40% of food produced around the world is never eaten, because it is spoiled after harvest and during transportation, or thrown away by shops and consumers.
 The share of food wasted is expected to increase drastically if emerging economies like China and India adopt western food habits, including a shift to eating more meat, the researchers warned.
 Richer countries tend to consume more food than is healthy or simply waste it, they noted.
 As poorer countries develop and the world’s population grows, emissions associated with food waste could soar from 0.5 gigatonnes (GT) of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to between 1.9 and 2.5 GT annually by mid-century, showed the study published in the Environmental Science &amp; Technology journal.
 It is widely argued that cutting food waste and distributing the world’s surplus food where it is needed could help tackle hunger in places that do not have enough - especially given that land to expand farming is limited.
 But Jürgen Kropp, another of the study’s co-authors and PIK’s head of climate change and development, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the potential for food waste curbs to reduce emissions should be given more attention.
 “It is not a strategy of governments at the moment,” he said.
The researchers analysed food requirements in the past and for different future scenarios.
 They found that while global average food demand per person remains almost constant, in the last five decades food availability has rapidly increased - hiking the emissions related to growing surplus food by more than 300%.
 The paper did not look at how food waste could be shrunk, but initiatives to tackle the problem are already on the rise in both developed and developing countries.
 In January, for example, 30 company heads, government ministers, and executives with foundations, research groups and charities launched a coalition to work towards cutting food waste by half and reducing food loss significantly by 2030.
 The aims are in line with the new global development goals that took effect this year.
 “Champions 12.3” - named after the food-waste goal number - includes the bosses of Tesco, Nestle, Rabobank, Unilever, Oxfam America, WWF International and the Rockefeller Foundation.
 Andrew Steer, another coalition member who heads the World Resources Institute, noted then that if food loss and waste were a country, it would be the third largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world.
 “Food loss and waste hurts people, costs money and harms the planet,” he said in a statement. “Cutting (it) is a no-brainer.” "

Environmental groups say the mine will fuel global warming and compound threats to the world heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef amid one of its worst coral bleaching events on record.
The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, and the mines minister, Anthony Lynham, made the announcement in Mackay on Sunday.
The premier put the value of the project at $21.7bn, and said the approvals meant thousands of new jobs were now a step closer to reality.
“Some approvals are still required before construction can start, and ultimately committing to the project will be a decision for Adani,” Palaszczuk said.
“However, I know the people of north and central Queensland will welcome this latest progress for the potential jobs and economic development it brings closer for their communities.”
She said stringent conditions would ensure the health of the reef and the environment, and the interests of traditional owners.
The three leases, over the mine site 160km north-west of Clermont, cover an area estimated to contain 11bn tonnes of thermal coal. 
Adani has estimated the mine, rail and port project will generate more than 5,000 jobs at the peak of construction and more than 4,500 jobs at the peak of operations.
Earlier on Sunday, the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) questioned whether Adani had pressured the mines minister to abandon his stated concerns about granting mining licences before court challenges had concluded.
ACF is challenging federal approvals for the mine in the federal court, with a hearing set down for early May. Traditional owners have also launched a separate case.
In announcing the approvals, Lynham said the approvals and the conditions attached were evidence of his government’s commitment to the sustainable development of the Galilee basin, and the jobs and opportunities the mine would create.
The announcement came as the federal government’s own marine science agency warned water quality targets designed to protect the reef are unlikely to be met.
Australian Institute of Marine Science researchers said water quality targets – set out in the Reef 2050 Plan, and aimed at warding off a Unesco decision to list the reef as in danger – would likely not be met under existing policies dealing with land-based pollution.
Adani said the approvals meant it could proceed to the next stage of development but acknowledged ongoing uncertainty from unresolved legal challenges “by politically-motivated activists”.
It said a final investment decision would not be made until the court challenges were resolved, and it had secured the final approvals it needs.
“Having previously sought to progress to the construction phase in 2015, Adani is keenly aware of the risks of proceeding on major works in advance of the conclusion of these matters,” the company said in a statement.
It also took a swipe at processes it said had held up a very significant project for Australia.
“The granting of the mining lease, coupled with strict and rigorous science-based environmental approvals, underlines the importance of major projects in Queensland, and in Australia more broadly, not being subject to endless red tape, after approving authorities have exhaustively examined them over some six years.”
Adani Australia chief executive, Jeyakumar Janakaraj, said the company was serious about proceeding with the mine.
“We have invested $1.2bn in the mine so far, and we have bought Abbot Point for $1.8bn. Without seriousness of developing these projects, we wouldn’t be investing that kind of cash,” he told reporters in Mackay.
“If we do not send clean coal ... from Australia, India will continue to burn dirty coal and that is just not good for anybody.”
Janakaraj said he hoped all outstanding approvals could be obtained this year, so construction could commence next year."

As the impacts of climate change are being felt more forcefully around the world, it is vital that prominent public institutions like the British Museum play their part in minimising the environmental impacts of their activities.
BP’s sponsorship contract with the museum is coming to an end this year. While governments in Paris committed to transition away from fossil fuels, BP remains a barrier to progress. It is working to extract new sources of carbon-intensive oil from the tar sands, the Arctic and under the oceans, when we need to keep at least two thirds of known fossil fuels in the ground. BP’s business plan is incompatible with a stable climate, and the company is using its influence to lobby against effective climate policies.
Meanwhile, its operations are affecting lives and livelihoods across the world. The company was recently hit with the biggest criminal fine in US history for its gross negligence in causing the Deepwater Horizon spill.
To receive sponsorship from BP is to condone these business practices. Retaining such an unethical sponsor would seriously damage the British Museum’s reputation, and place it firmly on the wrong side of history. Indeed, Tate and BP have just parted company after 26 years, following intensifying protests and criticism. We urge Dr Fischer to follow Tate’s lead in not renewing this contract, and to seek funding from sources more in line with the museum’s values and what is needed to ensure a stable future.Professor Anne Glover Vice-principal external affairs, University of Aberdeen, former chief scientific adviser to the European CommissionMargaret Atwood WriterMark Ruffalo ActorMark Rylance ActorDr Jane Goodall DBE Founder the Jane Goodall Institute, and UN messenger of peaceSir Tom Kibble Emeritus professor of physics, Imperial College LondonNaomi Klein Author, activist and film-makerJeremy Leggett Author, solar entrepreneur and advocateRichard Horton Editor-in-chief, The LancetSimon Lewis Professor of global change science at UCLEmma Thompson ActorNaomi Oreskes Professor of the history of science, HarvardMark Goldring Chief executive, Oxfam GBDr Nick Winterbotham Director, BTC &amp;

In a letter to the Guardian, the museum is urged to abandon the “completely out of touch” partnership. 
The intervention is backed by actors Emma Thompson, Mark Ruffalo and Mark Rylance, writers Margaret Atwood, Naomi Klein and Caryl Churchill, as well as the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and physicist Sir Tom Kibble.
It comes shortly after BP announced it was ending its 26-year relationship with the Tate art gallery, blaming the “challenging business environment”. Anti-oil sponsorship groups claimed that move as a campaign victory, and have since turned their attention to the company’s remaining cultural ties. 
The focus has switched to other beneficiaries of BP money: the National Portrait Gallery, the Royal Opera House and particularly the British Museum, where in December 2011 the four museum directors gathered to announce a five-year sponsorship deal worth £10m.
All four institutions have vigorously defended BP’s involvement in the arts. The former British Museum director Neil MacGregor described BP as the museum’s best corporate friend. “What would you want companies to do with their profits?” he asked. “Do you want them to spend them in a way that benefits the public or not?”
But Jess Worth of the campaign group Art Not Oil, which organised the letter, said signing up to a new deal would damage the reputation of the museum, especially since our understanding of climate change was evolving, with the need to “move away very, very fast” from fossil fuel companies.
“If the museum is locked into this deal with BP beyond 2020 it is going to look completely on the wrong side of history and completely out of touch. The world has changed and the museum has to change with it.”
The letter is timed to coincide with the arrival of the British Museum’s new German director, Hartwig Fischer, formerly director of the Dresden State Art Collections.
The letter says: “As the impacts of climate change are being felt more forcefully around the world, it is vital that prominent public institutions like the British Museum play their part in minimising the environmental impacts of their activities.”
Other signatories include the screenwriter John Collee, fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood, Bianca Jagger and Prof Dame Anne Glover, former chief scientific adviser to the European commission.
Glover said: “The British Museum is a powerful symbol of our culture and celebrates the complexity of our heritage and development. The museum exerts clear influence in our society and as well as preserving our past, the museum can also make a statement about safeguarding our future by addressing man-made climate change. I hope the museum will choose its partners well to reflect this.”
Emma Thompson said: “I find it unbelievable that the British Museum is promoting a company that’s not just extracting disastrous amounts of fossil fuels but is actively lobbying against clean energy alternatives. BP is sponsoring our past while destroying our future. We hope Dr Fischer will put an end to this.”
The letter also coincides with a protest carried out on Sunday in the British Museum’s Great Court.
The group BP or Not BP staged a “History of BP in 10 Objects” exhibition, mirroring MacGregor’s A History of the World in 100 Objects series on the BBC.
The protest objects on show included crude oil from the Louisiana coastline after the BP Deepwater Horizon spill and a photograph of Colombian trade unionist Gilberto Torres, who is suing BP alleging it was complicit in his kidnap and torture. BP have previously denied any involvement with, or knowledge of, Torres’s abduction.
Arts organisations have staunchly defended accepting money from BP and argue it is not easily replaceable.
BP, meanwhile, is proud of its arts sponsorship, calling its sponsorship of the four big national arts organisations “one of the most significant long-term corporate investments in UK arts and culture”.
On the back page of the programme for the National Theatre’s production of Les Blancs, which opened this week, is a full-page BP advertisement in which it boasts of its arts sponsorship.
A British Museum spokesperson said: “BP is one of the British Museum’s most longstanding corporate partners, supporting the museum since 1996. The British Museum is exceptionally grateful to BP for their loyal and ongoing support, which has allowed the museum to bring world cultures to a global audience through hugely popular exhibitions and their associated public programmes.
 “We believe it is more important than ever to deepen people’s understanding of the world’s many and varied cultures and this is something that can be achieved through the temporary exhibition format. It is only possible to develop and host temporary exhibitions with this kind of external support.
 “We are grateful to BP for their long-term commitment, sharing the vision that our artistic programmes should be made available to the widest possible audience. Discussions regarding the renewal of the partnership are continuing.”
Campaigners are launching a petition on Monday calling on Fischer to drop BP."

The answer may be related to another puzzling question: why does Donald Trump have such unwavering support among a certain segment of American conservatives?
 A recent paper by Jeremiah Bohr published in the journal Environmental Politics sought to answer the climate question. As Bohr notes:
Mainstream policy responses seek to utilize market mechanisms in an effort to minimize costs for major emitters of greenhouse gases. Presumably, this should win over some climate change deniers who align themselves with think tanks promoting free markets and economic growth. Yet, climate change deniers and free-market activists are as staunchly opposed to market-based climate policy as they are to any other form of climate mitigation.
Bohr looked through issues of the Heartland Institute’s Environment and Climate News newsletter. He found that about 75% of Heartland’s articles denied climate science, usually by exaggerating uncertainties, or by presenting the evidence as junk science. About 6% argued that climate change will be beneficial, and 39% argued that climate policies will do more harm than good, usually claiming that they’ll hurt the economy.
Among the latter group, 51% characterized markets as inherently efficient, self-regulating, and generative of wealth. Heartland views any tampering with the market as bad for the economy. As Bohr describes it:
In these newsletters, deniers harness the image of efficient self-regulatingmarkets to argue that regulatory policy itself is counterproductive to thegoal of climate change mitigation. Rather than mandating compliance with environmental performance standards, deniers argue that voluntary action from the private sector will more efficiently produce pro-environmental outcomes ... Neoliberal climate change deniers elevate unregulated markets to an almost mystical level impervious to long-term failure. By definition, they view markets as self-correcting.
In other words, they believe the problem will solve itself through the magic of the free market.
In another 40% of their climate economics articles, Heartland argued against climate policies by exaggerating their costs. These claims are disproved by real-world examples in places like British Columbia and California, where economies are thriving alongside carbon pricing policies. This is why there’s a 95% consensus among economic experts that we should cut carbon pollution.
Aside from the real-world examples, these arguments are also disproved by basic economics. If products have a cost that isn’t reflected in their price, that’s known as an “externality” and is a classic market failure. This was clearly articulated by Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman:
consumers are paying much too low a price for coal-generated electricity, because the price they pay does not take account of the very large external costs associated with generation. If consumers did have to pay the full cost, they would use much less electricity from coal — maybe none, but that would depend on the alternatives.
At one level, this is all textbook economics. Externalities like pollution are one of the classic forms of market failure, and Econ 101 says that this failure should be remedied through pollution taxes or tradable emissions permits that get the price right ... So if you really believed in the logic of free markets, you’d be all in favor of pollution taxes ...
Today’s American right doesn’t believe in externalities, or correcting market failures; it believes that there are no market failures, that capitalism unregulated is always right. Faced with evidence that market prices are in fact wrong, they simply attack the science.
This is exactly what Bohr’s research revealed. Accepting the reality and consequences of human-caused climate change leads to policies that make consumers take its costs into account, forcing “businesses to serve something other than the interests of their clients, communities, or stockholders.”
Contrarians instead believe that “pure” free markets will somehow solve the problem most efficiently. The problem is that their definition of a “pure” free market is one with external costs: a market failure.
In their 2011 paper “Cool Dudes,” McCright and Dunlap identified conservative white males as the predominant climate-denying group in the United States. A 2014 survey additionally found an age gap in climate science denial: 61% of Republicans under the age of 50 support climate regulations. 
This can largely be boiled down to what social scientists have described as “the white male effect,” in which white men tend to be the group least concerned with risks, generally because addressing risks would require changes that would disrupt the status quo. Nobody has benefited more from the status quo in America than old, white, conservative men.
Old, white, conservative men also describes the primary demographic supporting Donald Trump. His slogan “Make America great again” can be followed by the implication “(for old, white, conservative men),” who believe the societal status quo is changing to their detriment. 65% of Trump supporters deny human-caused global warming, as does the candidate himself.
Ultimately, climate denial originating from free market think tanks stems from this desire to maintain the status quo. Many old, white, conservative men believe that unfettered free markets solve all problems, because they’ve benefited that group the most. 
It may not be possible to convince this group to accept the market failure we’ve created through a lack of carbon pollution pricing. This belief may be as unwavering as their support for Donald Trump, because it similarly stems from their ideological worldview, not from evidence or facts.
However, while this group wields disproportionate influence, old, white, conservative American men are a small and dwindling population. While they may account for a plurality of Republican primary voters, that’s the full extent of their reach. 
As the GOP scrambles to deal with the Trump candidacy, it may also have to deal with the conditions that made that candidacy possible - the same conditions that have left the Republican Party as the only major climate-denying political party in the world."

As companies like Peabody Energy and Exxon Mobil face legal probes over allegedly lying about their exposure, it reinforces moves for greater transparency.
In its first report on Friday, the taskforce emphasised the need to incorporate global warming threats into financial reports.
“That is a big deal,” Curtis Ravenel, a Bloomberg executive on the taskforce’s secretariat told Climate Home. “Once it goes into financial filings, there is all sorts of oversight for companies. The point is to try and institutionalise thinking on this at board level.”
Most G20 countries already require businesses to disclose “material” climate-related risks in their financial reports. But interpretations of what is “material” vary.
Carbon-cutting regulations, clean technology and lawsuits can all hit the value of companies that rely on burning fossil fuels.
Mark Carney, chair of the Financial Stability Board, last year warned there could be market shocks if investors failed to anticipate these trends.
Long-term investors like pension funds are increasingly urging coal and oil majors to face up to the potential carbon crunch.
Yet they face resistance from firms like Exxon Mobil, which maintains that demand for energy will trump global efforts to curb warming.
Members of Bloomberg’s taskforce represent companies ranging from mining giant BHP Billiton to the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.
They are set to publish a final report by the end of 2016, with voluntary guidelines on what kind of information companies should disclose.
“Our thought is companies will want to adopt the guidelines to avoid the kind of legal implications facing Peabody and Exxon,” said Ravenel.
Responding to the initial report, the Carbon Tracker Initiative emphasised the need to test business plans in line with a 2C warming limit.
“Investors no longer want to see regulatory filings from fossil fuel companies that fail to discuss how the low carbon transition might impact their business models,” said Mark Campanale, founder of the London-based think tank.
The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, which represents 120 investors worth €13tn, agreed.
“We strongly support the focus on more standardised disclosures and forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information,” said the group’s chief executive Stephanie Pfeifer. “This will help investors better assess and address carbon risk in their portfolios.”
Jon Williams of consultancy PwC welcomed the taskforce setting out its stall. He said: “There is much ground to cover over the next nine months if it is to deliver on its highly ambitious targets and embed climate-related risks firmly within the financial mainstream.”"

In the worst case scenarios, often used by regulators to check the financial health of companies and economies, the losses could soar to $24tn, or 17% of the world’s assets, and wreck the global economy.
The research also showed the financial sense in taking action to keep climate change under the 2C danger limit agreed by the world’s nations. In this scenario, the value of financial assets would fall by $315bn less, even when the costs of cutting emissions are included.
“Our work suggests to long-term investors that we would be better off in a low-carbon world,” said Prof Simon Dietz of the London School of Economics, the lead author of the study. “Pension funds should be getting on top of this issue, and many of them are.” He said, however, that awareness in the financial sector was low.
Mark Campanale of the thinktank Carbon Tracker Initiative said the actual financial losses from unchecked global warming could be higher than estimated by the financial model behind the new study. “It could be a lot worse. The loss of financial capital can be a lot higher and faster than the GDP losses [used to model the costs of climate change in the study]. Just look at value of coal giant Peabody Energy. It was worth billions just a few years ago and now it is worth nothing.”
The Bank of England and World Bank have warned of the risks to the global economy of climate change and the G20 has asked the international Financial Stability Board to investigate the issue. In January, the World Economic Forum said a catastrophe caused by climate change was the biggest potential threat to the global economy in 2016.
“Physical climate change impacts are a systemic risk on a massive scale,” said Ben Caldecott, the director of the sustainable finance programme at the University of Oxford. “Investors can do much more to differentiate between companies more or less exposed and they can help reduce the risk to the global economy by supporting ambitious action on climate change.”
The new study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Climate Change, used economic modelling to estimate the impact of unchecked climate change. It found that in that scenario, the assets were effectively overvalued today by $2.5tn, but that there was a 1% chance that the overvaluation could be as high as $24tn.
The losses would be caused by the direct destruction of assets by increasingly extreme weather events and also by a reduction in earnings for those affected by high temperatures, drought and other climate change impacts.
If action is taken to tackle climate change, the study found the financial losses would be reduced overall, but that other assets such as fossil fuel companies would lose value. Scientists have shown that most of the coal, oil and gas reserves such companies own will have stay in the ground if the global rise in temperature is to be kept under 2C. The total stock market capitalisation of fossil fuel companies today is about $5tn.
“There is no scenario in which the risk to financial assets are unaffected by climate change. That is just a fiction,” said Dietz. “There will be winners and losers.” Major investors such as Norway’s sovereign wealth fund – the world’s biggest – have already begun selling off high-carbon stocks such as coal companies.
Investors have also been warned about investing in new coal and gas fired power stations after 2017 by a second new study. The research shows that, to meet the 2C target, no new carbon-emitting power stations can be built anywhere in the world unless they are later closed down or retrofitted with carbon capture and storage technology.
“Investors putting money into new carbon-emitting infrastructure need to ask hard questions about how long those assets will operate for, and assess the risk of future shut-downs and write-offs,” said Prof Cameron Hepburn of the University of Oxford."

Myles Allen, professor of climate dynamics at Oxford University, said carbon disposal technologies would be needed as “backstop” options because they would be the only way to reduce net carbon emissions into the atmosphere to zero, and thus stop temperatures from continuing to rise.
Carbon disposal consists chiefly of the burial of carbon dioxide in underground caverns, known as carbon capture and storage (CCS), but also includes possible methods of dissolving carbon dioxide in the oceans and other means of eliminating carbon from the air.
The UK government last year scrapped its promised £1bn funding from one of the longest-running schemes to pioneer CCS technology. The decision, taken as part of George Osborne’s autumn spending review, was condemned by the industry and by green campaigners.
Prof Allen said that reducing greenhouse gas emissions by other means, such as renewable energy generation, was important but would not get the world to its target of releasing no excess greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. That goal of ‘net zero emissions’ was enshrined in last December’s Paris climate deal.
He added that sacrificing economic growth in the short term in order to pay for incremental emissions reduction could be counter-productive, if it prevented economies from growing to the extent needed for them to invest large amounts in CCS. 
Prof Allen pointed to the UK, where current emissions reductions are slow, at an average of a few per cent a year, while economic growth measured by GDP is also averaging a few per cent a year at most, on long-term averages. He contrasted this with countries such as India, where economic growth is much higher, but emissions measured per capita remain low. 
By this reckoning, the UK would do better to invest in the expensive “backstop” option of carbon disposal rather than incremental reductions in emissions rates, which were puny compared with the growth in emissions from rapidly developing nations. His paper, “Drivers of peak warming in a consumption-maximising world”, was published on Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change.
Allen warned that this could not be taken as a signal that economies could stop investing in emissions reduction and wait for CCS technology to develop. If emissions continue to rise at current rates, that would mean much more carbon must be disposed of, and make CCS correspondingly much more expensive when it is needed, meaning measures to reduce emissions now would also be necessary.
“Saying that we should not [invest in this technology] because it is expensive and hard, when we know we are going to need it, is just daft,” said Prof Allen. 
He said the UK government must not have understood the issues when it made the decision to cancel CCS funding, and contrasted the decision with the tens of billions promised in support of new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C, which is now under question.
The Department of Energy and Climate Change said it was still interested in CCS, and that the choice to close funding for the long-running competition had been a “fiscal” one, usually code for a decision imposed by the Treasury.
“We haven’t closed the door to CCS in the UK, but as part of our ongoing work to get Britain’s finances back on track, we have had to take difficult decisions to control government spending,” the department told the Guardian. “CCS should come down in cost and we are considering the role it could play in the long-term decarbonisation of the UK. We are committed to meeting our climate change targets in a way that is affordable and provides secure energy to our families and businesses.”
Lisa Nandy, Labour’s energy and climate change shadow, slammed the government’s decision: “Without CCS it will be extraordinarily difficult to make the deep cuts that all countries agreed at the Paris summit. Britain should be at the forefront of pioneering expertise in this area to create jobs and build a new North Sea industry. The chancellor’s short-sighted decision to axe all support for these technologies could raise the cost of going green, and mean we miss out on investment.”
Indira Mann, of the Scottish Carbon Capture and Storage trade association, said the technologies involved in CCS were more mature than many critics said, and would open up new economic opportunities for the UK. She told the Guardian: “CCS is a chain of proven technologies that can deliver emissions reductions as part of action to limit global warmiong. CCS remains the only path to deep cuts in emissions from [some] industries such as the production of cement, steel and fertiliser.”"

The report, The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment, formally unveiled at the White House, warned of sweeping risks to public health from rising temperatures in the coming decades – with increased deaths and illnesses from heat stroke, respiratory failure and diseases such as West Nile virus.
“Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change,” John Holdren, the White House science adviser, told reporters on Monday. “Some are more vulnerable than others,” he went on.
These included pregnant women, children, the elderly, outdoor workers, low-income people, immigrants, communities of color and those with disabilities or pre-existing medical conditions.
The diversity of risks – and vulnerable populations – made climate change a far more challenging threat to public health than even the polio epidemics in the past in some regards, said Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general. 
“I don’t think we have seen something like this before where we have a force that has such a multitude of impacts,” Murthy said. 
Polio was eradicated with a specific vaccine, but there was no such quick fix for climate change, he said. “Climate change is not like that. There is not one single source that we can target,” he went on. “As far as history is concerned this is a new kind of threat that we are facing.”
 The grim, climate-inflected scenarios in the report – including projections of an additional 11,000 heat-related deaths by 2030 – intensify the efforts by the White House to rally public support for the Paris climate agreement and the clean power plant rules, which face a legal challenge on 2 June.
Governments will gather in New York on 22 April to formally sign on to the agreement reached in Paris. The Obama administration is leading a push by the United Nations to get the agreement signed and into force by the end of this year – a process that requires the support of 55 countries representing 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
The White House, Democrats in Congress and campaign groups are also working to gin up public support for the clean power plant rules ahead of the 2 June hearing into a legal challenge brought by a coalition of states and industries.
The findings in the report were broadly in line with a draft released by the White House in April last year. 
The research – conducted by 100 scientists working across eight government agencies – represents the most exhaustive look to date at the health impacts of climate change within the US, officials claimed on Monday. 
Earlier researchers have called attention to the risks of heatwaves, air pollution and illnesses borne by insects such as mosquitoes under climate change as well as the declining nutritional value of food staples such as wheat and rice. Last year, scientists warned that extreme heat could make outdoor work perilous and parts of the Middle East uninhabitable.
The officials made it clear they hoped the findings would broaden public support for cutting the carbon emissions that cause climate change. 
“Climate change is already under way and no matter what we do it can’t be stopped overnight,” Holdren told reporters. “But there is a huge difference in magnitude of impacts if we fail to act and the much smaller magnitude we expect if we take aggressive action set out in the president’s climate action plan.”
The urgency of the warning reflects growing understanding among scientists of the widespread impacts of climate change. 
It also lays to rest the false claim by those obstructing efforts to cut emissions that there are more positives than negatives in warmer temperature conditions.
Hot, sunny days cook more smog which makes breathing conditions worse for sufferers of asthma, emphysema and other respiratory conditions. Warming temperatures also extend the allergy season and fuel the risk of wildfires – whose smoke also worsens air quality.
“By the end of the century we are looking at an increase of tens of thousands of illnesses and death episodes because of climate change,” the surgeon general told reporters. 
Higher temperatures were also encouraging the spread of illnesses carried by ticks and mosquitoes such as Lyme disease and West Nile virus, Murthy went on. The report did not look at Zika.
The public health threats laid out in the report were on the cards for future generations of Americans even with the emissions commitments contained in the Paris climate agreement, the officials said.
Governments have been clear from the outset that the agreement reached in Paris last December was only a preliminary step towards limiting warming to 2C above pre-industrial levels. 
Under the agreement, governments committed to make even deeper cuts in emissions in the coming decades.
“We will need a big encore after 2030 in terms of further deep cuts in order to avoid the bulk of the deeper impacts described in this report,” Holdren said."

The Greens have a policy of approving no new thermal coal or unconventional gas projects in Australia. That includes new mines, as well as expansions to existing mines.
In 2013 the party obtained costings from the parliamentary budget office detailing their estimate of how much revenue the federal budget would lose as a result of reduced tax and any other costs, if the policy was implemented.
It was then estimated the policy would result in the government missing out on $1.5bn over the forward estimates – the four years to July 2017.
The Greens asked for the same advice again this year and that figure dropped dramatically to just $290m over the forward estimates – the four years to July 2019.
With coal and gas prices dropping around the world, the number of new fossil fuel projects expected to be developed is now fewer than it was in 2013. In addition, the profits those companies would make – and the tax the government would therefore miss out on if they were banned – has reduced over the period.
The costings fit with several other developments in recent months.
Of the $1.2bn wiped from the tax revenue the government would expect to get from new coal and gas projects, just $70m was a result of the minerals resource rent tax being scrapped. The vast majority was due to fewer and less profitable projects.
At the time of writing, the latest report used by the Parliamentary Budget Office to examine the number of future coal and gas projects was not available. But comparing the report used in the 2013 costing and the most recently available report (from October 2015) reveals a sharp decline in proposed coal and gas projects.
In April 2013, there were 19 coal mines that had been publicly announced – a number that had dropped to just 10 by October 2015.
Similarly, publicly announced liquefied natural gas, gas and oil projects had dropped from 12 to three over the period.
Coal projects that had reached “feasibility stage” – where more detailed planning work had been done – dropped from 57 to 39 over the period while those at the “committed” stage dropped from 16 to six.
The Greens senator and environment spokeswoman, Larissa Waters, said the figures show their policy was sensible.
“As the world transitions to clean energy, the taxes collected by the federal government from the fossil fuel sector are rapidly diminishing,” she told Guardian Australia. “We have everything to gain from embracing the job-rich clean energy industry and ending approvals of new coal or gas mines.
“Ultimately, the fossil fuel sector is a burden on our federal budget due to the subsidies it receives and the economic costs it adds through global warming and destruction of land and water.”
Waters said it also showed that, regardless of any policies that hasten the decline of the industry, the government needed a plan to create new jobs for those in the industry.
“The thousands of Australian workers the fossil fuel industry is sacking as it declines must not be left in the lurch.”
She said those jobs should come from the work needed to rehabilitate mine sites and in the new clean energy industry.
The executive director of coal at the Minerals Council of Australia, Greg Evans, said the coal industry had contributed more than $37bn in both company tax and royalty payments between 2007-08 and 2013-14.
“It is an enduring industry and confining any analysis to just the forward estimates period misses the mark about the positive long-term demand outlook,” he said. 
“The industry makes a substantial economic contribution and will continue to do so underpinning both base load energy provision in Australia and providing competitive and high-quality coal for Asia’s energy and steel making requirements.”"

A Daily Mail editorial called “the crippling green taxes imposed by Ed Miliband’s Climate Change Act in 2008” a “monstrous handicap” that had driven the steelworks and its 5,000 workers over the precipice. 
The Spectator’s editorial said “taxes and levies designed to help Britain meet its self-imposed and unilateral carbon-reduction targets, have worsened Tata’s problems in Britain”. These sentiments were repeated by a who’s who of the British climate sceptic commentariat: Dominic Lawson, Christopher Booker and Matt Ridley all sharpened their quills.
In Tata Steel’s press release last week, the company blamed “global oversupply of steel, significant increase in third country exports into Europe, high manufacturing costs, continued weakness in domestic market demand in steel and a volatile currency” for its intention to sell off the Port Talbot steel works. Part of steel’s manufacturing costs is, of course, electricity. Which is how we come to be talking about climate policies.
There is no doubt that the Port Talbot steelworks is a big energy user. According to reports, it uses as much electricity as nearby Swansea and each year the power bill runs to £60m. But in Simon Evans’ excellent Carbon Brief article, he finds electricity to be between 6 and 8% of the plant’s total production costs. Of this, perhaps 2-3% is due to green policy costs. But because the UK compensates energy-intensive industries for about two-thirds of the impact of these levies, the real cost of green levies at Port Talbot is about 1% of production costs.
According to the Guardian’s own analysis, if £60m is 8% of production costs, the total costs are £750m - thus Tata pays about £7.5m a year towards the UK’s climate change efforts. This is roughly the same amount the plant reportedly loses every week.
Little impact does not equate to no impact, and it is true that the UK pays more for its electricity than any other European country. (Although figures from the Department of Energy and Climate Change show the Sun’s Trevor Kavanagh was incorrect when he claimed Britain’s “punitive carbon tax” makes “the energy to produce our steel twice as costly as Germany’s”).
The UK operates a carbon floor price, which it recently doubled and has now frozen until 2020, which does affect the competitiveness of UK industry with its continental competitors. But research from the UK government Committee on Climate Change (CCC) found that this was compensated to a large degree and thus was a small factor in the struggles of the steel industry.
The UK Energy Research Centre’s director, Jim Watson, said: “arguments that have been made that ‘green taxes’ are responsible for the current problems of UK steel are exaggerated in my view”. 
As to why UK prices are generally higher, Watson explained that past investments and costs of operation were important factors and the UK’s highly privatised energy market was also key.
“The UK still has one of the most liberalised energy markets in the EU. Some other member states such as France, for example, have a very different structure - in France’s case with a dominant state-owned electricity company, which can more easily subsidise prices directly or indirectly,” he said.
Yan Qin, an analyst with Thomson Reuters, said the impact of higher electricity costs on the steel industry was not a crucial factor when compared to the global challenges facing the industry.
“The worsening global market conditions and Chinese dumping surplus steel at record low prices are the main reasons behind the closures in the UK,” said Qin.
The criticism of green levies during the weekend was often couched alongside concerns of Europe’s perceived role in undermining British steel. In a column for the Telegraph, leading “leave” advocate Boris Johnson said: “The UK’s various climate change policies – largely generated by Ed Miliband – have been highly damaging for British manufacturing”.
But Gummer, chair of the CCC, cited research and said that more broadly: “There’s no evidence at all that there’s been offshoring of industry from Britain because of our green policies. For most industries, the energy element is extremely small and the amount of extra cost from the green levies is so small as not to be in any way crucial.”
Emil Dimantchev, also a climate policy analyst with Thomson Reuters, said membership of the EU emissions trading scheme (ETS) had delivered Tata Steel’s European operations a £780m windfall through the over-allocation of carbon credits between 2008 and 2014. In estimates that Dimantchev considers conservative, the Port Talbot works alone received more than £239m over that period.
“The point here is that the EU ETS has been a source of profit for Tata, which is noteworthy given that most discussions on climate policies tend to consider them only as a cost to industry,” said Dimantchev.
It’s not clear whether the £60m costs of running Port Talbot factor in these windfalls or not. Tata Steel did not respond immediately to the Guardian’s request for clarification. 
If not, and the costs of green policies had been £7.5m every year since 2008 - which is unlikely as the penalties for carbon emissions have been increasing - it would appear that Port Talbot has actually been profiting from green policies."

“It’s a red flag,” said Martyn Obbard, a scientist with the Ontario provincial government and co-author of a recently published study in the journal Arctic Science.
Researchers looked at a population of about 950 polar bears who live along the northern coast of Ontario, stretching from James Bay to the provincial border with Manitoba. As they live further south than any other population of polar bears, the group is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. 
Using data from 900 bear captures carried out at varying points between 1984 and 2009, researchers found the average weight of males had dropped by 45kg (99lb) and females by 31kg.
It’s a significant change, Obbard said, given that male polar bears typically weigh about 500kg (1100lb) and females around 250kg (550lb). 
The drop in weight was strongly correlated with melting sea ice. Since 1980, the ice season in Hudson Bay has fallen at a rate of about one day a year, forcing polar bears to spent more time on dry land rather than hunting seals – their main source of food – on sea ice.
Polar bears now get some 30 fewer days each year on ice than previous generations. “That’s 30 days less out on the sea ice when they’re actively hunting seals,” Obbard said. 
He highlighted the drop in weight among females as worrisome. “It’s more than a 10% decline for adult females,” he said, and could ultimately affect the survival of the population. “We could see females having cubs less often and with less success.”
Some scientists have suggested that polar bears may supplement their diet by foraging for food on land, turning to sources such as caribou and geese. But the data suggest this is not providing enough sustenance for the polar bears to maintain their weight, Obbard said. 
The findings echo research previously done on polar bears who live on the western shores of the Hudson Bay. Melting sea ice has led to a spike in polar bear sightings in the town of Churchill, Manitoba, while scientists say the starving bears are resorting to risky and atypical behaviour, such as cannibalism and wandering far inland in search of food. 
Migrating north is an improbable option for the polar bears studied by Obbard, as the northern areas are unable to support greater numbers of bears. “A few individual bears may be able to migrate and survive but for most of them it’s going to be a slow eventual loss,” said Obbard. 
While the dramatic loss of weight has not led to a decline in the population of polar bears, that could change as a warming Arctic continues to melt away sea ice. “These changes that we’re seeing now are a warning that there are major changes happening in that whole marine system of Hudson Bay,” said Obbard. “Who knows when it’s going to happen – it might be 50, maybe 100 years and the bears will be gone from Hudson Bay.”"

The internal decision-making process behind the CSIRO’s decision to cut its climate research has been revealed in a 700-page document dump, delivered as part of a Greens-Labor inquiry into federal government budget cuts. Many key emails sent from private accounts were not included in the disclosure, but the documents reveal a shopping-list of controversial internal decisions.
In March CSIRO executives told a Senate committee the organisation was not moving away from “public-good science”, but the emails appear to cast doubt on that assertion.
They show one of the central reasons climate science could not continue to make money for the CSIRO was the federal government’s decision to cut grants for environmental research.
They also contain a detailed analysis of all the climate research capabilities that would be scrapped, as well as surprisingly callous language in discussions about which researchers would be made redundant, with remarks from managers referring to employees’ age, their work hours and how strong their union links were.
In November 2015, the CSIRO leadership began a “deep dive” into the oceans and atmosphere business unit, which houses most of the CSIRO’s researchers that focus on monitoring and modelling climate change.
On 21 November, before a meeting at which that investigation was discussed, the deputy director of the oceans and atmosphere business unit, Andreas Schiller, sent an email summarising what CSIRO executives thought ought to be done.
The focus should be to “maximise impact on nation”, he said, and “not doing science for science sake”. He said “public good is not good enough, [it] needs to be linked to jobs and growth”.
The scientists who work on climate science at the CSIRO are among the global leaders in their field, regularly publishing research in journals such as Nature and Science. But Schiller wrote: “Nature papers alone don’t cut it.”
In March Alex Wonhas, the executive director of environment, energy and resources, told the Senate inquiry public good research was not being cut: “I want to categorically say that is not the case ... Public good research has been the absolute foundation of what the CSIRO has been doing over our very long history.”
But on 18 January, about two weeks before the cuts were announced, Schiller wrote to the director of the unit saying they should aim to cut 120 staff. That would “allow a clean cut in terms of eliminating all capability associated with ‘public good/government-funded climate research’”.
A draft plan from 19 February for the implementation of the restructure explored the impact of 100 redundancies and another 15 contracts that would be ended early in the oceans and atmosphere unit, and listed all the capabilities that would be affected. It included decisions that:
The first deep-dive process had produced a suggestion to cut 35 climate scientists and redeploy them in other areas.
But Schiller said if they aimed for fewer cuts, “we will inevitably face the problem of keeping some of the climate scientists”.
Ken Lee, director of the oceans and atmosphere unit, responded: “I agree – let’s overshoot first.”
The documents suggest the decision to shift focus was coming from chief executive Larry Marshall and others at the top of the organisation.
In an email from Mark Underwood, a research program director in the oceans and atmosphere unit, to Lee on 24 November 2015, Underwood noted that publications in important science journals “are (for better or worse) now being deprecated by Larry Marshall, Alex Wonhas and other [executive team] members”.
In the discussion notes from the deep-dive process, it is clear what has caused the shift in focus: “Changes in government funding for climate research ... have impacted [two climate research groups] who have traditionally relied on these funds to shore up their pipeline.”
In another document, the rationale for cutting back on climate science is explicitly linked to the amalgamation of two government funding programs. The document identifies that “climate change research” and “global sea-level rise” research would be affected.
On 15 January, weeks before the announcement was made, discussions began about who would lose their jobs. Lee wrote to Wonhas suggesting that those who would be made redundant should be told their fate from the start.
“Otherwise, all staff will be left wondering ‘Is it I?’ – productivity of the whole [business unit] will drop to zero. I’ve done this before. By not doing so, our top scientists will leave – as they are in demand; as well as post-docs who are looking for future opportunities within our organisation.”
But that practice appeared to be abandoned, with staff still not aware of who will be made redundant. In an email on 25 February, Peter Oke, an acting director in the oceans and atmosphere unit, defended that course of action. A staff member said: “The feeling is that, if there were even a rudimentary understanding of what we do, then the plan as put forward appears rushed, and illogical. This is further magnified by the fact that management is only now thinking about the full ramification and is not yet able to end the uncertainty.”
Oke replied: “Consider the alternative. There’s an announcement that there are 100 FTEs [full-time equivalent positions] lost and here’s a list. Or … there are 100 FTEs lost, and our leadership team will try to figure out the best way to retain a workforce that can function properly and deliver impact.”
When the managers began talking about which researchers could be made redundant, they discussed the employees’ ages, and whether they were working full-time or part-time.
One person mentioned was “approaching 60” and it was noted they could be transferred to another business unit. Another possibility was someone who “has increasingly gone part-timed [sic] not producing much”.
Another person was listed with the note “considering retiring but has strong union links”.
CSIRO spokesperson Huw Morgan said the options discussed in the documents were put forward at an early stage and were not all current, nor were they ultimately adopted. 
Morgan said “public-good research” still had a key role within the organisation and the emails quoted were just a small selection of the more than 700 documents provided by the CSIRO to the Senate inquiry.
“Research for national benefit absolutely belongs in CSIRO, as it has done for almost a century. This is CSIRO’s mandate and that has not changed,” Morgan said. 
“Our new strategy will see us continue to deliver research outcomes that benefit Australians and the international community. This includes in our key focus areas such as cybersecurity and digital disruption, business transformation, agriculture, health, and climate adaptation and mitigation.
“We have to make decisions about where we should invest our budget and we do this with a view to what Australia needs most. The Australian economy is in transition and CSIRO has a critical role to play in preparing people for climate change and for things like digital disruption that will change the way they work and live.”
A senior researcher in the oceans and atmosphere unit told Guardian Australia CSIRO executives were rethinking some of the plans after the enormous international response to the cuts. That reaction included hundreds of climate scientists signing a petition, a front-page story in the New York Times and a report arguing the cuts would breach international commitments.
In earlier comments, Marshall said the response was surprising and was “more like religion than science”. He said the climate science lobby appeared more powerful than the oil lobby was in the 1970s. Marshall later apologised for any offence caused by those comments.
“We appreciate this can be an uncertain and challenging period for affected staff and remain committed to supporting staff throughout this process,” he said."

The environment minister, Greg Hunt, claimed recently that Australia’s total greenhouse emissions had “peaked” in 2005.
Declining electricity demand has been dampening electricity emissions and reducing the total increase in greenhouse emissions despite increases in emissions from land clearing and mining.
But the latest data from Pitt and Sherry for the year to March 2016 shows total demand in the east coast electricity market increased for the 13th successive month and demand increased for the seventh successive month in the west.
“There can be little doubt that the period of falling demand for electricity across Australia has now ended,” said Pitt and Sherry analyst Hugh Saddler.
That increasing demand and an increase in generation using black coal, after the removal of the carbon price, saw annual emissions increase 5.5% in the year to March 2016, compared with the year to June 2014, when the carbon price was scrapped.
Total coal generation was 76.1%, compared with a minimum of 72.3% in the year to July 2014. Total renewable generation was 13.2%. Coal generation in Queensland is rising particularly quickly to fuel the booming liquefied natural gas export market. Those emissions will soon comprise an extra 8m tonnes of CO2 a year.
Brown coal emissions fell slightly in the year to March 2016, almost entirely because Victoria’s brown coal generators stopped exporting power to Tasmania. But Saddler says Tasmania’s energy crisis – caused by low rainfall and the fact that the undersea cable linking the island state to the mainland broke in December – means “large volumes of brown coal electricity are certain to flow south through the Basslink cable as soon as it has been repaired, so as to allow hydro storage levels to recover”.
The revelation that electricity emissions are trending steadily upwards comes as the Turnbull government begins consultations on setting “baselines” for its “safeguard” mechanism, which is supposed to ensure that rising electricity and industrial emissions don’t undo the greenhouse abatement bought through the government’s emissions reduction fund.
The baselines will apply after 2020 for new facilities or significant expansions.
The electricity industry will have a sector-wide baseline, with individual company baselines only kicking in if the sector-wide baseline is exceeded.
But the electricity sectoral baseline will be set at the high point of sectoral emissions over the period 2009-10 to 2013-14 and individual baselines will also be set at each facility’s highest annual emissions between 2009-10 and 2013-14."

That can’t be said of their new subject, climate change: Armageddon seldom reduces audiences to stitches. Happy to report, then, that The End Is Nigh is the musical comedy duo’s most satisfying offering yet. Its songs are linked, for the first time, by a narrative, as Jonny Donahoe and Paddy Gervers relate what happened when the former recklessly promised his four-year-old niece that he’d save the world. It’s as broad, daft and punchy as all of their work, but here a lightly worn moral seriousness brings ballast to the gags and gigglesome wordplay. That’s a welcome development, given that, hitherto, the duo’s self-mockery has tended to draw their political sting.
Of course there are jokes here about the impotence of “two comedians from Reading” in the face of the climate apocalypse. But there’s something stirring in their refusal to submit to it. And I was oddly moved by their climactic rallying call, which proposes that acts of resistance, however childish, to the status quo are worth more than any grownup justification for inaction: “We’ll all stay alive / If we act like we’re five.” 
There are hiccups along the way: a somewhat sour song about ugly babies; an obvious gag conflating Donahoe’s memories of two TV series from his youth. More often, I found myself enjoying the show’s detouring but fluid transitions between song and story, as the pair experiment with foraging, pee in the shower and heckle a former minister for climate change about his use of private jets. The Rt Hon offender shrugs them off; those in charge, says Donahoe, “don’t give a damn”. For those who do, here’s a spirited comedy show that never soft-soaps the grim outlook, but insists that fatalism and scepticism aren’t the only options available."

The company, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, had lodged a complaint with the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) about claims on Ecotricity’s website that it supplies “Britain’s greenest energy” and “greenest electricity”. On Wednesday, the ASA dismissed the complaint - agreeing with Ecotricity that the claims are correct.

The advertising watchdog concluded in its ruling that only one other unnamed energy company – probably a reference to Good Energy – supplied electricity from 100% renewable sources, but on a lifecycle analysis of those renewable sources, Ecotricity produced a few grammes less CO2 per kilowatt hour generated.
On the basis that the Gloucestershire company’s gas supply was slightly lower emission than most because it used a small percentage of gas derived from sugar beet, the ASA said that Ecotricity’s claim to supply the greenest energy in Britain had been substantiated and was not misleading, and therefore the complaint was not upheld.
Dale Vince, Ecotricity’s founder and CEO, told the Guardian he was pleased the ASA had confirmed its claims: “Tesla’s complaints have never made any sense to us. Clearly they are unhappy with the way our recent legal proceedings ended, where we defended our Electric Highway from them. 
“But our claims to provide the greenest electricity in Britain are very well documented and founded, so we were surprised they chose to pursue this — it’s been a bit of a waste of everybody’s time.”
The two companies have a bad-tempered history after a partnership between them turned sour. Ecotricity had teamed up with Tesla to help it  build a network of charging points to support its customers’ high-end electric cars. But when the two companies fell out they reached a confidential out-of-court settlement in 2015.
Tesla has been increasing its foothold in the UK, most recently selling its Powerwall energy-storage system through third parties, as well as its luxury electric cars and building a car-charging network.
In 2014, Ecotricity accused Tesla of a “smash and grab”, saying it was trying to take over several sites on Ecotricity’s electric car-charging network at motorway stations across the country. The two companies had entered a partnership under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and Ecotricity alleged Tesla was asking motorway services operator Welcome Break to break off exclusivity contracts with Ecotricity and sign with Tesla instead.
The two companies countersued, ultimately leading to an out-of-court settlement last July. In a mutually agreed statement, they said: “Ecotricity and Tesla have reached an out-of-court settlement, the terms of which are confidential.”
A Tesla spokeswoman initially said the company had no comment to make on the ASA ruling, but later said: “Tesla and Ecotricity resolved their differences a long time ago, and we wish them the best.” The company has made headlines around the world in the last week with the unveiling of its more affordable Model 3 electric car, for which it has taken pre-orders worth almost £7bn in just two days, according to Musk."

Thursday’s meeting in Ottawa represents one of the last chances to grow on the climate partnership agreed on by the US president, Barack Obama, and Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, before the president leaves the White House. 
The US and Canadian leaders enjoyed a mind meld on climate change, according to Gina McCarthy, who heads the Environmental Protection Agency. 
“We have real kindred spirits in Canada right now, and a tremendous interest on the part of prime minister Trudeau and president Obama to really work together,” McCarthy told a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.
Obama and Trudeau agreed last month to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by up to 45% from 2012 levels by 2025. The understanding was a break with the pro-energy policies of Stephen Harper, the former prime minister, who had lobbied heavily for the Keystone XL pipeline.
McCarthy said the US-Canadian initiative and other such partnerships were a key part of Obama’s efforts to use his presidency to shore up the Paris climate change agreement. 
“I think the president has brought a visibility to the issue in a way no president has before,” she said. “He has been using more of his personal time to connect with leaders in other countries. I think if you ask anyone, that changed the dynamic in Paris.”
Now it falls to McCarthy and Catherine McKenna, Canada’s environment and climate change minister, to find ways of making those cuts during Thursday’s talks.
 McKenna publicly fretted about the difficulties of navigating between provinces such as Ontario and Quebec, which this week launched new clean energy initiatives, and energy producers Alberta and Saskatchewan whose economies depend heavily on fossil fuels. 
“I’m a realist on this,” she told a forum in Ottawa last week. “There are a lot of people who have lost jobs in Alberta. I’m not saying that we destroy our planet. But I think we need to be thoughtful of how we move forward.”
Methane is more than 80 times more warming than carbon dioxide over 20 years, and scientists are increasingly concerned that fugitive emissions from ageing oil and gas infrastructure could overwhelm other efforts to reduce climate pollution. 
McCarthy said the officials would be looking at how to reduce emissions along the entire oil and gas production and supply chain – from mining sites to pipelines. 
The EPA is already in the process of cracking down on methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas wells. Alberta, which is Canada’s biggest oil-producing province, committed to a 45% cut in methane emissions last November.
But methane is a moving target, McCarthy admitted. As the fracking boom got underway, the EPA drastically underestimated emissions from the oil and gas industry – by nearly 30%, according to the agency’s own figures. The EPA now has more work to do just to get an accurate measure of the powerful climate pollutant, McCarthy said. "

Opposition politicians said it showed Cameron had given up any pretence of leadership on climate change and that he was sending out the wrong signals by not filling the role.
Lord Barker of Battle was appointed in September 2014 to the position, which Cameron created days before he addressed a high-profile UN summit and warned climate change was “one of the most serious threats facing our world”.
Cameron told Barker in a letter last year that the role was an important post and thanked him for putting the UK in “such a strong position for international climate change negotiations”.
Barker, a loyal ally of Cameron who accompanied him in 2006 to the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard where the then opposition leader was famously photographed hugging a husky, stepped down from the envoy role and as an MP last year.
It was then unclear whether a new climate envoy would be appointed to replace him, but Cameron said in a recent written answer: “The focus now is on implementation [of the Paris deal]. There are no plans to appoint a new envoy on climate change at this time.”
The shadow climate and energy minister, Clive Lewis, said: “The prime minister promised the greenest government ever but he is axing carbon capture, cutting energy efficiency, blocking wind power, threatening the solar industry and selling off the green bank. 
“Now he’s giving up even the pretence of leading the battle against climate change, by abolishing the post of his personal climate change envoy only 18 months after creating it – a decision that the government didn’t even announce, in the hope that no one would notice.”
Lynne Featherstone, the Liberal Democrats’ climate change spokesperson, said: “The role in itself is not the issue for me, but what it represents. It is a clear signal that you care about this issue and that you want someone around the table making the case for our environment and green issues in key government discussions. 
“This prime minister has shown that he doesn’t want that and has downgraded our response to climate change. It’s short-sighted and wrong.”
Barker tweeted:
@adamvaughan_uk Don't need Envoy just now given strong leadership from @AmberRudd_MP but was way to tap my experience in run up to COP21.
Although the UN climate summit in Paris last December was broadly acclaimed as a success because nearly 200 countries agreed a deal on curbing emissions, top diplomats involved with the process say Paris only marked the beginning and governments now have to get on with the real action of implementing it.
Countries are being invited for the formal signing of the Paris agreement on 22 April at the UN headquarters in New York. 
China, the US, India and the EU, the world’s four biggest emitters, have all already said they will sign at the ceremony, which former French foreign minister Laurent Fabius has called an important opportunity for world leaders to give new “impulse” to action on climate change.
The Paris accord only formally comes into effect when countries responsible for more than 55% of global emissions ratify it."

Aviation is one of only two sectors not covered by the Paris climate agreement and many diplomats are optimistic that the UN International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) blueprint can be whittled into shape before a Montreal conference this September.
But several loopholes in the text present serious obstacles to a signing ceremony, with China and other countries still dragging their heels over core concepts such as “carbon neutral growth” in the industry after 2020.
If an adequate deal is not done, the EU will be obliged to restart its “stopped clock” on bringing international airlines into its more punitive Emissions Trading System (ETS). Without a pact, this will happen automatically at the end of the year.
One European diplomat involved in the negotiations likened the chances of the European commission and parliament agreeing to keep the clock on ice to a “one billion dollar question”.
He told the Guardian: “It depends on three big elements: carbon neutral growth after 2020, a review clause to increase ambition over time, and robust accounting that is consistent with UNFCCC [the UN body that oversees the climate talks] reporting guidelines. Those three big things are still missing from the text.”
Under the plan, developed countries would start offsetting their emissions growth from aviation with carbon cuts elsewhere in the world in 2021. They would be joined five years later by “upper medium income states” such as Brazil, Mexico and China.
More than 100 poor countries and small island states would be excluded from the system altogether. Unless rich world airlines compensate for their carbon output, curbs are unlikely to slow aviation emissions which have been predicted to grow up to 700% above 2005 levels by mid-century.
Measuring these curbs though would be complicated by the lack of a “negative list” of non-eligible projects in the draft, for which offsets could be claimed. Without this, even nuclear power projects might be considered for offset credits as a low carbon energy source, some officials privately say.
“For now we can’t be sure which credits will be used so we can’t have a 100% guarantee of the environmental integrity of the scheme, which is is absolutely necessary if you want to achieve carbon neutral growth,” a diplomat said.
Eighty campaign groups have taken a stand against ICAO’s plan, arguing it would allow the double counting of existing climate programmes, while aforestation projects could force indigenous peoples from their land or create other land use problems.
Hannah Mowat, a campaigner for the conservation group Fern, said: “ICAO’s own standards rule forests and land offsets out from the start, because they need to be permanent emissions reductions, which is impossible to prove for forests because the removals are reversible.”
Some European negotiators believe that these concerns will be satisfied in an eventual resolution, the first draft of which is expected later this month.
But the current proposal to end the ICAO scheme after 15 years will need amending, if it is to square with the Paris agreement’s mechanism of reviewing and ratcheting up carbon targets every five years. These are meant to increase carbon cuts until a world warmed by 2C or less is in sight.
“The [planned] global market-based mechanism foresees a termination of the system in 2035, which is completely contradictory with the need to increase the ambition of greenhouse gas reductions over time,” a diplomat said.
An ICAO consultation in Utrecht on Tuesday was said to have made progress in shining a light on contentious issues. An updated text is expected later this month, ahead of a high level meeting on 11 May to prepare for the September Icao council meeting. "

The CSIRO chief executive, Dr Larry Marshall, told a senate committee hearing he would handle the restructure announcement differently, but attributed stress to staff to “misreporting” that 350 job cuts would all be to climate scientists.
Marshall said the 100 job cuts in the oceans and atmosphere division announced in February was an “upper limit” but the agency was trying to minimise cuts. The chief financial officer, Hazel Bennett, said of the current planned cuts only 75 pertain to climate scientists.
Marshall said cuts were made to the oceans and atmosphere division to achieve a strategic shift to mitigation and adaptation to the effects of climate change and because the agency was “not in a financial position to make up a shortfall in external funding”.
He said the cuts were not made due to any formal or informal instruction from the government but were “made by CSIRO executive team with input by the leadership teams and endorsed by our board”.
Bennett said the board had been advised of the restructure before Christmas, in January, and finally on 2 February, just two days before cuts were confirmed.
She said consultation with stakeholders was limited because the CSIRO did not want to pre-empt its notification to staff on 4 February.
Marshall was questioned on conversations with the innovation and science minister, and a meeting with then-communications minister Malcolm Turnbull over a salmon meal in early 2015. He refused to detail the content of the conversations. 
Marshall said there was no direction to institute climate program cuts, but the CSIRO was guided by the ministerial statement of expectations  for the agency, as it is required to do.
After the committee hearing, the Greens senator, Peter Whish-Wilson, said “normally when an organisation goes through a significant restructuring there would be an open process, a transparent process and a full consultation with staff and stakeholders. It’s been secretive, there’s been no transparency and it’s blown up.”
Another Greens senator, Janet Rice, said “there’s so much we still don’t know, there is a whole period of time when decisions were made between mid-December and mid-January, and no email documentation for it”.
“Larry Marshall was completely evasive about who he consulted in that period of time. So we need to get to the bottom of this.”
Whish-Wilson said “we cannot as a committee get a decent answer about who instigated this, and why, and what evidence it was based on. So far we’ve only got spin.”
After the hearing, shadow research, industry and innovation minister Kim Carr said “I’m disgusted ... I’ve never seen anything like it”. 
“There’s no doubt in my mind this new management of the CSIRO is responding to government priorities. They’ve taken it far too literally they need to find money from other sources.
“One of the biggest consequences of $140m budget cuts to CSIRO was that there were job losses.
“It’s time we looked at not just the structure of the CSIRO but the way decisions are made, whether they are consistent with the objects of the Act and whether or not they’re meeting Australia’s national interest in terms of the future direction of the CSIRO,” Carr said.
Marshall refuted claims CSIRO was moving away from public good scientific research, labelling it disturbing and untrue. 
“Our people believe what they do is for the benefit of the Australian public – and that’s true whether research is purely government funded, is helping industry be more productive or helping national priorities.”"

And Hillary Clinton helped get us here | Naomi Klein";"Clinton’s conviction that she can get the fossil fuel companies on board is mistaken: this can’t be solved by convincing the ultra-rich to do the right thing";"There aren’t a lot of certainties left in the US presidential race, but here’s one thing about which we can be absolutely sure: the Clinton camp really doesn’t like talking about fossil-fuel money. Last week, when a young Greenpeace campaigner challenged Hillary Clinton about taking money from fossil-fuel companies, the candidate accused the Bernie Sanders campaign of “lying” and declared herself “so sick” of it. As the exchange went viral, a succession of high-powered Clinton supporters pronounced that there was nothing to see here and that everyone should move along.
The very suggestion that taking this money could impact Clinton’s actions is “baseless and should stop,” according to California senator Barbara Boxer. It’s “flat-out false,” “inappropriate,” and doesn’t “hold water,” declared New York mayor Bill de Blasio. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman went so far as to issue “guidelines for good and bad behaviour” for the Sanders camp. The first guideline? Cut out the “innuendo suggesting, without evidence, that Clinton is corrupt.”
That’s a whole lot of firepower to slap down a non-issue. So is it an issue or not? First, some facts. Clinton’s campaign, including her Super Pac, has received a lot of money from the employees and registered lobbyists of fossil-fuel companies. There’s the much-cited $4.5m that Greenpeace calculated, which includes bundling by lobbyists.
But that’s not all. There is also a lot more money from sources not included in those calculations. For instance, one of Clinton’s most prominent and active financial backers is Warren Buffett. While he owns a large mix of assets, Buffett is up to his eyeballs in coal, including coal transportation and some of the dirtiest coal-fired power plants in the country.
Then there’s all the cash that fossil-fuel companies have directly pumped into the Clinton Foundation. In recent years,Exxon, Shell, ConocoPhillips and Chevron have all contributed to the foundation. An investigation in the International Business Times just revealed that at least two of these oil companies were part of an effort to lobby Clinton’s State Department about the Alberta tar sands, a massive deposit of extra-dirty oil. Leading climate scientists like James Hansen have explained that if we don’t keep the vast majority of that carbon in the ground, we will unleash catastrophic levels of warming.
Did these donations have anything to do with the investigation found, Clinton’s State Department approving the Alberta Clipper, a controversial pipeline carrying large amounts of tar-sands bitumen from Alberta to Wisconsin? “According to federal lobbying records reviewed by the IBT,” write David Sirota and Ned Resnikoff, “Chevron and ConocoPhillips both lobbied the State Department specifically on the issue of ‘oil sands’ in the immediate months prior to the department’s approval, as did a trade association funded by ExxonMobil.”
Did they make Hillary Clinton more disposed to seeing tar-sands pipelines as environmentally benign, as early State Department reviews of Keystone XL seemed to conclude, despite the many scientific warnings? There is no proof – no smoking gun, as Clinton defenders like to say. Just as there is no proof that the money her campaign took from gas lobbyists and fracking financiers has shaped Clinton’s current (and dangerous) view that fracking can be made safe.
It’s important to recognise that Clinton’s campaign platform includes some very good climate policies that surely do not please these donors – which is why the fossil-fuel sector gives so much more to climate change-denying Republicans. Still, the whole funding mess stinks, and it seems to get worse by the day. So it’s very good that the Sanders camp isn’t abiding by Krugman’s “guidelines for good behaviour” and shutting up about the money in a year when climate change has contributed to the hottest temperatures since records began. This primary isn’t over, and Democratic voters need and deserve to know all they can before they make a choice we will all have to live with for a very long time.
Eva Resnick-Day, the 26-year-old Greenpeace activist who elicited the “so sick” response from Clinton last week, has a very lucid and moving perspective on just how fateful this election is, how much hangs in the balance. Responding to Clinton’s claim that young people “don’t do their own research,” Resnick-Day told Democracy Now!:
As a youth movement, we have done our own research, and that is why we are so terrified for the future…. Scientists are saying that we have half the amount of time that we thought we did to tackle climate change before we go over the tipping point. And because of that, youth—the people that are going to have to inherit and deal with this problem—are incredibly worried. What happens in the next four or eight years could determine the future of our planet and the human species. And that’s why we’re out there…asking the tough questions to all candidates: to make sure that whoever is in office isn’t going to continue things as they’ve been, but take a real stand to tackle climate change in a meaningful and deep way for the future of our planet.
Resnick-Day’s words cut to the heart of why this is not just another election cycle, and why Clinton’s web of corporate entanglements is deeply alarming with or without a “smoking gun.” Whoever wins in November, the next president will come into office with their back up against the climate wall. Put simply, we are just plain out of time. Everything is moving faster than the scientific modelling has prepared us for. The ice is melting faster. The oceans are rising faster. And that means that governments must move much faster too. The latest peer-reviewed science tells us that if we want a good shot at protecting coastal cities this century – including New York, the place where Bernie and Hillary are currently having it out – then we need to get off fossil fuels with superhuman speed. A new paper from Oxford University, published in the journal Applied Energy, concludes that for humanity to have a 50-50 chance of meeting the temperature targets set in Paris, every new power plant has to be zero-carbon, starting next year.
That is hard. Really hard. At a bare minimum, it requires a willingness to go head-to-head with the two most powerful industries on the planet – fossil-fuel companies and the banks that finance them. Hillary Clinton is uniquely unsuited to this epic task.
While Clinton is great at warring with Republicans, taking on powerful corporations goes against her entire worldview, against everything she’s built, and everything she stands for. The real issue, in other words, isn’t Clinton’s corporate cash, it’s her deeply pro-corporate ideology: one that makes taking money from lobbyists and accepting exorbitant speech fees from banks seem so natural that the candidate is openly struggling to see why any of this has blown up at all.
While Clinton is great at warring with Republicans, taking on powerful corporations goes against her entire worldview
To understand this worldview, one need look no further than the foundation where Hillary Clinton works and that bears her family name. Its mission can be distilled as follows: There is so much private wealth sloshing around our planet (thanks in very large part to the deregulation and privatisation frenzy that Bill Clinton unleashed on the world while president) that every single problem on earth, no matter how large, can be solved by convincing the ultra-rich to do the right things with their loose change. Naturally, the people to convince them to do these fine things are the Clintons, the ultimate relationship brokers and dealmakers, with the help of an entourage of A-list celebrities.
The problem with Clinton World is structural. It’s the way in which these profoundly enmeshed relationships – lubricated by the exchange of money, favours, status and media attention – shape what gets proposed as policy in the first place.
For instance, under the Clintons’ guidance, drug companies work with the foundation to knock down their prices in Africa (conveniently avoiding the real solution: changing the system of patenting that allows them to charge such grotesque prices to the poor in the first place). The Dow Chemical Company finances water projects in India. (Just don’t mention their connection to the ongoing human health disaster in Bhopal, for which the company still refuses to take responsibility.). And it was at the Clinton Global Initiative that the airline mogul Richard Branson made his flashy pledge to spend billions solving climate change (almost a decade later, we’re still waiting, while Virgin Airlines keeps expanding).
In Clinton World it’s always win-win-win: the governments look effective, the corporations look righteous, and the celebrities look serious. Oh, and another win too: the Clintons grow ever more powerful.
At the centre of it all is the canonical belief that change comes not by confronting the wealthy and powerful but by partnering with them. Viewed from within the logic of what Thomas Frank recently termed “the land of money”, all of Hillary Clinton’s most controversial actions make sense. Why not take money from fossil-fuel lobbyists? Why not get paid hundreds of thousands for speeches to Goldman Sachs? It’s not a conflict of interest; it’s a mutually beneficial partnership – part of a never-ending merry-go-round of corporate-political give and take.
Books have been filled with the failures of Clinton-style philanthrocapitalism. When it comes to climate change, we have all the evidence we need to know that this model is a disaster on a planetary scale. This is the logic that gave the world fraud-infested carbon markets and dodgy carbon offsets instead of tough regulation of polluters – because, we were told, emission reductions needed to be “win-win” and “market-friendly.”
If the next president wastes any more time with these schemes, the climate clock will run out, plain and simple. If we’re to have any hope of avoiding catastrophe, action needs to be unprecedented in its speed and scope. If designed properly, the transition to a post-carbon economy can deliver a great many “wins”: not just a safer future, but huge numbers of well-paying jobs; improved and affordable public transit; more liveable cities; as well as racial and environmental justice for the communities on the frontlines of dirty extraction.
Bernie Sanders’ campaign is built around precisely this logic: not the rich being stroked for a little more noblesse oblige, but ordinary citizens banding together to challenge them, winning tough regulations, and creating a much fairer system as a result.
Sanders and his supporters understand something critical: it won’t all be win-win. For any of this to happen, fossil-fuel companies, which have made obscene profits for decades, will have to start losing. And losing more than just the tax breaks and subsidies that Clinton is promising to cut. They will also have to lose the new drilling and mining leases they want; they’ll have to be denied permits for the pipelines and export terminals they very much want to build. They will have to leave trillions of dollars’ worth of proven fossil-fuel reserves in the ground.
Meanwhile, if solar panels proliferate on rooftops, big power utilities will lose a significant portion of their profits, since their former customers will be in the energy-generation business. This would create opportunities for a more level economy and, ultimately, for lower utility bills – but once again, some powerful interests will have to lose (which is why Warren Buffett’s coal-fired utility in Nevada has gone to war against solar).
A president willing to inflict these losses on fossil-fuel companies and their allies needs to be more than just not actively corrupt. That president needs to be up for the fight of the century – and absolutely clear about which side must win. Looking at the Democratic primary, there can be no doubt about who is best suited to rise to this historic moment. The good news? He just won Wisconsin. And he isn’t following anyone’s guidelines for good behaviour.

Researchers said that a doubling of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere compared with pre-industrial times could result in a global temperature increase of up to 5.3C – far warmer than the 4.6C older models predict.
The analysis of satellite data, led by Yale University, found that clouds have much more liquid in them, rather than ice, than has been assumed until now. Clouds with ice crystals reflect more solar light than those with liquid in them, stopping it reaching and heating the Earth’s surface.
The underestimation of the current level of liquid droplets in clouds means that models showing future warming are misguided, says the paper, published in Science. It also found that fewer clouds will change to a heat-reflecting state in the future – due to CO2 increases – than previously thought, meaning that warming estimates will have to be raised.
Such higher levels of warming would make it much more difficult for countries to keep the global temperature rise to below 2C, as they agreed to do at the landmark Paris climate summit last year, to avoid dangerous extreme weather and negative effects on food security. The world has already warmed by 1C since the advent of heavy industry, driven by CO2 concentrations soaring by more than 40%.

A lack of data and continuing uncertainty over the role of clouds is to blame for the confusion about warming estimates, said Ivy Tan, a graduate student at Yale who worked on the research with academics from Yale and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
“Models have been systematically underestimating the amount of liquid in clouds, meaning that we aren’t fully appreciating the feedback,” she said. “It could mean our higher limit of warming is now even higher, depending on the model, which means serious consequences for us in terms of climate change.
“This is one of the largest uncertainties left in climate change. We need to understand these feedbacks a lot better.”
Scientists have been trying to get to grips with the extent clouds and water vapor will influence the warming already under way. A paper published last year found that short-term fluctuations in clouds have large impacts on the net rate of heat gain by the Earth.
One of this paper’s authors, Dr Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said research has already shown “major errors in climate simulations associated with clouds”.
Trenberth said there is “some art” to working out the role of clouds, given their annual cycles and distribution, with uncertainty over whether climate sensitivity is significantly changed.
“I think the paper is fine as a first step but it is not the last step, and much more is needed to establish how clouds change as the climate changes,” Trenberth said of the Yale study."

The world’s biggest provider of public finance to developing countries said it would spend 28% of its investments directly on climate change projects, and that all of its future spending would take account of global warming.
At last year’s landmark conference on climate change in Paris, the World Bank and its fellow development banks were made the linchpins of providing financial assistance to the poor world, to enable countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the effects of global warming.
“Following the Paris climate agreement, we must now take bold action to protect our planet for future generations,” said Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank Group. “We are moving urgently to help countries make major transitions to increase sources of renewable energy, decrease high-carbon energy sources, develop green transport systems and build sustainable, livable cities for growing urban populations. Developing countries want our help to implement their national climate plans, and we’ll do all we can to help them.”
John Roome, senior director for climate change at the World Bank, told journalists: “This is a fundamental shift for the World Bank. We are putting climate change into our DNA. Climate change will drive 100 million more people into poverty in the next 15 years [unless action is taken].”
At least $16bn a year, from across the World Bank group, which includes other development and finance institutions, will be directed to climate change projects, including renewable energy and energy efficiency. The group will aim to mobilise $13bn in extra funding from the private sector within four years, for instance through joint funding programmes. By 2020, these efforts should amount to about $29bn a year, nearly a third of the $100bn a year in climate finance promised by rich countries to the poor as part of global climate change agreements.
As part of the institution’s new strategy, it will help to fund the construction of enough renewable energy to power 150m homes in developing countries, and build early warning systems of climate-related disasters – such as storms and floods – for 100 million people.
The bank will also target “smart” agriculture systems, which use less water and energy and retain soil fertility, and will help countries develop their transport and urban infrastructure to produce much less carbon. All projects considered for funding – including health, education and other development priorities – will be screened for their vulnerability to the impacts of climate change.
The World Bank has attracted strong criticism in the past for backing the construction of high-emissions infrastructure, chiefly coal-fired power stations, and had already made moves away from such investments. Roome refused to rule out fossil fuel investments in the future, but said they would be subject to strict criteria, to do with their necessity, ensuring the most efficient technology was used, and investigation of alternatives. For instance, he said, gas could provide a “transition” away from high-carbon fuels for countries struggling to build new renewable energy capacity."

Secretary general Ban Ki-moon is hosting the signing ceremony on the first day that the agreement reached in Paris in December opens for signature. 
The UN chief, French President Francois Hollande, and environment minister Segolene Royal, who is in charge of global climate negotiations, have invited leaders from all 193 UN member states to the event. 
The UN said signatures from over 130 countries, including more than 60 heads of state and government, would surpass the previous record of 119 signatures on the opening day for signing an international agreement. That record is held by the opening day signing of the Law of the Sea treaty in 1994. 
The UN stressed that the signing ceremony is the first step in ensuring that the agreement enters into force as soon as possible. It will take effect 30 days after at least 55 countries, accounting for 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions, deposit their instruments of ratification or acceptance with the secretary general. 
A number of countries have indicated that they will deposit their instruments of ratification immediately after signing the agreement, the UN said. 
“Paris was historic,” Ban said in a statement. “But it’s only the beginning. We must urgently accelerate our efforts to tackle climate change.” 
The agreement sets a collective goal of keeping global warming below 2C compared to pre-industrial times, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5C. It requires all countries to submit plans for climate action and to update them every five years, though such plans are not legally binding."

She is a fierce environmental activist – who earns a living in one of the most gas-guzzling industries on the planet.
But the 42-year-old, a Nascar racing driver, insists she isn’t the walking contradiction you might imagine. She’s a pragmatist. “I am making the biggest difference when I am at a race track and not when I am at an environmental event, preaching to the converted,” she says from her home in North Carolina.
There are 75 million racing fans in the US, and Münter has the platform to reach them all. “If I was just a biology graduate running around telling people to buy electric cars and give up eating meat and dairy, not many people would listen to me.”
Driving a racing car was on Münter’s bucket-list as a teen. “I was born with a lead-foot,” she says. After graduating from her degree in biology she funded her way through racing school by working as a stunt double for Catherine Zeta-Jones in the films Traffic and America’s Sweethearts. 
It was in 2001 that Münter ran her first race, and the usual announcement, “Gentleman, start your engines”, had to be changed to accommodate her. “I felt like I had already won the race,” she remembers. But receiving trophies from scantily clad grid girls can be quite a weird experience. 
“It’s good for little girls watching to see me standing alongside [the girls giving out trophies] in a racing suit; hopefully it plants a little seed in their head.”
But finding sponsors who don’t compromise her ethics can be tough: she refuses to work with companies associated with fossil fuels, animal testing, meat or diary products, fur or leather. 
Instead, she works with environmentally-friendly companies and advocacy groups fighting for clean energy and animal rights, and nine years ago committed to adopting an acre of rainforest for every race she runs to offset her carbon footprint. And off the track she drives a Tesla car powered by the solar panels on the roof of her house.
“I have walked away from big sponsor deals, and in some ways it has hurt my racing career because I haven’t been in a car as much as I could have,” she admits.
Getting on the track might have its challenges, but being an environmental activist who can make a quick getaway proved a valuable asset to the team behind the documentary Racing Extinction. Directed by Oscar-winning Louie Psihoyos, famous for The Cove, the documentary draws attention to mankind’s role in a potential loss of at least half of the world’s species. It follows the scientists, activists and journalists who are documenting it all over the world, and fighting to stave off mass extinction. 
Münter was dispatched in a customised electric Tesla car to beam rogue projections of endangered species across New York City. Passers by were astounded to see giant tigers stalk along buildings and a blue whale swim up the Empire State. She also incriminated corporations by lighting them up and highlighting their CO2 and methane emissions, with a filter that made the gases visible to the human eye.
 “With 7.3 billion people on the planet, we have to change the way we’re living and I think people are waking up to that – it’s something we have to confront,” she says. “A few times when the cops or security were called, I could speed away and, because the car’s camouflage paint job could be turned off, I’d hide in plain sight.” 
Shell, McDonald’s and Seaworld have all come under Münter’s fire, and not everybody is pleased about her taking a bolshie stand with her racing car. 
“I have had a few death threats and in one race I was given a security team because someone making threats was thought to be there in the crowd.” 
Quick to shrug it off, she is not afraid to ruffle feathers. In 2014 she raced in a Blackfish-themed car and handed out a thousand DVDs of the film, about killer whales in captivity. She did the same in 2012 with the dolphin-hunting film The Cove and hopes to get behind the wheel of a Racing Extinction-themed car soon too. 
Veganism is another movement close to her heart. She is planning to drive a vegan-themed race car and give away vegan food to racing fans at the finish line. She has already converted a few of her pit crew to eat vegan meat substitute, and that’s proof that US racing fans are just the sort of audience the environmental community should be speaking to, she insists. 
“If you really want to have an impact you have to have the uncomfortable conversations with the people who may not be on our side yet.” She recently received a message from a man whom she’d inspired to adopt an acre of rainforest for his wife’s birthday. 
He looked like the stereotypical Nascar fan that people picture, she says. “He had the big beer belly, the Budweiser in his hand, and I know that a lot of environmentalists would just write someone like that off and think there was no sense in reaching out to him, but that’s just not true.”
Ultimately, Münter would like to see Nascar move towards either using 100% renewable fuel or electric racing cars. “Innovation often comes from the racetrack and the sport could really help move us forward,” she says. “They have all these brilliant engineers who could also be working on making the sport more sustainable and environmentally friendly.” 
Münter is going to continue to fight from behind the wheel – beating men to the finishing line while she’s at it.

And it’s not alone — only firms in one country, Germany, received more than the €3bn pocketed by British businesses through the ETS between 2008 and 2014.
Yet Tata Steel’s chairman, Theo Henrar, argued that the ETS put its Port Talbot steelworks at “a competitive disadvantage”, because foreign rivals were not burdened by such tough environmental rules.
Enraged environmentalists have countered with studies by independent consultancies and market analysts showing that since 2008, Tata has taken more than £700m from the ETS in free allowances, offsets and windfall profits passed through to consumers.
Before the Paris climate agreement put all countries on notice to lower their emissions, the argument for “carbon leakage” measures – compensation to stop companies relocating their businesses elsewhere in the world because of Europe’s climate policies — appeared robust. The notion that cleaner European steel manufacturers could be forced to migrate to compete appeared commonsensical.
But one problem the European commission faced in supporting compensation was a lack of evidence that such leakage had ever occurred, according to its own studies. An OECD report last month was the latest to conclude that “tougher environmental laws do not hurt export competitiveness”.
In practice, the glut of free carbon allowances under the ETS – which cost the UK £13bn in lost revenues – has worked less as a trade protection, and more as an undeclared subsidy, or tax break. But labour costs in the UK are around 20 times higher than in China and, despite the handouts under the ETS, cheap Chinese steel imports to Britain more than doubled in 2014. Research suggests that subsidies for polluters were, for the most part, not spent on innovation or research.
Sharan Burrow, the secretary general of the International Trades Union Confederation and a New Climate Energy commissioner, complained that the handouts also depleted funds that could have enabled a more just energy transition. “Companies must accept [that] industrial transformation is essential to stabilise the planet and stop demanding a free ride,” she said. “Saving billions of dollars that can be used to support a just transition for workers in fossil fuels and invest in renewal for vulnerable communities is worth doing.”
 Safeguards for such communities in places like Port Talbot were not high on the agenda of the EU institutions – or environmentalists – when the carbon leakage debate raged in Brussels. But they will probably heave into view again, as the proposed Port Talbot buyout by Sanjeev Gupta’s Liberty Group is examined.
Gupta reportedly wants to replace the blast oxygen furnace used at Port Talbot with an electric arc furnace. Arc furnaces are secondary steel plants. They recycle scrap steel that has already been made – and use electricity rather than coal or gas to power their production process. Industry sources say that these plants – which make up around 40% of Europe’s capacity – typically produce nearly five times less CO2 than blast furnaces.
If Gupta’s plans to power an arc furnace in Port Talbot with renewable energy are realised, its greenhouse gas emissions could be greatly reduced. The Carbon Commentary blog estimates that a switch from blast to electric arc furnaces would save over three tonnes of CO2 for each tonne of steel.
For steelworkers, though, this would be a mixed blessing, as arc furnaces employ far fewer people. Profits might be increased by the scything of pensions payments, but communities would also be devastated by mass layoffs. And that brings us back to the “just transition” question of who will pay for the low-carbon-energy revolution. 
The closure of Britain’s mining industry may have been a defining moment for “green conservatism”, albeit at a terrible human cost. But the question, when the markets-first model is being extended to steel, is why employers should be shielded from its logic when their workers are not. "

Melting ice sheets, especially in Greenland, are changing the distribution of weight on Earth. And that has caused both the North Pole and the wobble, which is called polar motion, to change course, according to a study published on Friday in the journal Science Advances.
Scientists and navigators have been accurately measuring the true pole and polar motion since 1899, and for almost the entire 20th century they migrated a bit toward Canada. But that has changed with this century, and now it’s moving toward England, according to study lead author Surendra Adhikari at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Lab.
“The recent shift from the 20th-century direction is very dramatic,” Adhikari said.
While scientists say the shift is harmless, it is meaningful. Jonathan Overpeck, professor of geosciences at the University of Arizona, who wasn’t part of the study, said that “this highlights how real and profoundly large an impact humans are having on the planet.”
Since 2003, Greenland has lost on average more than 272 trillion kilograms of ice a year, and that affects the way the Earth wobbles in a manner similar to a figure skater lifting one leg while spinning, said Nasa scientist Eirk Ivins, the study’s co-author.
On top of that, West Antarctica loses 124 trillion kgs of ice and East Antarctica gains about 74 trillion kgs of ice yearly, helping tilt the wobble further, Ivins said.
They all combine to pull polar motion toward the east, Adhikari said.
Jianli Chen, a senior research scientist at the University of Texas’ Center for Space Research, first attributed the pole shift to climate change in 2013, and he said this new study takes his work a step further.
“There is nothing to worry about,” said Chen, who wasn’t part of the Nasa study. “It is just another interesting effect of climate change.”"

Most threatened are some of the capital’s busiest stations, including Waterloo, King’s Cross and London Bridge, and the report warns of potential dangers to passengers. “The rapid nature of flooding events often produces high safety consequences,” it reads. The report was funded after Hurricane Sandy swamped the metro in New York City in 2012.
The London tube network is one of the busiest in the world, with more than 3.5m passenger journeys a day between 270 stations across the city. As well as the risk to passengers, closures and delays result in multimillion-pound losses for the tube and the wider economy.
The report finds the risk of flooding is rising due to climate change, and its findings reflect wider concerns about the UK’s preparedness for the impacts of global warming. Other critical infrastructure including the M25, Immingham container port and major electricity grid sites have all come close to disaster from flooding in recent years, and in March professionals warned that the healthcare system was “unprepared for devastating effects of climate change”.
Ian Uttley, a senior drainage engineer at London Underground (LU), said: “You can’t get an asset more vulnerable to flooding than a network of underground tunnels.”
The unpublished flood risk review, produced by LU and obtained by the Guardian, says: “London has been fortunate to escape the worst of recent storm events in the UK, but it is only a matter of time before heavy rainfall seriously affects London and the underground network. The risk is generally expected to increase [as] climate change predictions are that storms will become more intense. There is some evidence to show that these have already increased in frequency.”
Bob Ward, a member of the London Climate Change Partnership and policy director at the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics at the London School of Economics, said: “This is a shocking report that reveals the massive number of tube stations and sites at high risk of flooding. While it is good that LU is now aware of the scale of the risks, it is worrying that more has not been done to make the tube system more resilient to flooding. London has just been lucky that it has not been struck by a major flash flood recently.”
Ward said the mayor of London’s climate change adaptation strategy, published in October 2011, highlighted that the underground was the most vulnerable to flooding of all the city’s transport networks, but he said little had been done to reduce the risk: “It is a shameful legacy from Boris Johnson’s time as mayor.”
The LU report is its first on flood risk since 2001 and identifies 85 “high-risk” sites, of which 57 are stations and the rest are shafts and tunnel entrances. The stations in the top 10 of highest risk are spread across the city and include Finsbury Park, Notting Hill Gate, Seven Sisters, Colliers Wood, Stockwell and Marble Arch. Another 68 sites were identified as at “significant risk” by the report, including 23 stations. 
The biggest risks are from flash flooding after heavy downpours and from burst water mains. Rainwater flooding regularly causes delays and at times in 2015 closed closed some lines, and in 2007 a train was left stranded. Ruptured water mains affect the tube an average of five times a year and in 2012 one incident sent 3m litres of water down a ventilation shaft between Mile End and Stratford, forcing the Central line to be closed for 26 hours at a cost of £4m.
LU has requested £3m over the next three years to analyse the riskiest sites in greater detail and to begin to install protective measures. But if the risk is to be significantly reduced, much more funding will ultimately be needed, said Anthony Fernihough, LU’s head drainage engineer. “£3m is not going to scratch the surface of it,” he said.
George McInulty, LU’s programme director for renewals, said: “We are investigating what more we can do to minimise any potential disruption flooding causes to our customers.”
Transport for London, which oversees the LU’s budget, is understood to be receptive to the plan but approval will depend on the mayor of London elected in May, who will become the chair of TfL and will appoint its board. In November the government announced it was cutting £700m a year of TfL’s funding.
“If the underground goes underwater we might finally see some real action on climate change from Westminster politicians,” said Guy Shrubsole, of Friends of the Earth. “Increasingly torrential rainfall of the sort experienced by people in the north of England this past winter poses a major danger to the tube. It’s clear that the government’s national flood resilience review must prepare the UK’s infrastructure for ever wetter weather, and take radical action to cut the pollution that’s changing our climate.”
In 2014 the Guardian revealed that government money spent on preparing the UK for the impacts of global warming had almost halved and the number of staff working on the issue had been slashed from 38 to six."

Reefs, in fact, not only sequester carbon, but also reuse their own waste byproducts. “When they produce calcium carbonate, they release carbon dioxide,” he explains. “This feeds the symbiotic algae that help support them.”
This circular process of reusing waste materials lies at the heart of a new generation of design and innovation. Tapping Into Nature, a recent report from environmental consultancy Terrapin Bright Green, explores several companies that are imitating nature to address some of humanity’s most dire problems.
Blue Planet is one of these companies. Beginning in 2011, it has worked with DeepWater Desal, a combined desalination plant, power plant and data storage facility in Moss Landing, California, to mix waste carbon dioxide released by its natural gas power plant with the calcium produced from water desalination. The result is calcium carbonate – limestone – a building material that California’s construction industry needs. And, not incidentally, the same material that coral reefs are made from.
“Rather than mimicking a beak or a chemical or a process at the organism level, we’re looking at mimicry at the system level,” says Constantz. “Ecosystems are, by definition, structured around efficiency and balance.”
According to Terrapin Bright Green, Blue Planet could sequester up to 10bn tons of carbon dioxide over the next decade. While only a fraction of the more than 360bn tons that humanity is likely to produce in that period, it is still a significant step forward – and it hints at a process that could potentially transform the way industry views its waste carbon. As an added plus, the DeepWater project also produces fresh water and data storage, two more things that California desperately needs.
DeepWater Desal’s desalination highlights another major global problem: a scarcity of water that threatens an estimated 4 billion people. But, while humanity often finds itself with insufficient water to fulfill its needs, nature usually finds ways to get or adapt to the available water supply, even in the most arid of regions.
For example, in the Namib desert, where temperatures can top 45C (113F) during the day, the Namibian desert beetle still finds a way to hydrate. “It positions itself on a sand dune to catch humid air coming off the sea,” explains Charlie Paton, managing director of UK-based Seawater Greenhouse. “Water condenses on its shell – much like on a cold beer can – and runs into its mouth, giving it all the liquid it needs for the day.”
Paton’s company – which has projects in Australia, Somaliland, Abu Dhabi and other arid countries – builds greenhouses that condense water vapor from seawater to produce fresh water, which they then use for agriculture. Their inspiration is the water cycle, the combination of evaporation and condensation, that organisms such as camels or the Namibian desert beetle use to keep themselves hydrated.
But even an apparently simple process, like the daily water routine of the Namibian desert beetle, can be deceptively complex. To imitate nature’s water cycle, Seawater Greenhouse mathematically analyzes a variety of climate data, including humidity, wind patterns and air temperatures. It then adapts its solution to each individual area. 
“In Somaliland, we’re developing a family-size unit,” says Paton. “It’s nominally one hectare, with a 1/10th hectare greenhouse in the middle. The greenhouse provides shelter and water for the rest of the farm. We expect it to be both very low cost and extremely profitable.”
Seawater Greenhouse also imitates nature’s use of water vapor. Mainstream agriculture generally focuses on liquid water, but Paton claims that water vapor is actually a more effective, and more flexible form of humidity. Viewed this way, he says, it’s easier to see how water can be reused multiple times in an ecosystem. “A molecule of water can evaporate and rain six times in the time it takes to work its way through the Amazon from the Atlantic to the Andes,” he says. Also, humid environments use water more efficiently and improve photosynthesis. “Raising a kg of tomatoes in a hot, arid climate, can take 300 liters of water or more, but in a humid environment, that drops to 20-30 liters,” he explains. With that in mind, Seawater Greenhouse focuses more on creating humid environments than on generating water.
According to John Warner, CEO of the Warner-Babcock Institute for Green Chemistry, one of the biggest shortcomings of human manufacturing is its obsession with purity. “Everything we do in manufacturing is unnatural,” he says. “Our manufacturing processes are based on the idea that our materials need to be 100% pure. But in nature, everything is a mixture of materials. Natures embraces that, for resilience.”
Ecovative, a New York-based manufacturing company, has adopted this use of mixed materials by using mycelium, the thread-like branching produced by fungi, often found on soil, to replace styrofoam, plastic, plywood and fiberboard. The fungus, which founder Eben Bayer calls “nature’s glue”, naturally binds together other ingredients and can grow to fill any form. “The old industrial mindset would look at mycelium and say ‘what can we extract?’” says Bayer. “Instead, we say ‘Let’s keep it as close to nature as possible.’”
To produce its fiberboard, Ecovative adds mycelium to wood fiber, then lets the fungus consume the fiber, binding it together. The slabs of mycelium then go to wood presses, where they are condensed into a medium density fiberboard. This process eliminates the need for formaldehyde, a hazardous chemical that is often used in industrial glues, and can reduce costs by up to 30%, Bayer says. Admittedly, mycelium fiberboard takes longer to produce than conventional products, but Bayer says that with sufficient advanced planning, Ecovative can maintain a steady flow of material.
A larger problem, some critics argue, is that bio-inspired imitation largely focuses on imitating single organisms, rather than ecosystems. Beth Rattner, the executive of the nonprofit Biomimicry Institute, says that this can limit the scope of innovation. “Sometimes people criticize bio-inspired innovation by saying that it’s a lot of compelling stories about one-off improvements, but we’re still far from a man-made world that functions as elegantly as nature,” she says. “Ultimately, we need to approach the system as a whole, rather than focusing on individual problems as separate issues.”
One solution, she says, is to address system-wide problems with system-wide partnerships. No single company can replace formaldehyde, for example – doing so will take the efforts of several stakeholders. 
“We will begin to see exponential changes when we change the building blocks of industry – say from petroleum-based plastic, with its relatively limited functional capacity, to something like chitin, which has different molecular structures to create the waterproof, lightweight, flexible, porous and iridescent shell of a beetle,” says Rattner."

At the very end of Sir David Attenborough’s three-part documentary on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, the 89-year-old asks this simple question, in his polite way, not pointing fingers at anyone in particular, just wondering.
It is all that has gone before that gives his question such force. We have seen the remarkable, beautiful and wondrous reef in a way that makes political spinning over its health and future seem hollow.
We have seen the reef, but we have also felt it. The wonder of the once-a-year synchronised coral spawning, millions of sperm and eggs shooting into the ocean. The extraordinary sight of coral polyps battling each other in territorial wars.
We have felt the effort of 100kg green turtles hauling themselves onto the sands of Raine Island in north Queensland after 40 years at sea, there to lay eggs in the same place they hatched themselves. We can sense how every creature – every polyp, crab, fish, manta ray and shark – depends on every other.
Nobody imagined in those days that the reef could be degraded, even disappear, in one man’s lifetime
At the end of this series, whether you’re a fan of nature documentaries or not, you will have learnt things, sure, but you will have witnessed and felt magical things.
Attenborough’s Great Barrier Reef has already been broadcast in the UK, but the first episode screened in Australia on Sunday on the ABC. There is a special poignancy watching it here, because Australia is the reef’s home and we are its guardians.
The opening episode is about the reef itself, how the 2,300km chain of coral reefs and islands formed between 10,000 and 14,000 years ago towards the end of the ice age. Water flooded the continental shelf and what remained was shallow and warm enough to be perfect for coral, the heart of this underwater city. 
The local Indigenous people living near Cairns have told through music and dance a similar story about how the reef was born for thousands of years.
Attenborough is an old man now, and one of his themes is time and change. Sixty years ago, dressed in little more than swimming shorts, flippers and a snorkel, he first explored the reef, and maintains that the “unforgettable beauty” of that experience remains the most magical moment in his career. 
The black and white footage of that adventure is nostalgic, even innocent. Nobody imagined in those days that the reef could be degraded, even disappear, in one man’s lifetime. 
Time has brought technological advances that allow Attenborough and his crew to explore the reef, as he tells us often, like never before. Down he goes in an explorer submarine – a Triton submersible – to remote corners of the reef rarely, if ever, filmed. The footage is as beautiful as you will ever see, the narration very Attenborough with its mix of information and drama.
After laying “one of nature’s great wonders” before us, Attenborough uses the third episode to outline the threats to the reef. Some of these, like cyclones, are natural events and the reef has proven extraordinarily resilient to many periods of exposure and regeneration over thousands of years. 
That’s the critical difference this time. Climate change is wreaking havoc because about 30% of the carbon dioxide we pour into the atmosphere is absorbed in the oceans. The rising temperatures and increased acidity it causes is happening too fast for the reef to cope. In the last 30 years, almost half the coral has disappeared.
“The greatest concern now is that we might lose the reef altogether,” Attenborough says. 
The scientists he meets are passionate and committed, doing all they can to protect and reef and its inhabitants. It has got to this: scientists at the Australian Institute of Marine Science in north-east Queensland are desperately trying to selectively breed a new kind of coral they hope might be able to withstand the worst effects of climate change. Perhaps we could place this laboratory coral created on the reef to regenerate areas that have died. There’s something so sad about this well-intentioned scramble. As one scientist says: “This is really a last resort option.”
Attenborough doesn’t get into the politics of climate change, either global or local. He doesn’t analyse the Australian government’s support for coalmines, especially the Indian company Adani’s enormous Carmichael mine in Queensland, and its potential threat to the reef. He doesn’t get into the need for ambitious renewable energy targets or which is best method of reducing carbon emissions. And his series came too late to capture the latest severe coral bleaching in the north of the barrier reef marine park, a result of warming temperatures. 
Attenborough’s gift is to take us beyond politics, to what matters. It is an especially loud message for Australians, who have the privilege and duty to look after this “eco-system like no other”.
 “The Great Barrier Reef is in grave danger,” Attenborough says. If temperatures continue to rise at the present rate it will be gone with in decades. What was once unthinkable is now happening on our watch. At the end of this series – perhaps Attenborough’s last big on-the-road documentary – he says without hyperbole, “That would be a global catastrophe.”"

Media reports have emerged suggesting Labor would adopt a policy of opening an inquiry into Australia’s energy industry, and shutting down the oldest and dirtiest power stations to lower emissions and create more demand for renewable energy.
The Grattan Institute report notes an economy-wide price on carbon would be the best possible policy– reducing emissions at the lowest possible cost – but it says a stable policy environment where successive governments stopped ripping up old policies and starting again was needed.
Without that, businesses could be reluctant to make long term investments in lower carbon technology, Tony Wood, lead author on the report told Guardian Australia.
“Pragmatism and urgency demand a practical, next-best approach,” Wood said.
Current Coalition Direct Action climate policies are projected to result in increased greenhouse gas emissions, albeit at a level that might allow Australia to meet its 2020 targets because of accounting rules. But new or strengthened policies would be needed to meet the 2030 or 2050 targets, the report finds.
Those policies came into effect after the Coalition was elected and ripped up the previous Labor government’s climate policies.
Meanwhile, the Labor party continues to have an emissions trading scheme at the centre of its policy, which would again result in wholesale change to the current policy framework.
The Grattan Institute report described this process as a policy bonfire and proposed a framework that “builds on the Coalition’s current climate policies while maintaining direction towards the long-term target”.
The report argues the government should take three steps.
Wood didn’t call this an emissions trading scheme but noted in the report that the above plan “shows how a future Labor government could take the Coalition’s policy framework and move to its preferred emissions trading model”.
Today the Australian reported the Labor party was preparing to announce its carbon policies to take to the election, and they would include the launching of an inquiry into the electricity market, that could be charged with developing a plan to shut down the oldest and dirtiest coal-fired power stations.
In a speech to the Sydney Institute in March, Mark Butler, the federal environment spokesman for Labor, said it were considering this. He said in his consultations with a wide range of groups, including the electricity industry, there was widespread support for a policy would shut down the “the more heavily polluting older coal fired power stations in this country.”
“We are considering those views very closely at the moment as we finalise our election policy,” he said.
AGL, Australia’s biggest emitter and owner of some of the country’s dirtiest power stations, has called for just such a policy. Critics have suggested it would then look for compensation payments from the government. Such a policy would also increase wholesale energy prices for generators like AGL.
Conservation groups in Australia have supported policies that would shut down coal, because it will decrease the oversupply of electricity in the market, increasing demand for renewables .
Wood said such a policy could sit on top of the sort of policy his report advocated, but said it wasn’t the most efficient way to reduce emissions.
“The objective is to reduce our emissions in the lowest cost way” and a carbon price would ensure that, he said. “I can understand that if you can’t get a stable, predictable carbon price, then you do something ... like regulation, but I think regulation is always the last card.”"

Helena Morrissey, chief executive of Newton Investment Management and a long-time campaigner for women in boardrooms, is spearheading the new “Two Degrees of Change” initiative. Under it, women will be encouraged to raise climate issues with their company boards, and demand companies and investors take action to stave off the threat of dangerous warming.
The name comes from the pledge made by governments at the historic Paris climate conference in December to limit global warming to no more than 2C, which scientists say is the threshold of safety.
Morrissey, who set up the “30% Club” named for her target to see 30% of board seats in big companies going to women, told the Guardian: “This is about having more women in senior roles [in business] focusing on climate change and changing the narrative. We need female voices in our boardrooms on this.”
Shareholders would benefit, she said, as the risks of climate change are still poorly taken into account in many companies, and traditional financial services companies have yet to make the major changes likely to be necessary in strategy.
Morrissey added that many women were more aware of climate change as a pressing problem than men at the top of the financial services sector. “Women are often interested in these areas more than men, and interested in a long-term view,” she said. “Many women find themselves working within an established culture at old-fashioned companies.”
Forming a network dedicated to helping women would be beneficial for businesses as well as the climate, she said: “Women see how change can happen within their companies, but they need encouragement and empowerment to speak out.”
She was joined at the launch on Monday in London by Christiana Figueres, the UN’s climate chief who led the successful negotiations at Paris, and Rachel Kyte, former vice president of the World Bank leading on climate change and now senior representative for the UN on sustainable energy, as well as a roll-call of City women specialising in green issues.
Figueres also highlighted links between the issues: “There is a clear parallel between the progress we’ve seen on gender equality and climate change in the last six years. Evidence suggests a greater presence of women the boardroom and in senior leadership can help increase the corporate focus on climate change.”
The UN’s climate change arm, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, has championed the representation of women through its “Women for Results” grouping.
Figueres called on companies and leaders of all kinds to participate in the new business-focused movement: “Just as political will brought an agreement in Paris, so the collective will of the right people in business can create momentum around the actions needed to tackle climate change.”
Figueres has been one of a number of women who have played a key role in shaping climate change negotiations, who also include Connie Hedegaard, former EU climate chief; Helen Clark, administrator of the UN Development Programme; Mary Robinson, UN special envoy for climate change; and Kristalina Georgieva, formerly of the World Bank and now vice president of the European commission, often tipped as the next UN secretary general.
Women have played prominent roles in international environmental politics for decades, driven by such figures as Gro Harlem Brundtland, who defined the concept of sustainability in her landmark 1987 report; Joke Waller-Hunter, a leading official drafting the Kyoto protocol; Margot Wallstrom, former EU environment commissioner; and Wangari Maathai, activist and Nobel peace laureate.
The Two Degrees of Change group will face a major task, however, as women are still poorly represented in politics and in most major international forums.
At the Paris climate talks, the former UN commissioner for human rights and ex-president of Ireland, Mary Robinson, who now leads her own Climate Justice Foundation, told the Guardian she was disappointed by the poor representation of women at the talks. “This is a very male world [at the conference],” she said. “When it is a male world, you have male priorities. If you don’t have women here, how can you say this is about people?”"

Friends of the Earth has produced a report saying a 30% target by 2020 is practical and achievable in Victoria and would maximise the state’s share of clean energy investment and jobs. South Australia, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory already have targets designed to give them an advantage.
The Victorian government has promised a 2020 and 2025 target and has held consultations on what the figure should be. It has suggested a baseline that at least 20% of electricity generation should be produced by renewable sources by 2020 and is due to release its plan within weeks.
A Friends of the Earth spokesman, Leigh Ewbank, said modelling by the group, reviewed by the Melbourne Energy Institute’s Dylan McConnell, found that a 30% target could be achieved if rooftop solar growth continued at current rates and already approved or almost approved wind farms went ahead. It would also require that existing permits for wind farms allow upgraded turbines.
Wind projects had stalled, Ewbank said, because of investor uncertainty over the federal government’s commitment to the national renewable energy target, which the Abbott government reviewed. Last year, the target was cut and is now set at 23% by 2020.
At the same time, state and territory governments are aggressively pursing opportunities in renewable energy, with some setting their own targets. Most ambitious is the ACT, which is aiming for 90% of its energy needs produced by clean energy by the end of the decade.
Victoria’s peak union organisation, the Victorian Trades Hall Council, the Municipal Association of Victoria and the City of Melbourne have all called for Victoria to set an ambitious target.
“Our analysis shows what’s technically possible looking at the wind projects that are already on the books and maintaining a moderate solar growth,” Ewbank said. “Given the attacks that the industry has withstood under the Tony Abbott era it’s ambitious because we have to rebuild [the industry].”
 The group would like a 50% target by 2025, similar to Queensland’s goal by 2030. The federal opposition has proposed that 50% of energy needs should be from renewables by 2030, but has released few details.
The vast majority of Victoria’s energy needs are supplied by ageing brown coal-fired power stations, which are especially polluting. About 14% is supplied by renewable energy, up from 6% in 2009.
The Victorian opposition has appointed its first spokesman for renewable energy, David Southwick, who told a rally earlier this year that “Victoria and Australia are experiencing a renewables revolution. It is led by the people because the people want it, voters want it and the community wants it”. It has yet to specify a target."

This makes Britain the first country to commit to one of the key pledges in the Paris climate agreement reached last December.
This decision was prompted by a tireless, non-partisan campaign led by former Labour leader Ed Miliband, the UK’s first ever secretary of state for energy and climate change. Securing this commitment is an important new climate milestone for Miliband, who played a key role in establishing the UK Climate Change Act when he was in government. 
The decision is also a testament to the ongoing cross-party commitment to tackle climate change which originally allowed the Climate Change Act to be adopted. But while we should take a moment to welcome the symbolic advance that has been made, a major issue with the UK’s flagship climate policy still remains unresolved and it is much more pressing.
The Climate Change Act was rightly held up as a groundbreaking piece of environmental legislation, the poster-child policy for global climate leadership. The act set an ambitious long-term target to cut UK emissions by 80% from 1990 levels by 2050, introduced an independent Climate Change Committee to chart an affordable course to that 2050 target, and established a system of five-year carbon budgets to ratchet national emissions down progressively over time.
But at some point shortly after this historic environmental victory – when the streamers had all been popped and the champagne had all been drunk – the lawyers and the accountants were called in to write the rules for our carbon budgets and somewhere along the way they decided to get a little creative.
The result of that creative accounting is something worthy of the Panama Papers. 
Our world-leading carbon budgets have been given feet of clay. While they pretend to limit emissions from the whole British economy, they only actually police half of them. The other half has been offloaded to the EU Emissions Trading scheme, which acts as a kind of offshore carbon haven. While the European carbon market is supposed to drive emissions reductions on the UK’s behalf, it is notoriously broken, and is still struggling to maintain a carbon price above a meagre €5 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted – and this despite numerous political interventions to fix it over the past decade.
With the stroke of a pen the technocrats quietly absolved government of all responsibility to reduce emissions from some of the most obvious and most tractable sources of pollution in the land: the fossil-fuel devouring power stations and factories whose smokestacks belch millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year – not to mention huge amounts of other pollutants which damage our health more directly than CO2.
It’s incredible to think that the carbon budgets established under the Climate Change Act have not prompted the installation of a single solar panel or wind turbine and haven’t required a single coal-fired power station to close. But by virtue of their design they could not drive this change. These specific carbon abatement measures have either been driven by European directives or by completely independent domestic political pressures and rules. 
We are obliged, then, to pose a new question. As the government prepares to adopt the fifth carbon budget in June – the budget that will control emissions from the year 2028 to 2032 – we need to ask not only what level that budget will be set at, but how it will be measured. Will it be an honest budget that does what it says on the tin, or will it be a budget that can be met through loopholes and accounting tricks?
We should soon find out. As the energy bill returns to the House of Lords on Tuesday, and both houses negotiate the final legislation, a key amendment to fix the accounting rules is still up for grabs. This is our opportunity to straighten out the books and change the rules so the government is accountable for keeping all national emissions within the UK carbon budgets. 
This proposal to close the reporting loopholes is backed by the Labour party, the Lib Dems, the Scottish National party, the Greens and others. It also has the support of NGOs including the RSPB, Sandbag, Greenpeace, Client Earth and WWF. 
The Conservative party’s manifesto says they will “continue to support the UK Climate Change Act”. The question right now is, will they help to fix it?"

But a hotter planet brings a less obvious menace: drought.
Three-quarters of the world’s small islands, home to 16 million people, are set to get more arid by mid-century, according to a study published in journal Nature Climate Change on Monday.
Warmer temperatures will evaporate more water than they replenish in rainfall, the survey of 80 island groups found.
Among the most severely affected are the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean including St Lucia and Grenada, French Polynesia – the subject of paintings by impressionist Paul Gauguin – and the Robinson Crusoe Islands in the south Pacific.
Islands in the tropics like the Marshall Islands and Kiribati will experience more rainfall this century, however.
Many islands already face acute water scarcity due to limited catchment areas and demand from growing populations.
But precise forecasts for these small archipelago and atoll nations are in short supply, as they do not typically register in global climate models.
“Up until now if you lived in the middle of the ocean on a small island, you were without the information that rest of us on big land masses have of what to expect in the future,” said Kristopher Karnauskas at the University of Colorado-Boulder and author of the study.
The study calculates future levels of evaporation and combines them with precipitation forecasts. Karnauskas said that would help planners adapt infrastructure and agriculture to future imbalances in water.
Without both sets of information, “it’s like the score of a ball game with just one team’s score. You need to know the other to know who’s won,” he told Climate Home."

Because the company their investments allow to operate is fourth in a list of the world’s top-emitting companies and was responsible for 2.47% of global emissions from 1751-2010.
The company will be forever linked to the massive spill in the Gulf of Mexico — but its the daily environmental toll that ultimately matters more — the constant, minute-by-minute flow of carbon into the atmosphere.
In order to keep its profits coming, despite the science, BP has worked its way into the highest levels of governments, and even gotten inside great cultural institutions like the British Museum and the Tate Britain gallery. It’s now attempting to slide unchallenged into the magical and dangerous waters of the Great Australian Bight, searching zombie-like for yet more oil. Ditto Azerbaijan, Angola, the tar sands of Canada and the old hunting grounds of the North Sea, even though scientists are painfully clear about the fact that we can’t burn most of the reserves we already know about.
BP’s actions are weird, in that they insist “we have publicly acknowledged the risk [of climate change] and have been working to address it since the 1990,” and that they are part of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) which publicly supported a global agreement at the Paris talks. But when you scratch beneath the surface, this is just another carbon major, being fast and loose with the future.
BP is also a card-carrying member of a trade organisation that lobbied against the EU setting renewables and energy efficiency targets for 2030; and opposed carbon pricing while supporting it publicly. It actively lobbied against action to reduce emissions – a 2015 analysis gave BP the lowest rating - a “negative and actively conflicting approach to climate change regulation”.
They’re out there every day, hunting for more hydrocarbons, even though their current reserves of oil and gas will release seven gigatonnes of carbon dioxide - 1% of the world’s remaining carbon budget.
BP is not only ignoring what its activities could mean for climate change. It is also ignoring the energy transition that is already happening. While BP hopes for an “orderly” transition to a low-carbon energy system, it has repeatedly underestimated the exponential growth of renewables. Clean energy currently represents just 0.5% of BP’s business - and it doesn’t seem to have any plans to change this. While the energy transition moves on, BP just keeps drilling.
Their old pillage and pollute business model is failing, though. Last financial year they posted the worst financial loss in their corporate history, even as investment capital around the world swings toward renewables. That’s the future, clearly — but the news comes as cold comfort for the people of the Pacific islands, or drought-affected Africa or India, or the folks in Australia whose livelihood depends on the survival of the Great Barrier Reef or the fishing industry in the Great Australian Bight.
Last year, in the Guardian, I wrote about the discovery of Exxon’s secret climate documents, saying: “it seems crucial simply to say, for the record, the truth: this company had the singular capacity to change the course of world history for the better and instead it changed that course for the infinitely worse.”
In 2016, as shareholders gather to talk about the company they collectively own, it’s worth saying that I could have easily been writing about BP. Deliberate and desperate attempts to find, exploit and sell more of oil and gas while pretending to care about the future is not just wrong, it’s sick.
It’s also likely to end very, very badly for everyone, including BP."

In an interview with Yale Environment 360, he responds to critics and explains why he believes the reality of climate change requires him to speak out";"Climate scientist James Hansen has been a prominent figure in the global climate conversation for more than 40 years. His 1988 congressional testimony on climate change helped introduce the problem of rising greenhouse gas emissions to the American public, and he has led study after study examining exactly how our world will change as a result of global warming. Eight years ago, however, Hansen made the rare decision to begin engaging in climate activism, and he has since protested mountaintop removal in West Virginia and gotten arrested outside the White House in a rally against the Keystone XL pipeline.
His actions have earned him both praise and criticism from the media and scientific community. Recent scientific endeavors of his — including a study last month that was publicized prior to being peer-reviewed — have also generated controversy. 
In an interview with Yale Environment 360 last week, Hansen, former director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, opened up about his unconventional career path, his frustration watching policymakers’ four decades of climate inaction, and what he believes the world could look like a century from now. 
“I don’t think that I have been alarmist — maybe alarming, but I don’t think I’m an alarmist,” he said. “We have a society in which most people have become unable to understand or appreciate science, and partly that’s a communication problem, which we need to try to alleviate.” 
Yale Environment 360: In a paper released last month in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, you and colleagues argued that 2 degrees Celsius of warming could be “dangerous,” setting the stage for abrupt climatic changes. Can you describe more in detail what could happen under this scenario? What would the world look like? 
James Hansen: We know from the earth’s history that 2 degrees would eventually lead to sea level rise of several meters. The last inner glacial period, 120,000 years ago, that’s the last time it was warmer than today, sea level was 6 to 9 meters higher — that would mean loss of almost all coastal cities. It’s unthinkable that we walk into such a situation with our eyes open, and yet, the science is very well understood. 
There’s no argument about the fact that we will lose the coastal areas, now occupied by most of the large cities of the world. It’s only a question of how soon. That message, I don’t think, has been clearly brought to the policymakers and the public. More than 190 nations agreed [at the Paris climate conference last December] that we should avoid dangerous human-made climate change. That loss of coastal cities would be a dangerous outcome. It’s hard to imagine that the world will be governable if this happened relatively rapidly. What we conclude is that the timescale for ice-sheet disintegration is probably a lot shorter than has been assumed in the intergovernmental discussions.
e360: You started researching climate change back in the 1970s. Forty years later, could you ever have imagined the scientific community would be predicting sea level rise of several meters? 
Hansen: I could imagine that we would be predicting that, but I’m disappointed that policy actions have not been achieved to deal with it. The first major paper that we published on climate was in 1981 in Sciencemagazine . It focused on the fact that if we kept burning fossil fuels, burn most of the fossil fuels, it would guarantee sea level rise of many meters. We also talked about the amount of warming we expected, when it would rise above the level of natural variability, and the fact that the Arctic would lose its sea ice — we would open the fabled Northwest Passage, and there would be a creation of drought-prone regions in North America and Asia. 
I remember commenting to my co-author, [NASA scientist] Andy Lacis, “Gee, by the time we’re retirement age, interesting things will be happening on our planet.” What we could not have guessed is the fact that the world’s governments would be so unresponsive to the increasing empirical evidence. No one expected that governments would react immediately when it was still just based on simple models 40 years ago, but now, it’s not just models. We can see what’s happening. 
e360: It seems as though recently every new scientific article that comes out, every new headline that’s published on climate change and climate projections, it’s about this abrupt climate change. Is the idea of gradual climate change gone for good now? 
Hansen: Some things do change gradually because of the inertia system. The global average temperature, if you average it over several years, is going up pretty smoothly, since the middle 1970s. January/February of this year, global temperature is now 1.3 degrees above the 1950-1980 average, but that was just two months. Averaged over the year, it’s going to be about 0.9 degrees Celsius, and that’s pretty much on this almost linear increase over the last four decades.
Locally and regionally you get abrupt events, which are the ones that have the biggest impact on people. The frequency and severity of extreme events increase as the planet continues to get warmer. Sea level and ice-sheet disintegration is also a very nonlinear process. It’s going to lead to rapid change within the next several decades. The other thing we point out is that the fresh water coming off of Greenland and Antarctica is affecting the ocean circulation. Normally in the winter at the polar regions, it gets cold, the salt in the ocean water gets dense, and will sink toward ocean bottom, and that drives this overturning ocean circulation or conveyor belt. I think there’s a danger that if we keep adding greenhouse gases, that we will get shutdown in the AMOC, Atlantic Meridian Overturning Circulation, sooner than the model indicates. It’s very interesting scientifically, but it’s very threatening. 
e360: You and your colleagues publicized the Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics study last July, before it had undergone peer review — and received a lot of criticism for doing so. Why did you choose to do that? 
Hansen: Because there was going to be a United Nations meeting in December, and we thought these are important considerations that should be included. It makes the urgency of actions clearer. This is a perfectly legitimate. That’s the great thing about the journal that we submitted it to, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. If an appropriate editor looks at it and decides that it appears to be reasonable, then they publish it. It’s available to anyone in the world. The whole idea is to get discussion, to improve the final paper that comes out. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with this. It is frustrating that some scientists find it objectionable. I think it’s exactly the right thing to do, and I think other people should do the same thing, if they have a paper that’s important to get the discussion out there.
e360: I know one of the biggest issues with climate denialists have been that they publish studies, but often these are not in peer-reviewed journals. Did you and your colleagues worry at all that following a similar route, publicizing it before it became peer reviewed, might undercut the credibility of the research?
Hansen: It shouldn’t. It should increase the credibility. If you’ve got more opportunity for people to criticize it and to make suggestions, it becomes all the stronger. I find people want to criticize, and they are welcome to do that, but I will gladly do the same thing again. 
e360: You support nuclear energy, but many environmentalists don’t. What’s your argument for supporting it? 
Hansen: It’s very interesting that environmentalists have become anti-nuclear. If you go back to the middle of last century, environmentalists, at least some of them, pointed out that nuclear energy was probably the best option for the future because it has the smallest footprint on the environment. A ping-pong-ball-sized piece of uranium contains enough energy for a person who lives to be 100 years old. Unlike fossil fuels, it doesn’t dump greenhouse gases and aerosols into the atmosphere.
We in the West raised our standard of living by burning fossil fuels. If the rest of the world does the same thing, we’re all cooked. China and India know very well they can’t get all the energy they need from the sun and the wind — those are useful and they should be part of the clean energy that the world needs, but they’re intermittent. They’re not a complete solution. 
e360: Some people have criticized you for being an alarmist, for using the extremes of climate scenarios when you talk to the media and the public. Do you worry at all that this can be counterproductive? That by saying things like Keystone XL would be “game over for climate,” it causes people to throw their hands up in despair and say, “We can’t do anything anyway. It’s too big of a problem”? 
Hansen: The scientific community is getting more and more concerned about the fact that we’re pushing the system beyond tipping points and things are happening. I don’t think that I have been alarmist — maybe alarming, but I don’t think I’m an alarmist. The point of the Keystone XL pipeline comment was that we cannot burn the unconventional fossil fuels without ensuring that young people inherit a situation out of their control. 
e360: When you look at the climate projections for the next 100 years, for your grandchildren’s lifetimes, do you think that we have the time and motivation to adapt?
Hansen: Some climate change is obviously going to occur which we have to adapt to, but the things you cannot adapt to are what I call the irreparable harm. There are specifically two things that I focus on: One of them we’ve talked about, that’s sea level rise. If ice sheets become unstable, it would cause continually rising sea levels with economic implications that are incalculable. That’s irreparable harm to young people. The other thing is extermination of species. If we keep burning fossil fuels business-as-usual, then the climate zones shift fast enough and far enough that it will, in combination with the other stresses on species, cause extermination of a significant fraction of species on the planet. It’ll be a much less desirable planet if we drive many species to extinction. 
e360: You balance between being a scientist and an activist, a position that many researchers are reluctant to take. When did you feel like you had to take more of an activist role? 
Hansen: I don’t recommend that all scientists, especially young ones, go out and get arrested. I can afford to do that since I’m beyond retirement age. The first time I got arrested was after young people at Virginia Tech told me about Larry Gibson, who was this man who had a cabin on Kayford Mountain [in West Virginia] and was blocking coal companies by refusing to sell his land. Mountaintop removal is like tar sands. It’s a crazy thing. The amount of pollution that you produce locally at the place where you’re taking the stuff out of the ground is enormous. They’re destroying the groundwater in the surrounding areas. They push the top of the mountains into the valleys where the streams are. The health of people living in West Virginia is significantly impacted by that practice. 
e360: Did you feel it hurt you within the scientific community when you started engaging in activism? 
Hansen: I don’t think so. It’s a little surprising to me that the scientific community objected to our recent paper being publicized before the final version was available, but other than that it has been very supportive. 
e360: You talked about young scientists maybe not getting into activism, but do you think that this is a role more scientists need to take? 
Hansen: I do think that more scientists need to be as clear as they can in communicating the implications of the science to the public. All ages of scientists can do that. We have a society in which most people have become unable to understand or appreciate science, and partly that’s a communication problem which we need to try to alleviate. 
e360: Fast forwarding a bit to November. Polls show more and more people are concerned about climate change in this country on both sides of the aisle, but the issue has yet to be a major priority for Americans in the voting booth. What do you think would have to change in order for that to happen? 
Hansen: Young people need to understand how much is at stake for them. It became a significant issue in the 2008 elections, not a major issue, but Barack Obama did address it in his campaigning. He did say we have a “planet in peril” a number of times. For a number of reasons, young people supported him, and that played a major role in his election. But they didn’t know what to ask after he was elected, and so the policies that were proposed by Obama were based on the policies advocated by Big Green, such as cap and trade, and that unfortunately is completely inadequate. The next time around, after this next election, we had better make sure that the new administration understands not only what the problem is, but what will work and what won’t work in solutions. 
e360: Has the major boom in fracking and in the release of methane into our atmosphere changed how scientists understand and predict climate change impacts? Was this even a factor a decade ago? 
Hansen: Fracking has changed the story in a major way. There were scientists who were arguing, “We’re at peak oil, peak gas,” and so the climate problem will diminish in the future because we’re running out of fossil fuels. The fossil fuel industry figured out ways to get a lot more out of the ground, and there’s a lot more down there. There’s no way we can burn all that’s available without guaranteeing that it’s a completely different planet. Fracking and tar sands, what I would call unconventional fossil fuels, we just can’t afford to burn them.
If it were really a bridge that allowed us to close coal, use gas for a little while, while we developed zero carbon energies, that would not be insensible — but that’s not what’s actually happening. We’re still burning coal, and we’re burning more gas. 
e360: Is there anything else you would like to mention? 
Hansen: The one thing, which is most important, is the assertion by the fossil fuel industry and the people who support them, that it would be expensive to solve the problem, is absolutely wrong. There have been economic studies that show if you add a gradually rising fee to fossil fuels, by collecting a fee on fossil fuel companies at the source, the domestic mine, or port of entry, and if you distribute the money to the public, an equal amount to all legal residents, it would actually spur the economy. It would increase the gross domestic product and add millions of jobs. We need to have such a common sense solution, which is revenue neutral, so it doesn’t make the government bigger. Instead of proposing taxes or regulations that conservatives will fight tooth and nail, we should find an approach that both liberals and conservatives would be willing to support. That’s what needs to be understood, that it’s not painful to solve this problem if we are smart, but we have to think this through. "

The appointments of Arena’s former board members expired in January, leaving it governed by the environment department secretary, Gordon de Brouwer.
On Wednesday the environment minister, Greg Hunt, announced six directors who have been appointed for a two-year term.
Wilder was appointed both a director and chairman of the Arena board. He is the head of Baker &amp; McKenzie’s global environmental markets practice, an adjunct professor at the Australian National University, and board director of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC).
The other five directors are Susan Jeanes, Meg McDonald, Katherine Woodthorpe, Maria Atkinson and Jonathan Jutsen.
The appointments follow the government’s decision in March to restructure Arena and the CEFC by setting up a clean energy innovation fund. The fund will in time take over Arena’s role of providing grants to help commercialise emerging technologies.
The government said Arena would “continue to manage its existing portfolio of grants and deliver the announced $100m in large-scale solar projects”. Arena would then move from a grant-based role to predominantly a debt and equity basis under the new CEFC.
Jeanes was a Howard government MP, a climate change adviser to the then environment minister, Robert Hill, and chief executive of Renewable Energy Generators of Australia and the Australian Geothermal Energy Association.
McDonald is a former Australian government ambassador for the environment and chief operating officer of the CEFC.
Woodthorpe is an experienced non-executive director, serving on boards ranging from ASX-listed companies to research institutions and government entities for nearly 20 years.
Atkinson is a director of her sustainability consultancy, the Maria Atkinson Consultancy.
Jonathan Jutsen founded Energetics, an energy, carbon and sustainability consultancy.
De Brouwer, who is already a director, remains on the board.
Hunt said the new board members have the experience and skills to help Arena improve the competitiveness of renewable energy technologies and increase the supply of renewable energy in Australia.
“The new board will also, in collaboration with the CEFC, jointly manage the $1bn clean energy innovation fund to support emerging technologies make the leap from demonstration to commercial deployment,” he said."

Almost 12% of Greenland’s ice sheet was melting on Monday, according to data crunched by the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI).
It beat, by almost a month, the previous record for a melt of more than 10%, on 5 May 2010.
“We had to check that our models were still working properly,” Peter Langen, climate scientist at DMI, told blog Polar Portal.
Temperature readings on the ice were in line with the numbers, however, exceeding 10C in some places.
Even a weather station 1,840 metres above sea level recorded a maximum of 3.1C, which data analysts said would be warm for July, let alone April.
Greenland’s usual melt season runs from early June to September. “Too much. Too early,” tweeted the World Meteorological Organisation."

Play nicely? Share? Such laments could be applied to many economic, political and social problems today. Perhaps the thorniest of them all is, climate change. Despite the relative success of the Paris COP21 in November, we are still far from effectively controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Could game theory help us rein in our impacts on the climate?
 Game theory is the mathematical study of conflict and cooperation between actors or groups: animals, people, businesses, countries or even computer algorithms. It became a formal topic of study in the 1950s and has since made significant impact on economics, political science and evolutionary biology and ecology. 
The fundamentals of the climate change are simple: the Earth’s finite capacity to absorb additional CO2 produced by burning fossil fuels, and the self-centred motivations of governments, businesses, and people which leads them to try and use as much of this capacity as possible. Simply put, more CO2 produces more wealth. Consequently, what is best for the individual is not best for the group. Somehow these two incentives need to align. One way would be for all 197 nations to cooperate in working out how to allocate carbon emissions. Presumably they would then move onto world peace.
In game theory speak, man-made climate change can be cast as an iterated game over a common-pool resource that no one owns and everyone has access to. For example, fish in a fishery, trees in a wood, or pasture land grazed by cattle. They regenerate and if sustainably managed, can provide valuable resources for many. Take too much however, and they can collapse.
Such collapses cause the ‘tragedy of the commons’, a concept that was popularised by Garret Harding’s 1968 article, in which we find a prescient summary of climate change “… the rational man finds that his share of the cost of the waste he discharges into the commons is less than the cost of purifying his wastes before releasing them”. Everyone would benefit if everyone played ball and cleaned up their mess. But that takes resources and money so the temptation to pollute is often too strong. 
It is possible to avoid a tragedy of the commons if the incentives are setup right – reward cooperation, and limit the benefits of temptation to free ride on others’ contributions. Such temptations can be reduced by punishing free riders. But how can you administer such rules within the largely lawless landscape of international relations? There is no single government that can demand inspections and impose fines. Climate change seems to require a game to facilitate cooperation, but there is nothing to stop any individual nation picking up the board and scattering all the pieces if things aren’t going their way.
One approach is a bootstrapping process. Thinking global while acting local recognises that local interactions are important. It has been shown that cooperation can be enhanced if people repeatedly play the same game with the same set of people. When they do, systems of reciprocity and trust can evolve. This will also allow effective punishment of defection. People trying to free ride either get penalised or thrown out of the group. A classic example of the emergence of such cooperation is the live-and-let-live system that operated in the British and German trenches during the first world war. This involved a number of behaviours that sought to minimise casualties on the opposing side. Soldiers would deliberately shoot high to miss the enemy, or shell the same spot with artillery at the same time of day.
In essence, this is a simple and robust strategy. Along with tit-for-tat. Play nice with someone and they return the favour. Upset or hurt them and expect consequences. Social scientist Robert Axelrod discovered tit-for-tat as an effective strategy in repeated social games in the 1980s. It’s not the best strategy for all interactions, but it’s robust and lends itself to modification. 
With regards to climate change, the hope is that if likeminded people within a group can agree to limit greenhouse gas emissions, then a group can make similar agreements with other groups. Regional agreements can help scaffold international agreements. It’s a bottom up approach. Finally a tipping point is reached in which limiting emissions becomes a social norm that is widely recognised. Think of the rapid changes in people’s attitudes to drink-driving, smoking in public places, or smacking children. 
If cooperation can emerge in the midst of the horrors of war, then surely we can find the right incentives to combat climate change. Unfortunately, there appears to be a crucial difference. What drove cooperation in the trenches was a realisation that while the uniforms may differ, all the soldiers were in it together. We are not all in this together with respect to climate change. The impacts on the climate and vulnerabilities to climate change vary considerably. 
In fact, the rules of the game appear to operate exactly in opposition to what’s required. Those that have the greatest impacts on the climate – the most industrialised nations – are those nations that will be least affected. It’s some of the poorest people living in some of the least developed nations that are going to bear the brunt of climate change.
This doesn’t mean the climate change game can’t be beaten. But we would do well to remember just who has most to lose if we collectively fail."

The Stanford Research Institute presented a report to the American Petroleum Institute (API) in 1968 that warned the release of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels could carry an array of harmful consequences for the planet.
The emergence of this stark advice follows a series of revelations that the fossil fuel industry was aware of climate change for decades, only to publicly deny its scientific basis.
“Significant temperature changes are almost certain to occur by the year 2000 and these could bring about climatic change,” the 1968 Stanford report, found and republished by the Center for International Environmental Law, states. “If the Earth’s temperature increases significantly, a number of events might be expected to occur including the melting of the Antarctic ice cap, a rise in sea levels, warming of the oceans and an increase in photosynthesis.
“It is clear that we are unsure as to what our long-lived pollutants are doing to our environment; however, there seems to be no doubt that the potential damage to our environment could be severe.”
The study, written by scientists Elmer Robinson and RC Robbins, adds that accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere could cause “serious worldwide environmental changes”.
The scientists estimated that CO2 in the atmosphere could reach 400 parts per million by 2000. In fact, CO2 levels broke that milestone last year, recording their largest leap on record. 
This huge increase in CO2, the primary driver of the greenhouse effect, has helped global temperatures rise by 1C over the past century. It is estimated that about three-quarters of the world’s known fossil fuel reserves, including oil, coal and gas, will have to remain unburned if civilisation is to avoid the worst ravages of climate change, such as droughts, floods, food insecurity and inundation from rising seas.
API, the peak body for the oil industry in the US, knew about the dangers of climate change at least 20 years before the issue was brought into mainstream public discourse via the former Nasa scientist James Hansen. Former US president Lyndon Johnson also received an early warning about climate change, with scientists explaining the mechanism of the greenhouse effect in 1965.
Last year, it was revealed that ExxonMobil, the world’s largest oil company, knew of climate change as early as 1981, only to spend millions of dollars over the following 27 years to promote climate denial. The exposure of this prior knowledge has been led by Inside Climate News. 
Exxon had a dedicated in-house team that established the connection between fossil fuels and climate change, but the company still spent years refusing to acknowledge the issue and funding climate denial activities. Exxon now insists it accepts climate science and doesn’t promote denial of the changes to the planet already under way.
 The Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) said hundreds of documents show oil and gas executives met in 1946 to agree that they should fund research into air pollution issues. The subsequent findings were then covered up to protect company profits, according to the environmental law group.
 Carroll Muffett, president of CIEL, said the latest documents from 1968 “add to the growing body of evidence that the oil industry worked to actively undermine public confidence in climate science and in the need for climate action even as its own knowledge of climate risks was growing.
 “These documents are the tip of an evidentiary iceberg that demands further investigation,” Muffett said. “Oil companies had an early opportunity to acknowledge climate science and climate risks, and to enable consumers to make informed choices. They chose a different path. The public deserves to know why.”
The prominent climate scientist Michael Mann, of Pennsylvania State University, said it was “disgraceful that industry groups like API knowingly hid the dangers of their project decades ago when they first learned of them, much as the tobacco industry hid the dangers of their product”.
 API was contacted for comment on the documents."

“The water suddenly started to rush out for about five minutes, dropping by about 1.25 metres, then after a couple of minutes returned with some force,” reported the harbourmaster. This tsunami-like event damaged boats and resulted in a serious head injury to one crewman. Analysis suggests that this mini-tsunami was brought on by the thundery weather.
At the Met Office, Andrew Sibley and his colleagues have analysed weather observations and radar images. Their results show a sharp spike in air pressure racing along in front of the thunderstorms. It seems the upwards convection associated with the storm, was balanced by powerful downdrafts in front of the storm system. This high pressure spike was enough to push the level of the North Sea down as much as 5cm and, with resonance in relatively shallow water, set up a tsunami-like wave.
Tidal gauges along the east coast of Scotland confirm the existence of this wave, which probably wasn’t a freak event. “They seem to occur as frequently as every three to ten years around the UK, and are relatively common globally too,” says Sibley, whose findings are published in the journal Weather. Indeed a similar event was seen in the Channel in June 2011. Greater understanding of these meteotsunamis should enable meteorologists to forecast them in future, giving people more time to get out of harm’s way."

The green deal scheme was launched in January 2013 with the intention of handing out loans to improve domestic energy efficiency. It folded in July 2015 despite claims by David Cameron that his would be “the greenest government ever”. 
The National Audit Office has examined the scheme for the first time and found that the Department for Energy and Climate Change spent £240m on the scheme.
Another £154m has been spent on the green deal home improvement fund which was set up to provide subsidies for efficiency measures, auditors found. 
They said 1.4 million homes benefited from measures ranging from new boilers to insulation by the end of last year under government schemes, but just 1% of households took out “green deal” loans. Around 14,000 households opted for the loan scheme but the numbers fell far below expectations, the report said. 
Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the public accounts committee, said the report shows ministers and officials had little idea how to implement the scheme.
“The Department of Energy and Climate Change has been flying blind when it comes to implementing the green deal and energy company obligation (ECO),” she said. “The schemes have cost over £3bn to date, but the department has achieved little energy savings compared to previous schemes,” she said.
Improving energy efficiency in the UK’s 27 million homes, which are responsible for more than a quarter of the country’s energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions, is seen as key to tackling climate change, energy security and fuel poverty. 
Under the scheme, householders could avoid the upfront costs of insulation, efficient heating systems, draught proofing, double glazing and renewable energy generation such as solar panels, paying back the cost of their installation with savings on bills.
But the loans were too expensive, the scheme was frequently changed and householders did not take up the finance plans at the expected rate, according to its critics.
The scheme’s failure to persuade households that energy efficiency measures were worth paying for meant it cost the taxpayer £17,000 per loan plan, the report said. 
Auditors concluded the green deal did not achieve value for money and delivered “negligible” carbon savings. 
The design of the ECO, which requires suppliers to install energy saving measures in homes to cut carbon emissions, was also examined by auditors.
The £3bn ECO scheme, whose costs are passed on to consumer bills, saved only around 30% of the carbon emissions of previous programmes, partly because of an initial focus on “harder to treat” homes which cost more to make efficient.
Taken together, the government’s various energy efficiency schemes have cost £94 for each tonne of carbon they saved, significantly more than the £34 per tonne of carbon dioxide of the schemes they replaced. 
Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said: “The Department of Energy and Climate Change’s ambitious aim to encourage households to pay for measures looked good on paper. 
“But in practice, its green deal design not only failed to deliver any meaningful benefit, it increased suppliers’ costs – and therefore energy bills – in meeting their obligations through the ECO scheme. The department now needs to be more realistic about consumers’ and suppliers’ motivations when designing schemes in future to ensure it achieves its aims.”
 Lisa Nandy, the shadow energy secretary, said: “This damning report shows it isn’t just the energy companies who are short-changing their customers, it’s the Tories too. Investment in energy saving should be a national priority but these schemes are so badly designed they are ripping people off and failing to target those families who need help the most.”
A spokeswoman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: “The government is clear about the need to have firm financial controls in place to protect consumers, which is why we took action last July to address the issues in this report – stopping funding to the Green Deal Finance Company and setting up an independent review of the energy efficiency sector. 
“We are now designing a new scheme that will help make even more homes warmer and bring people’s bills down.”"

A game for the sort of mug who could, right now, be looking forward to receipt of a squidrillion dollars in return for handing over their bank details to someone they just met over email. 
Earlier this week, it turned out one of America’s most prominent and active deniers of the dangers of climate change was no mug when it came to putting some money on the table.
Marc Morano, of the conservative think tank the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), had turned down two bets on global warming worth $20,000.
The bets were an offering from TV science pundit and commentator Bill Nye, whose name is rarely written without his rhyming epithet “the science guy”.
Nye offered to bet Morano that the current year, 2016, would be among the ten hottest ever recorded using conventional observations. The second was that the current decade would be the warmest on record. 
Morano said the bets were “silly” and that it was “obvious” he would lose. 
In an email to me, Morano further said the hottest year on record, 2015, was “barely a tenth of a degree” above the previous record (which happens to have been 2014). He also suggested that official figures from US government agencies had been “adjusted”. 
Morano is busy promoting a new “sceptical” film called Climate Hustle, which he “premiered” in Paris while global climate talks were taking place across the city. 
Morano’s CFACT is part of the network of conservative think tanks in the U.S that work to manufacture doubt and scorn over the science of human-caused climate change.
On a panel on Capitol Hill this week, Morano will show parts of his interview with Nye and hold a panel discussion with other “sceptics”, including former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin who once said “climate change is to this century what Eugenics was to the last century.”
But anyway, back to that mug’s game of betting against global warming.
Back in October, a research paper was published in the Royal Society’s 350-year-old journal, Philosophical Transactions A, that looked at the prospects of bets on global warming. 
In the paper, Australian climate scientist Dr James Risbey, of the CSIRO, and colleagues looked back at global temperatures from the late 19th century to present day. 
They wanted to find out what would have happened to bets made each year that the next 15 years would be warmer than the previous 15 years.
It's quite notable that people who deny the science of climate change are unwilling to back their position with money.
They found that from about 1970 onwards, the person betting on the world getting warmer would have won. 
As the paper noted:
The fact that so few bets have actually been taken against greenhouse warming implies that the level of actual resistance to greenhouse theory by climate contrarians is not as strong as claimed. 
The analysis of betting strategies here shows that contrarians are rational insofar as they are not betting against greenhouse warming….
Bets against greenhouse warming are largely hopeless now and that is widely understood. 
In January this year, British climate science sceptic/denier/contrarian Sir Alan Rudge admitted he’d been a “mug” for betting Cambridge University’s Dr Chris Hope £1000 that 2015 would be at least 0.1C cooler than 2008. 
So what about the bets offered by Nye to Marc Morano? 
Risbey explained that bets on single years were more open to chance, because of the natural short-term variations in the climate system. 
But in the same way that climate change is best measured using longer-term records, the same goes for a bet. 
Risbey says as you get out to a decade or longer, the warming driven by the added greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will generally overwhelm any natural changes. 
That means a bet that the next decade is warmer than the previous decade is a pretty likely bet, and that is because of the role of greenhouse forcing of climate. That doesn’t mean that it can’t happen, but it is much less likely to happen in the current greenhouse era. 
Morano was wise to reject the decadal bet as he would be pretty likely to lose in betting against it.
Risbey’s paper mainly covered bets of 15-year periods, rather than just ten. So what about bets over a decade? Is it still a mug’s game?
Professor Stephan Lewandowsky, of the University of Bristol, and a co-author on the paper, has re-run the data to show how safe bets like Nye’s really are.
The chart below shows the outcome of bets placed each year from 1860 onwards that the 10-year period at the time of the bet would be warmer than the previous one. Red dots show betting on warming wins, empty circles show bets too close to call. Blues lose.
So anytime from about 1970 onwards, if you had placed a bet against the world warming in the following decade, then you’d have lost your cash. Lewandowsky concludes:
Bets are far from a triviality or merely a form of entertainment over a pint in the pub.
On the contrary, bets have been used for centuries to reveal people’s actual preferences in arenas such as economics or cognitive science. Anyone unwilling to take a financial risk on their position probably does not hold that position very strongly. It is therefore quite notable that people who deny the science of climate change are unwilling to back their position with money.
The widespread reluctance to engage in bets by people who deny climate science suggests that their public rhetoric differs from their actual knowledge, and that they know full well that any such bet would be hopeless.
 See. I said Marc Morano was no mug."

 The agency’s research guides EU policymakers, who are reviewing proposals by the European commission to tighten laws on air quality, emission limits and new vehicle authorisations following the Volkswagen emissions scandal.
 Pollution from new vehicles slipped to 119.6 grams of CO2 per kilometre, beating by 8% the EU goal of 130 grams, the Copenhagen-based EEA said in a report.
 The data mapped a steady decrease, mainly due to more energy-efficient vehicles and increasing sales of electric and hybrid vehicles.
 From 2021, the EU official emissions goals will drop to 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre.
 “If current trends continue, we will reach the target of 95 grams,” Cinzia Pastorello of the EEA said.
 She cautioned, however, that the data was based on outdated official tests that recorded emissions around 30 to 40% lower than those in real-world driving conditions. The European commission is in the process of trying to enforce stricter testing.
Greg Archer, at Transport &amp; Environment, said: “Official figures on new car CO2 emissions are hot air. Most of the measured improvement is being delivered through manipulating tests, not real-world reductions. The chasm between the reported data and reality makes today’s announcement worthless. Without a new test conducted by genuinely independent testing bodies, drivers will continue to be misled while the planet warms.”
 New cars sold in the 28-nation bloc rose 9% last year to 13.7m, in the second year of more positive figures for carmakers following a slump in sales during the recession from a peak of 15.5m in 2007.
 Although hybrid and electric vehicles account for just 1.3% of all new EU car sales, EEA data shows, the number of pure battery-electric vehicles registered last year increased by 50% to 57,000, compared to a year earlier.
 The defeat device software Volkswagen used to cheat on emissions test was to conceal toxic nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel vehicles, which continue to account for more than half of all cars sold in the EU, according to the EEA.
 Although not illegal, altering CO2 emissions in cars can be achieved via a variety of engineering techniques to reduce fuel consumption such as switching off air conditioning, pumping up tyre pressure or improving aerodynamics by removing mirrors and taping up doors. "

Climate Ready shut in March, just before the Easter break, and no replacement service appears to be planned.
The service helped many small businesses that had been flooded last winter.
Climate Ready also supported the Local Government Association’s (LGA) Climate Local programme which supported and encouraged local authorities to make a formal commitment to take action on climate change and to report on their progress. Since its launch in 2012, 96 English councils have signed up.
It was coordinated by an EA employee, seconded to the LGA, but this person has now returned to the EA.
Mike Peverill, director of the NGO Climate UK which worked with the EA on Climate Local, said it was very disappointed to see the service come to an end.
“These voluntary commitments and support programmes have been a really important mechanism over the last decade for enlightened local authorities to demonstrate public community leadership,” he said.
The EA told ENDS that Climate Ready was designed to deliver objectives in the National Adaptation Programme and was supposed to last for three years, but had been extended for a further year until March 2016.
An EA spokesperson said: “The Environment Agency remains committed to the need to adapt to a changing climate and will continue to drive resilience and action. Climate Ready was always designed as a time limited programme to enable organisations to understand their climate risk and take action to reduce it.”
Defra said it would continue to ensure that it had the best possible plans in place for flood prevention and protection across the whole country.
“The first National Adaptation Programme sets out more than 370 actions to help the UK better prepare for climate change - we continue to deliver on these actions and make sure adaptation is integrated across government policy making,” it said.
The service cost approximately £6m over four years. The EA said that no jobs would be lost as a result of the closure.
The EA has also had to shoulder cuts to vital flood defence research."

The special report, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), will assess all the available peer-reviewed science along with other special reports on how land and oceans are being affected by climate change. These will look at the melting of ice in polar and mountain regions, as well as the impact of climate change on cities and food supplies.
“We now have a roadmap for the next comprehensive assessment which will be published in 2022, in good time for the global stocktake by governments in 2023,” said Hoesung Lee, chair of the panel, in Nairobi.
The 1.5C report was requested by governments meeting at the Paris climate talks in December where countries unexpectedly agreed to “pursue efforts” to limit warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. 1.5C marks the point, say many scientists, where there is a real danger of serious “tipping points” in the world’s climate. Temperatures have already risen 1C and show little sign of slowing. 
“Before the Paris meeting governments were focussing on [a rise of ] 2C. The latest assessment by the IPCC showed that some serious risks to corals and sea-level rise emerge at 1.5C. But there was not much available [science] on these topics. There is a lot we need to find out about 1.5C. We are ready to embark on this,” said Lee.
“Limiting warming to 1.5C will be a significant challenge,” said Myles Allen, Professor of Geosystem Science at Oxford university’s Environmental Change Institute (ECI). 
“In a nutshell, it means we have to reduce emissions twice as fast as we would have done to limit warming to 2C – and that was already looking challenging. Inevitably, people are already starting to ask if it is worth it. These are big tough questions, and we haven’t much time to answer them, so the academic community needs to step up.”
The University of Oxford will host a major 1.5C conference later this year to bring together climate experts, researchers, policymakers, businesses and members of civil society from around the world. 
The IPCC meeting in Nairobi comes ahead of next week’s UN meeting in New York when 130 countries will sign the Paris agreement. “It will be the biggest number of countries ever to have signed an international agreement. It will be ratified when countries that account for at least 55% of global emissions countries have signed,” said a spokesman for the IPCC. 
The IPCC is responsible for providing governments with authoritative overviews of the latest climate science. Every seven years it produces a “synthesis” report which sums up the scientific knowledge on climate change – the most recent one warned global warming would have “severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts”.

The analysis, for the Climate Institute, recommends implementing a carbon price and regulations to phase out coal-fired generators, and additional subsidies to encourage clean energy investment.
It comes as both major parties are promising post-election reviews to determine the details of their policies in a bid to avoid the kind of bitter battle over power prices that paralysed recent climate policy debates.
The analysis finds that whichever party wins government will need to impose some form of relatively low carbon price, as well as regulations and subsidies to force a change to clean electricity generation.
A “modest” carbon price of about $17/tonne in 2020, rising to $40/tonne in 2030, would come close to meeting the Turnbull government’s target of reducing emissions by 26% to 28% of 2005 levels by 2030. However, it would do almost nothing to shift to clean electricity generation.
There would need to be a huge disruption in the market and economic activity in 2030 to suddenly accelerate emission reductions enough to reach the Paris goal of zero net emissions by mid century.
In order to reach that goal using a carbon price alone, the price would need to start at $70/tonne and rise to $100/tonne, which, the report concludes, is politically unlikely.
If coal-fired generators were also phased out after a 45-year lifespan and some kind of subsidy offered – like the current renewable energy target to achieve 50% zero emissions generation by 2030 – then the necessary emission reductions could be achieved without a sudden economic shock. Adding energy efficiency policies to the mix would significantly lower the impact on power prices.
Labor has promised an emissions trading scheme as part of the climate policy it will take to an election but will not announce the details. It is expected to hold a post-election inquiry into the electricity industry and the phase-out of coal-fired generators if it wins office.
The Coalition will review its Direct Action climate policy next year and there is a widespread expectation in the business sector that it will have to tighten the baselines on its so-called safeguards mechanism in a way that could eventually turn it into a baseline and credit-style emissions trading scheme. 
The report argues that these reviews are critical because if changes aren’t made now, it becomes almost impossible to reach net zero emissions by mid century – as is necessary to meet the global goal of keeping temperature rises within 2C.
“The next 18 months are pivotal to our climate and energy future, whoever wins the election,” said the Climate Institute’s executive director, John Connor.
“Our research shows that a policy package that actively supports both clean energy investment and the orderly replacement of our ageing coal-fired power stations can better manage a timely transition to a cleaner energy supply.
“A baseline and credit, or emissions trading scheme alone, will not be strong or reliable enough to drive the change.”
The report found retail power prices would gradually rise between 2020 and 2030 under the recommended scenarios but there is a high degree of uncertainty around the forecasts.
The Climate Institute modelling was commissioned from Jacobs and was part-funded by a cross section of the electricity industry, including GE, AGL and Hydro Tasmania.
The independent Climate Change Authority is undertaking similar modelling for the government."

Is it possible that the elusive ‘decoupling’ of emissions and economic growth could be happening?";"The statistic is startling. In the past two years, the global economy has grown by 6.5 percent, but carbon dioxide emissions from energy generation and transport have not grown at all, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported last month. CO2 emissions in Europe, the United States, and — most stunningly — China have been falling. What is going on?
These numbers raise a key question of huge importance if nations are to avoid the worst effects of climate change: Is the world on a path toward “decoupling” economic activity from carbon dioxide emissions? 
Put another way: Is the idea of a future of “green growth,” with prosperity rising and emissions falling, real? Or as some fear, is it a dangerous myth? 
When the United Nations holds an official signing ceremony for the Paris climate agreement on April 22, the hope is this high-profile event will ensure political momentum for meeting the Paris pledge to halt global warming at “well below” two degrees Celsius. But even climate scientists elated by the Paris agreement agree that, even with political will, the task will be extremely tough. Many are unsure whether to be optimists, keen to show the job can be done, or pessimists, determined to ensure nobody thinks it will be easy. 
In its analysis last month, the IEA, a body linked with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), reported that global CO2 emissions from energy-related activities have not risen since 2013, staying at 32.1 billion tons even as the global economy grew. 
This surprising “decoupling” of emissions from economic activity was led by the two largest emitters, China and the U.S., which both registered declines in emissions of about 1.5 percent. 
The IEA finding followed a similar conclusion about global emissions from an international team of climate scientists, headed by Corinne le Quere of the University of East Anglia in England, reported during the Paris climate conference last December. 
A good part of the decoupling, both studies agree, is attributable to China. Its turnaround has been “quite remarkable,” says Fergus Green, an analyst of China’s energy policy at the London School of Economics. The country’s coal use grew annually by more than 8 percent between 2000 and 2013, and that growth was the biggest single cause of rising global CO2 emissions. As recently as 2011, China got 80 percent of its electricity from coal.
But growing concern about killer smogs has triggered new controls that mean many coal-burning power plants in China have now been mothballed. Coal burning fell by 3 percent in 2015, by which time the percentage of China’s electricity produced by coal had fallen to 70 percent, according to the IEA. 
Chinese emissions from oil and gas burning continue to grow, Green says. But that is more than counterbalanced by a combination of declining use of coal and reductions in energy demand from structural changes in the Chinese economy, with energy-guzzling heavy industries like cement and steel production both now declining. 
Per head of population, Chinese emissions exceed those of Europe, even though average income is less than a half that of citizens of the European Union. But China seems set on the road to climate redemption. In Paris, Beijing pledged to peak emissions by 2030. In fact, it may already have done so, says Green. And even if not, he foresees only small increases from now on. 
China is following a road already taken by more economically developed nations. The carbon intensity of high-income OECD countries has more than halved since 1970, meaning half as much CO2 is now emitted for every dollar of GDP. 
Lately, things have gone further. U.S. emissions have been falling for more than half a decade now, as coal burning is replaced by fracked natural gas and wind power. The United States has become 28 percent richer, but 6 percent cleaner since 2000, says Nate Aden of the World Resources Institute, who reported that, since 2000, 21 countries — all in Europe, except the U.S. and Uzbekistan — have reduced their carbon emissions while growing GDP. 
Britain, for instance, grew its economy by 27 percent while cutting emissions by 20 percent between 2000 and 2014. 
Part of this national decoupling is a result of advanced economies offshoring heavy industry to places like China, says Aden, with most of the “decouplers” having reduced the industrial share of their economic activity. But this is a minor element, he believes. These 21 nations show an average emissions reduction of 15 percent, but cuts in the industrial share of GDP are just 3 percent.
That said, clearly not all countries are decoupling. Emissions continue to rise in much of Asia and the Middle East. From Turkey to India, enthusiasm for coal remains strong. India has plans to double its already large coal production, which the Delhi government justifies by pointing out that its per-capita emissions remain only one-tenth of those of the U.S. But optimists note that, despite the bluster, India also has big plans for expanding solar energy production. 
It is far from clear, says the University of East Anglia’s le Quere, that the world has yet reached peak emissions of CO2 from energy sources — still less that this translates into a peak in greenhouse gas emissions overall. But with the three largest emitters — China, the U.S., and the European Union — all showing evidence of decoupling, the signs are suddenly rather encouraging. 
The first hint that decoupling was under way came four years ago, when a report from the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency and the European Commission’s Joint Research Center (JRC) found that in 2012,CO2 emissions rose just 1.1 percent globally, while GDP rose 3.5 percent. Greet Janssens-Maenhout of the JRC says now: “There has been continuous and increasing decoupling over the past four years.”
There is no modern precedent. Global CO2 emissions growth briefly faltered in the early 1980s, in 1992, and again in 2009; but in each case this was due to a decline in economic activity. 
The biggest cause of decoupling is the dramatic growth of renewable energy. Last year, more than twice as much money was put into new capacity for renewables such as solar and wind power than into new power stations burning fossil fuels, according to a new analysis by the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management. For the first time, the majority of this investment was in developing countries, with China responsible for 36 percent of the total. 
The reason has as much to do with price as climate policies. The cost of photovoltaic equipment, much of it manufactured in China, has fallen by 80 percent in the past decade. As a result, auctions for solar power in Texashave recently seen prices as low as 4 cents per kilowatt hour, which is below the price of most coal-generated energy. 
Renewables still only deliver about 10 percent of the total electricity generated worldwide. Even so, Ulf Moslener, a coauthor of the Frankfurt report, said recent investment in green energy has cut annual CO2 emissions from all energy sources, including transport, by about 1.5 billion tons, or 5 percent, from where they would otherwise be. 
The growth of renewables is being accompanied by a sharp decline in coal burning, not only in China, but in the U.S. and elsewhere. Canadian climate blogger Kyla Mandel recently noted that a quarter of European Union countries no longer burn any coal for power generation. 
This process is being amplified by a flight of capital, as investors fear that expensive coal mines and coal-burning power plants may become “stranded assets,” with no markets, as renewables ramp up and limits on CO2 emissions begin to bite. The coal industry has been hit hard, with the largest U.S. coal company, Peabody Energy, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection just this week.
This concern is likely to spread to other fossil fuels, says British energy analyst and former Greenpeace science director Jeremy Leggett. Current low oil prices may encourage oil burning and could postpone the market penetration of, for instance, electric cars. But low prices also discourage investment in new oil fields. As Leggett put it in a recent blog: “Most fossil fuel companies face a future in which they might not have the capital to expand even if they still want to.” 
But there are countervailing trends. The IEA’s emissions audit does not cover all CO2 emissions. Deforestation for the past half century has been a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, although that too now appears to be declining. More worrying — because they are still increasing fast but were left out of the Paris agreement — are emissions from international aviation and shipping. 
Expansion plans for the aviation industry could lead to emissions from this source tripling by 2040, says Annie Petsonk of the Environmental Defense Fund. Once these are taken into account, “the decoupling claimed for many nations disappears altogether,” says Kevin Anderson of the University of Manchester in England. 
The aviation industry may reach agreement later this year on plans to offset its emissions by investing in United Nations schemes for forest conservation.
But some environmentalists are concerned that the industry will simply be funding projects already promised by governments as part of their plans to meet their Paris pledges. If so, there will be no additional benefit to the planet.
There are growing concerns too about trends for some other greenhouse gases — in particular, the second most-important man-made planet warmer, methane, the main constituent of natural gas. When burned, natural gas produces energy with fewer CO2 emissions than coal. But if distribution systems leak significant amounts of gas, the warming effect of that methane could negate the benefit of switching off coal. 
“Methane numbers may undermine the basic thesis [of decoupling],” says climate activist Bill McKibben, who recently wrote in The Nation that U.S. emissions of methane — “CO2’s nasty little brother” — have increased by more than 30 percent. In the article, McKibben pinpointed leakage from fracking as the likely cause. 
This is a damaging failure of regulation, but at least it is fixable, at relatively low cost, according to studies by the United Nations Environment Programme. And while methane is a potent greenhouse gas, its lifetime in the atmosphere is roughly a decade, so we won’t be living with the consequences for nearly as long as those from CO2 emissions. 
Even if global emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases can be curbed, however, this won’t fix climate change, say critics of the decoupling narrative. The big problem is that warming is driven not by annual emissions but by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And while methane may disappear relatively quickly, CO2 hangs around for centuries. 
Last year, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million (ppm) for the first time. According to the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, keeping global warming below two degrees probably requires keeping this figure below about 450 ppm. That means emitting in total no more than about 800 billion tons of CO2 from all sources — or less than 20 years worth at current rates. In practice, emissions have to be brought down to zero by mid-century.
“Set against the small and rapidly dwindling carbon [emissions] budgets associated with the Paris Agreement… the tentative signs of decoupling are of little relevance,” says Anderson, of Manchester University, an avowed pessimist. “The concept of green growth is very misleading.”
Others are more optimistic. Even if decoupling cannot limit warming to two degrees, it could deliver three or four degrees, after which the world might find ways to draw down CO2 from the atmosphere. But all agree the bottom line is that, as le Quere puts it, “we need to bring emissions down to zero. The faster we decrease the emissions, the less risk we take.”
Decoupling is real, but it is just the start. "

And they’ll soon be able to get an estimate of how much climate change will affect their property prices and insurance premiums, too.
Launched on Friday, the website Coastal Risk Australia takes Google Maps and combines it with detailed tide and elevation data, as well as future sea level rise projections, allowing users to see whether their house or suburb will be inundated.
Coinciding with that is the launch of a beta version of Climate Valuation, a website that gives users an estimate of how much climate change will impact their property value and insurance premiums over the life of their mortgage.
Coastal Risk Australia uses median sea level rises projected for 2100 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change under low, medium and high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios.
On the high emissions scenario – which is the path the world is currently on – the IPCC says sea levels will likely rise by a median of 0.74m by 2100. But a rise of almost 1m is within the “likely” range of levels that could be reached by 2100.
In every state and territory except the ACT, the website shows that houses and famous landmarks will be underwater by 2100. Beaches like Manly, Byron and Coogee in New South Wales would lose significant amounts of sand, as will Bell’s Beach in Victoria and Noosa in Queensland.

Many coastal suburbs and cities are shown to be subject to severe inundation, including Cairns, Ballina and Hindmarsh Island.


James Hansen, a former Nasa scientist who is considered the father of modern climate change awareness, recently produced research suggesting that sea levels could rise “several metres over a timescale of 50 to 150 years”.
The website also lets users see how any sea-level rise will affect an area. If sea levels rose 5m, then large parts of most coastal cities would be inundated, according to the website’s calculations.
“We don’t want to create hysteria but we don’t want people burying their heads in the sand ether,” said Nathan Eaton, one of the creators of the website from the company NGIS Australia.
The tool was adapted from work NGIS did when it created a similar tool for the Pacific Island nations of Tonga, Samoa, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea, in collaboration with the Australian Department of Environment and the Collaborative Research Centre for Spatial Information.
Climate Valuation, also launched on Friday, will, for a fee, tell users the probability of a property being flooded by rising sea levels; the projected increases in insurance premium from coastal inundation risk; and the projected percentage reduction in value of the property at the end of a mortgage.
It is being launched for use by researchers initially and will soon be available as part of a Kickstarter campaign, which the developers say will raise money to include more climate change-associated risks like bushfires and river flooding. People who pledge to contribute will get early access to it.
The developers say the site uses risk engines that are already used to assess billions of dollars of critical infrastructure in Australia and the new site will give the general public access to that data for the first time.
“We’re hoping this helps people make informed decisions about their safety and on what is often the most significant investment they will ever make – their home,” said Karl Mallon, head of the Climate Valuation Project."

Cassava, which is originally from South America, is now south-east Asia’s third largest source of calories after rice and maize. An estimated 40 million people in the area depend on the plant for their livelihoods and the crop forms the basis of a $5bn (£3.5bn) regional market in starch, which is used to make products ranging from paper to biofuel.
But researchers say the crop’s viability is now at risk as more intense dry spells and rains bring about conditions in which pests and diseases can flourish. 
Scientists who gathered data from more than 400 sites across the region found symptoms of witches’ broom disease or mealybug in at least two-thirds of the cassava fields they studied. 
The former, which has already reached the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand, causes leaves to discolour and bunch into a shape resembling a witch’s broomstick.
The latter, which menaced crops in Africa after it was accidentally introduced from South America in the 1970s, destroys yields by leeching essential nutrients from the plant. The bug is now moving into parts of Indonesia where cassava is central to food security.
“Our data suggests that a number of factors have triggered an explosion in pests and diseases in south-east Asia’s cassava fields, including globalisation, climate variability and the changing frequency of droughts,” said Dr Kris Wyckhuys, an entomologist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (Ciat). 
“We also found that some pests and diseases are far bigger problems than we previously thought, and alarmingly, they’ve already spread further than we thought.”
The study, published in Pest Management Science, says that while infestation levels vary from country to country, urgent action is needed to tackle witches’ broom disease in Cambodia and central Vietnam, and mealybug in Indonesia. 
The authors call for a rethink of crop management practices – which are exacerbating the problems and undermining cassava’s ability to withstand new threats – and suggest that biological control methods, such as insect “enemies”, be used to contain the outbreaks.
“What we’re aiming for is practical, environmentally and economically sustainable options for farmers, so they don’t need to spend much money but get long-term results,” said Dr Ignazio Graziosi, a Ciat research fellow specialising in invasive species ecology.
Two years ago, scientists began deploying tiny, parasitic wasps to control mealybugs in Vietnam and Indonesia. The minute insects lay their eggs in the bugs; the hatching larvae then consume their hosts from the inside, mummifying and killing them. Despite success in some areas, however, researchers noticed that mealybugs appeared to gain the upper hand over the interlopers in regions with prolonged drought and low soil fertility.
Dr Aunu Rauf, professor of agricultural entomology at Indonesia’s Bogor agricultural university, said the study had laid bare the scale of the threat the mealybugs pose to poor farmers in Indonesia. 
“Because the pest is from a foreign country, there is no natural enemy, so it multiplies quickly,” he said.
“We’ve already planted the seed for long-term control not only for cassava mealybug, but for other invasive pests in the region. What we need right now is financial and technical support to roll out a major biological control response programme throughout the region, including equipment for diagnosis, detection and quarantine of emerging threats.”"

Recent research is helping to track energy flows between the ocean waters and the atmosphere as the El Niño builds, then slowly decays and even changes to a La Niña. This new information is an important advancement of our understanding of the Earth’s climate.
As a background, a part of the Pacific Ocean flips between cold (La Niña) and warm (El Niño) phases over a few-year-long period. Sometimes the oceans are in neither a cold or warm phase, and we call that neutral.
The flipping back and forth always occurs, but the duration and regularity can change. In general, the cycles occur over 3 to 7 years, sometimes with longer duration, other times shorter. But regardless, this El Niño/La Niña process is really important for the rest of the world. It affects the whole atmosphere through what are termed teleconnections. 
Consider for instance a situation when the waters are warm (El Niño), resulting in more evaporation from the ocean waters into the atmosphere. Conversely when the ocean waters are cold, there is often less evaporation. Because evaporation requires a great deal of thermal energy – it cools the ocean while moistening the atmosphere – it’s an engine that moves heat. 
Simply put, the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO; the latter is in the atmosphere) cycle can supercharge this movement of energy, or it can temporarily sequester the heat. But regardless, once the energy gets into the atmosphere, it changes the atmospheric winds around the globe and affects weather elsewhere.
So, a new study, led by Dr. Michael Mayer from the University of Vienna, focused on the energy flows during the ENSO process. The study recalls prior work that has led to a view of ENSO that is a bit like a rechargeable battery. During La Niña, heat builds up in the Pacific and then during El Niño, the heat is dissipated to other regions. The dissipation occurs in both laterally via atmospheric energy transports and vertically via radiation to space. When the warm water moistens the air (through evaporation), it invigorates storms and flow of energy in the atmosphere. As a result of these teleconnections, a substantial fraction of the heat released from the Pacific during El Niño subsequently appears in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. 
The authors also looked at climate models, which are computerized representations of actual processes occurring in the real world. They wanted to know how well models reproduce the energy flows associated with ENSO. Traditionally, models have struggled to correctly simulate ENSO. The authors found that models tend to underestimate the ENSO processes in the upper 700 meters of the Pacific. While observations show substantial cooling of the tropical Pacific during El Niño as measured by ocean heat content, most models lack this typical signature. 
This is related to biases in simulated low-level clouds, which in turn influence the amount of absorbed solar radiation. In addition, the authors found that models in general struggle to get the winds associated with ENSO correct, which hampers their ability to correctly simulate vertical redistribution of heat within the Pacific. Moreover, the models underestimate the strength of teleconnections to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.
While models continue to get better, their current errors have to be considered when using them, and further improvements are necessary. But practice makes perfect and studies like this advance their capabilities. Such improvements are essential if we are to better understand the intersection of El Niño and climate change, and where and how extreme weather events occur.
I communicated with Dr. Mayer and he told me, 
First, it is important to distinguish between the different oceans. The buildup and release of oceanic heat during La Niña and El Niño mainly occurs in the tropical Pacific. What is happening in the other basins during warm and cold ENSO events tends to be of opposite sign. This means that oceanic heat is released from the Pacific during El Niño while ocean heat content increases in the tropical Atlantic and Indian Ocean at the same time. The opposite tends to be the case during La Niña. This “seesawing” of oceanic energy between the different ocean basins is a result of the atmospheric teleconnections we describe. Besides this energy exchange between the different ocean basins there is also considerable radiative heat loss to space during El Niño. In the paper we checked whether the CMIP models replicate these pathways of anomalous energy flows.
We found that the models underestimate the ocean heat content variations in the Pacific associated with ENSO and they also underestimate the strength of teleconnections to the other basins as measured by ocean heat content variations in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. One reason of the found deficiencies in modeled ENSO are biases in the climatological mean states of the models, which adversely affects simulated variability of energy flows.
Getting ENSO correct is important not only because it impacts society. It is superimposed on a long-term human-caused climate change. As we warm the planet from our emission of heat trapping gases, the ENSO fluctuations occur on top of that warming. Potentially, this can make the next ENSO cycle even more disruptive and costly."

The move was seen as a sign of the growing influence investors wield in the fight against climate change.
In June 2015, the Scandinavian country’s parliament agreed to pull the fund out of mining or energy groups which derive more than 30% of their sales or activities from the coal business.
The new directive went into effect on 1 February.
The fund, fuelled by Norway’s state oil revenues and currently worth around 7.11tn trillion kroner (£610bn, $864bn), has banned 52 companies, most of them US and Chinese, including China Coal Energy, AES, and Peabody Energy, the biggest US coal producer which filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday.
The list also includes several Indian companies, such as Reliance Power and Tata Power, three Japanese groups and several European companies.
“Further exclusions will follow in 2016,” the central bank, which manages the fund, said in a statement.
Thursday’s announcement was hailed by environmentalists.
“It’s an important first step,” Martin Norman, the head of Greenpeace Norway, told AFP.
“The road ahead remains long though,” he added, noting that his organisation had a while ago counted 122 companies the fund needed to bar to be in line with the new directive.
The world’s three biggest coalmakers – Anglo American, BHP Billiton and Glencore – are not affected by the new rules because their other mining activities are so massive that their coal businesses represent less than 30% of their overall revenues.
But Norman said he hoped they would soon be excluded because of another criteria adopted last year, which prohibits the fund from investing in groups that produce “unacceptable levels” of greenhouse gas emissions. 
“It’s a good start,” added Marius Holm, the head of the environmental group Zero.
“But the fund still holds stakes in coal-related companies, and its exposure to oil and gas also needs to be discussed,” he said. 
The fund’s investment policy is run according to strict ethical rules, with a focus on sustainable economic, environmental and social development.
Those rules bar it from investing in companies accused of serious violations of human rights, child labour or serious environmental damage, as well as manufacturers of “particularly inhumane” arms, and also tobacco firms.

But that was where hardcore climate change denial landed Palin on Thursday: a wood-panelled committee room in Congress where she disputed the credentials of a hugely popular science educator who has designed devices for Nasa and been awarded several honorary degrees.
“Bill Nye is as much a scientist as I am,” Palin told the gathering. “He’s a kids’ show actor. He’s not a scientist.”
And that was not even the low point of the event.
The occasion was the premiere for the Climate Hustle, a film that dismisses global warming as an excuse for government takeover and makes the outrageously false claim that rising carbon emissions are beneficial.
But the real mission for Palin and the makers of the movie – in addition to airing various conspiracy theories – was to register the continued existence of a small but still powerful fringe, even as the rest of the world accelerates its efforts to fight climate change.
On a day when the World Bank president and ministers from Canada, France and Morocco urged governments to step up their commitments to fight climate change, there was a strong whiff of desperation to Palin’s efforts.
At the United Nations next week more than 130 leaders are expected to attend the formal signing of the Paris agreement, a symbolic show of support for cutting climate pollution.
 The event in Congress was hosted by Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who chairs the House committee on science, space and technology. He did not appear but his prepared remarks accused government scientific agencies of fiddling with climate data.
Outside Republicans in Congress and the Republican presidential race, the world is moving on. A record number of Americans see climate change as a serious threat. 
Palin and other speakers made plain they felt increasingly isolated, complaining of “group think” and “peer pressure”, and warning of government takeovers, “energy police” confiscating microwaves and plasma TVs, and brainwashing school children.
The former vice-presidential nominee admitted she did not believe scientists about anything any more – and appealed to presidential contenders to intervene, somehow.
“The science is kind of getting thrown out of the window in discussions about changes in the weather,” Palin said. “It’s something that our candidates should be talking about and giving us their view on and hopefully acknowledging that it needs to become in the science community less political. Otherwise, it leads us to believe that so many things then coming from the scientists could be bogus. If this is bogus, what else are they trying to tell us and control us around?”
To Palin’s mind, efforts by government, business leaders, campaigners – and yes, scientists like Nye – to fight climate change were a mere smokescreen for a huge power grab. She did not say by whom.
Nye’s efforts to educate the public about climate change – and counter the disinformation campaigns funded by corporations and conservative groups – has become a target of Palin and others who claim “extreme doubt” about climate change.
Among the majority of Americans, however, Nye is respected for his efforts to promote scientific literacy, through his educational television series and a not-for-profit group that encourages critical investigation. He has also worked as a visiting professor at Cornell and an executive at the Planetary Society.
“There is a predetermined agenda definitely of those who I think are controlling the narrative right now on changes in the weather,” Palin said. “There is definitely a political agenda behind all of this and as you suggested people who are involved in this issue they are not stupid. They have studied this stuff. They have studied the data that they are erroneously delivering to the public to make us think that we can somehow change the weather and how they do that is to grow government and allow the government to have more control over us, our homes, our businesses, our families, our lives, and it’s quite unfortunate because these people must be purposely doing this, right? Because they are smart enough to know better.”
Parents should be vigilant against attempts at mind control, Palin said. “We need to keep in mind how important it is for parents to understand this issue and to understand the political agenda behind global warming. It is being used as a fundraiser, it is being used as a partisan issue unfortunately so that parents can be first and foremost in their child’s life and influence them to trust science and believe in science and not leave it to the teachers.” 
With proper training – of the sort Palin said she received growing up at home with a schoolteacher for a father – children could then go on to take on figures such as Nye. Just like she did."

February was far above the long-term average globally, driven largely by climate change, and was described by scientists as a “shocker” and signalling “a kind of climate emergency”. But data released by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) shows that March was even hotter.
Compared with the 20th-century average, March was 1.07C hotter across the globe, according to the JMA figures, while February was 1.04C higher. The JMA measurements go back to 1891 and show that every one of the past 11 months has been the hottest ever recorded for that month. 
Data released released later on Friday by Nasa confirmed last month was the hottest March on record, but the US agency’s data indicated February had seen the biggest margin. The Nasa data recorded March as 1.28C above the average from 1951-1980, while February was 1.34C higher.
The World Meteorological Organisation, the UN body for climate and weather, said the March data had “smashed” previous records.
JMA: Global temp records smashed (again) in March, 1.07°C above 20th C avg https://t.co/erhOM82T0X #climateaction pic.twitter.com/uR0GpMTd6Q
Climate change is usually assessed over years and decades, but even scientists have been struck by the recent unprecedented temperatures. Furthermore, annual heat records have been also tumbling, with 2015 demolishing the record set in 2014 for the hottest year seen, in data stretching back to 1850.
The UK Met Office expects 2016 to set a new record, meaning the global temperature record is set to have been broken for three years in a row.
Prof Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University in the US, responded to the March data by saying: “Wow. I continue to be shocked by what we are seeing.” He said the world had now been hovering close to the threshold of “dangerous” warming for two months, something not seen before.
“The [new data] is a reminder of how perilously close we now are to permanently crossing into dangerous territory,” Mann said. “It underscores the urgency of reducing global carbon emissions.”
The Met Office, along with the US agencies Nasa and Noaa, keep the most-used global temperature records and will release their assessment of March temperatures later this month. But the JMA records have shown the same trends as these in the past.
The UN climate summit in Paris in December confirmed 2C as the danger limit for global warming which should not be passed. But it also agreed agreed to “pursue efforts” to limit warming to 1.5C, a target now looking highly optimistic.
A major El Niño weather event, the biggest since 1998, is boosting global temperatures. But scientists are agreed that global warming driven by humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions is the largest factor in the astonishing run of temperature records.
“While the current spike in global temperatures is getting a boost from El Niño, most of this anomalous warmth is a result of the ongoing human-caused global warming trend,” said Professor Stefan Rahmstorf, a climate scientist at Potsdam University in Germany.
Prof Adam Scaife, at the UK Met Office, said the run of record temperatures was set to continue, but that records would be less likely in 2017 as the impact of El Niño waned. 
“While the El Nino is now decaying, it’s impact on global temperature tends to peak a few months later due to a delayed effect on the rest of the world’s oceans. This means that there is a high risk of record global temperatures over the next few months,” Scaife said. “Global temperatures are expected to continue to rise in future decades due to climate change, but El Niño may well [end] later this year, reducing the chance of record temperatures in 2017.”
The impact of the heat has been seen around the world and at the end of March scientists announced that the winter peak of the Arctic ice cap was the smallest ever recorded on records going back to 1979.
Note: The first version of this story linked to Nasa’s data for land only, which shows March was 1.65C above the average from 1951-1980, while February was 1.71C higher. The current version links to data for land and ocean surface temperatures, a better global average."

Join an expert panel from 3-5pm BST on 21 April to discuss";"At a historic ceremony on 22 April, more than 130 countries will formally commit to the Paris climate agreement to keep global warming below 2C.
But in order for policymakers to take decisive steps, the general public in countries around the world need to be fully behind taking action to stop climate change. Article 12 of the Paris Agreement specifically requires governments to “enhance climate change education, training, public awareness, public participation and public access to information”.
Science has convinced us it’s happening, but now filmmakers, artists, TV producers, advertisers and other creative industries are needed to communicate what’s at stake. The power of one image to say more than thousands of words was demonstrated when a photograph from Spanish artist Isaac Cordell’s Follow the Leaders series went viral with the caption “politicians discussing global warming”. 
Public awareness about climate change varies around the world. “Overall, people in countries with high levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per capita tend to express less anxiety about climate change than those in nations with lower per-capita emissions,” reports Pew Global. 
However in some developing countries public awareness is low. According to Pew, less than 35% of people believe that climate change is harming people around the world now in Indonesia, Pakistan, Ethiopia and South Africa. 
So how can creative industries be effectively engaged to raise public awareness of climate change in countries around in the world? How can they reach those who are most resistant to accepting the reality of the situation? And how can they use creativity to challenge potential public fatigue with the subject?
Join an expert panel on Thursday 21 April 3-5pm BST, to discuss these questions and more.

But experts warn the rogue practice of removing the filters, which contributes to air pollution-related deaths, could be far more widespread.
Almost 29,000 people die prematurely each year in the UK owing to particle pollution, causing £15bn in health costs. Since 2009 diesel particulate filters (DPFs) have been compulsory in new diesel cars. But, particularly for cars driven in cities, the DPFs can become clogged and cause breakdowns.
Replacing DPFs usually costs more than a £1,000 and, as a result, many garages across the country offer to remove the filter completely for a few hundred pounds. Removing the filter is not illegal, but driving a car without a DPF is an offence and particle emissions from the exhaust pipe are likely to soar fivefold as a result.
In 2014, ministers said the “unacceptable” practice was “clearly detrimental to people’s health” and introduced a visual check into the MOT. This has caught 1,188 vehicles so far, according to figures given to the Guardian by the Department for Transport (DfT). 
However, many garages offer to circumvent the visual check by, for example, by “discreetly cutting a small window in the top of the chamber, removing the internal filter before rewelding the window and refitting to the vehicle. This way the vehicle still appears to have a DPF fitted and … will have no affect on your MOT.” Garages also claim removing the DPF will increase power and fuel efficiency, with one promising “your engine will breathe again”.
 Simon Birkett, director of Clean Air in London (CAL), said: “The thought of raw and carcinogenic diesel exhaust being spewed on to our high streets is terrifying. The diesel catastrophe, worsened by DPF removal, will affect the health of everyone in the UK.”
He added: “CAL estimates that tens of thousands and more likely hundreds of thousands of diesel vehicles have been tampered with in this way. As more and more vehicles come out of warranty and parts wear out, this problem will grow.”
Dave Garratt, chief executive at the Garage Equipment Association, said: “[DPF removal] has been going on for a long time and it is probably getting progressively worse. The biggest hole in the MOT is that they don’t really check it. [Visual inspection] does not actually tell you if there is a core in the canister. I’d guess there are a lot more out there.”
One garage owner, who has now stopped removing DPFs and did not want to be named, said: “We were inundated with vehicles with DPF problems. Removal was the quick fix.”
The roads minister, Andrew Jones, said: “We are fully committed to improving air quality and the new figures are proof that our common-sense changes to the MOT test are helping get hundreds of polluting vehicles off the road. We continue to tackle harmful vehicle emissions and are investigating ways to use the latest technology to further improve detection methods.”
The DfT has commissioned research on how existing or new technology can be used to detect DPF removal by measuring exhaust fumes. One possibility is adapting the use of the equipment that performs the current MOT smoke test to make it more sensitive. The findings may be implemented as part of changes to the Roadworthiness Directive, which sets the framework for MOT testing, and is scheduled to be introduced in the UK in 2017-18.
However, ministers face calls for more urgent action. “It is such a clear cut issue,” said Patrick Streeter, an elected councillor in the City of London Corporation, who has taken up the issue with the police. “They have to get out there and arrest these people. They need to raid the garages to collect the registration numbers [of the cars that have had DPF removed]. The pollution is absolutely terrible.”
Cleaning the DPF is possible and usually costs less than replacement but more than removal. Ceramex is one company offering the service and its managing director, Rob Rule, said DPF removal was undercutting action by politicians and car makers to improve the UK’s poor air quality.
“It drives me absolutely bonkers,” he said. “Not only is it immoral and illegal, you are undermining so much cost and effort that is going into cleaning up the environment. It is antisocial.”
Rule backed calls for a further crackdown on DPF removal, saying: “If there is one thing that could improve air quality in [cities], it would be to send the police to garages to tell them they are committing a criminal act, then go back if they don’t change their act.”
In October, police in Spain raided a string of garages which were allegedly performing DPF removal, while in the US in 2013, a company agreed to pay a $500,000 (£350,000) fine for DPF-related violations.
Birkett said: “The UK government must outlaw the removal of DPFs, modernise and mandate the testing of exhaust emissions during the MOT and introduce random on-road testing.” Spot checks used to take place in the UK but were stopped in 2011, with the government saying they had unearthed only two problems in a decade and that anti-pollution funding was better spent elsewhere.
DPF removal services are widely advertised across the UK. The Guardian contacted five garages offering the service on their websites. Two claimed their websites were out of date but did not subsequently update them. Two said managers would call back, but they did not. One said the service was offered only to off-road vehicles, though the website made no mention of this caveat.
Experts said DPF removal could invalidate car insurance if not declared and that the vehicle inspections offered by motoring organisations to prospective car buyers were visual checks only.
The notice issued to MOT testers in 2014 said: “The DPF plays an essential environmental role in enabling reductions in emissions, reducing air pollution and thereby improving health quality.”"

Hundreds of acres of maize grown in the West Country to feed large dairy herds housed in sheds allows milk to be produced slightly cheaper than from cows that eat grass.
The bare earth left by ploughing and growing crops on land that used to be grazed causes soil erosion and increased risk of flooding downstream, filling once pristine streams and rivers with silt and choking the life out of them.
The situation is made worse by changing weather patterns caused by climate change. When the soil is bare and compressed with tractor ruts, heavy bursts of rain cause soil loss on a large scale. Grassed fields soak up the water and hold the soil.
The Environment Agency and green pressure groups are trying to prevent the increasing destruction of rivers in the West Country – done in the name of efficiency, or keeping the price of milk down by a penny. The “How Much Meat” debaters argue: “If we are to rear ruminant livestock they must eat the diet they evolved to eat, i.e. grass, ideally grown on land unsuitable for crops for humans.”
All campaigners agree that regulation to protect rivers is required to stop the “free market” pressure on farmers to reduce costs at any price. Otherwise farmers and supermarkets reap the profits of their bad practices while taxpayers pick up the bill for the degraded countryside. Perhaps we are all to blame for wanting cheap milk. "

More than 150 governments, including 40 heads of state, are expected at a symbolic signing ceremony for the agreement at the United Nations on 22 April, which is Earth Day.
It’s the largest one-day signing of any international agreement, according to the UN.
But leaders will really be looking to see which countries go beyond mere ceremony and legally join the agreement, which would bind them to the promises made in Paris last December to keep warming below the agreed target of 2C.
So far, the US, China, Canada and a host of other countries have promised to join this year - boosting the hopes of bringing the Paris deal into force before the initial target date of 2020 – possibly as early as 2016 or 2017, according to officials and analysts.
That is well before the timeline originally envisaged at Paris. Environment ministers attending the World Bank spring meetings this week said the faster pace indicated serious commitment to dealing with the global challenge.
The accelerated timeline would have one obvious advantage for Barack Obama. The standard withdrawal clause on any such agreement would force a future Republican president to wait four years before quitting Paris, according to legal experts.
An earlier start date could also turbo-charge the agreement, providing momentum for deeper emissions cuts. 
It could also help efforts to attain the more ambitious goal of limiting warming to 1.5C – which would give a better chance of survival to small islands and other countries on the frontlines of climate change.
Christiana Figueres, who heads the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, has said global emissions need to peak by 2020 to have any chance of limiting warming to 1.5C. There has already been about 1C warming above pre-industrial levels.
“Early entry into force – we are very committed to making that happen,” Catherine McKenna, Canada’s environment and climate change minister, told a panel at the World Bank last week. “We can’t just now rest on our laurels and have a nice signing on Earth Day, and then we all go home.”
She told The Guardian Canada was committed to signing the agreement this year.
The push to bring the climate agreement into force quickly is in sharp contrast to the earlier international efforts to fight climate change through the Kyoto Protocol, which did not take effect for four years. 
Eliza Northrop, an analyst at the World Resources Institute, said there was growing momentum behind an early approval of the agreement.
“It’s likely it could come into effect in 2017. It could even happen this year,” she said. 
Governments at the Paris climate meeting had initially set the start date of the agreement in 2020 – with intense discussion over whether that start date should be at the start or end of the year, according to diplomats.  
The 2020 date remained in the negotiating drafts almost until the very end, the diplomats said. But unaccountably the final draft prepared by France left out the entire clause. By that point, after a few late-night negotiating sessions, a number of countries did not notice the omission. 
 The agreement, the first time all countries agreed to emissions cuts and other actions to fight climate change, aims to limit warming to below 2C and move towards a zero-carbon economy by the end of the century.
But it’s a tall order. The agreement needs to be approved by 55 countries accounting for at least 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions to come into force.
The US and China committed to join the agreement this year – but that still leaves a gap of more than 15% of global emissions.
A number of countries, including India and Japan, require their parliaments to approve the Paris agreement – a process which could take time.
The European Union will need agreement from its 28 member states before it can join the agreement – which makes it highly unlikely to be in a position to join early on.
“The assumption is that you have to do this without the EU to get to that 55% hurdle, if you want to see that in the next year or so,” said Alden Meyer, strategy director for the Union of Concerned Scientists.
That will force governments to cobble together a coalition of smaller countries if they hope to reach the 55% emissions threshold.
Possible contenders include India, Mexico, the Philippines and Australia. 
So far, about 10 countries have said they would join the agreement this year. 
On Wednesday, Román Macaya, Costa Rica’s ambassador to Washington, said his country would join the agreement in 2016. Palau, Switzerland, Fiji and the Marshall Islands have also said they will approve the agreement this year."

But overtime is deadly. If we worked less we’d make fewer errors, address inequality and have a better life";"Had you asked John Maynard Keynes what the biggest challenge of the 21st century would be, he wouldn’t have had to think twice.
Leisure. In fact, Keynes anticipated that, barring “disastrous mistakes” by policymakers (austerity during an economic crisis, for instance), the western standard of living would multiply to at least four times that of 1930 within a century. By his calculations, in 2030 we’d be working just 15 hours a week.
In 2000, countries such as the UK and the US were already five times as wealthy as in 1930. Yet as we hurtle through the first decades of the 21st century, our biggest challenges are not too much leisure and boredom, but stress and uncertainty.
What does working less actually solve, I was asked recently. I’d rather turn the question around: is there anything that working less does not solve?
Take climate change. A worldwide shift to a shorter working week could cut the CO2 emitted this century by half. Countries with a shorter working week have a smaller ecological footprint. Consuming less starts with working less – or, better yet – with consuming our prosperity in the form of leisure.
Overtime is deadly. Long working days lead to more errors: tired surgeons are more prone to slip-ups and soldiers who get too little shut-eye are more prone to miss targets. From Chernobyl to the space shuttle Challenger, overworked managers often prove to have played a role in disasters. It is no coincidence that the financial sector, which triggered the biggest disaster of the past decade, is absolutely groaning with people doing overtime.
Countless studies have shown that people who work less are more satisfied with their lives. In a recent poll conducted among working women, German researchers quantified the “perfect day”. The largest share of minutes (106) would go toward “intimate relationships”. Down at the bottom of the list were work (36) and commuting (33). The researchers noted that “in order to maximise wellbeing it is likely that working and consuming (which increases GDP) might play a smaller role in people’s daily activities compared with now”.
Obviously, you can’t simply chop a job up into smaller pieces. Nevertheless, researchers at the International Labour Organization have concluded that job sharing – in which two part-time employees split a workload traditionally assigned to one full-time worker – went a long way towards resolving the last economic crisis. Particularly in times of recession with spiking unemployment and production exceeding demand, sharing jobs can help to soften the blow.
Furthermore, countries with shorter working weeks consistently top gender-equality rankings. The central issue is achieving a more equitable distribution of work. Not until men do their fair share of cooking, cleaning and other domestic labour will women be free to fully participate in the broader economy. Take Sweden, a country with a truly decent system for childcare and paternity leave – and the world’s smallest work-time disparity between men and women.
Besides distributing jobs more equally between the sexes, we also have to share them across the generations. Older people increasingly want to continue working even after hitting pensionable age. But while thirtysomethings are drowning in work, family responsibilities and mortgages, seniors struggle to get hired, even though (some) working has proven health benefits. Young workers who are just entering the labour market may well continue working into their 80s. In return, they could put in not 40 hours a week for all those years, but perhaps just 20-30. “In the 20th century we had a redistribution of wealth,” one leading demographer has observed. “In this century, the great redistribution will be in terms of working hours.”.
And then there is the issue of economic inequality. The countries with the biggest disparities in wealth are precisely those with the longest working weeks. While the poor are working longer hours just to get by, the rich are finding it ever more “expensive” to take time off as their hourly rates rise. Nowadays excessive work and pressure are status symbols. Time to oneself is sooner equated with unemployment and laziness, certainly in countries where the wealth gap has widened.
It doesn’t have to be this way. We have the ability to cut a big chunk off our working week. Not only would it make all of society a whole lot healthier, it would also put an end to untold piles of pointless and even downright harmful tasks (a recent poll found that as many as 37% of British workers think they have a “bullshit job”). A universal basic income would be the best way to give everyone the opportunity to do more unpaid but incredibly important work, such as caring for children and the elderly.
“But wouldn’t everybody just be glued to the TV all the time?”, you may wonder. Actually, it is precisely in overworked countries like Japan, England and the US that people watch an absurd amount of television. Up to four hours a day in England, which adds up to nine years over an average lifetime. Sure, swimming in a sea of spare time won’t be easy. But that’s why a 21st century education should prepare people not only for joining the workforce, but also (and more importantly) for life. “Since men will not be tired in their spare time,” the philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote in 1932, “they will not demand only such amusements as are passive and vapid.”
We can handle the good life, if only we take the time."

At the big high tides of the year the sea washes over the famous wide beach and floods many of the city streets and magnificent Art Deco buildings. And over the past decade the floods have been striking more frequently.
Most of the city sits just a few feet above sea level, built on a foundation of porous limestone, allowing the rising seas to seep into the city’s foundations, surge up through pipes and drains, encroaching on fresh water supplies and saturating infrastructure. The city is now investing in a $500m project to raise roads and a pumping system to hold back the floods.
Miami Beach is one of the world’s most vulnerable cities to sea floods, but much of Florida’s coastline is facing similar problems. The Everglades wetlands is at risk from invading seawater and the Florida Keys are regularly flooded at extreme high tides.
Nasa is facing floods from Atlantic storms at the Kennedy Space Centre and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on the Florida coast. But the most urgent threat is to drinking water as saltwater, and the pollution it flushes out, invades underground, and is now moving close to drinking water supplies for 6 million residents.
So it’s no surprise that 81% of people in Florida polled recently said they believe that climate change is happening now – an increase on the 63% in 2012. And yet climate change has been drowned out in the US presidential primary elections – apart from political debates in Miami."

The UK has benefited from an EU-wide environmental cleanup in the past four decades, and giving up membership would lead to a damaging policy vacuum and an end to influence over green regulations, the commons environmental audit select committee has said in a report.
Britain was once “the dirty man of Europe”, pouring out toxic pollutants that caused acid rain, industrial pollution, poor air quality, contaminated land and sewage-filled beaches. After taking on EU membership, successive governments had to mend their ways in line with rules on the environment developed over decades.
Mary Creagh, chair of the committee, said: “The UK has cleaned up its act: EU laws mean we bathe on cleaner beaches, drive more fuel-efficient cars and can hold the government to account on air pollution. The overwhelming evidence is that EU membership has improved the UK’s approach to the environment and ensured that the UK’s environment has been better protected.”
George Eustice, the farming minister, who is part of the Vote Leave campaign, said in response to the report: “Our natural environment is rich in diversity, but is also complex. Imposing centralised policies through clunky EU directives has failed because these act as a straitjacket that stifles innovation in environmental management. 
“The UK has also lost its voice and voting rights on many international wildlife conventions. If we vote [to] leave and take control, we will regain our seat at the table at these conventions. We would be able to innovate, to pilot ideas and to really deliver for our natural environment.”
Separately, a group of former high-ranking environmental officials have warned that the UK’s influential position in international climate change negotiations would be at risk from a vote to leave. Membership of the EU has enabled the UK to punch above its weight. It has given us a platform to influence not only the climate commitments of our European neighbours, but also those of the US and China. In the last European parliament, all countries agreed to follow the carbon reduction trajectory set by the UK for the next 15 years,” they wrote in a letter to the Guardian.
The letter was signed by Lord Turner, former CBI director-general and former chairman of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC); Lord Deben, chairman of the CCC and former environment secretary; Chris Huhne, former environment secretary; Sir Crispin Tickell, former ambassador to the UN; and the leaders of six environmental campaigning organisations.
They noted that the UK had played a major role in the success of the climate change talks in Paris last year, which produced a new global agreement on greenhouse gas emissions that will be signed at a special ceremony at the UN later this week. Outside the EU, this “pivotal role” would be impossible, and this would “damage our national interest by reducing our diplomatic leverage”.
Environmental issues were largely left out of the prime minister’s negotiations earlier this year in which he sought to reform aspects of the UK’s relationship with the EU. According to the environmental audit committee’s report, the government does not have contingency plans for what would happen to environmental regulations if the UK were to leave the EU.
Some regulations would still have to be enforced if the UK were to be treated as a trading partner, similar to Norway or others. But it is not certain which rules those would be, and negotiations would likely be “tortuous”.
In addition, the committee said that future UK governments would be unable to influence those rules, or any new regulations, because there would be no British seat at the negotiating table when they were drawn up.
MPs also criticised ministers for moving too slowly on implementing some of the EU’s green regulations. Air pollution campaigners have taken the government to court for its failure to adhere to air quality standards.
Businesses stood to benefit from a vote to remain, as the single set of environmental standards governing all companies trading in Europe meant a level playing field, said Nick Molho, executive director of the Aldersgate Group, which represents businesses supporting green actions. “[This] has reduced the cost and complexity of complying with different regulations in different member states,” he said.
The Vote Leave campaign did not respond to requests for comment.
The National Farmers’ Union said it would not campaign on the referendum, but that its stance was in favour of remaining in the EU. The organisation said the decision, announced by the farming body’s council on Monday evening, was made because the Electoral Commission required it to take a view. A previously published report commissioned by the NFU found that Brexit could cost many farmers in lost subsidies.
The stance might be controversial for many in the farming community, as pro-Brexit views have been gaining ground. The NFU is not polling its members on the issue, saying such an operation would be too complicated, and that it was “not a political organisation”.
The NFU lobbies the government on farming issues."

In 2014 it was £55.18tn. It’s certainly been a rocky road at times, but the trend of economic growth has been robust. Only four years over this period have shown a contraction of economic output.
Consequently, one should feel foolish for suggesting that there are not only limits to growth, but that such limits are already affecting the global economy. That’s one evaluation of the book Limits to Growth, which was published in 1972 and contained the central, controversial conclusion that the seemingly never-ending increase in population, industrial output, food production, and resource use would rapidly unravel at some point around the middle of the 21st century. 
It painted a picture of our over-inflated global industrialised civilisation going bang. We are still here and growth continues, so it must be wrong, right?
Perhaps not.
The Limits to Growth study was commissioned by the global thinktank Club of Rome and was based on the output of computer simulations that represented a simple global economy and its interactions with environmental processes. Nowadays you could happily run this model on your phone. In the early 1970s it required a mainframe computer and cutting-edge numerical techniques.
Two studies have evaluated how well the 1972 results of the Limits to Growth model have fared compared to what has actually happened in the intervening period. Their main findings are that it did pretty well actually. That doesn’t mean collapse is inevitable, but that despite its simplicity, Limits to Growth captured some important features of our civilisation.
It concluded that there are two drivers of a possible collapse. First, non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels should become harder to extract. This makes them more expensive with costs feeding into, among other things, higher food prices and so the global food production system fails to keep up with demand. Second, pollution produced by industry swamps the Earth’s capacity to absorb them, with the spillover affecting both food production and human health.
It was possible to avoid collapse, but that proved very hard to do. In fact, the only reliable way to avoid overshoot was not just by increasing rates of technological innovation, but by reducing growth rates. Not just population growth rates, but economic and industrial.
Many begged to differ, and argued that above all, growth must be maintained. Growth has delivered increased living standards and poverty alleviation. Reduced growth threatens stagnation. Worse, recession. If one resource begins to run out, then we will find another. Necessity is the mother of invention. Just look at fossil fuels.
In the early 1970s, Opec was flexing its economic muscles and constricting oil supply. The price rocketed. At the same time some oil wells in the US were running dry. But since then, enhanced oil recovery techniques such as fracking have been developed to gain access to even more fossil fuels. The threat of “peak oil” is now very last century. Over this same period, agricultural productivity increased significantly as the green revolution was rolled out across the world.
So, rather than running out of resources, we live in a world of plenty. However, this fails to address the other half of the limits equation - pollution.
In 1972, global annual emissions of greenhouse gasses was equivalent to approximately 16bn tons of CO2. In 2014 it was 36bn tons. Pollution from burning fossil fuels is rapidly changing the Earth’s climate. 
There is a growing body of evidence that this climate change will have significant economic costs in the near future, not to mention its impacts on human health and biodiversity. Some scenarios of dangerous climate change are just as apocalyptic as any depicted by Limits to Growth. 
Today, vastly more complex integrated assessment models grapple with the myriad interactions between civilisation and the Earth system. But Limits to Growth continues to be of interest because it critically examines what is perhaps the most fundamental assumption in our current economic system: that growth will ultimately fix all of humanity’s problems, even those produced by growth itself.
• On Tuesday the all-party parliamentary group on Limits to Growth launches at the House of Commons."

Brandis said the science body’s decision to cut funding for its scientists, who have produced vital climate science research – in response to the former Abbott government’s cuts to the CSIRO in 2014 – is what it ought to do if it believes climate change is real.
He said Labor senators who think the science of climate change is settled should support the cuts, not oppose them.
“If the science is settled, why do we need research scientists to continue inquiring into the settled science?” Brandis said on Tuesday.
 “Wouldn’t it be a much more useful allocation of taxpayers’ money and research capacity within CSIRO to allocate its resources to an area where the science isn’t settled?”
The attorney general’s argument is similar to that used by the CSIRO chief executive, Larry Marshall, who said in an email to staff in February that further work on climate change would be reduced because climate change had been established.
The CSIRO is currently cutting hundreds of jobs in its oceans and atmosphere division, and its land and water division, according to according to reports.
The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and Marshall have been heavily criticised by global climate scientists for allowing those cuts to go ahead.
Brandis – who spent more than $15,000 of taxpayer’s money to build a new bookshelf in his parliament house office in 2014 – said he did not believe that the science of climate change was settled but he knew how to follow a logical argument.
He said it would be a better use of taxpayers’ money to divert climate science funding elsewhere.
“It doesn’t seem to me that the science is settled at all but I’m not a scientist,” he said. “I’m agnostic, really, on that question. But I can follow a logical argument.
“I am simply challenging the illogic of the proposition being advanced by the Labor party who say, on the one hand, that the science is settled but, on the other hand, say it is a disgraceful thing that we should make adjustments to our premier public sector scientific research agency that would reflect the fact that the science is settled.”
The CSIRO has had budget cuts from successive governments, including $110m in the Abbott government’s first budget in 2014.
Late last year, the heads of its divisions were told to find millions in savings to support its funding shortfall."

It’s not a novel result – in fact, most global warming attribution studies have arrived at the same general result – but this study uses a new approach.
Studies attempting to figure out the global warming contributions of various human and natural sources usually use a statistical approach known as ‘linear regression’. This approach assumes we know the pattern of warming that each source (forcing) will cause, but we don’t know how big the resulting warming will be. For example, we know that greenhouse gases cause more warming over land than water, the most in the Arctic, and more warming in response to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. 
As an example of this approach, this animated graphic shows what happens when a 2011 study by Foster &amp; Rahmstorf removed the known natural influences from the observed global surface temperature record, leaving behind the human-caused global warming signal.
We have an idea how much warming greenhouse gases will cause, but the range is fairly large (1.5 to 4.5°C in response to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide). So, the standard approach uses the known patterns from each forcing (greenhouse gases, other human pollutants, the sun, volcanoes, etc.), and without assuming the effectiveness of each, statistically determines how much each pattern has contributed to the observed temperature changes. 
However, some papers have argued that we do have some knowledge about the effectiveness of each forcing, and should use that information in these statistical studies. Conversely, the patterns of some forcings, like human aerosol pollution, are also uncertain and complicate this approach.
As the authors describe it, this new study “basically proposes a symmetric treatment of the magnitude and the pattern of the response to each forcing.” Their statistical model assumes that the temperature influence from several individual forcings will add up to the total temperature influence from all the forcings. They then run various tests to check consistency between the observed warming and the Earth’s natural temperature variability, the expected temperature response from all the forcings, or the expected response from subsets of forcings.
The study considered temperature changes for the period of 1951–2010. During that time, global surface temperatures warmed about 0.65°C. During that same period, their statistical approach which combines observations and climate models outputs found that humans have caused 0.67 ± 0.12°C warming, while natural factors have had essentially no effect on global temperatures (-0.01 ± 0.02°C).
This result is similar to the conclusion in the latest IPCC report:
It is extremely likely [95 percent confidence] more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together …
The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period ... 
The contribution from natural forcings is likely to be in the range of −0.1°C to 0.1°C, and from internal variability is likely to be in the range of −0.1°C to 0.1°C.
It’s also consistent with numerous previous global warming attribution studies, including those using the aforementioned statistical linear regression approach. Lead author Aurélien Ribes told me:
The main outcome of this study is to develop a new method that deals with uncertainty in a more comprehensive way. By using this new method, we hope to further narrow the uncertainty in past and future greenhouse gas-induced warming in the near future.
In other words, this new paper adds to the mountain of evidence pointing to humans as the dominant cause of global warming since 1950, using a new statistical approach to answer the question. Disentangling how much warming human carbon pollution has caused from the amount of cooling caused by human aerosol pollution remains a challenging task, but rapid global warming is the net result of human activities.
This mountain of scientific and statistical evidence is the reason why there is a 90–100% consensus among climate science experts that humans are responsible for global warming. It’s what scientists call a “knowledge-based consensus”, as described in the video below."

The Canadian prime minister will join 155 other countries at the United Nations on Friday for a symbolic signing ceremony. 
Trudeau is determined to bring the deal into force - possibly as early as this year - and will lobby other governments to that end, according to Catherine McKenna, the environment and climate minister.
“We are going to do whatever we can to encourage countries to ratify,” she said.
Some 55 countries covering 55% of global emissions must formally approve or ratify the agreement before it comes into force.
Trudeau is hoping to bring the climate deal to the Canadian parliament for formal approval by the end of the year, McKenna told the Guardian. 
 “We are going to ratify this year,” she said in an interview. “I think it’s important to get Canadians on board, but the timeline is certainly this year.”
Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, has built the 22 April signing ceremony into a key event, calculating that - once a deal had been forged in Paris last December - governments’ engagement with climate change might wane.
That strategy appeared to have paid off, with campaign groups reporting more mobilisation around the Paris deal. 
Obama is sending John Kerry, the secretary of state, to represent the US at the ceremony.
Negotiators feared a long time lag would compromise efforts to hold warming 2C below pre-industrial levels, the goal of the agreement. There has already been about 1C of warming. 
“We had 195 countries come together so we want to make sure those 195 countries are staying engaged and staying committed,” McKenna said.
That sentiment is widespread. Ahead of the signing ceremony, religious leaders and institutional investors called on governments to follow through on their pledges from Paris. 
On Monday, about 250 religious leaders called on countries to revisit their pledges - and take more ambitious cuts, such as the phase out of fossil fuel subsidies and the transition to 100% renewable energy.
 “The planet has already passed safe levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,” the statement from the religious leaders said. “Unless these levels are rapidly reduced, we risk creating irreversible impacts putting hundreds of millions of lives, of all species, at severe risk.”
On Tuesday, institutional investors managing $24tn in assets called on leaders to move swiftly to bring the Paris agreement into force.
“Maintaining strong momentum is particularly important in the lead up to the G20 meeting in China,” Emma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate change for Australia, said in a statement.
Since his election last year, Trudeau has shown increasing interest in the role of a global climate leader. 
 After coming to power last year, he moved to break with the pro-oil policies of his conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper. His government is in the midst of a six-month review of climate and energy policy. 
In a visit to the White House last month, Trudeau and Barack Obama agreed to work together on a host of climate initiatives.
One of the biggest was a commitment to reduce emissions of methane, a powerful climate pollutant, from the oil and gas industry.
That meeting of minds between Trudeau and Obama has raised expectations of a North American climate alliance between the US, Canada and Mexico. “If you can mobilise Canada and the US and Mexico, that sends a strong signal to the world,” McKenna said. 
On a domestic front, however, she acknowledged that Canada faced challenges.
A carbon price was a “no-brainer”, McKenna said. However, it was difficult reconciling the economic pressures on energy-producing provinces such as Alberta and Newfoundland and provinces such as Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia, which already have strong climate policies."

The move follows intense pressure from the scientific community to amend proposals drawn up by the Cabinet Office to stop organisations, mostly charities, from using taxpayer-funded grants to lobby the government or parliament.
The ban, which comes into effect on 1 May, threatened to silence academics and exclude them from public debates as diverse as energy, climate change and transport policies.
But speaking in the House of Lords on Tuesday, Lord Bridges of Headley, the parliamentary secretary for the Cabinet Office, announced exemptions for major government-backed funding bodies, including the research councils, the national academies and the Higher Education Funding Council for England.
Martin Rees, the astronomer royal, welcomed the move but criticised ministers for taking so long to clarify the proposals after they were first made public in February.
“This clarification is welcome but should have come sooner. It’s regrettable that it was preceded by months of confusion and ambiguity that generated needless anxiety, ill-feeling and time-wasting,” he said. Nearly 20,000 academics signed a petition calling for scientists to be exempt from the ban.
Sarah Main, the director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering, said the announcement was good news and a “huge step” in the right direction. “Scientists felt embroiled in a debate about lobbying which did not appear to apply to them,” she said. “We now need to get the detail right to make sure this solution works for all of government and all of science.”
But some in the community criticised the exemption for not going far enough. Imprecisely worded, it does not exclude scientists directly funded by government through departments such as health, business and defence.
Mark Maslin, a climatologist at University College London, said the independence of a country’s scientific expertise was central to the freedoms demanded by a modern democracy.
“If government or commerce, whether inadvertent or knowingly, put people at risk then scientists must be free to sound the warning bells without the risk of censure or legal proceedings. By rights the government should be granting a full exemption to all scientists sending a clear message that scientific knowledge is above petty party politics and is there for the betterment of all citizens,” he said. “What we have is a mess with an imprecise exemption which does not ensure that all scientists can criticise the government with impunity.”"

There have only been three mass bleaching events recorded on the reef , and all of them have happened since 1998. Scientists say this episode is the worst they’ve ever seen.
The world is in the midst of a global bleaching event, which is a result of a pulse of warm water flowing around the Pacific Ocean caused by El Niño, and the background global warming caused by man-made greenhouse gas emissions.
Corals bleach when they experience temperatures above their normal summer maximum for a month or two. The situation is made worse if there are few clouds, and a high level of UV radiation blasts the coral.
The Great Barrier Reef aerial survey began last month, and has now covered 911 individual reefs along the 2,300km structure from helicopters and planes.
Prof Terry Hughes, from James Cook University and head of the National Coral Bleaching taskforce, said only 68 of those reefs escaped bleaching entirely.
As Guardian Australia reported last week, more than half the surveyed reefs have been severely bleached, with as many as 81% of reefs north of Port Douglas experiencing severe bleaching.
If coral remains bleached for an extended period, it is likely to die. Hughes said that the northern region is already seeing mortality as high as 50%, and he expected that at some reefs it will exceed 90%.
In the central section between Port Douglas and Mackay, a third of the reefs are severely bleached and 57% have seen moderate or minor bleaching.
South of Mackay, 1% of reefs are severely bleached, but even there, only a quarter of the reefs have escaped bleaching entirely.
Hughes told Guardian Australia that in the previous two mass bleaching events – 1998 and 2002 – 40% of the reefs escaped bleaching. 
“By that metric, this event is five times stronger.” And in those two years, only 18% of reefs were severely bleached. “This time it’s 55%.”
“We’ve never seen anything like this scale of bleaching before. In the northern Great Barrier Reef, it’s like 10 cyclones have come ashore all at once,” said Hughes. 
“Towards the southern end, most of the reefs have minor to moderate bleaching and should soon recover.”

Hughes says the southern part of the reef was partially saved by weather conditions that brought clouds and cooler weather.
“This time, the southern third of the Great Barrier Reef was fortunately cooled down late in summer by a period of cloudy weather caused by ex-cyclone Winston, after it passed over Fiji and came to us as a rain depression. The 2016 footprint could have been much worse.”
The aerial work is being confirmed by teams of divers who are examining the coral up-close. Hughes said there have been 100 people underwater for the past month, and so far they’ve collected data from about 150 reefs."

Global policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector would reduce demand for oil, driving down prices and cutting global spending on the fossil fuel by £232bn a year worldwide between 2020 and 2030.
Cheaper oil for importing countries could free up billions of pounds which could be spent in other parts of the economy, the analysis led by Cambridge Econometrics said.
The report also warns that the era of ultra-cheap oil – with prices currently around $40 (£27) a barrel – will be limited, and without action to address climate change prices could rise to $130 a barrel by 2050.
If governments implement policies to cut carbon emissions from transport, which could see a significant uptake in hybrid and electric vehicles as the costs of battery technology falls rapidly, the reduction in demand in oil could keep prices lower.
Uptake of low-carbon transport could reduce prices by 15% in 2020 and 29% in 2040, and could see prices limited to $83-87 a barrel by mid-century.
Research by Cambridge Econometrics has also suggested that moving to low-carbon transport would be good for oil importing countries such as the UK.
In 2014, the UK imported 38% of its oil, which could translate to a £13bn a year saving by 2030 with a switch to clean transport, the research found, although imports dropped to 28% in 2015 as domestic production grew.
Increased spending on domestically-produced electricity or hydrogen fuel to power low-carbon vehicles and on innovative technology could boost the UK economy to the tune of between £2.4bn and £5bn and create thousands of jobs.
The report is being released ahead of the official opening for signing of the Paris agreement, the international climate deal agreed at the end of last year, which aims to shift countries on to a low-carbon path to curb rising temperatures.
Philip Summerton, director at Cambridge Econometrics and lead author of the report, said: “Without any further policy changes, oil prices are likely to recover in the long-term, driven by global economic growth and increasing demand for mobility.
“In a world where climate policies are being implemented to drive investment in low-carbon technologies - as governments agreed in Paris - demand for oil will be curbed, and ultimately reduced, leading to lower oil prices than would otherwise be the case.
“Through policy support and technological innovation, we can expect the global economy to be using 11m fewer barrels of oil per day by 2030 than we would without significant changes to transport technologies.
“Lower oil prices would benefit oil-importing regions such as Europe by reducing inflationary pressures on consumers, increasing real incomes, and shifting spending towards other goods and services that deliver more value for Europe.”"

Like other big oil firms, the company has caused its share of environmental disasters, including a 2011 oil spill that contaminated 840 sq km (324 sq miles) of Bohai Bay, off China’s northeastern shore. CNOOC got in trouble with government regulators for initially concealing the spill and has since been named in a lawsuit.
But the company has also been spending hard to make amends for its environmental sins. From 2008 to the end of 2014, its Southeast Asia subsidiary spent $1m to plant coral reefs and protect mangrove stands in the Thousand Islands archipelago of Indonesia. Some of the money also bought equipment to help local people breed and keep up the sea turtle population, which was dwindling because of illegal trade and habitat loss, in the waters north of Jakarta. In all, CNOOC sank the equivalent of $18m into charity and other social programs in 2014.
CNOOC’s spending is unusual among Chinese companies. Only 10% of Chinese firms carry out corporate social and environmental initiatives, typically charity work, according to SynTao, a Beijing-based consulting firm on corporate sustainability. In February, SynTao and European nonprofit Globethics released an online directory of 6,000 sustainability reports from China. They found 1,300 reports filed for 2013 and 666 the following year.
Meanwhile, sustainability has been part of the corporate vernacular in the US and Europe for decades; its meaning is starting to expand to include strategies for cutting costs and improving companies’ bottom lines, an approach to build social and environmental initiatives into long term business plans. Sustainability reporting by S&amp;P 500 firms rose from 20% in 2011 to 81% in 2015, according to New York-based consultant G&amp;A Institute. A study by auditing and management consulting firm KPMG in 2011 found that 95% of the world’s 250 largest companies did the same. 
To achieve its climate goals, Chinese companies must start putting money into projects that will minimize their environmental impact, which has created air so dirty that it’s among the chief causes for lung cancer. In 2014, the country, which is the world’s largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions, committed to cap its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The country signed the historic Paris climate deal in a UN ceremony on 22 April, where China also announced it would “finalize domestic procedures” to ratify the agreement before the G-20 summit in China in September. 
“Companies (historically) looked at sustainable initiatives from a compliance approach or as a public relations tool,” said Yuan Yuan, senior program coordinator with the Global Reporting Initiative, an Amsterdam-based organization that designs corporate responsibility reporting standards. “Chinese companies are gradually becoming more and more proactive.”
Even before China committed to capping emissions, it had begun to address the environmental impact of its growing economy. In 2008, the government started to require state-owned firms to regularly review and change their practices to save energy, manage resources more efficiently and cut pollution.
Since then, about half of China’s state-owned companies – generally the largest and oldest ones – carried out sustainability projects, said SynTao’s co-founder Guo Peiyuan. In 2011, state-owned China Petrochemical Corp, the country’s chief petroleum and petrochemical producer, began reporting its sustainability efforts, which have included water conservation, wildlife protection and carbon footprint reduction. The government-backed Industrial and Commercial Bank of China began its efforts in 2007, launching projects that reduce poverty and help startup businesses grow. China Vanke Co, a major property developer, puts money into habitat preservation in the cities where it does business.
In recent years, the Chinese government has begun to toughen environmental regulations that apply across state-owned and private businesses as severe air and water pollution, a result of the country’s fast-growing economy in recent decades, is being linked to an increase in cases of cancer and other serious health problems, and costing its economy billions of dollars.
“China’s interaction with the environment will be very much driven by government policy and they are really serious about this,” said Tim Clissold, author of Mr. China: A Memoir. “There is a genuine effort underway to clear up the mess and, like Western governments before them, I’m sure that over time they will solve this problem. They have no choice.”
Even without climate change and the government to contend with, many Chinese companies are facing growing pressure to improve their business ethics in order to attract investments and win contracts. Much of the nudging comes from their overseas customers and partners. One of the most high profile cases began with a string of employee suicides in 2010 at Foxconn, a Chinese manufacturer that makes iPhones and iPads for Apple. Long working hours, paltry pay and other conditions at its sprawling manufacturing compound – and the media attention on these conditions – have forced the company and Apple to make changes in labor practices that included increasing wages.
“The increasingly competitive global marketplace and the rise of social media, coupled with more and more conscientious consumers, are drivers for [corporate sustainability] inside or outside China,” said Song Seng Wun, economist in the private banking unit of CIMB in Singapore.
In 2014, the Swedish Embassy in Beijing and research firm CSR Asia surveyed 2,944 people, including corporate sustainability officers from Chinese and international companies, academic researchers and non-government groups, to find out more about what was driving sustainability practices in China. Some 46% said demand by international buyers was the second biggest reason (after the government) that they had developed sustainability plans. Other motivators included media coverage, industry peer pressure and demand from the Chinese public. The survey also found that energy and banking are the two business sectors that have done the most in cutting emissions and implementing other sustainability programs.
That said, critics still say Chinese companies have a long way to go to do their part in reining in global warming when most of them don’t build sustainability into their long term business plans.
“There are quite a number of Chinese companies that are competitive worldwide, acting as role models in sustainable initiatives and their approaches and reports are following international best practice,” Yuan of the Global Reporting Initiative said. 
“But there are still thousands of companies that show no real awareness of sustainability issues. The gaps in this market remain, therefore, quite large.” "

Writing on BusinessGreen today ahead of a roundtable event on the implications of Brexit for energy and climate policy this morning at MHP Communications, where Davey now holds a senior adviser role, the former energy and climate change secretary warned a vote for Brexit can “only be bad for Britain’s green businesses”.
“Perhaps a greener government than the current Conservative majority could offset the damage - but who’s to say a Brexit vote won’t unleash even stronger anti-green forces in the Tory Party and across the right of British politics?” he warned. “But you don’t have to take a party political position as I do. You only have to contemplate the years of uncertainty that would follow a Brexit vote. Energy investment thrives on political certainty because of the huge amounts of cash involved and because the financial returns come over a long period.”
He added that if Britain does vote to leave on 23 June, green businesses “better have a good export strategy”.
Drawing on his experience during his stint as energy and climate change secretary, Davey warned that giving up the UK’s involvement in Brussels’ negotiations would undermine both its energy security and its ability to help shape international climate policies.
Specifically, he detailed how the UK helped lead the EU response to the energy security threat posed by Russia’s annexing of Crimea in 2014, pushing for a new energy security strategy which was subsequently adopted. “With energy security the ultimate in ‘soft power’ - a force for peace perhaps better than military spend - this experience shows we are more secure, at a lower cost, because we’re at the EU table,” Davey said.
He also warned the UK’s role at ongoing international climate change talks would be compromised if it left the EU, arguing that it was the UK-backed Green Growth Group of ministers that helped push the bloc towards a more ambitious negotiating position ahead of the successful Paris Summit.
“On climate change, it would frankly be environmental madness for the UK to leave the EU,” Davey warned. “It’s of course logically impossible for Britain to solve climate change alone - we only produce two percent or less of global greenhouse emissions: we have to work with other countries to achieve our own domestic goals on climate. By exercising influence at the EU, we can force others to do their share; and with the EU, we exercise much more influence on the global stage of the United Nations.”
Davey’s analysis follows similar warnings from his successor as energy and climate change secretary, Amber Rudd, who last month warned Brexit would jeopardise much-needed new investment in energy infrastructure and push up bills for households and businesses.
It also comes in the same week as a major new report from the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) revealed the green sector’s strong support for EU membership. The analysis, based on the committee’s extensive evidence sessions with ministers, EU officials, businesses, and NGOs over recent months, underlines the role the trading bloc has played in strengthening Britain’s domestic environmental legislation, spurring green business innovation and boosting the UK’s influence in international climate negotiations.
The report also warned there remains “significant unanswered questions” over the fate of Britain’s environmental policies if it left the EU, with EAC chair and Labour MP Mary Creagh highlighting to BusinessGreen the risk of core green legislation being overturned by eurosceptics intent on deregulation. “Most politicians who support Britain’s exit would like to see a deregulatory agenda, and in areas like air and water and waste it opens the door for future governments to quietly drop beneficial legislation,” she said."

In the 10-page letter, the company predicted in 2013 that a mass industry flight would result if laws to regulate tar sands, cut power plant pollution and accelerate the uptake of renewable energy were passed, because of the extra costs and red tape they allegedly entailed.
The measures “threaten to drive energy-intensive industries, such as refining and petrochemicals, to relocate outside the EU with a correspondingly detrimental impact on security of supply, jobs [and] growth,” said the letter, which was obtained by the Guardian under access to documents laws.
The missive to the EU’s energy commissioner, Günther Oettinger, was dated 9 August 2013, partly hand-written, and signed by a senior BP representative whose name has been redacted.
It references a series of “interactions” between the two men – and between BP and an unnamed third party in Washington DC – and welcomes opportunities to further discuss energy issues in an “informal manner”.
BP’s warning of a fossil fuel pull-out from Europe was repeated three times in the letter, most stridently over plans to mandate new pollution cuts and clean technologies, under the industrial emissions directive.
This reform “has the potential to have a massively adverse economic impact on the costs and competitiveness of European refining and petrochemical industries, and trigger a further exodus outside the EU,” the letter said.
The plant regulations eventually advanced by the commission would leave Europe under a weaker pollution regime than China’s, according to research by Greenpeace. 
BP said any clampdown would cost industry many billions of euros and so pollution curbs “should also be carefully accessed with close co-operation with the industrial sectors”.
Last year the EU’s environment department moved to limit the coal lobby’s influence on pollution standards, after revelations by the Guardian and Greenpeace about the scale of industry involvement. 
The commission had previously allowed hundreds of energy industry lobbyists to aggressively push for weaker pollution limits as part of the official negotiating teams of EU member states.
The Green MEP Molly Scott Cato said that the UK’s robust advocacy of BP’s positions was a cause of deep shame, and illustrated how Brexit would increase the power of fossil fuel firms.
She said: “It reveals how the arm-twisting tactics of big oil seek to undermine the EU’s progressive energy and climate policies. BP’s covert lobbying, combined with threats of an exodus of the petrochemicals industry from the EU, are nothing short of blackmail.
“This document paints a disturbing picture of the degree to which global corporations subvert the democratic process, influence the commission and threaten the vital transition to a cleaner, greener Europe.” 
 A BP spokesman said that the letter was intended to “highlight the risk of ‘carbon leakage’, where EU policy to reduce carbon emissions may result in industry relocating outside the EU, rather than achieving any actual reduction in emissions. Avoiding this perverse outcome is of critical importance to climate policy.”
In his reply to BP, Oettinger said that his department was finalising an energy prices report and “your thoughts are very valuable in this context”.
Before the report’s publication, Oettinger’s team removed figures from an earlier draft which revealed that EU states spent €40bn (£32bn) a year on subsidies for fossil fuels, compared to €35bn for nuclear energy, and just €30bn for renewables. The commissioner’s office argues that the numbers were inconsistent and “not comparable” 
 Early in his tenure, Oettinger had been forced to back down on plans for a moratorium on deepwater offshore oil drills in the wake of the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster. Within two years, he had become an industry champion, arguing that Europe was competitively disadvantaged by a reluctance to take offshore drilling risks.
Oettinger regularly hosts alpine retreats for government ministers, bankers and captains of industry. In 2013, these included executives from Shell, Statoil, GDF Suez, EDF, Alstom, Enel and ENI, although not BP.
 A spokeswoman for Oettinger said: “When the Commission prepares formal legislative proposals, there is a full public consultation exercise in which all stakeholders can participate. With the majority of the EU legislation referred to, Commissioner Oettinger was not the Commissioner in the lead.”
An alignment between the commission’s eventual climate proposals and BP’s positions was “unfound,” the official added. 
In his reply to BP, Oettinger said that he shared the firm’s views on a guarantee for unlimited crude oil and gas exports being included in a TTIP free trade deal and welcomed more “thoughts” from the company.
Along with Shell, BP began lobbying for an end to the EU’s renewables and energy efficiency targets in 2011, but the scope of its lobby intervention went further.
In its letter, BP strongly opposed renewable energy subsidies, particularly in Germany, and a planned cap on certain biofuels which studies have shown to be highly-polluting.
Over the year that followed, an EU state aid decision on renewables went against Germany, while a cap on the amount of first generation biofuels that could be counted towards EU targets was also weakened. 
 
Europe’s efforts to cut carbon emissions should be built upon market-based tools such as its flagship emissions trading scheme, BP said in its letter.
But EU proposals to label tar sands oil as more polluting than other oil – which could lead to additional taxes – risked companies “being penalised subjectively on the basis of adverse perceptions”, according to BP.
The tar sands proposal was vehemently opposed by the UK and the Netherlands, and the plan was eventually dropped in 2014.
Jos Dings, the director of the sustainable transport thinktank Transport and Environment said: “In case anyone doubted why Europe chose to treat all oil – regular and high polluting – the same, here’s the answer: Big Oil telling the commission that really its impossible to tell them apart.”
Lisa Nandy, the Labour’s shadow energy and climate secretary, called for the EU’s climate policies to be strengthened. “By working together with like-minded governments across Europe we can ensure that big companies cannot water down environmental safeguards,” she said.
BP recently topped a survey of the most obstructive company on climate change, and is increasingly a target for fossil fuels divestment campaigns."

Dr Axel Moehrenschlager said cases of “translocation”, such as India’s plan to relocate tigers to Cambodia or South Africa’s scheme to airlift rhinos to Australia, have increased exponentially in recent decades and will become more common due to human pressures driving species closer to extinction.
Translocation is the practice of intentionally moving plants and animals from one area and releasing them in another to improve their survival chances and combat biodiversity loss. 

It is usually considered a “last resort” method, but conservationists warn that intensive and sometimes controversial forms of intervention may now be needed.
“Species are under increasing threat around the world, but the science is maturing about how to bring them back,” said Moehrenschlager, director of conservation and science at the Calgary zoo and chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reintroduction specialist group.
“This is not a new tool - it’s gone on for more than 100 years - but it’s definitely escalating in terms of frequency and geographical spread, not just for an individual species but for entire ecosystems.”
Traditional conservation has focused on maintaining species in protected areas, but Moehrenschlager said this approach would no longer be relevant as temperatures rise and species are unable to exist in their native range.
“The impact that people have on the planet is ever-increasing,” he said. “The times when we could simply hope that we could set areas aside for species are increasingly disappearing. We are in a situation of emerging threats due to climate change that we need to more actively manage species otherwise we will lose them.”
The most recent assessment from the UN’s climate change body warned in 2014 that global warming was causing “widespread and consequential” harm to animals and plants, many of which had moved their range, changed numbers or shifted their seasonal activities as a result of warmer temperatures.
In 2013, an IUCN report found that 6-9% of endangered bird species, 11-15% of amphibians and 6-9% of corals were considered highly vulnerable to climate change and would be threatened with a greater risk of extinction if current climate trends continued.
Moehrenschlager, who will deliver a lecture on the topic on Wednesday night at the St Andrews prize for the environment ceremony in Scotland, reached the figure of an estimated 1,300 translocations from his work on two papers due to be published this month and case studies from the IUCN.
The German-born scientist has worked for 25 years in conservation and is based at Calgary zoo, one of the world’s leading zoos for conservation research. His work on swift foxes, once Canada’s most endangered carnivore, was so successful that its conservation status was “downgraded” in 2012 from endangered to threatened - a rare occurrence.
Moehrenschlager said it was impossible to pinpoint which the 1,000th species would have been as so many projects were ongoing, but that the first known translocation would have been attempts to reintroduce the bison to the US in the early 1900s.
Translocation is considered controversial by some scientists because of the risk that relocated species could overpopulate a new area and cause local organisms to become extinct.
The obvious benefit is saving a species from extinction, but this must be balanced against any risks, Moehrenschlager said. Animals or plants could die or suffer excessive stress during relocation, and the impact of animals within an ecosystem receiving the new species must also be considered. There are also socioeconomic implications, if a relocated species were to cause damage to land or pose a threat to humans.
“To me this is not controversial as long as the correct process is followed. Success is not guaranteed, but the alternative of not acting is guaranteed - and that is extinction. We have to remember the reason this is done is primarily because one is trying to avoid extinction, but also because one isn’t able to restore species within their indigenous range because the threats in those zones are so pervasive and can’t be avoided.”
The IUCN released 2013 guidelines on conservation translocations, which Moehrenschlager helped to draft. At the moment, there is no formal worldwide regulation or enforcement. “We encourage a very close planning process that looks at the goals, with evaluation of potential benefits and risks,” he said. 
The process can mean reinforcing and reintroducing a species within its range - the area it is traditionally found - for example, grey wolves in Yellowstone national park in the US - or introducing a species outside its native range to boost numbers or replace a function in an ecosystem that has been lost through extinction. 
Perhaps an underestimated benefit of the method was hope, he said. “In the space where nature is under increasing threat, restoration of species through conservation translocation can motivate us that the recovery of species is possible and that conservation truly can work.”
Californian condor – in 1982 only 23 birds survived. In 1987 all wild condors were placed in captive breeding programmes. Since 1992, when they were re-released into the wild, the population has grown to 410 birds.
Groups of golden lion tamarins in Brazil were moved from small threatened forests to larger uninhabited and protected forests as logging, agriculture and industry encroached on their habitat. 
The Arabian oryx became extinct in the wild in 1972. Reintroductions from captive breeding herds have taken place in Oman, Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan, and its conservation status has been upgraded to “endangered”.
The Vancouver Island marmot is endemic to one island in Canada. In 2004 it was down to less than 40 individuals in the wild. There was a real risk of extinction in the wild by 2010 - the same year that it was the symbol of the Winter Olympics. Now numbers have reached 350.
Swift foxes had been lost from Canada since 1938 due to habitat loss and hunting but were reintroduced in 1983. Their conservation status is now of “least concern”.
Short-haired bumblebee - Declared extinct in the UK in 2000 as wildflower-rich grassland was lost to intensively farmed land. After a failed attempt to reintroduce bees from New Zealand, queens from Sweden nested and bred successfully in 2013.
European mink were taken to two Estonian islands free from the threat of their predatory competitor, the American mink.
Corals in India that had become locally extinct due to reef degradations were reintroduced to the Gulf of Kutch and grown on artificial reefs. Known as assisted colonisation. 
The Aldabra giant tortoise was introduced to one of the Mauritian islands, which replaced the grazing and seed-dispersal roles of the original tortoises that had become extinct. This is known as ecological replacement translocation. "

This man in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, uses a rope to scare birds off his rice paddies. “Unusually strong storms and exceptionally high tides breached the levies that protect his rice paddies, destroying a large portion of his harvest,” says Russell. “These climate change phenomena have drastically reduced the rice production capacity of farmers, jeopardizing the food security and livelihoods of their families and communities.”
Jasper Doest (@jasperdoest) is a Dutch photographer focusing on wildlife and conservation. This image shows a Svalbard reindeer crossing the tundra while his moulting fur flies around in the strong Arctic wind. Doest writes that, while the reindeer have no natural enemies, the changing climate has put them under threat. Rain would cause greater insulation loss than increasing wind velocity in Svalbard reindeer of all ages, with the exception of calves under one month old, which could experience dramatic insulation loss from a combination of heavy rain and windchill.

The mysterious recluse, who was better known to neighbors for her exquisite garden than for her lyric poems that revealed a passionate love of nature, differed from fellow 19th-century American writers whose thinking became the bedrock of modern environmentalism. While Thoreau famously declared wild places to be “the preservation of the world,” Emily Dickinson was finding nature’s truth and power in an ordinary dandelion. 
Among the plants that survive on the family property where Dickinson confined herself for much of her adult life are picturesque old trees called umbrella magnolias (Magnolia tripetala) — so named because their leaves, which can reach two feet long, radiate out from the ends of branches like the spokes of an umbrella.
The trees, believed to have been planted by Emily’s brother Austin, have jumped the garden gate in recent decades and established wild populations not far from the poet’s home. This new location is a couple of hundred miles north of the tree’s native range, centered in the sheltered woods and ravines of the Appalachian Mountains, and is the first evidence that native plant horticulture in the United States “is giving some species a head-start on climate change,” according to Smith College biologist Jesse Bellemare.
Ironically, the denizen of the Dickinson homestead is also challenging basic precepts of conservation practice, such as what is the definition of “native”? Are climate refugees that hitchhike north via horticulture less worthy of protection than plants that arrive on their own? Do they pose a threat to existing native species? Should native plant gardening, the domestic form of assisted migration, be used to help plants stranded in inhospitable habitat? 
The standard definition of native, says Bellemare, was based on a view of nature as unchanging, and of what constitutes “native” as absolute and enduring. But “this very local definition breaks down,” he says, as climate change makes many plants unsuited to habitats they historically have occupied. The definition of native needs to shift, he adds, as the boundaries of entire biogeographic regions, like the eastern deciduous forest, shift with changing conditions. 
A few years ago, Bellemare began to notice umbrella magnolias “peeking out from roadside vegetation” in western Massachusetts. 
Most of the naturalized plants, he observed, were “close to, or within sight of, horticultural specimens.” Intrigued, he set out to determine the age of the garden escapees. Although some of the landscaped trees, like those on the Dickinson homestead, were planted more than a century-and-a half-ago, core samples from a number of the largest naturalized individuals revealed that the species started escaping profusely only in the last 20 to 30 years. 
As Bellemare and coauthor Claudia Deeg pointed out in a paper last July in Rhodora, this is also when the climate began warming quickly in the region. In a presentation at the Ecological Society of America conference last year, Bellemare and a group of collaborators concluded, “It is unlikely that natural dispersal from the South would have allowed Magnolia tripetala to reach this region anytime soon.” 
For years, scientists have predicted that natives planted well north of their historic geographic limits inevitably would not only survive, but thrive and naturalize outside of horticulture in habitat made increasingly hospitable by global warming. In a 2008 paper in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, biologists found that 73 percent of the 357 native European species they investigated were being sold hundreds of miles north of the plants’ natural geographic ranges. 
“While debate continues about whether humans should actively assist the migration of species in the face of climate change, it is clear that the horticulture industry has already done so for hundreds of species,” they wrote. 
Natural range shifts of birds and other mobile species have been documented in the past decade, but new studies suggest that many native plants are also struggling to keep up with climate change by migrating to higher elevations or towards the poles. In an analysis of the flora of Worcester County in central Massachusetts in 2013, biologist Robert Bertin found that the ranges of native plants appear to be contracting. 
“Northern” species most widely distributed in upper New England, he wrote, are declining faster than the region’s “southern” plants, primarily from New England’s lower reaches, which are expanding their ranges northward. In a paper published earlier this year, biologists detected significantly fewer shifts in elevation by plants in California than by other organisms such as birds and mammals. They also found that the migration upward in elevation of non-native invasive plant species was nearly five times greater than that of the flora overall, and even more when compared to localized endemic plants. 
Endemic plants with small ranges, scientists believe, are among the species at greatest risk as their preferred climate shifts far beyond their ability to disperse. Bellemare and University of Minnesota biologist David Moeller have analyzed the likely impact of climate change on one of the most celebrated clusters of endemic plants — herbaceous wildflowers of the Southeast, from bleedinghearts to trilliums — which produce a flamboyant explosion of blooms that carpet the forest floor in spring. 
These endemic wildflowers have been unable to disperse northward in the 15,000 years since the last ice sheet began receding. While they would probably be well positioned to survive the climatic cooling of another ice age, the breakneck speed of current warming seems to place many of these plants “on the wrong side of climate history,” Bellemare has written. 
Horticulture has helped the umbrella magnolia disperse beyond its former range limit south of the glacial boundary. Naturalized populations have been discovered throughout the Northeast, including on Long Island, where the trees were planted widely in the 1920s, and perhaps earlier.
The population located a stone’s throw from the Dickinson homestead, consisting of several hundred trees spread over six or seven acres, is believed to be one of the largest clusters in the Northeast.
Not all biologists are toasting the plant’s arrival in the northeastern U.S., however. Because the umbrella magnolia arrived via horticulture, Bill Brumback, director of conservation at the New England Wild Flower Society, says he would not consider it native — the basic prerequisite for a plant worth preserving. 
“I really don’t know” if southeastern species that have escaped from cultivation should be considered native in New England, says Brown University biologist Dov Sax, who is collaborating with Bellemare and other scientists on a nationwide study of what shifting ranges portend for the survival of native plants in the face of rapid warming. “A new, more nuanced set of terms than ‘native’ or ‘non-native’ is needed,” Sax says. 
The debate over how to characterize plants colonizing new areas as the climate changes is based in large part on concern over their potential to hijack the habitat of existing native species. This same worry has made assisted migration of species threatened by climate change one of the most controversial topics in contemporary conservation science and has fueled concern among some scientists over gardeners moving native plants well beyond their current boundaries. 
“Native plant horticulture is giving us some fascinating insights into what is likely to happen with climate change,” says Bellemare. “But we’re not at a point where most botanists and ecologists would feel comfortable advocating” that gardeners help protect plants by moving them to cooler climes, he adds. Indeed, given their rampant spread, Brumback worries that the naturalized magnolias may be in the early stages of biological invasion. “If I saw them taking over a woodland, I’d recommend removing them,” he says. 
Brown University’s Sax suspects that this is unlikely, noting that studies indicate a species’ risk of becoming invasive increases with the distance of its historic native range from the region it is colonizing. Although he is concerned that a small percentage of plants introduced from other continents “will likely become problematic,” he believes that a nearby native like the umbrella magnolia, which has outlier populations in southern Pennsylvania, “poses little risk” in New England.
Both Sax and Bellemare have pointed out that the threat of negative ecological consequences is likely lessened by the fact that the umbrella magnolia and other forest plants from the Southeast and mid-Atlantic share a biogeographic history with those in New England.
Researchers are only beginning to understand the complexities of the microbes in the earth’s soil and the role they play in fostering healthy ecosystems. Now, climate change is threatening to disrupt these microbes and the key functions they provide.
According to paleoecologists, as the climate cooled and glaciers expanded during the Pleistocene era, forest plants of the Northeast survived by migrating to so-called refugia in the South. When the climate warmed and the most recent ice sheet receded, some species were able to recolonize the habitat they had lost. But others, Sax suspects, were impeded by the human-driven extinction, about 12,000 years ago, of the mastodons, giant ground-sloths, and other megafauna that had dispersed their seeds for millennia. 
“If we still had those big mammals,” says Sax, it’s likely that “many species that are currently restricted to the Southeast or mid-Atlantic would now be in New England.” One of these species may be the umbrella magnolia, which has no apparent modern seed disperser, biologists and horticulturists say, with the notable exception of humans. 
While scientists grapple with the implications of escaped magnolias, there is poetic justice that a plant from the Dickinson homestead has sparked the discussion. Although the view of enduring wilderness championed by Thoreau and John Muir came to dominate conservation thinking, Emily Dickinson, who perceived the beauty and destructive capacity of nature all around her, may be the more appropriate literary icon for an age of climate disruption.

Vast areas of the contiguous US have warmed considerably during winters without becoming unbearably hot during the summers, making the climate generally more agreeable to the public. A new study has found that 80% of the American population lives in areas where the weather has become more “preferable” since 1974.
According to the analysis by Duke University and New York University, 99% of Americans live in places where the average January temperature has increased, with just 60% in locations where the July temperature has risen. Rainfall and humidity changes have also, largely, changed by a favorable degree for many Americans. 
This shift to more temperate conditions means that “virtually all Americans are now experiencing the much milder winters that they typically prefer, and these mild winters have not been offset by markedly more uncomfortable summers or other negative changes,” the paper found.
Even though parts of Louisiana are being gobbled up by the sea, California has experienced its worst drought in a millennium and huge storms have smashed New York and New Orleans in recent years, most of the country has been basking in more bucolic weather changes.
But the situation is set for a radical reversal in the years ahead, the paper warns, with 88% of the US population set to experience temperature and weather trends that are extremely unfavorable by the end of the century.
If greenhouse gas emissions aren’t curbed, summer temperatures will start to rise rapidly, meaning far less comfortable living conditions for millions of Americans. The changes in the climate will also bring about cascading problems affecting ever-increasing numbers of people, including sea level inundation, drought, health problems, food insecurity and extreme weather events.
“If the winter temperatures were becoming much colder, you’d imagine a lot of Americans would find it troubling and unpleasant,” said co-author Patrick Egan, associate professor at New York University. “Here, it’s the opposite. The changes brought about by global warming have increased pleasant weather but when that switches, it may be too late for policy changes to make an impact.”
Rising temperatures have so far been a “poor source of motivation” for the public to vocally demand policy responses to climate change due to this trend, the research, published in Nature, contends.
“Policymakers cannot rely upon Americans’ experiences with the weather to catalyze change,” Egan said. “They will have to look elsewhere to convince them that this a major problem.”
Leading climate scientist Michael Mann, of Pennsylvania State University, said the study was a “solid analysis”. Mann wasn’t involved in the research.
“The population may have been lulled into complacency when it comes to the impacts of climate change by the fact that perceived weather conditions have improved with the moderate warming of the past century,” he told the Guardian. 
“What this neglects, however, is all of the other damaging impacts that climate change has had on our lives which many people may not be perceiving in the passage of day-to-day weather variations, such as the impacts of increasingly devastating droughts, flooding, wildfires and coastal inundation.”
Mann said living conditions will deteriorate with further warming, meaning that the research’s findings are “sobering and they underscore once again the urgency of reducing global carbon emissions”. 
The researchers used data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to assess temperature changes to date and chart future alterations in the climate. 
Temperature data was charted for each of the more than 3,000 counties in the lower 48 states, showing that, on average, winter temperatures have increased by 0.58C per decade, compared to just a 0.07C increase in summer.
Assumptions on what is considered “ideal” weather were taken from several economic reports which show population movement within the US. Climatic conditions, which is a leading reason for people moving locations, were isolated by controlling for factors such as relocating for a new job.
Large parts of Florida, which has experienced a population influx in recent years, are now considered more favorable due to warming temperatures. Areas of America’s southeast have also become much warmer in winter, and therefore more pleasant, although areas of New England and the northwest Pacific coast have largely been bypassed by this trend.
Last year was the warmest on record globally and the second warmest on record in the US, amid rising public concern over the issue. 
Global temperatures have increased by around 1C over the past century, fueled by a rapid rise in carbon dioxide emissions from human activity. In America, a third of emissions come from electricity generation, with industry, transportation and agriculture also major contributors."

The ad comes as a survey revealed 93% of the Great Barrier Reef was affected by the bleaching. That finding motivated the Queensland government to call on the federal government to convene an urgent meeting of the nation’s environment ministers to talk about measures to address climate change in light of bleaching.
Organised by the Climate Council, the full page ad in the Courier Mail on Thursday contains an open letter signed by 56 scientists. 
“One of the reasons we placed the ad in the Courier Mail was that we’ve seen very little coverage of the coral bleaching event in that paper and in fact there was a front-page story that said the coral bleaching event had been wildly exaggerated,” said Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, director of the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland and one of the signatories of the letter.
The letter explains that it is the worst bleaching event in its history, and that it is being driven by climate change.
“The Great Barrier Reef is at a crisis point,” the scientists say. “Its future depends on how much and how quickly the world, including Australia, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit ocean warming.”
It then calls for Australia to rapidly phase out coal-fired power stations and for no new coalmines.
“This must be the top priority for Australia if we are to protect what remains of the Great Barrier Reef and other reefs around the world,” they say. 
Climate Council member and signatory to the letter Lesley Hughes said: “We are now seeing first-hand the damage that climate change causes, and we have a duty of care to speak out.”
On 7 February, the Courier Mail ran a story quoting the federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, as saying the reef remained an untouched beauty. His comments were in response to a David Attenborough documentary about the Great Barrier Reef being aired.
“The key point that I had from seeing the first of the three parts is that, clearly, the world’s Great Barrier Reef is still the world’s Great Barrier Reef,” Hunt told the Courier Mail.
The story included a subheading that read: “Reports of reef’s death greatly exaggerated: Attenborough”.
A News Corp Australia spokesman said on Wednesday that the claim there had been very little coverage of coral bleaching in the Courier Mail was “frankly baffling”.
“A quick Google search shows numerous stories have been published including, to highlight just a few, on March 1st, 21st and 30th. And today the paper has covered the issue extensively once again,” he said.
“Equally importantly the paper also exposed Greenpeace’s dishonesty in using deceptive imagery on two separate occasions. Such scare campaigns only serve to undermine the efforts to secure the reef’s future.” 
A story about the 93% bleaching appeared in Thursday’s paper on page 13.
The Queensland environment minister, Steven Miles, called for an urgent meeting with Hunt, and said “we have to move quickly on climate change,” and bemoaned the “lack of a coherent effective national policy.”
“The federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, has been downplaying the seriousness of the coral bleaching because he knows the major cause is global warming and we still haven’t seen any meaningful climate change policy from the federal level,” Miles said.
The Queensland government itself has been criticised for approving Adani’s Carmichael mine, which would be Australia’s largest coalmine. Federal approval of the mine will be challenged in court this month, on the basis that emissions released when the coal is burned will threaten the Great Barrier Reef."

NZBus runs more than 1,000 buses across New Zealand, carrying more than 50m passengers each year. The US$30m deal will result in a “significant number” of those buses having their combustion motors removed, and replaced with two powerful electric motors, a battery pack, and a gas turbine generator, that will charge the batteries when needed.
Wrightspeed previously retrofitted garbage trucks and FedEx delivery vans with similar technology in the US. But the New Zealand deal is the first move for the company outside the US and the first roll-out of the technology for public transport.
NZBus wouldn’t say how many buses would be converted, but chief executive Zane Fulljames told Guardian Australia the first step would be to convert 60 trolleybuses in Wellington – electric buses that run on overhead wires – to the technology, before moving on to their diesel buses. “It will be a significant proportion of our fleet,” he said.
Fulljames said the first converted buses should be on the road by October.
Wright said that with most countries relying heavily on coal for electricity generation, the on-board gas generator was a cleaner way to charge the batteries than using electricity from the grid.
However, the batteries can also be charged from the grid, which in New Zealand is supplied by an unusually high amount of renewable energy – about 80%.
“In New Zealand it’s unusual in that regard and it’s about the one place you can say it’s cleaner to get it from the grid,” said Wright. “The turbine is about 10 times cleaner than a piston engine,” he said.
By carrying a generator, the buses can carry an order of magnitude less battery power. “If we tried to make one of these buses without the range-extender, it would have to carry about 500kwh of battery packs. We carry less than a 10th of that – about 40kwh.”
Wright said the technology could provide unusually high torque, with two separate motors and four gears. That allowed the buses to go up steep hills, but also gave them very efficient regenerative braking, using the powerful motors to stop the bus, and charging the batteries in the process.
By saving money on fuel and maintenance, Wright said garbage trucks in the US were able to make back the cost of the conversion in just three years.
Last year an Australian company ran a demonstration electric bus, travelling the 1,018km from Melbourne to Sydney without a charge and without an on-board generator. Thousands of all-electric buses with batteries are on the road in China.
Fulljames said NZBus looked at all-electric options but they weren’t powerful enough to climb some of the steep hills in New Zealand and diesel-hybrid buses had significantly higher emissions.
They calculated an ordinary diesel bus would emit 207kg of CO2 per day, but the new converted buses would emit about 23kg of CO2, not including emissions associated with charging the buses from the grid.
“Wrightspeed’s powertrains outperformed the competition on nearly every metric,” Fulljames said.
Fulljames said that as battery prices dropped, NZBus would look at replacing the range-extender with more battery storage, converting the buses to all-electric."

Greg Hunt is about to join 60 heads of state and representatives from more than 150 countries at the United Nations signing ceremony for last year’s Paris climate agreement, and has said Australia will move to ratify it by the end of the year.
That eagerness, in itself, is a step forward. The Howard government refused to ratify the Kyoto protocol for a decade.
Now the bad news. Neither major party has yet advanced a detailed and credible policy to achieve what Australia is solemnly promising.
Bruised by the brutal politics of the barren, wasted years of climate policy war, the major parties are circling and wary – the government trying to manage its sizeable internal climate sceptic faction by saying as little as possible on the subject in the lead-up to the election, Labor making promises and sending signals it is prepared to do much more but hesitating with the detail lest it once again feel the barrage of a full-bore axe-the-tax scare campaign.
Many of the groups hanging on the outcome – climate lobbyists, energy companies, business – are treading carefully too, knowing Australia has delayed sensible policy for so long the situation is now critical, close to an emergency. Elevating hope over experience, they have made the judgement that giving the major parties at least a little bit of breathing space is the best way to return to some semblance of policy common sense.
But the Paris agreement – imperfect and incomplete in parts – does put considerable pressure on Australia (as on all countries) to toughen the targets the Turnbull government has pledged (they have been rated inadequate by the Climate Tracker thinktank and other analysts) and to actually meet them. 
The government insists its “Direct Action” climate policy can meet its Paris pledge – to reduce emissions by between 26% and 28% by 2030, through buying emission reductions with its $2.5b fund as well as other measures.
But data shows Australia’s emissions from electricity generation – around one third of our total emissions – continue to rise and are now 5.5% higher than when the carbon price was repealed. And analysis by Reputex shows Australia’s overall emissions are on track to keep rising through until 2030.
“At a time when almost all developed economies have begun to cut their emissions, including China and the United States, Australia’s national emissions are projected to remain on a growth pathway, with analysis indicating Australia is on track to exceed its historic 2005-06 high, with no peak in emissions expected to occur before 2030,” a Reputex analysis of the government’s emissions figures concluded.
The government has said it will review its policies after the election and change them if necessary. It is widely expected that review will have to toughen the so-called “safeguards” mechanism on industrial polluters, which at the moment is not even trying to reduce emissions, but just aiming to make sure they don’t go up so much that they undo all the emission reductions the government fund is buying. But that would take the Coalition towards a form of baseline and credit emissions trading scheme.
For its part, Labor has said it would make sure 50% of energy came from renewable sources by 2030 and would adopt a target to reduce overall emissions by 45% by 2030 and that one of the policies to get to those aims will be an emissions trading scheme. Given the experience of the Rudd and Gillard years, that’s a significant pledge. 
But it has, as yet, released no specific details, and is likely to announce in the lead-up to the election that an ETS would be phased in, as part of a range of policies to gradually retire older coal-fired power stations and encourage renewables.
Recent analysis found that whichever party wins government, it will need to impose some form of relatively low carbon price, as well as regulations and subsidies to force a change to clean electricity generation and meet Australia’s climate pledges.
It also found that this has to happen quickly to avoid a massive economic shock and a huge disruption in the market and economic activity in 2030 to suddenly accelerate emission reductions enough to reach the Paris goals.
And that’s the importance of what Greg Hunt will pledge at the United Nations. The Paris agreement is the benchmark to measure the yawning gap between scientific and international reality and Australia’s unedifying period of climate policy paralysis. "

 “If you lose trust, you lose everything; and on this issue, you are losing trust,” said the group, in a letter to the Times editor, John Witherow, seen by the Guardian. 
The group says the Times’s coverage: “appears designed systematically to undermine the credibility of climate science and the institutions that carry it out, and the validity of programmes aimed at reducing emissions.”
“Climate science has proven remarkably robust to repeated scrutiny, and multiple lines of evidence indicate that climate change and ocean acidification pose serious and increasing risks for the future,” the group says. “There is abundant evidence also that decarbonised energy systems can provide energy security at reasonable cost if they are properly planned.”
The group say they find two aspects of the Times’s coverage “particularly concerning”. 
According to the signatories: “The first is that neither the quality bar that broadsheet newspapers regularly apply to scientific evidence, nor the simple concept of balance, appear to exist in all of your paper’s reporting on climate change. The second concern is that many of the sub-standard news stories and opinion pieces appear to concern, in some way, the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF).”
The GWPF is a thinktank led by former chancellor and climate sceptic Lord Lawson, and regular Times columnist Viscount Matt Ridley is a member of its academic advisory council. “It would be deeply perturbing to find that a paper as eminent as the Times could allow a small NGO, particularly one whose sources of financing are unknown, a high degree of influence,” says the letter to Witherow.
The signatories of the letter, all members of the House of Lords, include Lord Deben, current chair of the government’s official advisers on global warming, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), as well as Lord Krebs, who chairs the CCC’s adaptation committee and is a former president of the British Science Association.
Seven of the signatories are Fellows of the Royal Society (FRS), the UK’s elite science academy, including two past presidents, Lord Rees and Lord May. The latter is a former government chief scientific adviser. Among the other FRS are Lord Hunt, former head of the Met Office, Lord Oxburgh, former chair of Shell UK, and Lord Stern, author of a landmark analysis of the economics of climate change and a former chief economist at the World Bank. Lord Turner, a former chair of the CCC, and the Bishop of London, also signed the letter.
The letter to Witherow, dated 20 April, takes issue with some of the paper’s recent coverage and cites two recent examples of what the peers consider “poor quality and/or distorted coverage”. 
The writers first single out an article headlined: Planet is not overheating, says professor, in which the Times reported on a study which concluded the global average temperature is likely to remain unchanged by the end of the century.
 “That a paper of the Times’ standing chose to report on this study at all is astonishing, given its poor quality,” the group writes. “Since your article appeared, scientists have commented, for example, that the method used involves ignoring everything that science has discovered about atmospheric physics since the discovery of greenhouse warming by John Tyndall more than 150 years ago … [The study] was not peer-reviewed, and was commissioned and paid for by the GWPF. On social media it has, literally, been a laughing stock.”
The second article was headlined Scientists ‘are exaggerating carbon threat to marine life. The peers write that “the researcher on whose work it was based, Dr Howard Browman, has criticised [the Times] article using terms such as ‘cherry-picking’, ‘sensational’ and ‘disappointing’.”
“Please do not mistake our comments as an attack on press freedom,” the peers tell Witherow. “Nothing could be further from the truth. A healthy, vibrant, inquisitive press is a vital component of a mature democracy, and neither science nor ‘green’ business should be exempt from proper scrutiny. But trust is also essential for any newspaper, particularly one as distinguished as The Times. If you lose trust, you lose everything; and on this issue, you are losing trust.”
The peers said not all Times articles on climate change lacked balance: “Your coverage at the close of the Paris climate summit was both balanced and comprehensive.”
A Times spokeswoman said: “The Times regularly reports on energy and climate change from across the scientific spectrum of debate and, as the peers’ letter acknowledges, our coverage at the close of the Paris climate summit was ‘both balanced and comprehensive’.”
Dr Benny Peiser, director of the GWPF said: “We note that in the Lords this week Lord Krebs was rightly arguing against suppression of scientists giving dissenting advice to government so we are surprised to see him writing to the editor of the Times demanding that it censors its balanced reporting of climate issues. GWPF is an independent thinktank which does not accept any funding from the energy industry, and publishes work by distinguished academics and others, so there is no reason the Times should not cite its work.”"

Prof Justin Marshall has been diving this reef, about 270km north of Cairns, for 30 years. Right now he is, to say the least, angry.
“My veil is down,” he says, no longer bothering with the kind of polite niceties common among academics.
“I have cried. I have broken down in front of cameras. This is the most devastating, gut-wrenching fuck up,” says Marshall, of the University of Queensland.
Back in November, researchers and staff on the Australian Museum’s Lizard Island Research Station started to see the early signs of coral bleaching – faded colours, odd fluorescent hues and chunks of white.
The Great Barrier Reef, of which Loomis is just one of 3,000 reefs, is in the death throes of its worst ever coral bleaching event – part of the third global mass bleaching since 1998.
Latest figures show that 93% of the reef has been impacted by bleaching. The worst affected areas are in the reef’s north.
“Loomis Reef was an amazingly diverse, beautiful little reef about 500 metres long – covered in lots of different coral. Now it’s going to be a big ball of slime,” Marshall says. The past tense, it seems, is deliberate.
“It’s in an area that tourists use – you can pretty much snorkel there right from the shore. You don’t need a boat.
“At the closer end on Loomis there is a nice Porites coral – they can be thousands of years old. The one on Loomis would be maybe hundreds.”
“You get a lot of large fish coming through – there’s a big nurse shark about eight foot long that lives there – beautiful, totally harmless.”
Loomis Reef has a history almost as colourful as the corals that have attracted tourists and scientists for decades.
The reef is named after the late American Henry Loomis and his family, who stumped up $110,000 in the early 1970s to help establish the Australian Museum’s Lizard Island research station.
Henry, who had a background in physics, was a former director of the US government’s Voice of America. His dad, Alfred, was a former Wall Street tycoon and science patron who built his own laboratory so grand it attracted the likes of Albert Einstein. 
Images from Loomis and its neighbouring reefs have been featured around the globe. In particular, there was a spectacular but haunting photograph of a bright orange “Nemo” fish nestling among a bleached sea anemone.
“Any of these animals trying to hide themselves in the coral now stand out against the reef like dogs’ balls,” Marshall says.
A large part of Marshall’s area of expertise is in understanding how ocean animals see underwater – research known as visual ecology (he is best known for studying the amazing vision of the mantis shrimp and its oversupply of photoreceptors).
“But it’s not just the corals but the animals and the fish that live on them,” he says. 
“I have six students on Lizard right now and they have been asking me where all the fish are. Well, they have either moved on, died … I don’t know. But you lose the small fish, then the bigger ones … then it all collapses.”
The mass coral bleaching event started in Hawaii last year before sweeping quickly and mercilessly across reefs around the world.
What is happening on Loomis, is mirrored across the northern parts of the Great Barrier Reef and in coral ecosystems around the globe.
This is Australia’s biggest ever environmental disaster
Corals get their colour and their nutrients from the zooxanthellae algae they live with. When corals sit for too long in unusually warm temperature, the algae and the coral skeleton separates leaving a “bleached” animal behind.
The link between fossil fuel burning, coral bleaching and a long-term trend in rising ocean temperatures is clear, scientists say.
Water temperatures over the Great Barrier Reef’s corals in February and March were the hottest on a record going back to 1900, according to figures cited by the government’s Great Barrier Reef Marine Authority.
Marshall, the chief investigator for citizen science project CoralWatch, expects that “well over 50%” of the corals that have bleached on Loomis are dying or are already dead. Recent photographs show corals covered in algae.
While the global mass bleaching event means Australia loses corals, Marshall points out that for other communities around the world bleaching means “that they can’t feed their kids”.
There are hundreds of millions of people who depend on healthy coral reefs to sustain the populations of fish that make up their diets.
As news of the bleaching spread around the globe, the Australian government granted more approvals for what could be Australia’s largest ever coalmine in Queensland’s Galilee basin.
To Marshall, the timing of the announcement was galling.
“This is not just about little Australia. This is a global event. When we mine coal and sell it, that is killing all reefs – not just ours,” he says.
Marshall remembers the 2014 speech that the US president, Barack Obama, made at the University of Queensland. Obama told the crowd, much to the annoyance of several Australian government ministers, that the reef was in danger and that he wanted it to be there for his children and grandchildren to visit in the future.
“But now we can see it’s not about our grandchildren – it’s our kids. It’s us,” Marshall says.
“It’s happening right now – not in some future where we’re dead. Kids are saying ‘grown ups, what are you doing? You are stealing our future, our livelihood, our wonderment’.
“I have taken my kids to Loomis for the last 15 years. I would not take them there now. This is Australia’s biggest ever environmental disaster.” "

The scientists found the additional 0.5C would lead to longer heatwaves, greater droughts and, in the tropics, reduced crop yield and all coral reefs being put in grave danger.
The global climate change deal agreed in Paris in December pledged to “hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C.” Vulnerable countries, such as low-lying islands, have warned that 2C of climate change would wipe their nations from the map.
Understanding the different impacts from 1.5C or 2C of warming has been made more urgent by the recent run of record temperatures, with 2014 and 2015 breaking long-term records and recent months smashing previous highs. In February, the global temperature was 1.34C above the average from 1951-1980, according to Nasa data. 
The new research was published in the journal Earth System Dynamics, and lead author Carl Schleussner, a scientific adviser at Climate Analytics in Germany, said: “We analysed the climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [and] considered 11 different indicators including extreme weather events, water availability, crop yields, coral reef degradation and sea-level rise. We found significant differences [between 1.5C and 2C] for all the impacts we considered.”
The researchers found: “For heat-related extremes, the additional 0.5C marks the difference between events at the upper limit of present-day natural variability and a new climate regime, particularly in tropical regions.”
The analysis found that regional dry spells increased by 7% with 1.5C of warming but by 11% with 2C, while sea level rises by 10cm more in the hotter scenario. Some regions would be more affected than others with, for example, water availability in the Mediterranean falling by 9% under 1.5C of warming but 17% under 2C.
The research found crop yields might rise in some high-latitude regions, but “tropical regions like west Africa, south-east Asia, as well as central and northern South America are projected to face substantial local yield reductions, particularly for wheat and maize.”
Coral reefs, which provide vital nurseries for many fish on which people rely on for food, would be particularly affected by an additional 0.5C of warming. “In a [2C] scenario, virtually all tropical coral reefs are projected to be at risk of severe degradation due to temperature-induced bleaching from 2050 onwards.” This is reduced to 70% by 2100 for the 1.5C scenario, the scientists found.
Jacob Schewe, one of the research team and at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, said: “Some researchers have argued that there is little difference in climate change impacts between 1.5C and 2C. Indeed, it is necessary to account for natural variability, model uncertainties, and other factors that can obscure the picture. We did that in our study, and by focusing on key indicators at the regional level, we clearly show that there are significant differences in impacts.”
Prof Nigel Arnell, at the University of Reading, UK, who was not involved in the research, welcomed the new study: “This study demonstrates that the impacts in 2100 are lower under a 1.5C world than under a 2C world and that the difference is greater for some sectors than for others. Impacts on heat extremes are most affected. 
“The study also shows that the rate of change over time is really important for future impacts, so in order to really understand the differences between a 1.5C and a 2C world we need to run more comprehensive global climate models with lower rates of [warming] than used so far to see how the climate system responds.”"

A Department for Transport (DfT) study of cars made by manufacturers such as Ford, Renault and Vauxhall found there was a vast difference in nitrogen oxide emissions measured in the laboratory and under normal driving conditions.
Not a single car among 37 models tested against the two most recent nitrogen oxide emissions standards met the EU lab limit in real-world testing, with the average emissions being more than five times as high.
However, the DfT said it had found no vehicles outside the VW group with systems in place to deliberately rig emissions figures. Robert Goodwill, the junior transport minister, said: “Unlike the Volkswagen situation, there have been no laws broken. This has been done within the rules.”
The minister denied that the findings meant the current emissions testing regime was a farce. “But certainly I am disappointed that the cars that we are driving on our roads are not as clean as we thought they might be. It’s up to manufacturers now to rise to the real-world tests and the tough standards we’re introducing,” he said.
The DfT exercise was ordered after it emerged that Volkswagen had allegedly used technology to cheat emissions tests. It measured NOx, or nitrogen oxide emissions. Nitrogen oxide helps to form ozone smog that can badly affect people with chest conditions such as asthma.
The tests were carried out by a team led by Ricardo Martinez-Botas, professor of mechanical engineering at Imperial College London. Among the vehicles tested were 19 models that meet the latest Euro 6 limit of 80mg/km NOx emissions in laboratory tests. Euro 6 was introduced for all new cars sold after September last year. 
When driven in a real-world simulation of urban, rural and motorway travel, the average was nearer to 500mg/km, with some cars getting close to 1,100mg/km.
Among the new models tested that are meant to comply with the Euro 6 standard were the Ford Focus, which had a real-world emission about eight times above the EU limit, the Renault Megane, whose emissions were more than 10 times higher, and the Vauxhall Insignia, almost 10 times higher.
Officials stressed that comparisons directly between models was unfair as they were all tested on different days, with varying temperatures and road conditions.
The study also revealed that none of the 37 top-selling vehicles that were claimed to have met the previous Euro 5 limit of 180 mg/km, in place from 2009 until last year, stayed within that legal level when driven on the road.
The models tested represented 50% of all diesel cars on the roads sold from 2010 to 2015, the report said.
The results do not mean any of the manufacturers other than Volkswagen have potentially broken any laws, because the only legal standard currently is to meet the lab requirement.
In the US it emerged that the of nearly 600,000 Volkswagen vehicles rigged to cheat on diesel emissions tests will have the option to have their cars fixed or bought back by Volkswagen, a federal judge said on Thursday. 
VW may have to spend more than $10bn to comply with the agreement it has struck with the US Justice Department, according to analysts and sources briefed on the deal. The German carmaker admitted in September using sophisticated secret software to cheat exhaust emissions tests.
Industry experts said the car industry faced a crisis similar to recent banking scandals. David Bailey, professor of industry at Aston University, said the government, manufacturers and regulators needed to act on the results of the study. 
“I liken this to the Libor crisis in banking. There is a fundamental question of confidence in the industry,” Bailey said. “Clearly the testing regime needs to more accurately reflect the real world. That is not happening at the moment, not just in terms of nitrogen oxide but fuel efficiency. There is also an issue of accountability and openness for manufacturers in terms of what they put into public domain.”
In the wake of the tests, the government has promised to introduce new “real driving emissions tests” from next year. Initially, manufacturers will be able to sell cars that produce slightly over double the 80mg/km limit on the roads, but from 2020 this will fall to the actual limit.
The report found big variations depending on outside temperatures, with engines producing more emissions when it was cold.
Manufacturers told the DfT that devices to reduce emissions, called exhaust gas recirculation, tended to switch off when it was cold to protect the engine. This partly explained the lower lab emission readings, as these were taken at temperatures of about 20C.
The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said car manufacturers needed to take action. “Following the Volkswagen emissions scandal, the whole of the automotive industry must work hard to restore public trust by being transparent about the systems they employ and advancing plans for introducing cleaner engine technology.”
He added: “I’m disappointed the results are as bad as they are. We expected them to be different by a factor of maybe 0.5 or two on the road compared to the lab, but the levels are disappointingly high – industry needs to raise its game.”
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which represents the auto industry, said it backed the new real-world tests. A spokesman said: “The differences between the results from official laboratory tests and those performed in the real world are well known, and industry acknowledges the need for fundamental reform of the current official test regime, which does it no favours.
“SMMT and industry support the introduction of the proposed new and more onerous test, which will help to reflect better real-world driving.”
Friends of the Earth said properly stringent standards would take too long to come into force, with tens of thousands of people a year dying early because of poor air quality. “This confirms what experts have been saying for years: deadly emissions are far higher in the real world than in controlled tests in the lab,” said Oliver Hayes, from the group.
Jaguar Land Rover said its customers should be confident that its cars were “fully compliant with all current emissions legislations”. It added: “The results demonstrate that Jaguar Land Rover does not use any cheat devices or software. Jaguar Land Rover recognises that there is a difference between lab and real-world test results. We fully support the move towards real-world testing and the greater clarity this will bring for our customer.”
Mercedes said its vehicles had been “certified and licensed in accordance with the applicable legal requirements”. Vauxhall said it “welcomes the clarity provided by the report from the UK government”.
A Vauxhall spokesman added: “Vauxhall is actively engaged in the discussion on RDE (real driving emissions). We strongly believe that the industry has to regain trust by increasing the transparency with customers and authorities, and we have taken definitive steps in this direction.”"

The above-average temperatures were first recorded in December and have continued into April, affecting the oyster, salmon and abalone industries, as well as stressing already declining kelp forests.
Dr Alistair Hobday, a senior principal research scientist with the CSIRO in Tasmania, said the heatwave could be attributed to El Niño, which extends the southern tip of the East Australian Current down to Tasmania, bringing warmer waters with it, and the effects of climate change.
“Part of the warming we just can’t explain as being down to something other than global warming,” Hobday told Guardian Australia. “In about four months – we are doing that work now – we will be able to say that 60% of it is due to climate change and 40% is due to El Niño.”
While the heatwave’s visual impacts were “not as dramatic as the bleaching of the coral reef”, Hobday said it had contributed to the mass death of oysters from Pacific Oyster mortality syndrome (Poms), which had never been reported in the state before devastating Tasmanian oyster farms this summer. 
The higher temperatures were also linked to abalone deaths and a decline in the salmon harvest. 
The effect of the heatwave on local marine species is still being studied, but Hobday said some species, such as the giant kelp forests on the east coast, which have declined by more than 90% in the past 40 years, were already suffering the effects of longer-term warming. Other species have been slowly shifting south.
“It’s the same as when Tasmanian people go to Queensland for a holiday: they can’t stand the heat and humidity, yet Queenslanders who have lived there for some time cope with it fine,” Hobday said.
Ocean temperatures off Tasmania have increased by 2C in the past 100 years, three times the global average ocean temperature rise, and the island sits within a recognised global warming hot spot.
Hobday said the heatwave provided scientists and aquaculture businesses with “a glimpse of the future”.
“People who are involved in ocean businesses are going to have to say, ‘look, if this is what it’s going to be like, we should learn about how to adapt’,” he said. “You just should not ignore a look in the crystal ball.”
Data collected through public reports on RedMap.org.au, a project led by the University of Tasmania’s Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS), have shown an increase in species such as snapper and yellowtail kingfish, which were previously seen in very low numbers in Tasmanian waters. The yellow-bellied sea snake, from the south coast of New South Wales, and jimble jellyfish, usually found only on the north coast of Australia, from Western Australia to Southern Queensland, have also been sighted.
“We are seeing species move – the problem is that different species can do that at different rates,” the University of Tasmania’s associate professor Gretta Pecl, who helps run the project, told Guardian Australia.
“It’s causing these large differences in our ecosystems. The clearest example of that in Tasmania is the long-spined sea urchin, which is moving down the east coast... eating all the kelp forests and leaving behind these rocky urchin barrens that rock lobsters and other organisms don’t like to live in,” she said. “The larvae can survive at 12 degrees, so as our winter temperatures hit that 12 degree threshold now, it’s allowing more and more of them to survive.”
Professor Philip Boyd, with IMAS, said species that preferred cooler waters were at risk of extinction if they could not migrate or adapt in time, or, as the higher temperatures extended south, were left with nowhere to go.
“As you get to the southern extremity of Tasmania, you can’t just keep having these kelp forests, because you run out of coastline and end up in deeper water,” Boyd said. “It’s already undermining the whole ecosystem that’s there.”"

A UK government-sponsored trial launched in the wake of the VW revelations has found that every single one of the diesel-fuelled vehicles tested had higher emissions of nitrogen oxide pollutants than permitted under EU laws. For some models emissions were 12 times the legal limit.
None of the 56 vehicles tested in Germany and 37 in the UK was found to have a defeat device aimed at artificially lowering its emissions under test conditions, such as those used by VW. But all were found to exceed the EU-set standards on air quality and pollution when driven in real-world situations. Clearly there are important questions for manufacturers.
So what is happening? Crucially, the higher emissions were found to be the result of engine management systems that are routinely used by manufacturers to improve the performance of their vehicles. One by-product is more polluting emissions.
Environmentalists say the result is not unexpected. “This confirms what experts have been saying for years: deadly emissions are far higher in the real world than in controlled tests in the lab,” said Oliver Hayes of Friends of the Earth.
“Governments say they are championing ‘real driving emissions’ but this is a smokescreen. These standards are far weaker than those that currently exist.”
This points to the inadequacy of current testing regimes, but it also reveals a much more alarming truth: that manufacturers are tuning their vehicles’ engines in a way that hurts all of us. Engine management systems have become standard across the industry, and these new tests make it clear that they are there for one purpose: to improve the performance of the car, even if that comes at the expense of those breathing in the air from their exhausts.
Diesel engines produce much higher levels of air pollutants than petrol-driven engines, although they produce less carbon dioxide. This has led EU member states to encourage drivers into diesel cars, reducing the impact of driving on climate change but vastly increasing the problem of air pollution.
The UK is one of the few EU countries that tax diesel at the same rate as petrol, as most countries skew their taxation levels to favour diesel (although tax parity still favours diesels because they do more miles per gallon). 
It is ironic that the push for lower carbon dioxide emissions to combat climate change has led to higher air pollution. And the European commission has been slow to get to grips with the problem. A major announcement on air pollution in late 2013 failed to even mention diesel cars. 
But the problem is now pressing, as new research is revealing the extent of the damage being done routinely to our health, particularly the majority of the world’s population who live in cities. About 7% of deaths are caused or contributed to by air pollution, according to the World Health Organisation, and the effects on people’s quality of life is even greater. Long a silent killer, air pollution is now being recognised for its devastating effects, particularly on small children and older people.
The question those breathing the pollution will be asking is whether governments are prepared to act."

The Conservative mayoral candidate’s support for moving the £4.8bn London Pension Authority Fund (LPFA) out of fossil fuel investments is at odds with Boris Johnson, who last year rejected a motion calling for divestment. 
It is believed to be the first time the Tory MP and environmentalist has publicly backed divestment.
In a response to Friends of the Earth asking where Goldsmith stood on several green issues, he wrote that he did not have direct power over the fund: “But the mayor does have the power to appoint people to the [fund’s] board. So I will make my support known for divestment, and will insist a climate expert is appointed, to ensure the risks of a ‘carbon bubble’ is fully understood by board members.”
The carbon bubble is named after the risk of a serious financial hit to oil, coal and gas companies’ value if they are unable to exploit their fossil fuel reserves because of governments’ action on climate change. Last year nearly 200 countries agreed to a long term goal of phasing out fossil fuels.
Labour’s mayoral candidate, Sadiq Khan, has already spoken strongly in favour of divesting the pension fund. “We’ve got hundreds of millions of pounds invested in all sorts of things. I’m going to lead by example and say we’re not going to invest anymore in fossil fuels,” he told the Guardian columnist Owen Jones last year.
Sophie Neuburg, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “It’s fantastic news that, whoever wins, the next London mayor will be committed to divesting City Hall pensions from fossil fuels.
“With world leaders committed to the Paris climate agreement, it’s becoming increasingly clear that most fossil fuels will have to stay in the ground to prevent catastrophic climate change. Gas, coal and oil aren’t just bad for the environment, they are a risky investment too.
“This sends a clear signal to local authorities across the country – it’s time to pull the plug on dirty fossil fuel investments, and get into clean energy instead.”
Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green party London Assembly members last year passed a motion calling on the mayor to push for the fund to divest, though six Conservative members were absent and the other three voted against it. Johnson later rejected the call, saying divestment was a “sudden cliff edge”.
The mayor does not have direct control over the pension fund, though he does have the power to appoint people to its board, which includes two members who have previous experience in the oil industry.
A spokeswoman for the Divest London campaign, said: “We must keep the majority of fossil fuels in the ground to prevent catastrophic climate change. The leading mayoral candidates have realised this and it’s time for the LPFA to do the same.”"

Today, leaders gather again – this time at the United Nations in New York – to sign the landmark agreement.
Two degrees may not sound like a major threat, or even a difficult goal. But limiting average temperature increase could be the difference in assuring our future. A future that includes breathable air, dependable weather patterns, drinkable water, secure food sources and the survival of the ecosystems on which our climate – and human life – depends.
The Paris agreement was not our first effort at tackling the grave issue of climate change. The summits at Copenhagen, Kyoto and Montreal were each an attempt to pull us back from the brink of disaster. But they came up short. For our moment in history, Paris is a critical breakthrough – but it is also just the beginning. We must build on this foundation, and strive for the even more ambitious limit of 1.5C in the coming years, to avoid catastrophic impacts to those least capable of adapting and potentially losing entire island nations to rising seas.
It is a global obligation to ourselves and to future generations. In order to meet it, our work to deliver on the promise of Paris must follow five basic principles:
Emissions reduction is the standard by which climate action must be measured – and only strict limits can help us to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. To drive the reductions at the pace and scale that science demands, we need to implement powerful economic incentives: proven market-based policies that put a price on carbon pollution, make polluters pay for their damage to the climate and reward the innovators and entrepreneurs who develop and deploy cleaner technologies.
We possess the technology – right now – to speed up the transition to 100% clean energy use. This is not the stuff of science fiction: clean energy costs have plummeted and installed capacity is expanding rapidly. The enormity of our energy infrastructure means the transition will take time – but make no mistake, it is happening. Renewable energy will help usher in a new era of economic promise and security for people around the world.
Accelerating the transition means divesting from fossil fuel holdings and investing in clean energy solutions. As companies such as Peabody Coal file for bankruptcy protection, investors should factor in the risk of supporting fossil energy. Policies that support clean energy are coming fast and there are profits to be made.
Our planet’s delicate, irreplaceable rainforests and wild oceans are key to a sustainable future for all life on Earth. Without these incredibly diverse places, we will not be able to sustain a steady climate that works as nature intended: to clean our air and regulate global temperature. No science or technology can replace or replicate these unique natural wonders. Safeguarding the world’s forests and oceans is critical to supporting the livelihoods of the local and indigenous communities that depend on them.
An emphasis on long-term solutions and mid-century goals can obscure the fact that the worst effects of climate change may become irreversible if we don’t take aggressive action now. Controlling methane emissions is the single most impactful move we can make to alter the near-term trajectory of climate change. Manmade methane emissions cause one quarter of the increased warming we are currently experiencing.
Yet cost-effective remedies exist: inexpensive technologies can reduce leaks and venting from existing oil and gas systems immediately; and innovative programmes exist to reduce landfill waste, which releases methane as it decomposes.
Over half the world’s population lives in dense urban areas that generate more than 70% of global emissions. Any long-term changes must involve major cities from both hemispheres. Already, many are serving as models. Vancouver, Sydney, Stockholm, and Las Vegas have already committed to using 100% renewable energy in the coming decades. Other cities must follow their lead.
These are real solutions, many of which are already being implemented in parts of the world to great success. It is up to political and community leaders, businesses, and citizens everywhere to act as guardians not just of this new, aggressive set of standards for climate action – but as guardians of our future.
We know what needs to be done. Together, we must stand up and fight for these meaningful, effective solutions. Failing to do so will unjustly leave our children a world that is hotter, less diverse and more violent and unjust – all things we can avoid with bold action now."

A dozen countries – mainly the small island states at risk of being drowned by rising seas – said they would take the additional step on Friday of ratifying or granting legal approval to the agreement.
The renewed commitments, and the personal appearance at the UN by about 60 heads of state, delivered a sense of momentum to efforts to bring the agreement into force far earlier than had originally been hoped.
The agreement reached in Paris by 196 countries still needs formal approval from 55 countries representing 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions to come into force. In some cases, that means a vote in parliament.
The US, China and India - the three biggest climate polluters - have all committed to join the agreement, possibly as early as this year.
Leaders said the events on Friday were a sign that governments, business leaders and campaign groups were aligned with trying to move swiftly to phase out the use of fossil fuels and move almost entirely to clean sources of energy by the middle of the century.
“Today’s signing ceremony reaffirms the commitments made last December and delivers a jolt of energy to international climate efforts,” Felipe Calderón, the former president of Mexico, said.
The signature ceremony, kicked off by François Hollande, as host of the Paris climate talks, will be an elaborate affair. Leaders will make their way one-by-one in alphabetical order to a special podium at the General Assembly to sign the single copy of the agreement, translated into six languages.
Amid the celebratory atmosphere, with Leonardo DiCaprio scheduled to appear, leaders and scientists agreed: the measures covered by the Paris agreement still fall far short of reaching the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C to 2C above pre-industrial levels, and time is running out.
Last year was the hottest year since record keeping began in 1880. Temperatures for the first three months of this year have already demolished that record – confounding scientists by the scale and pace of temperature rise.
In the Arctic, there was almost no winter, with temperatures at the North Pole rising above freezing even in December, the depths of the polar night. Temperatures were up to 16C above normal.
On Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, some 93% of coral showed evidence of bleaching, because of long term ocean warming due to carbon emissions, and the El Niño weather phenomenon.

The federal environmental minister, Greg Hunt, has joined leaders from 170 other countries in New York to sign the Paris Agreement to limit global warming by at least 2C.
Hunt says Australia will beat its Kyoto emission reduction targets by 78m tonnes and meet a 2030 target of reducing emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels.
“These are some of the highest targets anywhere in the world and certainly on a per capita basis we’re right at the top,” he told the ABC from New York on Saturday.
But the Greens senator Larissa Waters says Australia signing the agreement won’t enable it to avoid warming of 3C to 4C if it’s not backed up by action.
“Unfortunately, minister Hunt likes to bandy about some figures but Australia has been a laughing stock on the international stage,” she said.
“Our pollution reduction targets are so far below the science and people know that our policies aren’t even getting us towards those very low targets.”
Senator Waters rejected the government’s commitment of a further $11m on projects to continue improving water quality on the Great Barrier Reef following a study this week showing 93% of the reef was bleached.
She pointed to the Queensland and federal government’s backing of the Adani coal mine, which critics say will further imperil the reef.
“We need to really have a change of policy when it comes to approving every coal mine anyone ever thinks of and instead really fund and support the transition and speed it up to clean-energy,” Senator Waters said."

Last year, earthquakes, floods, heatwaves and landslides left 22,773 people dead, affected 98.6 million others and caused $66.5bn (£47bn) of economic damage (pdf). Yet the international community spends less than half of one per cent of the global aid budget on mitigating the risks posed by such hazards. 
Robert Glasser, the special representative of the secretary general for disaster risk reduction, said that with the world already “falling short” in its response to humanitarian emergencies, things would only get worse as climate change adds to the pressure.
He said: “If you see that we’re already spending huge amounts of money and are unable to meet the humanitarian need – and then you overlay that with not just population growth … [but] you put climate change on top of that, where we’re seeing an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters, and the knock-on effects with respect to food security and conflict and new viruses like the Zika virus or whatever – you realise that the only way we’re going to be able to deal with these trends is by getting out ahead of them and focusing on reducing disaster risk.”
Failure to plan properly by factoring in the effects of climate change, he added, would result in a steep rise in the vulnerability of those people already most exposed to natural hazards. He also predicted a rise in the number of simultaneous disasters.
“As the odds of any one event go up, the odds of two happening at the same time are more likely. We’ll see many more examples of cascading crises, where one event triggers another event, which triggers another event.”
Glasser pointed to Syria, where years of protracted drought led to a massive migration of people from rural areas to cities in the run-up to the country’s civil war. While he stressed that the drought was by no means the only driver of the conflict, he said droughts around the world could have similarly destabilising effects – especially when it came to conflicts in Africa.
“It’s inconceivably bad, actually, if we don’t get a handle on it, and there’s a huge sense of urgency to get this right,” he said. “I think country leaders will become more receptive to this agenda simply because the disasters are going to make that obvious. The real question in my mind is: can we act before that’s obvious and before the costs have gone up so tremendously? And that’s the challenge.”
But Glasser, speaking ahead of next month’s inaugural world humanitarian summit in Istanbul, said international disaster risk reduction (DRR) efforts remain woefully underfunded. 
According to UN figures, in 2014 just 0.4% of the global aid budget of $135.2bn – roughly $540m – was spent on DRR. Glasser said the UN wanted that proportion to rise to at least 1% and would push for an increase at the Istanbul meeting.
“That would still be a very small amount of money to meet the problem and that is a big challenge,” he said. 
“I used to work for a company that used to say, ‘Once we get a little more money in, we’ll start spending more of it on training our staff. But it’s too tight this year; maybe next year.’ This is one of those things like capacity-building with people: you have to start doing it. You can’t wait. You just have to make choices.”
He said that the internationally agreed Sendai framework for disaster risk reduction, which was adopted last year, offered the best way to reduce the human and financial cost of disasters.
“It’s basically about beginning to think of disaster risk as a core planning activity so that when countries invest in infrastructure they’re not building a hospital in a flood zone or establishing communities in areas vulnerable to storm surges and are not creating risk but identifying ways of reducing it,” he said.
“That’s the only way that I can imagine we’re going to be able to cope at all and even then, it’s a huge challenge to do that.”
The special representative said that DRR simply could not be seen as an adjunct of development or humanitarian relief: they were all part of the same structure. He said that in countries such as Bangladesh, which regularly experiences devastating floods, thousands of lives had been saved over recent decades because DRR had been factored into core economic planning and money invested in infrastructure, storm shelters and early warning systems.
Last year’s earthquake in Nepal was another case in point – and an example of the need for a more holistic approach to development and DRR. 
“If you take Nepal, there was a school safety programme that retro-fitted something like 350 to 400 schools to be prepared for earthquakes. As I understand it, not one of those schools collapsed or was damaged significantly during the earthquake,” said Glasser.
“So this is a great example of the links between sustainable development and risk reduction. There’s something like 35,000 public and private schools in that country. If you build them and they’re not earthquake-resilient, and tens of thousands of them are destroyed, it just highlights that you need to get it right the first time if you’re going to achieve a development outcome like improving literacy or the education of girls.”
Dr Matthias Garschagen, scientific director of the World Risk Report (pdf), said large-scale disasters such as the earthquakes in Nepal and Haiti often act as stark reminders of fundamental development problems.
“Nepal, in a very sad fashion, reminded us of the importance of infrastructure for humanitarian assistance,” he said. “Nepal is a country that is very challenged by its geography and has very limited road and rail networks; there wasn’t the helicopter infrastructure in place to distribute humanitarian assistance in a sufficient manner.”
He said the 2010 earthquake in Haiti – which is estimated to have killed between 90,000 and 316,000 people and displaced more than 1.5 million – served as a warning of the need for building codes, and for health and sanitation plans to deal with the aftermath of a disaster.
But although international attention is quick to focus on huge disasters and lessons are often learned, Garschagen says the momentum is not always sustained.
A recent trip to Indonesia, he said, had yielded evidence of a familiar post-disaster pattern. 
“After the Indian Ocean tsunami there was a lot of attention and international resourcing into building tsunami resilience.
“The tsunami early warning system worked well for three or four years – and worked well institutionally – but afterwards, it started to fade so the equipment hasn’t been well maintained and the institutional capacity-building was not kept alive. In educational terms, the topic [has] faded out of awareness.”
And therein, he added, lies the challenge: “Every time there’s a mega disaster, there are lessons learned – or at least there’s a lot of attention in the scientific and political realm. The key question is always, how do you keep up the awareness after a couple of years?”"

But it’s just the start of a long, hard road";"The danger of gala events like the official signing of the climate change treaty at the UN in New York on Friday, crowned with a guest appearance from Leonardo DiCaprio and with 60 heads of state in attendance, is the impression they create that the job is done. It was certainly a spectacular demonstration of global intent to get more than 170 signatures on the deal agreed in Paris in December at the first time of asking; but what matters is making it legally binding. For that, it must be not just signed but ratified by at least 55 countries, and it must cover 55% of emissions. Nor does the Paris deal go far enough. It was only a step on a long, hard road. The targets that each country set themselves do not go nearly far enough. Now the gap between reality and the ambition of holding global warming below 2C needs addressing. In Churchillian rhetoric, this is not the end, nor the beginning of the end, but it is the end of the beginning.
There are powerful reasons to pursue the Paris summit objective. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, each of the past 11 months was warmer than the 20th-century average. Nasa statistics showed that 2015 was even hotter than the previous record-setting year of 2014. Yet despite the way the evidence is stacking up, political leaders in polluting countries continue to argue about whether and how fast they need to act. In the US, President Barack Obama’s climate plan has hit trouble in the supreme court, where the regulation of emissions from coal-fired plants has been blocked. Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic candidate for the presidency, is pledged to continue Mr Obama’s commitment to tackling emissions, but her probable rival, Donald Trump, is certainly not. The US and China are committed to ratifying the climate change treaty, but for others, such as India, it may be more complicated.
In the UK, 10 years after David Cameron hugged that husky, his record is in tatters. Not only has “the green crap” been whittled back by big cuts in subsidies and incentives that have left solar power, onshore and even offshore wind all less attractive, but policies to limit emissions have been repeatedly portrayed as harmful to the economy. High energy costs have been widely blamed for the crisis in British steel. Yet, while it is true that energy prices are higher than elsewhere in Europe – partly because of climate change programmes and partly because of the fragmented nature of the privatised industry largely beyond government control – they are mitigated by compensation. As fact-checkers point out, for steel, the actual costs of energy policy amount to around just 1% of total manufacturing costs. The double whammy of an uncompetitive currency and a slump in global demand are the real problems that Tata and other steelmakers are facing. Energy costs get the blame because that’s where the government might have real traction.
As divestment lobbies chalk up triumph after triumph, there are signs of parallel trends. In the past few days, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has pulled out of scores of companies for being over-reliant on fossil fuel, and the Rockefeller Foundation has divested from fossil fuel entirely. Yet governments still resist the commitment to greening their economies that will turn the Paris deal from an exercise in global cooperation to a watershed for global warming."

The Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition (CPLC) is a policy-focused alliance of national and subnational governments, intergovernmental agencies, businesses and institutional investors, nonprofits and stakeholder networks. It was launched on the first day of the Paris climate negotiations, and its mission is simple: to collaborate across borders, across sectors, sharing information, know-how and capacity, to build the most economically efficient tools for decarbonization into every nation’s climate plan as soon as possible.
The Paris Agreement calls for non-state support for national climate action. The 17th Sustainable Development Goal is devoted to partnerships that build capacity and speed implementation. At the CPLC table, all of the partners are peers, and this takes the project well beyond the the conventions of global governance: honest and capable support for success is the shared focus, so governments and leading businesses work with intellectuals and policy advocates, to ensure no good thinking is left off the menu.
Asked why he sees this multi-sectoral collaboration as so crucial to success in combating climate change, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said “Putting a price on carbon pollution will cut emissions, improve people’s health, and spur new investments in clean technology,” adding that success “will have a clear impact on our efforts to end extreme poverty in the world in 15 years.”
When Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Hailemariam Dessalegn joined the Carbon Pricing Panel last fall, he said his nation wanted to ensure it followed the most cost-effective route to leadership in the 21st century clean economy. Last week, he said he aims “to build a climate-resilient green middle-income economy.” Ethiopia will also produce “recommendations on the role and possible forms of carbon pricing policies in Ethiopia, which might also be applicable to similar low-income developing countries.”
On Friday, April 15, the CPLC held its first ever High-Level Assembly, a governance meeting bringing together leading diplomats, heads of government, and executive representation of all Coalition partners. Ségolène Royal, Minster of Environment for France, and Feike Sijbesma, CEO of Royal DSM, co-chaired the Assembly. They were joined by Dr. Kim, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, OECD Secretary General Angel Gurría, and Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan of Côte d’Ivoire.
In her opening remarks to the inaugural governing Assembly, Minister Royal called for carbon pricing that is “high enough, significant enough to have a clear and rapid impact on various behaviors, namely on investment choices.” Royal, who is now also President of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Climate Convention, added that “This is the key element of the Paris Agreement.”
Specifically, Article 4 of the Paris Agreement calls on all nations to “promote environmental integrity, transparency, accuracy, completeness, comparability and consistency, and ensure the avoidance of double counting” in designing policy strategies that track, limit or eliminate carbon pollution. Article 6 outlines ways to transition market mechanisms developed under the Kyoto Protocol into a sharing of responsibility for climate action across borders, in fulfillment of new national climate action commitments. 
As a venue to share policy aims, build new collaborative strategies, and work toward ensuring best practices are made available to all policy-makers, the CPLC has a real chance to ensure effective, efficient, and equitable strategies are part of every nation’s climate action agenda. Some approaches focus on covering one or more sectors of the economy—power generation, transport, agriculture. Others prioritize rewarding early actors while limiting emissions overall. But a simple fee applied to carbon-emitting fuels at the source with revenues recycled back into the economy can cover all sectors while adding day to day economic value at the human scale.
It is due to the already serious work being done between the CPLC partners that six heads of state, along with the leaders of the World Bank, IMF and OECD, were able to issue such a bold call to action on the day before the Paris Agreement was signed. Their Vision Statement calls for an expansion in carbon pricing policies from covering 12% of global greenhouse gas emissions now to 25% by 2020, then doubling again to 50%within ten years.
Those targets are the framing of a 10-year vision for broadening carbon pricing coverage, deepening carbon pricing where it exists, and expanding and enhancing international cooperation, through a well-designed, diverse, multisectoral coalition of working partners. This first-of-its-kind international policy collaboration is an effort to ensure we transition efficiently to climate-smart energy practices. No community should suffer the degradation brought on by pervasive climate disruption, and all nations can and should be part of a new and inclusive economy of sustainable shared prosperity.

The newspaper started to award a bag of coffee and a certificate to any angler who landed a cod over 30kg (66lb).
Now the paper’s records, painstakingly compiled over the decades, bear witness to a remarkable outcome of climate change and far-sighted fisheries management.
The catch of monster cod has exploded in the last five years, as the fish have feasted on shoals of capelin thriving in warmer waters. Meanwhile, commercial fishing has been tightly controlled, allowing the fish to age and grow … and grow and grow. 
Anglers are catching unheard of numbers of kaffetorsk, or “coffee cod”, and the Lofoten Post has had to give away almost half a tonne of coffee this year. As of last weekend, 490 giants had been reported, up from 289 last year and just 49 in 2010. The biggest was 45kg (99lb).
Managing cod stocks is not rocket science – it is much more complicated than that
“Commercial fishing and angling are extremely important for Lofoten, and the kaffetorsk have become a concept, almost a brand,” says Kai Nikolaisen, the paper’s official coffee-cod correspondent. “I walk through the harbour and fishermen say look, that’s the kaffetorsk guy. When I started the job in 2006, we had only a dozen such fish every year.”
Commercial fishermen support the Lofoten Post’s less than scientific observations.
“We’ve seen a lot of big cod this season, that’s a fact – this year seems to have been extraordinary,” says Jan-Erik Indrestrand for the Norwegian Fishermen’s Association, the professional fishing union.
Anglers have come from abroad to enjoy the bonanza. Last month British pensioner Bert Williams reeled in a 42kg (93lb) animal, the largest ever caught by a Briton, further north up the coast at Sørøya. Two weeks earlier a Swede, Marica Eriksson, broke the world record for a fish landed by a woman, at 38kg (84lb). 
The phenomenon of massive cod is partly due to the warming climate, which has greatly expanded the area where the cod can feed, says Knut Korsbrekke, a specialist at the Institute of Marine Research in Bergen. But Norway also began to place limits on the commercial harvest in the 1980s, and this is bearing fruit, he says. In 1989, after an “extreme cooling event” in the Barents Sea when stocks declined rapidly, Norway and Russia agreed to close down the fishery altogether.
“Try doing that in the EU,” says Korsbrekke, who compares the “huge success” of Arctic fisheries management with the North Sea, where overfishing has meant cod populations are still only a quarter the size they were in the 1970s. North Sea cod stocks are a “terrible mess”, he says, as countries haggle over quotas. In contrast, Norway and Russia have a long history of successful cooperation.
“Managing cod stocks is not rocket science – it is much more complicated than that,” Korsbrekke says.
Each female lays some 8m eggs, 1.3mm across; at peak spawning in early spring, the density of eggs can be as high as 28,000 per square metre. Were all the Barents Sea spawn to be placed side by side, an egg at a time, they would stretch for more than 1bn km, Korsbrekke has calculated.
But only two eggs per female survive to become mature fish. It takes between 10 and 15 years for them to grow to 30kg, and perhaps as long as 20 – fish can be aged by counting the growth rings in an ear bone, like a tree. And while some cod can live 30 years, the potential for them to grow so large depends on availability of food, and modest harvesting rates.
Favourable conditions due to climate change have happened before – the 1930s saw a similar warm period when cod stocks took off, and huge fleets of trawlers landed hundreds of thousands of tonnes before the war. But it is not easy to predict whether the current trend towards an abundance of Barents Sea cod will continue, Indrestrand says. Russia is reporting “vast amounts” of small cod at great depths in the east, possibly related to falling temperatures.
“It is normal that the bigger fish arrives first, while in the later part of the season we see a more mixed population with a lot more of the smaller, more normal, fish,” Indrestrand says. “So the big cod may not reflect the real situation in the stock.”
Commercial fishermen used to be at loggerheads with scientists demanding stock control, says Korsbrekke. “But we have established a level of trust – we are working for the fisherman too, to create a healthy ecosystem that can be harvested sustainably. As soon as they realise that our objectives coincide, they cooperate.”
Norwegian anglers have had their share of luck, with the warming climate roughly doubling the area where the cod can thrive and reach such staggering size. But they are also reaping the rewards of human intervention, Korsbrekke says.
“It pays to utilise the resource in a rational way.”"

Here in Pakistan, media plays a huge role in opinion making. Sadly there are other issues which usually dominate TV talks shows and print media. There is an issue of prioritisation and obviously media would have to cater to business interests as well. Climate change probably does not sell very well.

Cars are a symbol of wealth and prosperity in industrialising countries, so asking people to give up on owning and using a car is a pretty big ask. But the impact of crowded roads is easy to highlight – excessive pollution, health issues like asthma and respiratory disorders, congestion. This is stuff that most people can understand since they are affected directly. So it helps sometimes to work backwards and highlight the human impacts.

Climate change is asking us to care about people we’ve never met and to fight for their happiness as well as our own. I have family in the mid-west who I love deeply but who can’t wrap their heads around climate change because it’s “away”.

Speaking at a sustainability event in London, Sir David argued innovation to bring down the cost of clean technology would bring swifter results.
“I don’t think it [carbon pricing] is a fast enough driver for change,” he told Climate Home on the sidelines. “It needs to go hand in hand with other regulatory systems.”
His stance contrasts with the priorities of neighbouring France and indeed the UK government’s line within the EU.
Last week, France was among six countries calling for an expansion of carbon pricing to cover half the world’s emissions by 2030.
President Francois Hollande promised to make France a “role model”, charting a path to a price of €100 a tonne. On the EU market, permits trade at €5/t.
The World Bank and IMF champion emissions trading or taxes as the main lever to cut emissions, supported by many large corporations.
Yet Sir David said these mechanisms were unlikely to take effect early enough to hold warming to 2C or 1.5C – the international goal agreed in Paris last December.
“I don’t see India, China or South Africa coming in with a sufficiently high carbon price to drive them off coal,” he said.
Instead, he called for efforts to make clean technology cheap enough to compete with traditional energy sources.
Sir David was one of the architects of Mission Innovation, a commitment by 20 governments to double research funding to $20 billion within five years.
“The point of Mission Innovation is to make sure we have all the technology we need to move away from a fossil fuelled economy,” he said.
“Once you get to the point where the prices are competitive, you no longer really need a carbon price.”
Renewables development is “self-accelerating”, as increased demand brings prices down, which encourages further take-up.
Within the EU, Britain pushed the rollout of emissions trading a decade ago. Sir David said that had helped bring reluctant member states on board with the climate agenda.
He hinted at disagreement with UK lobbying to limit alternative climate policies that might interfere with the market price signal, however.
Asked about the UK position, he said: “There is a tension between those who see the free market as the overall objective and those who see the need to reduce CO2 emissions quickly.”"

Members of the transport select committee said the government had been “phenomenally complacent” and that VW lawyers would be “popping champagne corks” after Robert Goodwill, the minister of state at the Department for Transport, said he had not discussed a possible prosecution.
Appearing before the committee on Monday afternoon to discuss the vehicle programme testing in the light of the emissions scandal, Goodwill said that he was shocked that real world tests conducted by the DfT found that emissions of NOx were 12 times higher in a range of vehicles.
Yet although Goodwill said that the testing confirmed VW had used a defeat device, the minister would not comment on whether it was illegal, claiming it was a matter for the courts. 
However, Goodwill said that he had not pushed for any move by the Serious Fraud Office, despite similar action abroad, including the success of the US government in reaching a settlement last week. Asked about compensation, he said: “I’m not a lawyer. You’ve have to demonstrate material loss.”
The minister added that he was more concerned with people breathing air that had become more polluted by higher NOx emissions. 
Reacting to suggestions that Britain’s reaction was “phenomenally complacent”, Goodwill said: “I’d not accept that. We are the first member state to publish details of our own testing programme – we’ve established that defeat devices are not widespread.”
The Conservative MP Mark Menzies said that VW had “deceived this committee and the people of this country”, adding: “Do you not think that the government has got a duty to bring a prosecution? Can I make sure you hold VW to account?”
While at a previous hearing Patrick McLoughlin said VW “behaved appallingly” and was using illegal devices, Goodwill refused invitations to repeat his condemnation. 
The Labour MP Graham Stringer added: “It seems you are more concerned with protecting the reputation of VW as opposed to punishing them for poisoning the people of this country. VW lawyers will be popping very expensive bottles of champagne tonight after this performance, minister.” 
Goodwill said the DfT would be conducting further tests, at a cost of £2m to the taxpayer. 
Testifying earlier to the committee, the head of consumer group Which? said the government had been “woefully slow”. Richard Lloyd told MPs: “In the US the authorities have been much more proactive, much quicker – they put enormous pressure on VW and as a result US consumers are at the front of the queue for compensation.
“Given the loss of trust in VW, given that the government has carried out tests and presumably has data, the government needs to equip consumers. The DfT has been woefully slow and hasn’t given consumers enough independent verified information for them to make a judgement as to whether they should make a legal claim, join in a representative action, or merely wait for how many months for VW to get in touch with them to change the software.”"

At least 34 countries representing 49% of greenhouse gas emissions formally joined the agreement, or committed to joining the agreement as early as possible this year at a high-profile signing ceremony at the United Nations last Friday.
That brought the historic agreement closer to the critical threshold for becoming operational faster than expected, officials said. 
“The progress that [was] made in only hours and days after the agreement was formally opened for signing now puts us within striking distance of entering into force years earlier than anyone would have anticipated,” Brian Deese, a White House adviser, told a conference call with reporters.
The gathering at the UN made other advances towards dealing with climate change, the White House said. 
The World Bank, along with countries such as Canada and Mexico, earlier this month endorsed setting a price on carbon.
But economists and scientists say governments are still moving too slowly to map out a long-term future free of coal, oil, and gas – even as rising temperatures and melting polar ice unleashes havoc in real-time. 
About 175 governments took a first step of signing onto the deal on Friday. The action, though entirely symbolic, had maintained important momentum since the Paris climate meeting last December, the White House said. 
China, which on its own accounts for about 20% of global emissions, told the UN it would finalise domestic procedures to join the agreement before the G20 meeting in September. Other industrialised countries offered similar pledges to submit the agreement for approval to parliament.
The agreement reached in Paris seeks to avoid catastrophic climate change by limiting warming to 1.5C to 2C. Governments committed to replacing fossil fuels almost entirely by clean energy in the second half of this century. 
But first the deal must become operational – a threshold required the formal approval of 55 countries accounting for 55% of global emissions.
By the UN’s count, the Paris climate deal was already very close. At least 15 countries formally joined the agreement on Friday. They included mainly small island countries at risk of drowning in rising seas, but also Palestine and Somalia.
The White House said the count was now up to 34 for countries that have formally joined the agreement, or were committed to joining this year. 
Together, they represent about 49% of global greenhouse gas emissions, Deese said. 
The White House has been an important cheerleader for the global agreement – despite legal challenges and opposition from Republicans in Congress and the party’s presidential candidates to its efforts to cut climate pollution from power plants – Barack Obama’s signature climate plan."

Of the organisation’s remaining 75 to 80 climate scientists, half will go to the Tasmanian centre.
The federal science and environment ministers welcomed the move but senior climate scientists in the CSIRO said it still represented a large cut to Australia’s climate science capability and expressed concern for the future of those scientists not moving to the new centre.
In a statement released on Monday evening, the CSIRO said the Hobart centre would employ 40 scientists and have funding secured for 10 years.
On Tuesday morning, the CSIRO’s chief executive, Larry Marshall, announced that 75 positions would be cut from the oceans and atmosphere business unit rather than the 110 originally announced. 
More details were expected to be released after a meeting of the unit on Tuesday afternoon.
The CSIRO also announced the establishment of a national climate science advisory committee, which would report at a ministerial level.
Senior climate scientists in the CSIRO told Guardian Australia they first heard about the changes from the media, including details of the meeting. One said the changes were a “fig leaf” designed to mute the issue as the election approached.
“They’re trying to get it off the front pages of the newspapers because the Labor party decided to make an election issue out of it,” he said. “They’re going to say – we’ve given you what you want, take it or leave it.”
 It was unclear whether the positions that were not part of the new centre would survive further cuts, he said.
“It’s a con,” another senior CSIRO climate scientist said. “What happens to those other jobs? Are they prepared to cut those?”
Scientists also questioned why the centre would be based in Hobart, suggesting it might be politically motivated. 
Internal emails released to the Senate earlier this month had referred to the political implications. 
On 28 January the director of the Oceans and Atmosphere unit, Ken Lee, said he would continue to work on ways to “minimise impacts on Hobart”. He said any cuts “need to address loss of employment in Tas (a regional political issue)”.
A senior scientist in CSIRO said the question of which jobs would be made redundant should be based on what capabilities were needed, not where the scientists were based.
The federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, told ABC radio on Tuesday the government had helped to “broker” the new arrangement.
“From what was frankly a difficult situation we worked to engage with the organisation and to get I think the longest, deepest national climate science program that Australia has ever had,” Hunt said.
Scientists who spoke to Guardian Australia flatly rejected that suggestion. The centre would hold the remnants of a severely reduced climate science capability in the CSIRO, they said. Funding for climate science was severely reduced when the Coalition cut the Australian climate change science program after the 2013 election.
Labor’s research spokesman, Kim Carr, said the move was nothing more than a political fix. He said the move showed the government was happy to intervene, but was not interested in saving “the jobs or CSIRO’s international reputation”. He called on the government to put the changes on hold until staff were properly consulted.
“This announcement is a marginal seats strategy, not a science strategy,” he said.
According to internal CSIRO documents seen by Guardian Australia, the new centre will house the organisation’s climate modelling and measurement projects. Many scientists had feared the modelling capability would be lost but the documents suggest the CSIRO will continue to invest in it. 
The centre would “sit alongside key collaborators and CSIRO’s science and engineering capability supporting the Marine National Facility, the RV Investigator”, the documents say.
Andy Pitman, the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science at the University of NSW, said there were not enough details in the announcement to judge whether Australia would maintain an adequate climate science capability. He said if the 40 scientists in Hobart were required to maintain the climate measuring, the model development and climate projections, there simply wouldn’t be enough people.
“This is a good news story relative to the initial cut,” he said. “This is a catastrophic story because Australia is significantly cutting its capability.”"

Technologies that remove carbon dioxide from the air are assumed in the models that avoid dangerous climate change – but such technologies do not yet exist and it is unclear whether they could be deployed at a meaningful scale.";"The scenarios modelled for the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report assume the large-scale deployment of technologies that achieve negative emissions that draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and permanently store it. But whether such proposed methods could be deployed at a material scale is unproven. It would be more prudent to exclude these techniques from mitigation scenarios used by the IPCC, unless and until we have sufficient evidence of their availability and viability to support their inclusion.
Most of the modelled emissions pathways limiting warming to 2 °C (and all the ones that restrict the rise to 1.5 °C) require massive deployment of Biomass Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). This involves growing biomass which is used to generate power and geologically sequestering the carbon dioxide produced. While the constituent steps of this process have been demonstrated, there are but a few, small, examples of the combined process. To rely on this technique to deliver us from climate change is to demonstrate a degree of faith that is out of keeping with scientific rigour.
There is a distinct lack of evidence to determine whether BECCS is technically feasible, economically affordable, environmentally benign, socially acceptable and politically viable at a material scale. Technically, there are serious doubts about the ability to sequester the vast quantities of carbon dioxide that are implied in the models. Economically, without a substantial carbon price, the costs would be much higher than competing power-generation technologies. Environmentally, growing such volumes of biomass would have profound effects on biodiversity. Socially, the use of land for BECCS would restrict agriculture – contributing to substantial increases in food prices; while politically, the issue seems so toxic that the Paris Agreement carefully avoided mentioning negative emissions at all. Such impacts would not be material were BECCS to be deployed at a small scale, but the economic scenarios consistent with 1.5 °C (or even 2°C) assume that BECCS is deployed at a truly gargantuan scale, at which these adverse impacts would indeed be material. 
For a technology to be deployable it needs not only to work, but also to possess a social licence to operate. For example, that Germany possesses the technical ability and financial means to build new nuclear power plants is not in question, but lacking the social and political will to do so makes the point moot. 
The IPCC’s own scenario database suggests that the ambition of the Paris Agreement cannot be achieved without negative emissions technologies. Even with rapid decarbonisation, there will be a need to achieve net negative emissions during the second half of this century. That objective cannot be achieved from a standing start. Well-functioning methods would need to be developed and rolled out at a rate unprecedented in human history. Yet to model what you want to happen, rather than what there is evidence could happen, is to lose the thread of reality. It is redolent of a defeated leader issuing orders to armies that have long since ceased to exist – not so much vision, as delusion. 
Should modellers be able to model what they like? Of course. Scenarios allow us to undertake useful thought experiments that provide us with the means to assess potentially novel approaches.
But it is hazardous to rely on science fiction in the development of the scenarios that are used to inform policymakers. To include scenarios for avoiding dangerous climate change that employ entirely speculative approaches seems reckless in the extreme. 
Some will defend the use of these technological imaginaries in IPCC scenarios by arguing that without them hopes of avoiding dangerous climate change are forlorn and that this would generate a degree of despair that would undermine the will to act. 
But that is not the role of models. “Fake it ‘til you make it” may work as a tactic, but it is a lousy strategy. As the dust settles on the Paris Agreement and policymakers face up to the challenge of achieving the ambition set out by their leaders, we need to reflect on what actually needs to happen. Policymakers can only hope to develop realistic plans, if the basis on which they are making those plans is itself realistic. While the boundary between ambition and delusion may be not be entirely sharp, the inclusion of negative emissions amounting to 600-800 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (equivalent to 15-20 years of current annual emissions) is clearly more than a stretch goal. For this reason, negative emission techniques should be excluded from the mitigation scenarios used by the IPCC unless and until there is sufficient evidence to warrant their inclusion and then only on a scale that is demonstrably realistic. 
The IPCC recently announced a Special Report on the 1.5 °C target. To be credible, this must include detailed assessment of proposed negative emission techniques, drawing on a wide range of expertise from natural sciences, engineering, social sciences and the humanities to assess to what extent, if any, such approaches could be deployed without creating countervailing side-effects. 
On the basis of such a comprehensive assessment, policy makers will then have to make an explicit decision either to invest in the necessary research, development and demonstration of the technologies or to explain how they propose to meet their ambitious targets without such interventions. Policymakers cannot be allowed to hide behind the vague language of the Paris Agreement (“achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases”). 
In the absence of comprehensive research and indications of political feasibility, it seems prudent to exclude from the models what is currently magical thinking. Only by undertaking research will it be possible to determine whether today’s science fiction could be transformed into tomorrow’s science reality.

Never before has it been possible for people from all over the world to access the latest information and collectively seek solutions to the challenges which face our planet, and not a moment too soon: the year 2015 was the hottest in human history, and the Great Barrier Reef is suffering the consequences of warming oceans right now. 
Yet despite the scientific consensus that global warming is real and primarily due to human activity, studies show that only about half the population in some countries with among the highest CO2 emissions per capita understand that human beings are the driving force of our changing climate. Even fewer people are aware of the scientific consensus on this question. We live in an information age, but the information isn’t getting through. How can this be?
While the internet puts information at our fingertips, it has also allowed misinformation to sow doubt and confusion in the minds of many of those whose opinions and votes will determine the future of the planet. And up to now scientists have been on the back foot in countering the spread of this misinformation and pointing the public to trustworthy sources of information on climate change. 
Climate Feedback intends to change that. It brings together a global network of scientists who use a new web-annotation platform to provide feedback on climate change reporting. Their comments, which bring context and insights from the latest research, and point out factual and logical errors where they exist, remain layered over the target article in the public domain. You can read them for yourself, right in your browser. The scientists also provide a score on a five-point scale to let you know whether the article is consistent with the science. For the first time, Climate Feedback allows you to check whether you can trust the latest breaking story on climate change.
Last year the scientists looked at some influential content. Take the Pope’s encyclical, for instance. The scientists gave those parts of the encyclical relating to climate science a stamp of approval. Other “feedbacks,” as we call them, have made a lasting impact. When the scientists found that an article in The Telegraph misrepresented recent research by claiming that the world faced an impending ice age, the newspaper issued a public correction and substantially modified the online text.
But there’s more work to be done. Toward the end of the year the scientists carried out a series of evaluations of some of Forbes magazine’s reporting on climate change. The results give an idea of the scale of the problem we’re tackling. Two of the magazine’s most popular articles for 2015, one of which attracted almost one million hits, turned out to be profoundly inaccurate and misleading. Both articles, reviewed by nine and twelve scientists, unanimously received the lowest possible scientific credibility rating. This rarely occurs, and just in case you’re wondering, yes, the scientists do score articles independently: ratings are only revealed once all scientists have completed their review.
We argue that scientists have a moral duty to speak up when they see misinformation masquerading as science. Up to now scientists have however had little choice but to engage in time-consuming op-ed exchanges, which result in one or two high-profile scientists arguing against the views of an individual who may have no commitment to scientific accuracy at all. Climate Feedback takes a different approach. Our collective reviews allow scientists from all over the world to provide feedback in a timely, effective manner. We then publish an accessible synthesis of their responses, and provide feedback to editors so that they can improve the accuracy of their reporting.
We’ve got proof of concept. Now we need to scale up, and for that we need the support of everyone who values accuracy in reporting on one of the most critical challenges facing our planet. Climate Feedback won’t reach its full potential until we start measuring the credibility of news outlets in a systematic way. We want to be in a position to carry out an analysis of any influential internet article on climate change. We want to develop a ‘Scientific Trust Tracker’ – an index of how credible major news sources are when it comes to climate change.
We’re all increasingly relying on the internet to get our news. But the internet has engendered a competitive media environment where in the race to attract the most hits, sensational headlines can trump sober facts. We’re building into the system a new incentive for journalists with integrity to get ahead. Some journalists are already coming to us, asking our network of scientists to look at their work. We want readers to know which sources they can trust. We want editors to think twice before they publish ideological rather than evidence-based reporting on global warming.
On Friday 22 April 2016, more than 170 countries signed the Paris climate agreement. But this unprecedented international treaty will lead to real action only if the leaders of those countries can garner popular support for the measures needed to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The fate of the Paris deal lies largely in the hands of voters in democratic countries, and we cannot expect democracies to produce good policy responses to challenges of climate change if voters have a confused understanding of reality.
Scientists from all over the world are standing up for better informed democracies. You can help them make their voices heard. We invite you to stand with us for a better internet. We invite you to stand with science.

Kevin Faulconer, the mayor of San Diego, could therefore qualify as one of the most outlandish, as well as green-tinged, Republicans in the US. Faulconer has thrown his weight behind a binding plan to make San Diego run on 100% renewable power by 2035 – the largest American city to have such an ambition.
Faulconer is as much a product of his largely liberal surrounds as he is of his party, of course. The 49-year-old mayor will march for LGBT pride and supports a path to US citizenship for undocumented immigrants.
But San Diego’s bipartisan push to embrace clean energy such as solar and wind, while radically paring back greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050, is a glimpse into how the rancorous brawls over climate change could have been avoided across the rest of the US.
“This isn’t a partisan issue,” Faulconer told the Guardian. “I’ve said from the very beginning there’s enough partisan politics at the national level. I was a volunteer for our parks before becoming mayor; I love our natural resources, our beaches and landscapes. I feel strongly about protecting them.”
While Republicans, including Florida senator Marco Rubio, have warned any action to cut emissions will raise power bills and lead to economic ruin, Faulconer has sold a vision of low-carbon innovation, jobs and clean air. San Diego’s business community is now on board, although Faulconer admitted it took “a lot of persuasion”.
“I pride myself on being fiscally responsible and environmentally conscious,” he said. “The two aren’t exclusive. I’ve never seen it as a zero sum game. We want a plan that is ambitious and leads the way for the rest of the country.”
A plan endorsed unanimously by San Diego’s Democrat-dominated council in December would see America’s eighth largest city transformed into one riddled by bicycles and public transport, with roofs swathed in solar panels. The city will switch half its fleet of vehicles to electric power, and almost all the methane from sewage and water treatment will be recycled.
A key selling point for the plan is the resulting jobs and investment in clean energy – San Diego ranks second in the US in electrical output from solar energy, and the city is openly courting clean tech firms to set up shop there. It already derives 40% of its power from clean sources. But public concern about climate change is also a key driver.
“People have seen and felt the drought, the wildfires, the flooding,” said Nicole Capretz, who wrote the first iteration of the climate plan before the controversial exit of previous mayor Bob Filner. “People were witnessing a lot of things in their backyard. When you see your quality of life is at risk, people start to wake up and say ‘it’s time.’”
“The beautiful part about having a Republican mayor embrace this plan,” she added, “is that he did outreach to his own friends and factions and persuaded them it was the right thing to do for economic reasons.”
There remain hurdles for San Diego to clear. An implementation plan has yet to be finalized but much will rest upon an intervention into the electricity market. San Diego’s utility has said it cannot meet the 100% renewable goal itself, meaning that the city will have to branch out to source its power elsewhere while the utility retains control over poles and wires.
“There’s a battle brewing on that,” Capretz admitted. “It’s the largest part of the climate plan – we can’t get to the goal without it.”
On the plus side, the 2035 decarbonization plan is legally binding, unlike the aspirations of other large cities. And some measures should be straightforward to achieve, such as an initiative to increase San Diego’s tree canopy cover to 35%, which would soak up carbon and help cool the city with more shade. 
Improvements to train and bike infrastructure should also prove popular, but a price tag has yet to be put on this. It’s likely that help from Californian or federal coffers will be required.
Regardless of whether the target is met, San Diego is among a large group of cities impatient with federal government bickering over climate change. Municipalities from New York to San Francisco have goals to either majorly or completely switch to renewable energy, while Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, has spearheaded an international coalition of mayors that is looking to wean urban areas off fossil fuels.
While a record number of nations have signed up to cut emissions, there is still a significant gap between their pledged action and what is required to avoid the worst ravages of climate change, such as drought, extreme weather events and sea level rise. Faulconer said this shortfall can be plugged, in part, by cities taking the lead.
“Cities are leading the federal government, yes,” he said. “They are leading on innovation and policy. The technology is advancing incredibly quickly. We need to have our eyes wide open on this.”"

The policy will cost $355.9m over four years, with $300m earmarked to help regions and industries facing upheaval in the transition to a cleaner economy.
As Australia’s greenhouse emissions from electricity generation continue to rise, Labor’s policy promises to speed the shift to renewables, through a radical plan under which power generators would be forced to pay for the closure of a competitor’s dirty brown-coal fired plant and also through an electricity-industry specific “intensity based” trading scheme, similar to the kind of scheme many in business expect will be created post-election after a review of the Coalition’s Direct Action plan.
But the policies have been cautiously crafted – and some crucial details deferred – to avoid a repeat of the anti-carbon tax campaign waged by the Coalition in the past.
The intensity-based scheme would require generators with an emissions intensity above an electricity industry wide baseline to buy “credits” from those below it – effectively penalising polluting power stations and rewarding clean ones.
The idea was most recently proposed by the Australian Energy Market Commission in a submission to the Coalition government, with the AEMC stating that it could operate “without a significant effect on absolute price levels faced by consumers.” The plan is similar to the model originally proposed by Turnbull in 2009 when he was opposition leader, and to the sort of scheme that could evolve from existing Coalition policy if the government “ratchets up” the baselines, leaving open some prospect of bipartisanship in the bitterly-contested policy area.
Australian National University academics first proposed the second-part of Labor’s policy – the radical scheme under which big brown-coal generators, near the end of their operational life, would submit bids for how much money they would need to receive in order to shut straight away and deal with the community and employment fallout, with the cost of the winning bid spread across all the other generators in the market, who would enjoy higher prices because of their competitor’s closure. 
The academics estimated the scheme could cause a one-off rise of between 1% and 2% in retail power bills, but subsequent modelling by Reputex found the impact could be even lower – between 0.2% and 1.3%.
Labor is hedging on the third aspect of its policy to force change on national electricity generation – the possibility of an extension to the renewable energy target – saying it remains committed to to its 50% renewable generation target by 2030 but would consult on what extra policies might be needed to achieve it, with a further RET not the favoured option.
With the costs of “gold plating” investments in poles and wires now washed through the electricity market, residential power prices are forecast to fall in coming years, meaning Labor is likely to argue that any minor cost increases from its policies will be barely noticed.
The ALP is also taking a highly cautious approach to reducing emissions from heavy industry, proposing a two-stage ETS and deferring decisions on details.
Between 2018 and 2020 a “cap” would be imposed on big industrial emitters, but those exposed to international competition exceeding the cap would be allowed to meet their entire liability by buying international permits, currently priced at less than $1 a tonne. This means the cost would be minimial.
After 2020 the scheme would morph into a more traditional ETS, but Labor says it will consult on the details. Agriculture, road transport and refrigerants will be left out of the first phase of the scheme.
The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, who will unveil the policy with his environment spokesman, Mark Butler, on Wednesday, said that unlike the Coalition, Labor accepted climate science and was prepared to avoid the high costs of inaction.
“We do not consider climate change a question of ‘belief’, we know it is an economic and environmental reality ... The cost of inaction, to our economy and the environment, will be profound. This is not a price Labor is prepared to make the next generation of Australians pay,” he said.
 Labor’s policy would also:
When Labor first committed to the 45% reduction several Coalition frontbenchers, including the environment minister, Greg Hunt, said Labor’s plan would cost the economy $600bn.
That claim was discredited by the leading economist Warwick McKibbin, in modelling done for the government, who found that a 45% reduction in emissions would result in a loss 0.7% of Australia’s gross domestic product, compared with 0.3% for the Coalition’s target. $600bn is about 2% of Australia’s GDP.
Most experts believe Direct Action has little chance of meeting Australia’s long term greenhouse commitments. The Coalition has said it will review the policy next year."

The BCA has previously lobbied the Senate to repeal the carbon tax and complained of the “high cost of the carbon tax and other green energy policies on business”.
But on Wednesday, Westacott released a statement calling for “Australia to begin the careful transformation of our economy if we are to achieve our lower emission future”. 
She welcomed Labor’s differentiation between key sectors of the economy after it proposed two emissions trading schemes – one for big industrial polluters and one for the electricity industry.
“The federal opposition’s climate change action plan, released on Wednesday, could provide a platform for bipartisanship to deliver the energy and climate change policy durability needed to support this critical transformation,” Westacott said.
“The last thing Australia needs is to start from scratch on carbon policy. With the support of business and the community in developing specific measures, the opposition’s plan could build a bridge from the existing regulatory frameworks to the first phase of their proposed emissions trading scheme.”
Westacott said the BCA supported measures to reduce emissions, including shifting the mix of power sources away from higher emission technologies towards low or zero-emission technologies, encouraging greater energy efficiency, better managing land use and encouraging the adoption of more fuel-efficient vehicles.
Labor’s outlined its climate policy on Wednesday, proposing two emissions trading schemes and committing to reduce emissions by 45% by 2030 on 2005 levels – as recommended by the Climate Change Authority, compared with the Coalition’s pledge of a reduction between 26% and 28%.
Labor has also proposed a legal trigger to allow the commonwealth to regulate broadscale land clearing, an area currently solely under the purview of the states. 
The Coalition seized on the policy, repeating Tony Abbott’s arguments against the emissions trading scheme (ETS) in 2013. Malcolm Turnbull described an ETS as “effectively another tax” and Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce accusing Labor of trying to push up power prices.
“In order to deliver a near doubling of our emissions targets, [Labor] will have to very significantly increase the cost of energy, the cost of electricity and all other power,” Turnbull said. “So that is going to be another brake on the economy.”
Joyce has revived the Coalition’s $100 lamb roast scare campaign and suggested Labor’s policy to allow the commonwealth to prevent land clearing would lead to “new policemen on people’s farms”.
Joyce, who faces a challenge in his New England electorate from former independent Tony Windsor, accused a “Labor-Greens-Independent alliance” of trying to “make people poorer”.
“[The power price issue] is the one that takes that last $20 or $30 or $50 out of your wallet so you don’t have the capacity to go and have a cup of coffee with the other ladies down at the coffee shop ... because you have to pay your power bill”.
In 2009, Joyce suggested the carbon tax and the ETS implemented by Labor would lead to $100 lamb roasts – a threat that never eventuated. 
Asked on Wednesday whether a return to an ETS would cause the fabled $100 lamb roast, Joyce said “it clearly says if you start putting up power prices of course the price of everything will be affected”.
Labor’s policy would also establish a legal trigger to allow the commonwealth to prevent runaway land clearing, particularly in Queensland, which is threatening to undo Australia’s emissions reductions elsewhere. 
Joyce said the issue of land clearing was an issue for state governments and the Coalition policy was to “leave well enough alone”.
He said Labor was disregarding the Queensland and New South Wales parliaments.
“This is a realm for the states, and it’s not a realm for the federal government to be going in,” Joyce said. “This is one of the greatest things that’s absolutely infuriates people. Because they say that’s my private asset.”
Releasing the policy, Bill Shorten said Turnbull was “selling out what he used to believe” and predicted the prime minister would “keep trying to trump up a sort of rich man’s Tony-Abbott-scare-campaign”.
“Before he became the leader of the Liberal party he said Mr Abbott’s policies were an economic can fig leaf, a climate change fig leaf to mask the determination of the Abbott government to do nothing on climate change,” Shorten said.
“Now he’s the champion of the climate sceptics.”"

Here are six reasons the government’s campaign is wrong";"1. The prime minister says that by promising to cut emissions by 45% by 2030, rather than 26% to 28% (as the government has pledged) Labor is “doubling the burden” on Australians. But modelling commissioned by the Coalition from leading economist and former Reserve Bank board member Warwick McKibbin showed that a 45% cut would shave between 0.5% and 0.7% from gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030, whereas a 26% cut would shave between 0.2 and 0.3%. In other words the difference in the economic cost of the Coalition’s target and Labor’s target is about 0.3% of GDP in 2030. That’s 0.3% of an estimated GDP of over $3.5 trillion. It’s not hard to work out that is not doubling an economic burden.
2. Greg Hunt and Barnaby Joyce have recycled the discredited claim that different modelling has shown that Labor’s 45% target will increase electricity prices by 78%.
That is wrong. The numbers come from Treasury’s 2013 modelling from the Climate Change Authority. The CCA itself has said it is “incorrect” and “wrong” to interpret its report this way. Its former chairman, Bernie Fraser, said the claim was “weird” and “misleading”. The 78% increase refers to wholesale prices in a scenario where Australia did nothing at all, compared with a scenario where we reached a higher target using only a high carbon price. We have already decided doing nothing is not an option, and no political party is proposing to reach a target using only a carbon price. So the figure is entirely irrelevant to the debate. The McKibbin modelling is far more useful in estimating the costs of what might actually happen.
3. Scott Morrison claims Labor “learned nothing from the last election when voters said ‘no’ to a carbon tax” and is “bringing back ... a big thumping electricity tax” that will “punish Australian families”.
Except it isn’t. It is proposing a separate intensity-based emissions trading scheme for the electricity sector, different from the ETS for heavy industry. This idea is very, very similar to one Malcolm Turnbull himself proposed as opposition leader in 2009, and very, very similar to the scheme “Direct Action” could be converted into after the election – something most in the business community assume will have to happen since Australia’s emissions are rising and Direct Action has little hope of reaching the government’s long term target. It’s the scheme the energy market regulator – the Australian Energy Market Commission – recommended that the government adopt in a submission last year and said could operate “without a significant effect on absolute price levels faced by consumers” and which state and federal energy ministers asked that body to develop further late last year.
So if prices increase slightly – and they may – it’s a price rise the Coalition itself is very likely to find itself considering when it starts figuring out how to reshape Direct Action into something workable after the election.
4. Malcolm Turnbull says Labor’s proposed target is out of step with the rest of the world, because it is higher than the target he pledged at the Paris conference.
But that’s not really right either. The Paris conference was a “bottom up” process, which means countries got to promise whatever they were prepared to do, and peer pressure was the only thing pushing them to higher levels of ambition. Many have judged the Coalition’s target to be too low to represent our fair share of the global effort. Analysis by Climate Action Tracker rates it as “inadequate” The CCA recommended a reduction of 40% to 60% on 2000 levels by 2030. The Climate Institute said the government’s target was “pathetically inadequate”. And the prime minister acknowledges that Australia will almost certainly have to increase its target over time, which raises the question as to whether we wouldn’t be better designing policy to achieve the emission reductions we know we are going to have to achieve.
5. The government claims the broader industrial ETS will be “yet another economic handbrake that Labor is putting on our economy”.
But – evidently not keen to walk straight into another major scare campaign – Labor has gone to great lengths to make sure this claim cannot be substantiated.
In its first stage, from 2018 to 2020, heavy industry will only have to buy permits over a yet-to-be-determined “cap”. If it’s a trade exposed industry and exceeds its “cap” those permits can all be bought on the international market. The cheapest of those permits, “certified emission reductions”, are selling for less than $1. So while we can’t calculate exactly what a particular firm might have to pay, it isn’t going to be much.
After 2020 it will introduce a longer term industrial ETS, and also decide what other sectors might be covered, for example agriculture or road transport. Here the details become even more vague, with most to be determined in consultation with industry after a Labor government won office.
And just in case anyone still had concerns, there’ll be a “strategic industries taskforce”, to help design the scheme, and a $300m fund to help hard-hit communities with the transition.
Labor might be criticised for leaving important details until later, for erring on the side of caution, for claiming it will get to net zero emissions by 2050 without explaining exactly how it would do it. But it’s made absolutely sure it can’t be attacked for applying an economic handbrake on anything.
6. Which brings us to the final reason this new carbon tax scare campaign rings so totally hollow. Labor, and those in the Coalition who understand that climate change is a thing, are actually converging in their ideas about what policies Australia should adopt. They are moving towards sectoral, and maybe intensity-based, trading schemes and towards using a suite of policies (energy efficiency, vehicle standards, regulations) to get to our targets. And every interest group with a stake in this argument – business, environment groups, investors – are desperately willing the major parties to find some kind of consensus. The Business Council of Australia said Labor’s policy could be a “platform for bipartisanship”. They are right.
And the barren, stupid climate wars and dumb fact-free scare campaigns are a guaranteed recipe for a terrible economic and environmental failure."

In another gruelling Senate committee hearing on Wednesday, Dr Larry Marshall confirmed about 75 researchers in the oceans and atmosphere business unit would lose their jobs in a revamped, smaller restructure – down from about 110 announced to widespread derision in February.
However, Marshall denied the decision to establish a small climate research centre in Hobart was politically motivated.
“I’ll grant you I’m not very good at communications and I’m not very good at politics and I think that’s been shown quite clearly,” Marshall told senators.
He also acknowledged the vast external pressure on the organisation to step back from its initial cuts but said he thought the CSIRO would have come to the new strategy regardless. 
“I guess I’d like to believe that CSIRO’s own process would have come to this solution anyway,” Marshall said. “Not to say the external pressure didn’t help.”
Documents provided to the Senate reveal the CSIRO initially planned to cut 96 climate researchers but Dr Alex Wonhas, executive director of environment, energy and resources, told the committee only 40 climate scientists would lose their job under the new arrangement.
Of the remaining cuts, there would be about 30 from the Canberra team, between 10 and 15 from Melbourne and about 15 from Hobart, the executives told the committee.
Earlier in the week it was announced the CSIRO would set up a climate research centre in Hobart that would secure funding for 40 climate scientists for 10 years.
Emails from the executive team revealed to the Senate show CSIRO was aware of the political impact of job losses in Hobart, and the director of the oceans and atmosphere unit, Dr Ken Lee, said he would work on ways to “minimise impacts on Hobart”.
A senior climate scientist at CSIRO told Guardian Australia the decision to base the program in Hobart was political, since of the 40 scientists that would be employed by the centre it was likely about 30 of them were based in Melbourne.
But Marshall denied it had anything to do with politics. “Hobart was just the obvious choice given what we already have there, the infrastructure we have there, the people we have there,” he said. “It was just the clear choice.”
The committee hearing was part of a Greens-Labor inquiry into government budget cuts, which has focused recently on the CSIRO cuts to climate science. Executives have said the cuts were at least partly a result of government funding for climate research being cut in the last budget."

The so-called fifth carbon budget sets a limit on the quantity of greenhouse gases that can be produced across the country between 2028 and 2032, as a way of meeting national and international commitments on combating global warming. 
It is set by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the statutory body set up under the Climate Change Act, but must be approved by parliament before it can enter into force.
“The UK can’t afford any further delays when it comes to replacing dirty power stations with cleaner forms of generation,” said Angus MacNeil, the chair of the energy and climate change select committee. “Investors need certainty and setting a decarbonisation target for the energy sector would signal the government’s commitment to phasing out fossil fuels.”
The MPs also recommended that the UK’s share of international transport should be included for the first time in a carbon budget, and that ministers should set stringent limits on emissions from electricity generation. The government has already said the targets set in Paris would be legally binding.
Last time a carbon budget was set, during the coalition government in 2011, David Cameron had to step in to quell a potential backbench revolt among his MPs. At the time, they were promised a Treasury review of the fourth carbon budget as a compromise.
This time, the budget will come up for consideration during the feverish preparations for the referendum on EU membership, in which environmental measures have come under increasing attack from those favouring a Brexit.
The government is supposed to approve the fifth carbon budget by the end of June, or face a judicial review. However, ministers may try to alter this timetable because of the unprecedented disruption of the referendum.
The CCC has warned that new houses should be built to higher standards in order to meet the budget, but the government has not yet unveiled plans to reach this.
In an acknowledgement that the passage of the budget could be controversial, MacNeil said: “Should the government deviate from the Committee on Climate Change’s advice for the fifth carbon budget, we will be looking carefully for a robust evidence base on any alternative level [of emissions] proposed.”
Nick Molho, executive director of the Aldersgate group of companies which support green aims, said: “Now is the time to translate international commitments into a new set of national policies to guide cost-effective investment in energy efficiency, low-carbon transport and clean energy technologies over the next 15 years. 
“It is key to the UK’s future economic competitiveness that it continue to support the growth of a low-carbon economy, while also taking care to provide the necessary support to its energy-intensive sectors during this transition.”
Emma Pinchbeck, head of energy and climate change at WWF, said: “It’s crunch time on climate policy. The government must accept and act on the committee’s advice and avoid the temptation to use smoke and mirrors to lower the level of ambition. We need a clear plan to reduce carbon emissions that is supported by colleagues in the Treasury and across government departments.”
Under the fifth carbon budget, which would run from 2028 to 2032, the UK would emit no more than 1,765m metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, or a 60% cut by 2030. 
The Committee on Climate Change has confirmed that it is sufficient to meet the UK’s obligations under the Paris agreement, although campaigners complained that the CCC only considered the Paris-set target of limiting warming to no more than 2C, instead of the agreement’s more stretching aspiration of limiting warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.
In its report, Setting the Fifth Carbon Budget, published on Wednesday, the energy and climate change select committee said the government should also set a target of limiting emissions from the power generation sector to 100g of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour of electricity generated.
Under the Climate Change Act, which was voted in nearly unanimously by MPs, the UK must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% compared with 1990 levels by mid-century, which mirrors the commitments likely to be necessary by all developed countries if warming is to be limited to 2C.
In Paris last December, almost every country in the world - developing as well as developed - agreed to adopt the 2C limit and “pursue efforts” to limit warming to only 1.5C. But the agreement did not contain detail on specific measures required to meet this, instead leaving it to national governments to set limits on their emissions with a five-year review period to ensure they are sufficient to meet the long-term targets.
The UK has met its first three carbon budgets but further policies may be needed to meet the fourth. The Climate Change Act, which has since been copied by other countries, was the first to set carbon budgets and to ensure that they extended well beyond the term of the parliament in which they were approved, in order to bind future governments to long-term policy commitments."

The group, Land Services of Coast and Country, filed an appeal for a judicial review of the Queensland government’s environmental approval of the Carmichael mine in the supreme court on Wednesday.
The group argues the state’s environment department failed in its obligations to ensure the mine planned by the Indian conglomerate was an ecologically sustainable development under the Environmental Protection Act, which it described as “the community’s safety net”.
The Coast and Country spokesman, Derec Davies, said the decision to grant environmental authority to the Galilee basin mine “ignored climate change totally and failed to properly take account of the true jobs figures – 1,464 net jobs not the 10,000 advocated”.
“What is most concerning is the fact [the department] failed to properly consider and apply the legislation under which it operates,” Davies said.
The department’s decision in February followed a land court recommendation to approve the open-cut mine, which would produce up to 60m tonnes a year of thermal coal to be shipped to Asia over 60 years.
That ruling resulted from another Coast and Country challenge. During the hearing, an Adani economic expert conceded the number of jobs created would be lower than the company had claimed, while the judge recommended added safeguards concerning species and ecological protection. 
The string of legal challenges to Adani’s project – which, the Indian conglomerate complained, fed into “regulatory uncertainty” for its $16bn investment – led the federal government to flag moves to curtail “lawfare” by green groups.
A spokesman for Adani said it had previously factored into its planning the prospect of “additional, politically motivated challenges seeking to delay the project”.
Davies said the principle of sustainable development within the act had been in place since 1994 as “an overarching filter used to assess a proposed development’s environmental harm against its purported benefits”.
“Our appeal to the supreme court is simple,” he said. “We have laws to protect the environment that we rely on for our food, clean water and the air we breathe, and that supports our unique biodiversity.
“In our opinion, the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection has made an error of law. The department cannot just ignore those laws that will allow the big end of town to develop a huge, polluting coalmine that will create catastrophic environmental harm both now and into the future.”
The Environmental Defenders Office Queensland, which acted for Coast and Country in the land court, is again acting in the appeal.
The federal court is yet to rule on an Australian Conservation Foundation appeal against federal environmental approval of the mine.
Some representatives of the mine site’s traditional owners, the Wangan and Jagalingou people, have several legal actions under way to challenge a land use deal with Adani signed by other representatives. 
Adani, which had spent six years working with various governments on environmental approvals, had “for some time warned of the threat to major, job-creating projects proceeding in Queensland [posed by] endless appeals”, its spokesman said.
“As it relates to Carmichael, the approvals given are the most strict and rigorous of their kind ever given for a single development,” he said.
“When the Queensland government announced their strict, science-based approval had been given to the mine at Carmichael, the company noted that its timelines assumed additional, politically motivated challenges seeking to delay the project and deny the benefits of jobs, taxes and royalties of our state from proceeding as planned.“Notwithstanding this challenge, Adani stands ready to deliver on its plans to build a long-term future with Queensland.”"

But they may consider an agreement with Labor because that would provide an opportunity to pursue serious Greens initiatives at the federal level, he said.
Speaking at the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday, Di Natale unofficially kicked off his party’s 2016 election campaign with a broad speech about the Greens’ vision for Australia.
He criticised the lack of courage shown by Coalition and Labor MPs, and attacked the political establishment – the “old parties” – for deserting progressive mainstream voters in recent years, saying the Greens have been the only innovative and disruptive party promoting new ideas.
“We announced our policies on negative gearing before anyone dared to go there,” he said. “We paved the way for Labor to announce their policy. We announced our policy on superannuation tax concessions, again, long before that issue was discussed in mainstream economic circles.”
The Greens’ priority in the next parliament would be to renew Australia’s energy system, legislate strong climate laws to protect the Great Barrier Reef and protect Australia’s forests, Di Natale said.
“It’s time to make the big polluters stop getting a free ride ... We have to get back on track,” he said. “Too many years have been wasted.”
Di Natale also announced his plan to introduce a so-called Buffett Rule to force Australia’s wealthiest citizens to pay a legislated minimum amount of tax – 35% of their total income – to make it impossible for them to pay less tax than teachers, nurses or shop assistants.
By forcing the top 1% of earners to pay a minimum amount of tax – the rule would apply to people with income above $300,000 a year – it would raise $7.3bn in revenue for the commonwealth over four years, he said.
“Last year, 56 people who earned a collective $129m paid no tax, not a single cent, but spent $47m on tax advice,” he said.
“Meanwhile, Australians are being told to tighten their belts, while the government rips $80bn from our schools and hospitals.”
That policy is similar to an idea Labor has been considering since July last year.
Di Natale is the first leader of Australia’s major political parties to speak at the Press Club since the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, announced his plans to hold the election on 2 July.
The treasurer, Scott Morrison, will speak at the Press Club next Wednesday – the day after his highly anticipated first budget.
Di Natale criticised the Abbott-Turnbull government for preventing the country from transitioning to a new, post-mining economy.
He said it had neglected to invest heavily in infrastructure, clean energy, world-class communication and fast, efficient public transport.
“These are the fundamentals of the new economy and on each of them, the prime minister is failing,” he said.
Di Natale also criticised Labor and the Nationals for siding with the Liberal party in its support for the fossil fuel industry and the “sacred cow” of industry assistance: fossil fuel subsidies.
“It’s remarkable that [the Labor leader] Bill Shorten and Malcolm Turnbull have remained tight-lipped about the billions of dollars each year gifted to the likes of Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer, considering that abolishing fossil fuel tax credits returns $13.5bn to the budget over the forward estimates – that’s $13.5bn more for hospitals, for the NDIS [National Disability Insurance Scheme], for science and research,” he said. 
Di Natale said the Greens also wanted to establish a $250m fund, called Renew Australia, to help workers move out of old dirty-energy jobs into new renewable ones, and the economy to modernise. He would like it to fund projects worth $1bn over the next 15 years."

Van Jones – the activist, author, former Obama administration official, and current CNN commentator – revealed that Prince had secretly funded causes from public radio to Black Lives Matter to the Harlem Children’s Zone. He also conceived of #YesWeCode, an initiative to train black kids for work in tech. And he supported Green For All, a group working to fight climate change and bring green jobs to underprivileged populations. Jones is in the leadership of the latter two organizations.
“I was an Oakland activist giving speeches about the need for green jobs,” Jones told me over the phone, recalling how he first came into contact with the musician 10 years ago. “Prince heard me in the media and sent a $50,000 check to support the work I was doing. But he did all his giving completely anonymously, so I sent the check back. You never know when someone is trying to set you up – it could have been from Chevron or from a drug dealer or whatever. So then he sent the check back and I sent it back again, and then he sent it back and then I sent it back, until finally a representative called and said, ‘Will you please accept this check? I won’t tell you who it is from, but the guy’s favorite color is purple.’ I said, ‘Well, now you have a different problem: I’m not gonna cash this check, I’m gonna frame it.’”
Soon after, Prince reached out to Jones, and the two became friends – a friendship that would last until his death. Jones’ role in Prince’s life was, he says, as “his lead guitarist for social impact, for lack of a better term.” Jones helped distribute Prince’s resources when he didn’t want the attention, including providing solar panels for families in Oakland. The families never knew who their benefactor was.
As a Jehovah’s Witness, Prince wasn’t permitted to advertise his good works. But even without his spiritual tradition, Jones says Prince would have been modest about his giving. “He thought it was in poor taste for these celebrities to get millions of dollars and then write a check and have their publicists all over the media bragging about it,” Jones said. “He was like, ‘This is ridiculous. We get enough attention. We’re celebrities.’”
Jones says that what Prince really cared about was humanity. “He cared about life and love and freedom,” Jones says. “His politics were not red. They were not blue. They were purple. He had a mind that let him see answers – musically, spiritually, even politically. Rather than argue about global warming, he said, ‘Let’s help kids put up solar panels.’”
It’s clear in conversation that Jones deeply mourns the loss of his friend. When asked what he will miss most, he takes a long pause, so long I think for a moment that the line has gone dead.
“Everybody will tell you about the songs, but the genius didn’t stop when he walked out of the studio,” Jones says. “He was so hilariously, ridiculously funny. He was Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock, Kevin Hart–level funny. Dave Chapelle is probably funnier, but he’s the only one. Everybody else, Prince could have eaten their lunch, and half the time with no curse words. That’s irreplaceable. You can’t find that on YouTube or iTunes.”"

Australian farmers have long bought and sold their wares at auction. Sale yards were the hub of country towns and the din of a moleskin-clad auctioneer shouting over the bleating and mooing of fattened livestock has long been a familiar rural backdrop. 
But an overloaded agricultural system has depleted the land’s carbon content and its replenishment is vital in the face of climate change. “Farmers use the term ‘clapped-out paddock’ but we have clapped-out Australia,” says Louisa Kiely, director of Carbon Farmers of Australia. “Improving the land should be put on a war footing because food security is a real issue in the face of climate change.” 
Similar to the carbon offset programme, carbon sequestration could be a viable solution, with farmers encouraged to store carbon dioxide (CO2) in soil and trees and prevent additional emissions from animal waste methane. And again, farmers take part in an auction, albeit a more sedate, less visible one, to make it profitable.
The ins and outs of the fund take some navigation, however. At the auction, bidders undertake to store a set amount of carbon or not emit a set amount of CO2, within a fixed time period and for the lowest price they can profitably deliver carbon abatement.
Each endeavour for landowners, whether it is storing carbon or cutting CO2 emissions, is classified as a project and the methods used to deliver their outcomes are set out by the regulator. For example, a farmer who undertakes to boost his soil’s carbon content by changing his grazing practices or by increasing organic compost has to nominate a specific method to achieve the improvement. 
Provability is the lynchpin of the system and navigating the stringent demands of a contract can be challenging for landowners. Kiely has been campaigning for a farm-based carbon offsets industry for many years and Carbon Farmers of Australia prepares submissions on behalf of those bidding for contracts.
Kiely says the criteria for registering and delivering a project makes the carbon credit system robust and transparent. “On the face of it, you are selling air. No one can see it, so you have to prove it. But I do think the soil-testing processes could be streamlined.”
If you want adoption of carbon neutral farming, we should have a simple system. Farmers want to make the land better.
Core samples of soil are taken from random spots on a carbon-farmer’s land before and after a project. They are tested for carbon content and payment is made if there is an improvement.
Chloe Munro, the regulator’s chief executive, said the reporting criteria are demanding because carbon abatement processes and measuring results are so complex. “When we issue a credit we need assurance that there is genuine abatement,” Munro says. “There is a balance to be struck between maintaining the integrity of the system and the burden [of proof] on the farmer. It’s not foolproof, but we are vigilant.”
There is considerable money to be made by those who take part. The $2.55bn fund pays a sum for each tonne stored or not emitted through the currency of ACCUs (Australian carbon credit unit). Each ACCU represents one tonne and is paid when contracts are delivered. The average price paid per tonne in the first auction in April 2015 was $13.95, which fell to $12.25 at the second auction in November. Unsurprisingly, all eyes are on the price to emerge from this week’s auction.
There are 583 projects on the register and 275 of those are under contract, which collectively promise to deliver about 93m tonnes of carbon. 
Munro says the past year has been positive, though some projects have been renegotiated because farmers underestimated the time it would take to deliver. She expects a wider range of participants in this week’s auction.
David Bruer, co-founder of Temple Bruer vineyard in South Australia, runs a carbon neutral business. An ardent advocate for sustainable farming, Bruer says it is not good enough just to cut CO2 emissions and instead uses special growing methods to remove it from the atmosphere.
He plants giant cane (arundo donax), a species that captures more CO2 than any other plant, near his vineyards. Watered with the highly saline winery wastewater and then used to nourish the soil with bio-char compost, it is an innovative process.
Bruer says the regulator’s auction scheme is technically very complicated and would be “vastly assisted by a domestic price set on carbon dioxide”.
“If you want widespread adoption of carbon neutral farming, we should have a simple system. I have a great deal of faith in Australian farmers and, by and large, they want to make the land better.”
Kiely agrees, but insists that the incentives need to be meaningful. “Farmers have always been price-takers, not price-setters. It’s taking a while for the industry to come on board and you need a few leaders to set an example. 
She tells of a contract-holder in Cobar, in western New South Wales, who announced to a gathering of local farmers that his first ACCU cheque was $1m. “That got them listening,” she says."

But despite the policy similarities, the government is persisting with a Tony Abbott-style anti-carbon tax scare campaign, which a leading climate thinktank has labelled “misleading” and “dishonest”.
Labor is now proposing a separate “emissions intensity” trading scheme for the electricity sector in which generators with higher emissions than an industry-wide baseline would have to buy credits from those with lower emissions. This is a major shift from the “cap and trade” scheme it previously introduced.
Danny Price, the chief executive of Frontier Economics, told Guardian Australia “the emissions intensity part of Labor’s plan appears to be exactly what we were proposing for Malcolm Turnbull and Nick Xenophon in 2009”.
Xenophon modelled the scheme for Turnbull and Xenophon when Turnbull was the opposition leader and considering his response to the then Labor government’s cap and trade ETS. 
Turnbull lauded it as a “cheaper, greener, smarter scheme” and said it could deliver deeper cuts to greenhouse emissions but impose far lower increases in electricity prices. But the then prime minister, Kevin Rudd, dismissed it as a “magic pudding”. The then climate minister, Penny Wong – now the leader of the opposition in the Senate – also dismissed the scheme that now forms part of Labor’s policy. 
“It is not a hybrid, it is a mongrel. It is not a credible alternative, it is a smokescreen,” she said. “[It] has the distinct taste of magic pudding.”
Price said the new Labor policy was “a bit light on detail but it looks pretty much the same [as the Turnbull 2009 plan]. Malcolm Turnbull thought it was a good idea then. I’m delighted the Labor party is proposing it now.”
And Price – who the government recently appointed to the Climate Change Authority and who acted as an adviser on Direct Action – said the Coalition would probably have to move to a similar scheme itself in order to meet its own emissions reduction targets.
“The government’s Direct Action plan – its safeguard mechanism – could be modified to create exactly this same type of scheme,” he said. “I’ve always thought that was the most likely way for them to go after the review they have scheduled for 2017, because they are obviously going to have to make changes to meet even their existing targets and this is a low-cost way to do it.
“It is actually emerging as an idea with the potential to be adopted by both major parties.”
Under Direct Action the “safeguards mechanism” is supposed to ensure that increased emissions from heavy industry and electricity generators do not undo the reductions bought through the government’s $2.5bn scheme, by setting baselines for their emissions.
At the moment the baselines are lenient, ensuring industries don’t “go rogue” but not seeking to reduce their greenhouse emissions. But many observers, including business groups, expect they will have to be tightened after 2017 to gradually reduce industrial emissions. And that would turn Direct Action into much the same scheme as Labor is proposing.
As well as the electricity-sector scheme, Labor is proposing an emissions trading scheme for heavy industry. In its first stage, from 2018 to 2020, polluters would buy international permits, currently trading at less than $1, for emissions over a yet-to-be-determined cap. Details of the second stage are yet to be determined.
Despite the similarities between Labor’s electricity scheme and its own policy direction, the Turnbull government has continued to use Abbott’s lines to attack it. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, called it a “big, thumping electricity tax” and the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said Labor, the Greens and the independents wanted to “make people poorer because it’s good for you, because it’s righteous”.
 But John Connor, CEO of the Climate Institute, said the scare campaign was “disappointing” and some of the government’s claims were “misleading” and “dishonest”.
He pointed to recent modelling by the institute that showed Australia faces significant economic disruption unless it moves quickly to implement clear policies to meet the Paris goals. The institute recommended a carbon price and regulations to phase out coal-fired generators and additional subsidies to encourage clean energy investment.
The Business Council of Australia said Labor’s policy could “build a platform for bipartisanship”."

Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, announced a seven-point plan that his party will take to the election, saying Australia needs to plan for a future without coal, not a future without the reef.
“Governments need to intervene here – not to prop up the dying coal industry, but to help coal workers get out and to protect the thousands of jobs that rely on the health of Australia’s stunning natural assets,” he said.
“Coal workers, tourism operators and all Australians who love the Great Barrier Reef deserve better than what we’re getting from the two old parties who are pretending that we can expand the coal industry and keep the reef healthy – when the science says we have to choose.”
The announcement comes just weeks after news that almost 93% of reefs on the Great Barrier Reef have been hit by coral bleaching.
Terry Hughes, of the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce, broke the news after his recent flyover of the reef, saying it had been the saddest research trip of his life. 
Di Natale and Greens deputy leader, Queensland senator, Larissa Waters, visited the reef on Thursday to see the coral bleaching for themselves.
The chief scientist on Sir David Attenborough’s recent three-part series on the reef, Justin Marshall, who accompanied Di Natale and Waters, said he has seen the reef deteriorate significantly over 30 years. He said it is “undoubtedly Australia’s worst environmental crisis” and he’s angry that the government is trying to hide it. 
“All of the reefs that I took Sir David to in our submersible ... are now heavily bleached, dead, or dying. So what you’re seeing in that series is not natural history, but history.”
The Greens says their seven-point plan will help shift Australia away from its reliance on fossil fuels, which they say are causing the reef to die.
Their plan includes the creation of a $1bn Clean Energy Transition Fund to help coal workers and their communities adjust to a non-coal world.
They want miners to start paying the fuel excise – which motorists have to pay each day – which would save the government $6bn a year in subsidies to the mining industry.
They want a moratorium on new coal and gas projects, saying Australia needs to start preparing for a life beyond dirty energy.
They also want to charge a thermal coal export levy, at $3 per tonne of coal exported – which won’t apply to coal shipped to countries with an effective price on pollution. It would raise $700m a year.
They also want to re-implement a carbon price of some kind, but they have no details on what that scheme would look like.
“Labor and the Liberal-National coalition are dumb and dumber when it comes to the subject of coal,” Di Natale said on Thursday.
“They’ve sold out to their fossil fuel donors, handing out billions of dollars in subsidies and approvals for new coal and gas projects when this is an industry in decline.
“Coal is going down – that’s a market reality – but only the Greens have a plan to make sure workers and the reef don’t go down with it,” he said.
The environment minister, Greg Hunt, visited Cairns on Tuesday to announce $50m of federal money for new projects to improve water quality on the Great Barrier Reef.
The funding would be used to restrict the levels of artificial nutrients entering the reef, he said.
He also said further budget funding for the reef would be announced in coming weeks.
The Greens says the billions that could be raised or saved by their policies could be used to fund the long-term health of the reef, and increase funding for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Australian Institute for Marine Science."

This assumption has even been presented on  The Daily Show, but it’s supported by precious little evidence. In fact, as Chris Mooney documented in great detail in 2014: 
[The data] do not support the idea that vaccine denial is a special left-wing cause. As for GMOs, while resistance may be strongest on the far left, worries on this issue are quite prominent across the spectrum as well.
In neither case are these beliefs a mirror image, on the left, of climate change or evolution denial [on the political right].
A new YouGov poll provided yet more data, asking, “Do you think it is generally safe or unsafe to eat genetically modified foods?”. There was little difference in answers across political affiliations – Democrats and Republicans were evenly split on the question of safe/unsafe, and Independents were more likely to consider GMOs unsafe. Gender and family income best predicted the answers, with men and higher-income individuals more likely to consider GMOs safe.
Those surveyed were also asked if the science supporting the safety of childhood vaccination is indisputable. In this case, Democrats were the most likely to answer yes (68%) rather than no (21%), followed by Independents (53% to 33%), with Republicans expressing the least confidence in the science supporting vaccine safety (47% yes, 42% no). Contrary to The Daily Show clip, these data show that vaccine science denial is more prevalent among conservatives than liberals.
A 2013 paper by Stephan Lewandowsky and colleagues investigated the links between ideology and science denial. The study similarly found no evidence of symmetrical science denial between liberals and conservatives on different issues. The authors concluded that conspiratorial thinking and free market support - both prevalent on the political right - were most strongly related to science denial:
Free-market worldviews are an important predictor of the rejection of scientific findings that have potential regulatory implications, such as climate science, but not necessarily of other scientific issues. Conspiracist ideation, by contrast, is associated with the rejection of all scientific propositions tested.
The study found that libertarian objections to government intrusion arising from mandatory vaccination programs explained the prevalence of anti-vaccine views among conservatives. They also found that those on the liberal side of the spectrum are more likely to distrust the pharmaceutical industry, and thus also oppose vaccinations, but as borne out by the YouGov poll data, this appears to be a smaller effect. On GMOs, the Lewandowsky study found no link between trust in science and ideology, again, consistent with the latest polling data.
The YouGov poll also asked respondents “Generally speaking, how much trust do you have that what scientists say is accurate and reliable?”. There was little difference between various ethnicities, ages, geographical regions, or genders. However, Democrats were far more likely to trust scientists than Republicans, with Independents falling in the middle, but closer to Republicans.
These results are consistent with a 2012 paper by Gordon Gauchat, which found:
public trust in science has not declined since the 1970s except among conservatives and those who frequently attend church.
This rising distrust of science is particularly high among higher-educated conservatives, in what’s been coined the “smart idiot” effect. Essentially, on complicated scientific subjects like climate change, more highly-educated ideologically-biased individuals possess more tools to fool themselves into denying the science and rejecting the conclusions of experts.
Chris Mooney has attributed these trends to the growth of the ‘religious right’ and other changes in the Republican Party:
Clearly, The Republican War on Science’s politicization thesis is being strongly validated—a thesis that attributes the problem to the growth of a modern conservative movement, its need to appease its core interest groups and constituencies (corporate America, conservative Christians), its need to have its own alternative expertise and journalism (think tanks, Fox, Limbaugh), and so on … as the “New Right” emerged in the U.S. in the wake of the cultural battles of the 1960s and 1970s, it mobilized strong forces of authoritarianism–e.g., psychological rigidity and closed-mindedness. 
Indeed, authoritarians favor Donald Trump, whose supporters have considerable overlap with climate science denial. Robert Brulle’s research into the ‘dark money’ funding climate denial also helps explain the problem. The Republican Party has become increasingly dependent upon corporate funding and support, which is heavily skewed in the direction of climate denial. The near-total abandonment of party leadership on the climate issue has sent a signal to Republican voters – climate change isn’t a concern, and anyone saying otherwise is part of the hoax.
The growth of this anti-science strain of the Republican Party thus seems to stem from multiple sources: increased party reliance on the religious right and corporate interests, and the growth of a right-wing media echo chamber that feeds anti-science conspiratorial thinking. 
However, there is good news. For one, climate denial is largely limited to a small and dwindling group of old, white, male conservatives; hence, it’s not a tenable long-term position for the Republican Party. Like opposition to gay marriage, science denial is a position that will increasingly alienate young voters in particular, who will bear the brunt of the consequences of climate inaction.
The party’s chosen path has also resulted in the Donald Trump candidacy, which has GOP leadership in a panic. For these reasons, a rebound away from extreme partisanship and towards reality may be imminent. Already a group of House Republicans signed the Gibson climate change Resolution and formed the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, acknowledging the reality of human-caused climate change and the need to do something about it. 
Perhaps this blossoming Republican climate leadership will trickle down to reverse the ideologically-based science denial among too many party members."

Productivity losses alone could rise above $2tn by 2030, as outdoor employees in many regions slow their pace, take longer breaks and shift their work to cooler dusk and dawn hours.
The effects of heat stress brought on by a warming world are already evident among the 4 billion people who live in the tropics and subtropics, says the report, Climate Change and Labour, which was jointly produced by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), UN Development Programme and the World Health Organisation.
In west Africa, the number of very hot days each year has already doubled since the 1960s, with an increase of around 10 sultry days each decade.
Matthew McKinnon, the manager of the UN’s climate vulnerable support forum, told the Guardian that increased incidence of heat stroke was only the most dramatic evidence of the problem he encountered on a recent trip to Ghana.
He said: “Teachers were complaining that it was too hot to teach children in schoolrooms which had no air conditioning. The children were also exhausted. We had truck drivers who were complaining that the rates of tyre bursts was increasing a lot because of the heat. Farmers too were worried that they had to spend too much time in open fields in the hot season.”
Around 2% of daylight hours are predicted to be shaved off the working day in west Africa, south Asia, and 10 regions in Asia, Africa and Latin America by 2030, potentially creating an epidemic of heat-related injuries.
“If temperatures climb beyond 2C, it would really be a problem on that scale in the tropics and sub-tropics,” McKinnon said.
More than half of the workforce in many middle- and low-income countries is already exposed to heat hazards, which also affect workers in factories that have inadequate air conditioning and ventilation systems. This is in turn can make normal work impossible.
“When heat is at a maximum threshold and it continues to get hotter, there are limitations to what people can do,” McKinnon said.
If ambient temperatures rise above the body’s median 37C, a person can only continue working by expelling heat through sweat evaporation. Where high humidity or clothing requirements prevent this, the only way to avoid dehydration and ultimately, clinical heatstroke is through reducing the work rate, resting and drinking as much water as possible.
Heat-related health breakdowns would have a gender dimension, hitting men who traditionally slog through heavy-lifting jobs, and pregnant women who are forced to work for economic reasons, especially in rural areas.
The worst-affected areas in the century ahead will likely include countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia and Burkina Faso which had already lost 2-3% of their available daylight work hours by the mid-1990s due to heat extremes.
Even if the Paris agreement succeeds in limiting global warming to 2C, 10-15% of daylight work hours will be lost in vulnerable countries by the century’s end, says the study which bases its estimates on theUN climate science panel’s latest findings.
“Limiting warming to 1.5Cas enshrined in the UNFCCC Paris agreement would still result in a substantial escalation of risks but increases the viability of adaptation measures and contains the worst impacts in health, economic and social terms,” the report says. 
The paper calls for low-cost measures such as guaranteed access to drinking water in workplaces, frequent rest breaks, management of output targets, and a protection of employee’s incomes and conditions.
However, more labour disputes to protect vulnerable workers - and apply the ILO’s guidelines on climate change – are all but inevitable as the century advances, according to the ILO.
Moustapha Kamal Gueye, an ILO spokesman, said: “Climate change is going to be a major issue for unions in the years ahead. It is a significant problem already and workers and unions are far ahead of governments and employers when it comes to putting on pressure about the urgency to take action.”"

Thanks for your suggestions. Read more about the weekly format of the Readers recommend series at the end of the piece.
In 1974, Jackson Browne’s celebration of the back-to-the-land movement, Before the Deluge, which starts this week’s playlist, contained this one eerily prescient verse that served to dampen the spirits of that generally optimistic generation: 
Some of them were angry At the way the earth was abused By the men who learned how to forge her beauty into power And they struggled to protect her from them Only to be confused By the magnitude of her fury in the final hour
The idiosyncrasies of 20th century weather could be the topic of comical pieces, such as Flanders and Swann’s engaging A Song of the Weather, or the blackly humorous Hard Day on the Planet by Loudon Wainwright III which includes the lines:
In California the body counts keep getting higher It’s evil out there, man, that state is always on fire
As we approached the turn of the millennium, however, there was a greater sense of accountability for the problems of the planet. Our waste, our emissions, our extractive industries, our sheer numbers were threatening the ecosystems we depended on. You can hear the grief in Tracy Chapman’s haunting song that accuses us of just standing by and watching The Rape of the World, you can hear the anger in Michael Jackson’s Earth Song, and you can hear the profound sadness in New Model Army’s Ballad, accompanied by a fabulously mournful harmonica:
When they look back at us and they write down our history What will they say about our generation? We’re the ones who knew everything still we did nothing Harvested everything, planted nothing
I chose the next three songs because they seem to me to represent the spirit of enquiry that was the next important step. 
""Liberated Carbon"" by Andy Revkin is a fun one. Not only is it a nice blues, but it has geologically accurate lyrics and is written and performed by the creator of the New York Times's Dot Earth blog: https://open.spotify.com/track/4KVmNgJ2G1NEbu27p6ORpf
Corb Lund’s song The Truth Comes Out is an observent but low-key song about the effects of climate change on wildlife in the foothills of Alberta. As Baylor Fox-Kemper’s nomination suggests Andrew Revkin’s Liberated Carbon provides some geological background, and Melissa Etheridge’s passionate anthem to personal responsibility, I Need To Wake Up, was used in Al Gore’s influential climate change documentary An Inconvenient Truth.
Next up are two contrasting songs – one angry, one resigned nevertheless both looking towards a very changed planet and a very difficult human future. The Restarts insist there is No Escape from global warming, and French for Rabbits sing an elegy for a home Claimed by the Sea.
I can’t completely explain the reason I chose to end this playlist with Harry Belafonte’s Turn the World Around. Several nominated songs made me feel hopeful for the future but none more than this one. I appreciated the simplicity of the message, we need to get back to the basic elements of life, and I was inspired by his amazing, never-give-up energy. Enjoy the music.
The theme for next week’s playlist will be announced at 8pm (UK time) on Thursday 28 April. You have until 11pm on Monday 2 May to make nominations.
Next week’s playlist will be compiled by Andrew Morrissey, who posts in the comments as Makinavaja.

The survey, which is repeated every few months, shows that public enthusiasm for the controversial energy extraction method has fallen steadily in the past two years while opposition to it has risen dramatically.
The government has consistently advocated shale gas as a future home grown energy source – no commercial fracking wells are currently operating in the UK – while at the same time cutting subsidies for solar and wind power.
Just 19% of people back exploration for shale gas in the latest edition of the Department of Energy and Climate Change’s long-running public attitudes tracker, down from a high of 29% two years ago. The percentage against has risen to a new high of 31%, while the proportion neither for or against has remained largely stable, at 46%.
The Decc polling, published on Thursday, showed a jump in support for renewable power to a new high of 81%, with only 4% opposing it. Backing for renewables has remained steadily high at 75-80% in recent years.
The news follows a protest by actor and anti-fracking campaigner Emma Thompson who broke an injunction to film a mock Great British Bake-Off film with Greenpeace on shale gas explorer Cuadrilla’s site in Lancashire. The stunt prompted the farmer who owned the land to drive-by in his tractor spreading slurry close to the filming.
The next big planning decision on fracking comes on 20 May, when North Yorkshire county council will decide whether to approve an application by Third Energy to frack at Kirby Misperton. Cuadrilla meanwhile is appealing against a rejection by Lancashire county council last summer.
A Decc spokesman said: “These findings show that half of the people asked still don’t have a view on fracking, but more importantly that the vast majority (88%) said that they do not know a lot about it. This is exactly why we want people to have access to all the facts so they can see past the myths and understand the benefits which include greater energy security, more jobs and growth.”
Ken Cronin, chief executive of Ukoog, the trade body that represents the shale industry, said: “This research shows that two thirds of people are concerned that we cannot heat ourselves and keep the lights on, and nearly half are worried that we are too dependent on gas imports from abroad. 
“The solution is to source energy from the ground beneath our feet and the industry must continue its efforts to ensure that factual evidence based information is provided to the public rather than scaremongering and myths.”
Statistics published by the government today also show that there is now 9.5GW of solar power installed in the UK, up by nearly a fifth on last year. Around half is in the form of big solar farms (greater than 5MW) which ministers such as environment secretary, Liz Truss, have attacked and undercut with subsidy changes.
Juliet Davenport OBE, chief executive of green energy company Good Energy said: “The message from the British public is loud and clear. 81% of us back renewables for our energy – people want to see a transition to a renewable future here in the UK.”
Last year’s historic climate agreement in Paris – and the recent signing of the deal – may also have given a small fillip to public concern on climate change, which was up slightly on earlier polling, from 66% previously to 70% now."

The former archbishop of Canterbury and master of Magdalene college made his comments in a foreword to a 74-page report on divestment by student campaign group Cambridge Zero Carbon Society.
“Environmental degradation of one kind and another is a life-and-death question for many communities around the world, especially for some of the most economically vulnerable ... The cost of our slowness or indifference to these matters is immensely grave for the poorest in our world, and many of them are bewildered by our sluggish responses.”
The argument was not only about ethics, he wrote. “It is also about the long-term prospects for our economic life. Patterns of profit and investment are changing fast, as people recognise the impossibility of expecting limitless returns from limited resources in our world. To change our own patterns of investment may be, as the authors of this report contend so forcefully, the most realistic future to plan for.”
The report, written by students and economists, shows that if the university had divested three years ago, it could have made an additional £112m. 
It argues that divestment is morally right; an effective tool for social and political change; is needed to retain the university’s research integrity and is a prudent financial decision. It calls on the university to withdraw all investments from fossil fuel stocks, bonds and investments, commit not to invest in fossil fuel companies in the future and explore a new, more environmentally sustainable investment strategy. 
Scientists agree that most existing coal, oil and gas reserves must remain in the ground if the world is to stay below 2C of warming, which scientists regard as the limit of safety.
Campaigners, backed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, argue there is moral case for divesting from fossil fuel companies that are exploring for new reserves. They also argue there is a financial case for divestment because, if the majority of fossil fuels become unburnable, companies could crash in value. 
Many endowments have already lost money on fossil fuel investments due to plunging coal and oil prices. Funds worth $3.4tn have already divested from fossil fuels, including many universities, the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund and two of the world’s biggest pension funds.
This Saturday more than 200 people from student, community and faith groups are expected to stage a protest at Senate House at Cambridge University in support of divestment. The local Labour MP, Daniel Zeichner, is due to speak. 
“Saturday marks the culmination of a strong student movement which has consistently highlighted our serious concerns about fossil fuel investments, with various direct actions,” a spokesman for Cambridge Zero Carbon Society said. 
Nearly 100 Cambridge academics are also supporting the action in an open letter calling for full divestment. 
“When it comes to the climate, Cambridge is making exactly the wrong kind of impact,” the letter reads. “To live up to its values, and to bring its policy in line with its research, Cambridge University needs to divest from fossil fuels.”
It warns that a failure to divest “will lead to huge losses on the horizon” that will disadvantage future students and highlights the contradiction of calls by the university’s own Institute for Sustainability Leadership to “ensure a transition to a low-carbon economy”. 
Cambridge and Oxford universities are among the most prestigious and influential academic institutions in the world and have endowments of £5.8bn and £4.2bn respectively.
Last May Oxford ruled out future investments in coal and tar sands, but said it would not divest from all fossil fuels as demanded by thousands of students, academics and alumni.
At the same time, Cambridge announced a working group to investigate ethical investment, which is due to report on 23 May. Students are demanding that this include full divestment, and their petition has so far gathered more than 2,100 signatures. 
A university spokesman said: “The findings of this working group will further inform our decisions. Through the university’s Environmental Sustainability Strategy, we are committed to making a positive impact in this area, making sure that the university operates sustainably every day.”
Earlier this year, hundreds of academics from the two universities demanded their institutions adopt an “evidence-based, morally sound investment policy that serves the needs of the future”, which could include divestment from fossil fuels."

British insurer Aviva and Seattle’s public pension fund are among the latest to declare their support for a shareholder resolution to be considered at next month’s AGM. California’s CalPERS, New York City Pension Fund and the Church of England are also in favour.
They are asking Exxon to analyse the impact of a 2C global warming limit on the value of its oil assets and publish the findings by 2017.
Standard &amp; Poors has stripped the world’s largest private oil company of the triple-A credit rating it had held since the Great Depression.
The ratings agency cited Exxon’s pursuit of high cost ventures as part of the reason its debt levels have more than doubled in recent years.
Scientists estimate at least a third of the world’s proven oil reserves and half of natural gas is unburnable under the 2C threshold.
Previously, Exxon has insisted its assets will not be affected. Governments are “highly unlikely” to restrict emissions enough to meet the international 2C goal, it argued.
The firm’s credibility has been dented by emerging evidence it misled the public about climate science, however.
An investigation by Inside Climate News uncovered internal documents showing industry researchers were flagging the risks as early as the late 1960s.
The latest to surface, a 1980 report by Exxon subsidiary Imperial Oil published by blog DeSmog on Tuesday, said: “It is assumed that the major contributors of CO2 are the burning of fossil fuels…
“There is no doubt that increases in fossil fuel usage and decreases of forest cover are aggravating the potential problem of increased CO2 in the atmosphere.”
Yet over the next few decades, Exxon mounted a PR campaign to undermine that scientific consensus.
While Exxon has been singled out for a legal inquiry into these allegations, the shareholder resolution is part of a wider movement.
Coalitions of investors have lodged similar requests with other oil and mining majors to assess their exposure to carbon risk.
Rio Tinto, BP and Shell embraced the challenge, recommending shareholders vote in favour.
Exxon has fought every step of the way, unsuccessfully appealing to regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, to strike the vote off the ballot.
In one of the most closely contested votes to date, 42% of shareholders in US utility AES backed a 2C “stress test” last week.
Investor activists are privately confident of getting at least 20% at the Exxon AGM in Dallas on 25 May.
Shanna Cleveland of sustainable investor network Ceres wrote: “This proxy season, shareholder proposals on climate risk are being propelled by a powerful set of tailwinds: an historic climate accord, rapidly changing market forces, and unprecedented shareholder collaboration.”"

The EU is planning two new fuel efficiency targets for 2025 and 2030 to help meet promises made at the Paris climate summit last December.
But executives from the two industrial giants launched a study on Wednesday night proposing greater use of biofuels, CO2 car labelling, and the EU’s emissions trading system (ETS) instead.
In reality, such a package would involve the end of meaningful new regulatory action on car emissions for more than a decade, EU sources say. But Shell insisted it is not trying to block an EU push for electric cars.
Ulrich Eichhorn, VW’s new head of research and development, said that plug-in hybrids and more efficient vehicles were “building blocks” for the future, but that “higher shares” for biofuels would be needed in the meantime.
 He told a meeting in Brussels: “Modern diesel and natural gas engines will absolutely be required to deliver CO2 targets until 2020 and they will also contribute to further reductions going on from there.”
 In meeting the Paris goals, “societal costs need to be minimised to keep our industrial strength and competitiveness,” he said.
The Auto Fuels Coalition study, written by Roland Berger, makes a series of highly pessimistic assumptions about the costs of fuel efficiency improvements, and equally optimistic ones about greenhouse gas emissions from biofuels. A recent EU study found the dirtiest biofuels three times more polluting than diesel.
An EU source said: “these two industries have realised they have a shared interest. When you saw who was paying for the study, you knew what the answer would be.”
A spokesman for Shell said: “Nothing in the report can be interpreted as seeking to block electric vehicles.”
 Campaigners point out that signs of an electric vehicles take-off this spring have included 400,000 pre-orders for the new Tesla’s Model 3, as well as a bid by the Dutch parliament to ban petrol and diesel engines by 2025. On Thursday Germany promised a €1bn subsidy boost for electric cars.
Yet the industry study assumes a lack of public appetite for electric cars over the next decade continuing until 5m urban recharging centres have been installed and renewable electricity prices fall from current rates.
Dr Christoph Wolff, the managing director of the European Climate Foundation, told the Guardian: “Electrification is taking off rapidly in markets such as China, Norway and the Netherlands. EU policymakers need to agree stringent measures, which will push the auto sector towards developing products that are fit to compete in this fast-evolving marketplace.” 
Saudi Arabia’s recent declaration that it would detach itself from oil dependence by 2030 was heralded by campaigners as such a development. The increasing cost-competitiveness of renewables has been another. 
But Shell’s vice-president for downstream strategy, Colin Crooks, said: “Liquid fuels will remain essential during the [low-carbon] transition as internal combustion engines are expected to still continue powering most transport for many years to come.”
The Dutch oil giant has invested heavily in Brazilian ethanol and Crooks stressed that biofuels would play a key role into the future, albeit one requiring policy incentives.
 “New fuels will require financial support from governments to support technology development and reduce investment risk,” he said.
 Road transport currently makes up about a fifth of Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions. The EU has set a target of a 60% reduction in transport emissions by 2050 as measured against 1990 levels. Emission levels are currently 20% above that rate, although they have begun to fall.
 By 2021, no new cars will be allowed to emit more than 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre, but electrification and widescale renewable electricity will be needed to approach zero emissions levels.
Carlos Calvo Ambel, an analyst for the Transport and Environment thinktank, said that Europe would miss its greenhouse gas targets altogether if it followed the Auto Fuels Coalition paper’s advice.
 “Carmakers, oil companies and biofuels producers are making a desperate bid to dissuade Europe from undertaking fuel efficiency standards for cars, vans and trucks, a push for electric vehicles and many of the other badly needed actions in the transport sector,” he said."

The disaster declaration, which follows a request from Marshallese president Hilda Heine on 1 April, will allow Fema to provide emergency relief to the archipelago, which is suffering one of its worst-ever droughts. Fema is able to provide federal assistance to overseas territories such as the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the Marshall Islands, as well as US states.
Heine declared a state of emergency in February after the Marshall Islands, a collection of atolls south-west of Hawaii, received just a quarter of its usual rainfall during the November to February period. 
Water is being carefully distributed, with residents in the capital Majuro given an allocation once a week for a four-hour period. “We’re receiving complaints from the public that they’re out of water,” said Majuro mayor Ladie Jack as the emergency declaration was made. 
The low-lying Marshall Islands is extremely reliant on consistent rainfall for its water supply, given there are few freshwater reservoirs or sources of groundwater. The strong El Niño climate event has fueled the drought, with Micronesia, Palau, Fiji and Papua New Guinea also affected to varying degrees.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned “severe or extreme” drought conditions are set to persist, with just light rainfall expected in the coming months. 
The US provided $5.5m drought relief to the Marshall Islands in 2013, following a dry spell that forced people to drink from coconuts and eat unripe breadfruit. Water catchments became clogged with dirt and salt, with the staple diet of fish becoming scarce as fishermen were unable to travel out under the hot sun for long periods without water.
The 50,000 people who live in the Marshall Islands are able to move to the US and work without a visa following an agreement made between the two countries. The US conducted nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll, part of the island network, in the 1940s and 1950s, forcing local people to relocate.
Climate change is a looming threat to the Marshall Islands. The low-lying atolls risk being swamped by rising sea levels, which could threaten key infrastructure and ruin drinking water supplies through salt intrusion.
The Marshall Islands were one of the most vocal nations calling for a 1.5C limit to the global temperature increase at the Paris climate talks last year, warning that the nation would be in mortal danger if warming hit 2C above pre-industrial times."

Australia and the rest of the world have been reeling from a string of temperature records being smashed. February caused alarm when it was the most unusually warm month on record by a huge margin. But that record was broken immediately by March.
 In Australia March 2016 was the warmest March on record. And this week the Bureau Of Meteorology released its seasonal outlook, showing above average temperatures are set to continue across the country at least throughout May.
According to David Karoly, a climate scientist from the University of Melbourne, climate change increased the chance of March breaking the temperature record in Australia by at least seven times. 
“The previous record had about a one in 43-year chance due to natural climate variations alone but now occurs about one year in six in the present climate, that is already affected by human-caused climate change,” he told Guardian Australia.
“It’s evidence that climate change is already happening – and increasing the risks of hot extremes.”
 Blair Trewin from the Bureau of Meteorology said: “April won’t be a record but it will be well above normal.” 
Throughout May temperatures across most of the country have an 80% chance of being warmer than the average from 1961 to 1990. By June and July most coastal regions will continue to have unusually warm weather, however temperatures will return to normal around central and southern Australia.
The current spike in warm weather is happening partly because of the monster El Niño that spread a pulse of warm water across the Pacific Ocean in 2015. That El Niño is dissipating, spreading the warmer water around Australia, raising temperatures.
But all that was happening on top of the background of global warming, Trewin said. He said that these days, in an El Niño year, the world tended to experience extreme temperatures and merely “above average” temperatures in other years. Only when a La Niña cooled the globe were there normal or slightly cool temperatures."

Al Gore, former US vice-president, Nobel laureate and chairman of the Climate Reality Project, has led the global discussion about climate change for many years. His multi-award-winning film An Inconvenient Truth (2006) has been widely credited with changing the way world leaders and citizens think about the issue. Don Henry is public policy fellow in environmentalism at the University of Melbourne and is a former director of the Australian Conservation Foundation. He is a long-term collaborator with Gore. Their conversation was recorded for the Griffith Review.
Don Henry: The Paris climate agreement was recently concluded – what opportunities and challenges does it present to the world for the future?
Al Gore: This past December, 195 countries came together in Paris for the 21st conference of the parties (COP21) and reached a historic agreement, which exceeded the highest end of the range of expectations we could have had for it. Now the questions we face are how will we solve the climate crisis, what opportunities are we presented with and what challenges remain? COP21 received an unprecedented level of support from all sectors of society, both public and private, creating a window of opportunity aligning at just the right time for a successful agreement. We have created a major new opportunity by committing to a sustainable future. But we have to steer in the right direction and accelerate our pace because we still face challenges. We simply cannot continue to put 110m tons of global-warming pollution into the atmosphere every day as if it’s an open sewer. 
The sum total of the commitments made in Paris – the intended nationally determined contributions – will not add up to what is necessary to keep us under the target set by the agreement. The emissions reductions agreements are not mandatory, which, I believe, was the unavoidable and right choice. But because of this and because we know we must change, it is exceptionally important that we focus on the commitments made by countries and the work nations are doing to implement their commitments, as well as process, visualise and share this information widely. 
Moreover, the regular, five-year review and ratchet provision, and the requirement for transparency in reporting, are mandatory, and they will give people who care about our planet and future generations an opportunity to focus on the decisions being made by their leaders. This is really important. The success of Paris was largely due to the fact that global awareness, and the level and quality of global consciousness about the existential threat we face from the climate crisis, has risen to a point where nations that were in the bubble could not go home without having taken substantial action – and we need to keep the pressure on. Significantly, the process of “review and ratchet” set out in the Paris agreement will occur against the backdrop of a continuing sharp decline in the cost of renewable energy, energy efficiency, batteries and storage, and sustainable agriculture and forestry. The practical ability of nations five years from now to say, “we can do more” will be greatly enhanced. So if the people of the world really pay attention and continue to keep the pressure on, it will make a tremendous difference. 
The rapidly declining cost of renewable energy, particularly solar photovoltaic (PV) energy, provides a great opportunity for nations around the world to embrace a sustainable, low-carbon economy. Our ability to convert sunshine into usable energy has become much cheaper far more quickly than anyone had predicted. For example, solar energy has been coming down in cost at a rate of 10% per year over the past 30 years. 
In many parts of the world, renewable energy is already cheaper than that of fossil fuels and in some parts of the world renewable energy is leapfrogging fossil fuels altogether. These cost reductions are continuing. 
But we must do more to help nations make the transition to a low- or zero-carbon economy. India, for example, has more people without any electricity at all than the entire population of the United States. And in order to invest in solar on the scale at which they require presently means borrowing money for solar farms at an interest rate of 8-12%. That is an absurdly high cost of capital in an era of very low interest rates. We need to address this on a priority basis and the public-private partnerships on which the Paris agreement was built need to do more and go farther. 
We also need to put a price on carbon and enable markets to more effectively reflect the true costs of sources of energy. Though there is a growing adoption of direct and indirect carbon pricing at local, national and regional levels now being implemented in 40 countries, and 23 large city-states and provincial governments, we must work to make it a universal standard rather than an exception. We need to move faster in eliminating the massive government subsidies of fossil fuels. 
Regardless of the challenges we still face, there was a powerful signal of opportunity sent from Paris by business leaders and investors, civil society leaders and society in general. That signal is being received around the world: we can and we will solve the climate crisis. 
Henry: In your book The Future, you examine six drivers of global change. With fresh insights from the last two years, do you still see these as the key drivers of change for the future? Would you add, subtract and emphasise any? 
Gore: Much has changed since I wrote The Future but the forces that are driving that change have not. For example, our world is becoming increasingly globalised, the biotech revolution is speeding up, the internet has continued to serve as an open public square and there appear to be no signs of these advancements slowing down. 
This is evident when we witness the ongoing struggle to balance cyber security and surveillance, and when we see automation changing the way we produce goods and services. It’s clear as we watch countries around the world confront the balance of political, economic and military powers, as they shift faster than we have seen at any time in the last 500 years and as advancements in synthetic biology continue to reinvent life and death. 
If I were to emphasise any key driver of global change, it would be the rapid transformation of renewable energy to fulfil our energy needs and solve the climate crisis. Since The Future was published, we have seen the development of renewable energy continue to progress faster than I could have imagined, along with a stunningly sharp decline in the price of renewable energy. In 2000, analysts predicted that wind capacity would reach 30GW by 2010. In reality, that was exceeded by 14.5 times in 2015. In 2002, analysts predicted the solar energy market would grow 1GW per year by 2010. That was exceeded by 17 times; in 2015 it was exceeded by 58 times and it is predicted to be exceeded by as much as 68 times in 2016. And there are no signs of these trends stopping. 
I also certainly hoped for, but could not have predicted, the willingness of global leaders to come together so eagerly to chart a path forward to solve the climate crisis this past December. Actors in every part of our global society are recognising not only the challenges we face due to these key drivers but also the opportunities they provide. And they are actively working together to take advantage of these opportunities. We also cannot ignore the speed with which many of these changes are taking place and having an impact on our society as a whole. We can, we will and we are working to minimise their negative impacts and take hold of the opportunities they present us with – but we cannot wait and we must do more. 
Henry: You refer to the beginning of a massive global transformation to re-establish a healthy balance between human civilisation and the future. What could this look like in 2050? 
Gore: The good news is that establishing a healthy balance between human civilisation and the future is within our reach but it will require a highly functioning global ideology – and ours currently needs substantial reforms. 
Capitalism must incorporate reforms to show complete and accurate measurements of the full spectrum of “value”, including both positive and negative “externalities”, so that we can effectively respond to threatening crises like climate change. As for democracy, which until recent history has served as a beacon of hope and leadership for the world, it has been hacked by large corporations and special interests. It no longer reflects the ideals it was established to embody and instead is dominated by the unchecked influence of money in politics. This must be changed urgently so that we can once again harvest “the wisdom of crowds” in self-governance. 
If we are to have the healthy balance that is well within our reach, we’ll need to re-evaluate our current reliance on gross domestic product, fully recognise the value of public goods, redesign growth, agriculture and forestry with sustainability as a guide, and firmly establish leadership based on the deepest human values. But there is hope.
Technology, for its part – particularly the internet – is giving voice to the growing movement for reform. Social media, blogs and digital journalism are leveling the playing field and serving as the foundation for broader participation in democracy, and the elevation of reason over wealth and power. And, as income inequality persists throughout the world, more calls are being made to ensure that our measurements of growth are fair and logical. The Paris agreement shows us that we can do the collaborative work necessary for a healthy, sustainable future. 2050 could be dominated by clean, efficient energy and a zero-carbon, commonsense economy, which utilises a long-term view and protects the planet for future generations. Developing nations like India and Bangladesh, where they are installing nearly two new rooftop photovoltaic systems every minute, and countries in west and east Africa are already embracing a future powered by clean energy. We have all the tools we need to solve the climate crisis and ensure a sustainable future; the only question is how dramatically we can accelerate this transition. 
Henry: Reflections for Australia – what could this look like in Australia in 2050? Where are Australia’s strengths and weaknesses for this transformed future? 
Gore: Australia is one of the world’s “canaries in the coalmine”, a place where we are already seeing the impacts of the climate crisis. This past year was one of Australia’s five hottest years of all time and annual rainfall was well below average. Hotter temperatures and rising sea-level projections mean that the climate crisis could cost Australia as much as $200bn. In the face of this harsh new climate reality, there have been political forces in your country working to prevent Australia’s ability to act as the global leader it once was in the effort to solve the climate crisis. The most recent example of this is the announcement of major cuts to Australia’s CSIRO, a global leader and reference point for climate science. These cuts will deeply affect the source of valuable research for the entire world at a time when such information is critical to solving the challenge of our changing climate. They should be re-evaluated at the highest level.
In 2014, I was disappointed by the repeal of Australia’s nationwide price on carbon. Despite [Australia’s] legacy as a world leader, this step placed Australia behind other major industrial nations in the growing global effort to reduce carbon emissions. Yet the continued public support for the Renewable Energy Target, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Climate Change Authority are encouraging signs of Australia’s continued effort to solve the climate crisis. 
In areas where the national government has failed to act or when political forces work to prevent climate action, Australia’s subnational governments and businesses are, in fact, proving to be a bold force. And despite government cuts in investment, individuals are leading the way by investing in clean energy like solar PV. According to a report last year, approximately 15% of Australian homes were equipped with solar panels. Much of this growth is due to important policy choices in places like South Australia and Queensland. By the end of 2014, more than 1.4m small-scale solar PV systems were installed across Australia. And there are even more encouraging signs. From June 2014 to June 2015, annual emissions were the second lowest since 2000 and per capita emissions were 28.4% lower than they were in 1990. These examples, along with the Labor party’s pledge to adopt a 50% renewable energy target by 2030, show that there is strong support and opportunity for climate action in the country. 
Australia has a rich history of beating its international commitments on climate change, beginning with the commitment made under the Kyoto protocol. The country’s business and government sectors must return to the vanguard of solving the climate crisis and remember that political will is a renewable resource. 
Henry: You dedicate your book The Future to your mother. What did she and your other mentors give you that has helped you think about change and the future? 
Gore: My mother was a pioneer in pursuing the rights of women. She was one of the first women to graduate from Vanderbilt law school in my home state of Tennessee. After graduating, she could not find legal work anywhere in the city of Nashville because none of the law firms there would hire women. She had to leave Tennessee and go elsewhere in order to seek employment. Even in the prime of her career she still faced this kind of discrimination on a regular basis. 
When I first encountered the history of women’s suffrage and the long struggle in my country for women’s rights, I imagined the difficulties in those first decades of the 20th century that my own mother faced, not only in finding work in her profession but raised in a society where the right to vote was decided on gender. It hit me like a bolt of lightning. I could not understand how there could be or have been such discrimination against women. 
But I took from that realisation a message of real hope because if we could change so much from that time until now, it means that more change is possible. And the women’s suffrage movement is not the only moral cause humanity has had to deal with. We have seen similar struggles in the civil rights movement of my country, the movement against apartheid in South Africa and the movement to remove discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. These examples all demonstrate that the political will to act is, itself, a renewable resource. 
They are fantastic sources of hope for all the work that must be done in order to realise a sustainable agenda for the future. As the great poet Wallace Stevens said: “After the last ‘no’ comes a ‘yes’ and on that ‘yes’ the future of the world depends.”

Al Gore has said the decision by Australia’s science agency CSIRO to cut climate research should be “re-evaluated at the highest level”, since they limit a source of critical information for the entire world as it attempts to solve the challenges posed by climate change. 
The former US Democratic vice-president also praised the government’s support for renewable energy and the Labor party’s recent climate change policy announcement.
The comments by Gore, a leading climate change campaigner, were made in a wide-ranging conversation in the latest edition of the Australian literary quarterly the Griffith Review, which has also been published online by Guardian Australia. 
“In the face of this harsh new climate reality, there have been political forces in your country working to prevent Australia’s ability to act as the global leader it once was in the effort to solve the climate crisis,” he said, in conversation with Don Henry from the University of Melbourne, and former director of the Australian Conservation Foundation.
“The most recent example of this is the announcement of major cuts to Australia’s CSIRO, a global leader and reference point for climate science. These cuts will deeply affect the source of valuable research for the entire world at a time when such information is critical to solving the challenge of our changing climate,” he said. “They should be re-evaluated at the highest level.”
The comments follow remarks Gore made in February, shortly after the cuts were announced. “Further development of climate modelling and observations by CSIRO and colleague scientific organisations is essential to planning for climate mitigation and adaptation to global warming,” he said at the time. “This effort needs strengthening, not weakening, after the Paris Agreement in December.”
Besides praising state governments and businesses that are driving investment in solar PV, he also singles out the Australian Labor party’s recent climate policy announcement.
“These examples, along with the Labor party’s pledge to adopt a 50% renewable energy target by 2030, show that there is a strong support and opportunity for climate action in this country.”
In order to solve the challenge, Gore said the world needed “a highly functioning global ideology”. He said capitalism needed to find a way to price environmental damage and democracy needed to be fixed after it was “hacked by large corporations and special interests,” which meant it was “dominated by the unchecked influence of money in politics”.
But Gore said there was hope all this could be achieved. Previous estimates of how quickly renewable energy would be adopted have regularly been far exceeded, and the agreement in Paris sent a signal around the world that “we can and we will solve the climate crisis,” he said."

Labor has had another stab at a climate policy – half brave, half cautious and vague, but certainly more credible than the current government’s fig leaf of a “plan”. And the PNG government has called time on the festering human rights catastrophe that is Manus Island, a development that left both parties gawpingly devoid of answers.
Each of these failures has been driven by politics.
Australian climate policy is at near crisis point because it can be solved only with a degree of bipartisanship, absent in the past seven years of brain-dead fact-free sense-paralysing conflict. Asylum policy is already at crisis point because the leading parties are in a bipartisan death lock that refuses to acknowledge the human and moral cost of achieving the stop-every-single-boat objective. 
But instead of discussing how we got ourselves into these messes or how we might get out of them – what the climate policy might actually mean for the economy or the environment, or what the Manus decision by the PNG supreme court might mean for the poor souls we’ve left languishing there – politicians and some commentators leap straight over the detail and discuss how the developments will “play” in the political “game” of the imminent election campaign. Or launch a completely inaccurate scare campaign written for a different policy altogether. Or argue over who’s “fault” it all is. Because those things are obviously way more important than, I don’t know, the future of our environment, our economy, or the lives of the 850 utterly desperate men detained at our behest for years.
Of course, we’ve always assessed the political impact of events or announcements but there was a time when we used to make some attempt to understand what they meant first, or what might be done about them.
But much of the response to each of these politics-fuelled crises ignored the substance and immediately reacted to, and assessed their impact on ... politics. 
When the Papua New Guinean supreme court brought down its widely anticipated decision that the Manus offshore detention centre was illegal, everyone’s first reaction was to pass the buck.
The latest agreement for processing on Manus Island was struck by Kevin Rudd, but Labor’s Richard Marles immediately said the mess was all the government’s fault.
“We have seen a complete failure on the part of the Turnbull government to properly negotiate resettlement arrangements with PNG and to negotiate resettlement arrangements with third country options,” he thundered.
“The Manus facility was established to serve as a circuit breaker ... It was never intended to serve as a punitive place of indefinite detention.”
But according to the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, it was all Labor’s fault.
“Well this arrangement obviously was put together by the Rudd government back when they lost control of our borders and thousands of people were arriving,” he said.
And when a few Labor MPs reiterated their long-standing opposition to the policy, Dutton insisted the real issue at stake here was “a leadership” question for Bill Shorten. Yep, right, that would be the big question.
He said the refugees on Manus were PNG’s problem. PNG said they were Australia’s problem.
Meanwhile, commentators busied themselves with the really critical conundrums – was this a crisis for Malcolm Turnbull or in fact a “political gift”? Because it was great for the Coalition to be talking about boats during an election campaign.
Even accepting the overriding policy priorities of both major parties to keep people smugglers out of business, these responses are pathetic. Yes, the government has been working furiously behind the scenes to try to find another country that will take refugees from Manus and Nauru, and if Labor was in government it would be doing the same thing. But the Coalition appears to be ruling out options with at least some chance of success, such as resettling refugees in a third country from where they could apply to come to Australia after a period of time, or New Zealand’s long-standing offer to take some refugees, apparently because a solution cannot even be contemplated if there’s a risk even one more boat might come. The political scoreboard is the top priority.
Of course, there aren’t easy answers, but a solution would surely be simpler if we just concentrated on finding it, rather than apportioning political blame. 
And on the same day Labor released its climate change plan, which retreated on so many aspects of the former emissions trading scheme that even the Business Council of Australia said it could provide a bridge towards bipartisanship. One of the Coalition’s own advisers concedes the scheme Labor is proposing for the electricity sector is almost identical to the one Turnbull championed as a “greener, cheaper, smarter” option in 2009, and exactly what everyone thinks the “Direct Action” plan will be morphed into when it is reviewed in 2017 – if the Coalition actually wants to achieve its greenhouse gas reduction targets, that is.
Did the prime minister, who promised to respect the intelligence of the electorate, concede any of these things? As his predecessor might have said, nope, nope, nope. He and his ministers dusted off the same old, factually incorrect scare campaign that Tony Abbott was using – misused the same modelling data to sprout the same incorrect assertions about the possible cost of Labor’s scheme, and cranked up the same lines about “big thumping electricity tax” that is about to impoverish Australian households. Stay tuned for dire predictions about Whyalla and lamb roasts. The Daily Telegraph has already responded to the semblance of a climate policy with a full front page picture of a masked ghoul, screaming “Horror Show”, because a “nightmare” was returning. Apparently if we have no credible climate policy we can all sleep easy.
Business and environment groups alike were dismayed by the reaction, because, as modelling by the former Reserve Bank of Australia board member Warwick McKibbin clearly shows, the thing that will push up power prices far further than anything either party has on the table is the cost of continued investment uncertainty, the kind that is caused by continued climate “wars” and stupid screaming headlines and political paralysis. As recent modelling by The Climate Institute showed, continued deadlock and delay in taking action will cause massive economic disruption in Australia when we finally realise that we have to do something in coming years.
And still politicians tell us, straight faced, that they are really interested in good policy because that leads to good politics in the end. It’s hard to know whether to laugh or cry. Or scream."

Sally Jewell, US secretary of the interior, painted a stark picture of communities relocating and lives disrupted in her first official visit to Canada. The Arctic, which is warming at twice the rate of the global average, has just recorded its lowest recorded peak ice extent after what’s been called a “warm, crazy winter”.
“We will have climate refugees,” Jewell said. “We have to figure out how to deal with potentially relocating villages. There’s real tangible support we need to do from a government basis, working alongside indigenous communities as they make very difficult choices about what is right for them.
“We can’t turn this around. We can stem the increase in temperature, we can stem some of the effect, perhaps, if we act on climate. But the changes are under way and they are very rapid.”
The escalating Arctic temperatures, diminishing ice and rising sea levels are having consequences for humans as well as other animals such as polar bears and walruses. The ability to catch fish and travel – or even to hold the famed Iditarod dog sled race in Alaska – is at risk.
Jewell said the remote town of Kivalina in Alaska is “washing away”. The coastal town, located around 80 miles above the Arctic circle, has been visited by Barack Obama following warnings its 400-strong population will have to be moved due to thinning ice that exposes the town to crashing waves.
It’s a problem that is expected to be replicated elsewhere in Alaska and in Canada. Jewell said political leaders need to “act and support” efforts to make communities more resilient to climate change. US Republicans have, so far, opposed any funding to protect or relocate Alaskan towns.
“The changing climate isn’t just about melting permafrost, it’s having a huge impact upon cultures,” said Catherine McKenna, Canada’s environment minister, who met with Jewell in Quebec. “When your ice highway has gone, communities can’t interact. It’s having a huge impact upon food and food insecurity.”
McKenna said there is a “huge commitment to do more” from Obama and Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister. The two leaders met in Washington DC in March to agree to help lead the world to a low-carbon economy and to bolster efforts to protect the Arctic and the people who live there.
Scientists expect the Arctic to be completely ice-free for at least a few days during the summer by the 2040s. The area of summer ice has shrunk by around 3m sq km since 1980.

Modelling by the former Reserve Bank of Australia board member Warwick McKibbin, done for the former Abbott government, found the Coalition’s promise to cut emissions by between 26% and 28% – if achieved with efficient policies – would shave between 0.2% and 0.3% from GDP in 2030, whereas Labor’s 45% target would reduce GDP by between 0.5% and 0.7%.
But the same modelling found the difference between the two policies (0.3% of GDP), or even the cost of the Labor target, would be dwarfed by the potential cost of continued investor uncertainty – which could be as high as 1% of GDP. 
“Uncertainty increases the cost of capital for electricity generation and that increases electricity prices, which flows through the whole economy. Those price increases can be significantly larger than the price rises flowing from any of the policies to achieve a modest reduction in emissions,” McKibbin told Guardian Australia.
“The most critical thing is to achieve clear bipartisanship; continued political deadlock and disagreement increases uncertainty and means investors need a higher rate of return. Bipartisan policy gives you real economic benefits, and uncertainty costs as least as much as any difference in the estimated costs of meeting the targets proposed by each of the major parties,” he said.
McKibbin has raised concerns that, in practice, Labor’s target might be difficult to achieve. 
He also says the government will struggle to meet its target using its current policy, largely relying on buying emissions reduction with the $2.5bn emissions reduction fund.
“The problem with the government’s existing policy is it’s very difficult to scale up. They will almost certainly have to modify it so it became a baseline and credit trading scheme and get it off budget.
“If the government did that there would be an overlap there with Labor’s policy on the electricity policy.”
Labor is now proposing a separate “emissions intensity” trading scheme for the electricity sector in which generators with higher emissions than an industry-wide baseline would have to buy credits from those with lower emissions. This is a big shift from the “cap and trade” scheme it previously introduced. The Coalition’s “Direct Action” scheme includes provisions that – with adjustment – could become the same kind of trading scheme.
McKibbin joins the economist and adviser to the Coalition government Danny Price and the Business Council of Australia in pointing out that these similarities provide a possible basis for a bipartisan policy.
Price, the chief executive of Frontier Economics, who advised the Coalition on “Direct Action”, told Guardian Australia the Labor plan was very similar to a scheme advocated by Malcolm Turnbull in 2009, and to the scheme that could be formed from “Direct Action”.
“The emissions intensity part of Labor’s plan appears to be exactly what we were proposing for Malcolm Turnbull and Nick Xenophon in 2009,” he said.
Price modelled the scheme for Turnbull and Xenophon when Turnbull was the opposition leader and was considering his response to the then Labor government’s cap-and-trade ETS.
Turnbull lauded it as a “cheaper, greener, smarter scheme” and said it could deliver deeper cuts to greenhouse emissions but imposed far lower increases in electricity prices. But the then prime minister Kevin Rudd dismissed it as a “magic pudding”. The then climate minister Penny Wong, now the leader of the opposition in the Senate, also dismissed the scheme that now forms part of Labor’s policy.
And Price – who the government recently appointed to the Climate Change Authority and who acted as an adviser on Direct Action – also said the Coalition would probably have to move to a similar scheme itself to meet its own emissions reduction targets.
“The government’s Direct Action plan – its safeguard mechanism – could be modified to create exactly this same type of scheme,” he said. “I’ve always thought that was the most likely way for them to go after the review they have scheduled for 2017, because they are obviously going to have to make changes to meet even their existing targets and this is a low-cost way to do it.
“It is actually emerging as an idea with the potential to be adopted by both major parties.”
Under Direct Action, the “safeguards mechanism” is supposed to ensure that increased emissions from heavy industry and electricity generators do not undo the reductions bought through the government’s $2.5bn scheme, by setting baselines for their emissions.
At present, the baselines are lenient, ensuring industries don’t “go rogue” by not seeking to reduce their greenhouse emissions. But many observers, including business groups, expect they will have to be tightened after 2017 to gradually reduce industrial emissions. And that would turn Direct Action into much the same scheme as Labor is proposing.
But the Turnbull government immediately attacked Labor’s policy as an “electricity tax”. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, called it a “big, thumping electricity tax” and the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said Labor, the Greens and the independents wanted to “make people poorer because it’s good for you, because it’s righteous”."

Politicians and scientists have had their say, but how are writers and artists responding to this crisis?";"In 2003 the Australian philosopher Glenn Albrecht coined the term solastalgia to mean a “form of psychic or existential distress caused by environmental change”. Albrecht was studying the effects of long-term drought and large-scale mining activity on communities in New South Wales, when he realised that no word existed to describe the unhappiness of people whose landscapes were being transformed about them by forces beyond their control. He proposed his new term to describe this distinctive kind of homesickness.
Where the pain of nostalgia arises from moving away, the pain of solastalgia arises from staying put. Where the pain of nostalgia can be mitigated by return, the pain of solastalgia tends to be irreversible. Solastalgia is not a malady specific to the present – we might think of John Clare as a solastalgic poet, witnessing his native Northamptonshire countryside disrupted by enclosure in the 1810s – but it has flourished recently. “A worldwide increase in ecosystem distress syndromes,” wrote Albrecht, is “matched by a corresponding increase in human distress syndromes”. Solastalgia speaks of a modern uncanny, in which a familiar place is rendered unrecognisable by climate change or corporate action: the home become suddenly unhomely around its inhabitants.
Albrecht’s coinage is part of an emerging lexis for what we are increasingly calling the “Anthropocene”: the new epoch of geological time in which human activity is considered such a powerful influence on the environment, climate and ecology of the planet that it will leave a long-term signature in the strata record. And what a signature it will be. We have bored 50m kilometres of holes in our search for oil. We remove mountain tops to get at the coal they contain. The oceans dance with billions of tiny plastic beads. Weaponry tests have dispersed artificial radionuclides globally. The burning of rainforests for monoculture production sends out killing smog-palls that settle into the sediment across entire countries. We have become titanic geological agents, our legacy legible for millennia to come.
The idea of the Anthropocene asks hard questions of us. Temporally, it requires that we imagine ourselves inhabitants not just of a human lifetime or generation, but also of “deep time” – the dizzyingly profound eras of Earth history that extend both behind and ahead of the present. Politically, it lays bare some of the complex cross-weaves of vulnerability and culpability that exist between us and other species, as well as between humans now and humans to come. Conceptually, it warrants us to consider once again whether – in Fredric Jameson’s phrase – “the modernisation process is complete, and nature is gone for good”, leaving nothing but us.
There are good reasons to be sceptical of the epitaphic impulse to declare “the end of nature”. There are also good reasons to be sceptical of the Anthropocene’s absolutism, the political presumptions it encodes, and the specific histories of power and violence that it masks. But the Anthropocene is a massively forceful concept, and as such it bears detailed thinking through. Though it has its origin in the Earth sciences and advanced computational technologies, its consequences have rippled across global culture during the last 15 years. Conservationists, environmentalists, policymakers, artists, activists, writers, historians, political and cultural theorists, as well as scientists and social scientists in many specialisms, are all responding to its implications. A Stanford University team has boldly proposed that – living as we are through the last years of one Earth epoch, and the birth of another – we belong to “Generation Anthropocene”.
Literature and art are confronted with particular challenges by the idea of the Anthropocene. Old forms of representation are experiencing drastic new pressures and being tasked with daunting new responsibilities. How might a novel or a poem possibly account for our authorship of global-scale environmental change across millennia – let alone shape the nature of that change? The indifferent scale of the Anthropocene can induce a crushing sense of the cultural sphere’s impotence.
Yet as the notion of a world beyond us has become difficult to sustain, so a need has grown for fresh vocabularies and narratives that might account for the kinds of relation and responsibility in which we find ourselves entangled. “Nature,” Raymond Williams famously wrote in Keywords (1976), “is perhaps the most complex word in the language.” Four decades on, there is no “perhaps” about it.
Projects are presently under way around the world to gain the most basic of purchases on the Anthropocene – a lexis with which to reckon it. Cultural anthropologists in America have begun a glossary for what they call “an Anthropocene as yet unseen”, intended as a “resource” for confronting the “urgent concerns of the present moment”. There, familiar terms – petroleum, melt, distribution, dream – are made strange again, vested with new resilience or menace when viewed through the “global optic” of the Anthropocene.
Last year I started the construction of a crowdsourced Anthropocene glossary called the “Desecration Phrasebook”, and in 2014 The Bureau of Linguistical Reality was founded “for the purpose of collecting, translating and creating a new vocabulary for the Anthropocene”. Albrecht’s solastalgia is one of the bureau’s terms, along with “stieg”, “apex-guilt” and “shadowtime”, the latter meaning “the sense of living in two or more orders of temporal scale simultaneously” – an acknowledgment of the out-of-jointness provoked by Anthropocene awareness. Many of these words are, clearly, ugly coinages for an ugly epoch. Taken in sum, they speak of our stuttering attempts to describe just what it is we have done.

The word “Anthropocene” itself entered the Oxford English Dictionary surprisingly late, along with “selfie” and “upcycle”, in June 2014 – 15 years after it is generally agreed to have first been used in its popular sense.
In 1999, at a conference in Mexico City on the Holocene – the Earth epoch we at present officially inhabit, beginning around 11,700 years ago – the Nobel prize-winning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen was struck by the inaccuracy of the Holocene designation. “I suddenly thought this was wrong,” he later recalled. “The world has changed too much. So I said, ‘No, we are in the Anthropocene.’ I just made the word up on the spur of the moment. But it seems to have stuck.”
The following year, Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer – an American diatom specialist who had been using the term informally since the 1980s – jointly published an article proposing that the Anthropocene should be considered a new Earth epoch, on the grounds that “mankind will remain a major geological force for many millennia, maybe millions of years to come”. The scientific community took the Crutzen-Stoermer proposal seriously enough to submit it to the rigours of the stratigraphers.
Stratigraphy is an awesomely stringent discipline. Stratigraphers are at once the archivists, monks and philosophers of the Earth sciences. Their specialism is the division of deep time into aeons, eras, periods, epochs and stages, and the establishment of temporal limits for those divisions and their subdivisions. Their bible is the International Chronostratigraphic Chart, the beautiful document that archives Earth history from the present back to the “informal” aeon of the Hadean, between 4bn and 4.6bn years ago (“informal” because vanishingly little is known about it). Being a geo-geek, I sometimes mutter the mnemonics of the ICS as I cycle to work, trying to get the sequences straight: Cows Often Sit Down Carefully. Perhaps Their Joints Creak? – Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous …
'What will survive of us is love', wrote Philip Larkin. Wrong. What will survive of us is plastic
The Anthropocene Working Group of the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy – a title straight out of Gormenghast – was created in 2009. It was charged with delivering two recommendations: whether the Anthropocene should be formalised as an epoch and, if so, when it began. Among the baselines considered by the group have been the first recorded use of fire by hominins around 1.8m years ago, the dawn of agriculture around 8,000 years ago and the Industrial Revolution.
The group’s report is due within months. Recent publications indicate that they will recommend the designation of the Anthropocene, and that the “stratigraphically optimal” temporal limit will be located somewhere in the mid-20th century. This places the start of the Anthropocene simultaneous with the start of the nuclear age. It also coincides with the so-called “Great Acceleration”, when massive increases occurred in population, carbon emissions, species invasions and extinctions, and when the production and discard of metals, concrete and plastics boomed.
Plastics in particular are being taken as a key marker for the Anthropocene, giving rise to the inevitable nickname of the “Plasticene”. We currently produce around 100m tonnes of plastic globally each year. Because plastics are inert and difficult to degrade, some of this plastic material will find its way into the strata record. Among the future fossils of the Anthropocene, therefore, might be the trace forms not only of megafauna and nano-planktons, but also shampoo bottles and deodorant caps – the strata that contain them precisely dateable with reference to the product-design archives of multinationals. “What will survive of us is love”, wrote Philip Larkin. Wrong. What will survive of us is plastic – and lead-207, the stable isotope at the end of the uranium-235 decay chain.

The Deutsches Museum in Munich is currently hosting “An Anthropocene Wunderkammer”, which it calls “the first major exhibition in the world” to take the Anthropocene as its theme. Among the exhibits is a remarkable work by the American writer and conservation biologist Julianne Lutz Warren, entitled “Hopes Echo”. It concerns the huia, an exquisite bird of New Zealand that was made extinct in the early 20th century due to habitat destruction, introduced predators and overhunting for its black and ivory tail feathers. The huia vanished before field-recording technologies existed, but a version of its song has survived by means of an eerie series of preservations: a sound fossil. In order to lure the birds to their snares, the Maori people learned to mimic the huia song. This mimicked song was passed down between generations, a practice that continued even after the huia was gone. In 1954 a pakeha (a European New Zealander) called RAL Bateley made a recording of a Maori man, Henare Hamana, whistling his imitation of the huia’s call.
Warren’s exhibit makes Bateley’s crackly recording available, and her accompanying text unfolds the complexities of its sonic strata. It is, as Warren puts it, “a soundtrack of the sacred voices of extinct birds echoing in that of a dead man echoing out of a machine echoing through the world today”. The intellectual elegance of her work – and its exemplary quality as an Anthropocene-aware artefact – lies in its subtle tracing of the technological and imperial histories involved in a single extinction event and its residue.
Anthropocene art is, unsurprisingly, obsessed with loss and disappearance. We are living through what is popularly known as the “sixth great extinction”. A third of all amphibian species are at risk of extinction. A fifth of the globe’s 5,500 known mammals are classified as endangered, threatened or vulnerable. The current extinction rate for birds may be faster than any recorded across the 150m years of avian evolutionary history. We exist in an ongoing biodiversity crisis – but register that crisis, if at all, as an ambient hum of guilt, easily faded out. Like other unwholesome aspects of the Anthropocene, we mostly respond to mass extinction with stuplimity: the aesthetic experience in which astonishment is united with boredom, such that we overload on anxiety to the point of outrage-outage.
Art and literature might, at their best, shock us out of the stuplime. Warren’s haunted study of the huia finds its own echo in the prose and poetry of Richard Skelton and Autumn Richardson. Their work – sometimes jointly authored – is minutely attentive to the specificities of the gone and the will-be-gone. Place names and plant names assume the status of chants or litanies: spectral taxa incanted as elegy, or as a means to conjure back. In Succession (2013), Skelton and Richardson studied palynological records to reconstruct lists of the grasses and flowers that flourished in the western Lake District after the end of the Pleistocene. The area “is still inhabited by the ghosts of lost flora and fauna”, writes Richardson, of which there are “traces that even now, centuries later, can be uncovered and celebrated”. Diagrams for the Summoning of Wolves (2015), a purely musical work, shifts from celebration to intervention: it is intended as a performative utterance – a series of notes, rituals and gestures that might somehow enable “the return itself”.
Rory Gibb smartly notes that the work of Skelton and Richardson is different in kind from conventional eco-elegy: it evokes “a more feral feeling of being stalked by ecosystemic memory”. Such a feeling is appropriate to the Anthropocene, in which we have erased entire biomes and crashed whole ecosystems. Their writing often moves back through the Holocene and into its prior epochs, before sliding forwards to imaginary far futures. They send ghost emissaries – foxes, wolves, pollen grains, stones – back and forth along these deep-time lines. Instead of the intimacies and connections urged by conventional “green” literature, writing like this speaks of a darker ecological impulse, in which salvation and self-knowledge can no longer be found in a mountain peak or stooping falcon, and categories such as the picturesque or even the beautiful congeal into kitsch.

Perhaps the greatest challenge posed to our imagination by the Anthropocene is its inhuman organisation as an event. If the Anthropocene can be said to “take place”, it does so across huge scales of space and vast spans of time, from nanometers to planets, and from picoseconds to aeons. It involves millions of different teleconnected agents, from methane molecules to rare earth metals to magnetic fields to smartphones to mosquitoes. Its energies are interactive, its properties emergent and its structures withdrawn.
In 2010 Timothy Morton adopted the term hyperobject to denote some of the characteristic entities of the Anthropocene. Hyperobjects are “so massively distributed in time, space and dimensionality” that they defy our perception, let alone our comprehension. Among the examples Morton gives of hyperobjects are climate change, mass species extinction and radioactive plutonium. “In one sense [hyperobjects] are abstractions,” he notes, “in another they are ferociously, catastrophically real.”
We exist in an ongoing bio­diversity crisis – but register that crisis as an ambient hum of guilt, easily faded out
Creative non-fiction, and especially reportage, has adapted most quickly to this “distributed” aspect of the Anthropocene. Episodic in assembly and dispersed in geography, some outstanding recent non-fiction has proved able to map intricate patterns of environmental cause and effect, and in this way draw hyperobjects into at least partial visibility. Elizabeth Kolbert’s The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History (2014) and her Field Notes from a Catastrophe (2006) are landmarks here, as is Naomi Klein’s This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs the Climate (2014). In 2015 Gaia Vince published Adventures in the Anthropocene, perhaps the best book so far to trace the epoch’s impacts on the world’s poor, and the slow violence that climate change metes out to them.
Last year also saw the publication of The Mushroom at the End of the World: On the Possibility of Life in Capitalist Ruins, by the American anthropologist Anna Tsing. Tsing takes as her subject one of the “strangest commodity chains of our times”: that of the matsutake, supposedly the most valuable fungus in the world, which grows best in “human-disturbed forests”. Written in what she calls “a riot of short chapters, like the flushes of mushrooms that come up after rain”, Tsing’s book describes a contemporary “nature” that is hybrid and multiply interbound. Her ecosystems stretch from wood-wide webs of mycelia, through earthworms and pine roots, to logging trucks and hedge funds – as well as down into the flora of our own multispecies guts. Tsing’s account of nature thus overcomes what Jacques Rancière has called the “partition of the sensible”, by which he means the traditional division of matter into “life” and “not-life”. Like Skelton in his recent Beyond the Fell Wall (2015), and the poet Sean Borodale, Tsing is interested in a vibrant materialism that acknowledges the agency of stones, ores and atmospheres, as well as humans and other organisms.
Tsing is also concerned with the possibility of what she calls “collaborative survival” in the Anthropocene-to-come. As Evans Calder Williams notes, the Anthropocene imagination “crawls with narratives of survival”, in which varying conditions of resource scarcity exist, and varying kinds of salvage are practised. Our contemporary appetite for environmental breakdown is colossal, tending to grotesque: from Cormac McCarthy’s The Road (2006) – now almost an Anthropocene ur-text – through films such as The Survivalist and the Mad Max franchise, to The Walking Dead and the Fallout video game series.
The worst of this collapse culture is artistically crude and politically crass. The best is vigilant and provocative: Simon Ings’ Wolves (2014), for instance, James Bradley’s strange and gripping Clade (2015), or Paul Kingsnorth’s The Wake (2014), a post-apocalyptic novel set in the “blaec”, “brok” landscape of 11th-century England, that warns us not to defer our present crisis. I think also of Clare Vaye Watkins’s glittering Gold Fame Citrus (2015), which occurs in a drought-scorched American southwest and includes a field-guide to the neo-fauna of this dunescape: the “ouroboros rattlesnake”, the “Mojave ghost crab”.
Such scarcity narratives unsettle what we might call the Holocene delusion on which growth economics is founded: of the Earth as an infinite body of matter, there for the incredible ultra-machine of capitalism to process, exploit and discard without heed of limit. Meanwhile, however, speculative novelists – Andy Weir in The Martian, Kim Stanley Robinson in Red Mars – foresee how we will overcome terrestrial shortages by turning to asteroid mining or the terra-forming of Mars. To misquote Fredric Jameson, it is easier to imagine the extraction of off-planet resources than it is to imagine the end of capitalism.
The novel is the cultural form to which the Anthropocene arguably presents most difficulties, and most opportunities. Historically, the novel has been celebrated for its ability to represent human interiority: the skull-to-skull skip of free indirect style, or the vivid flow of stream-of-consciousness. But what use are such skills when addressing the enormity of this new epoch? Any Anthropocene-aware novel finds itself haunted by impersonal structures, and intimidated by the limits of individual agency. China Miéville’s 2011 short story “Covehithe” cleverly probes and parodies these anxieties. In a near-future Suffolk, animate oil rigs haul themselves out of the sea, before drilling down into the coastal strata to lay dozens of rig eggs. These techno-zombies prove impervious to military interventions: at last, all that humans can do is become spectators, snapping photos of the rigs and watching live feeds from remote cameras as they give birth – an Anthropocene Springwatch.
Most memorable to me is Jeff VanderMeer’s 2014 novel, Annihilation. It describes an expedition into an apparently poisoned region known as Area X, in which relic human structures have been not just reclaimed but wilfully redesigned by a mutated nature. A specialist team is sent to survey the zone. They discover archive caches and topographically anomalous buildings including a “Tower” that descends into the earth rather than jutting from it. The Tower’s steps are covered in golden slime, and on its walls crawls a “rich greenlike moss” that inscribes letters and words on the masonry – before entering and authoring the bodies of the explorers themselves. It gradually becomes apparent that Area X, in all its weird wildness, is actively transforming the members of the expedition who have been sent to subdue it with science. As such, VanderMeer’s novel brilliantly reverses the hubris of the Anthropocene: instead of us leaving the world post-natural, it suggests, the world will leave us post-human.

As the idea of the Anthropocene has surged in power, so its critics have grown in number and strength. Cultural and literary studies currently abound with Anthropocene titles: most from the left, and often bitingly critical of their subject. The last 12 months have seen the publication of Jedediah Purdy’s After Nature: A Politics for the Anthropocene, McKenzie Wark’s provocative Molecular Red: Theory for the Anthropocene and the environmental historian Jason W Moore’s important Capitalism in the Web of Life. Last July the “revolutionary arts and letters quarterly” Salvage launched with an issue that included Daniel Hartley’s essay “Against the Anthropocene” and Miéville, superbly, on despair and environmental justice in the new epoch.
Across these texts and others, three main objections recur: that the idea of the Anthropocene is arrogant, universalist and capitalist-technocratic. Arrogant, because the designation of the Anthropocene – the “New Age of Humans” – is our crowning act of self-mythologisation (we are the super-species, we the Prometheans, we have ended nature), and as such only embeds the narcissist delusions that have produced the current crisis.
Universalist, because the Anthropocene assumes a generalised anthropos, whereby all humans are equally implicated and all equally affected. As Purdy, Miéville and Moore point out, “we” are not all in the Anthropocene together – the poor and the dispossessed are far more in it than others. “Wealthy countries,” writes Purdy, “create a global landscape of inequality in which the wealthy find their advantages multiplied … In this neoliberal Anthropocene, free contract within a global market launders inequality through voluntariness.”
Perhaps the Anthropocene has already become an anthropomeme: its presence in popular discourse just a virtue signal
And capitalist-technocratic, because the dominant narrative of the Anthropocene has technology as its driver: recent Earth history reduced to a succession of inventions (fire, the combustion engine, the synthesis of plastic, nuclear weaponry). The monolithic concept bulk of this scientific Anthropocene can crush the subtleties out of both past and future, disregarding the roles of ideology, empire and political economy. Such a technocratic narrative will also tend to encourage technocratic solutions: geoengineering as a quick-fix for climate change, say, or the Anthropocene imagined as a pragmatic problem to be managed, such that “Anthropocene science” is translated smoothly into “Anthropocene policy” within existing structures of governance. Moore argues that the Anthropocene is not the geology of a species at all, but rather the geology of a system, capitalism – and as such should be rechristened the Capitalocene.
There are signs that we will soon be exhausted by the Anthropocene: glutted by its ubiquity as a cultural shorthand, fatigued by its imprecisions, and enervated by its variant names – the “Anthrobscene”, the “Misanthropocene”, the “Lichenocene” (actually, that last one is mine). Perhaps the Anthropocene has already become an anthropomeme: punned and pimped into stuplimity, its presence in popular discourse often just a virtue signal that merely mandates the user to proceed with the work of consumption.
I think, though, that the Anthropocene has administered – and will administer – a massive jolt to the imagination. Philosophically, it is a concept that does huge work both for us and on us. In its unsettlement of the entrenched binaries of modernity (nature and culture; object and subject), and its provocative alienation of familiar anthropocentric scales and times, it opens up rather than foreclosing progressive thought. What Christophe Bonneuil calls the “shock of the Anthropocene” is generating new political arguments, new modes of behaviour, new narratives, new languages and new creative forms. It asserts – as Jeremy Davies writes at the end of his excellent forthcoming book, The Birth of the Anthropocene – a “pressing need to re-imagine human and nonhuman life outside the confines of the Holocene”, while also asking “how best to keep faith with the web of relationships, dependencies, and symbioses that made up the planetary system of the dying epoch”. Systemic in its structure, the Anthropocene charges us with systemic change.

In 1981 the research field of “nuclear semiotics” was born. A group of interdisciplinary experts was tasked with preventing future humans from intruding on to a subterranean storage facility for radioactive waste, then under construction in the New Mexico desert. The half-life of plutonium-239 is around 24,100 years; the written history of humanity is around 5,000 years old. The challenge facing the group was how to devise a sign system that could semantically survive even catastrophic phases of planetary future, and that could communicate with an unknown humanoid-to-be.
Several proposals involved forms of hostile architecture: a “landscape of thorns” in which 15m-high concrete pillars with jutting side spikes impeded access; a maze of sharp black rock blocks that absorbed solar energy to become impassably hot. But such aggressive structures can act as enticements rather than cautions, suggesting here be treasure rather than here be dragons. Prince Charming hacked his way through the briars to wake Sleeping Beauty. Indiana Jones braved wooden spikes and rolling boulders to reach the golden idol in a booby-trapped Peruvian temple. Sometimes I wonder if the design task should be handed wholesale to the team behind the Ikea instruction manuals: if they can convey in pictograms how to put up a Billy bookcase anywhere in the world, they can surely tell someone in 10,000 years’ time not to dig in a certain place.
The New Mexico facility is due to be sealed in 2038. The present plans for marking the site involve a berm with a core of salt, enclosing the above-ground footprint of the repository. Buried in the berm will be radar reflectors, magnets and a “Storage Room”, constructed around a stone slab too big to be removed via the chamber entrance. Data will be inscribed on to the slab including maps, time lines, and scientific details of the waste and its risks, written in all current official UN languages, and in Navajo: “This site was known as the WIPP (Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Site) when it was closed in 2038 AD … Do not expose this room unless the information centre messages are lost. Leave the room buried for future generations.” Discs made of ceramic, clay, glass and metal, also engraved with warnings, will be embedded in the soil and the shaft seals. Finally, a “hot cell”, or radiation containment chamber, will be constructed: a reinforced concrete structure extending 60 feet above the earth and 30 feet down into it: VanderMeer’s “Tower” made real.
I think of that configuration of berm, chamber, shaft, disc and hot cell – all set atop the casks of pulsing radioactive molecules entombed deep in the Permian strata – as perhaps our purest Anthropocene architecture. And I think of those multiply repeated incantations – pitched somewhere between confession, caution and black mass; leave the room buried for future generations, leave the room buried for future generations … – as perhaps our most perfected Anthropocene text.

Over 55% of global carbon emissions and 55 countries must formally join for it to apply from 2020. China and the US account for about 40%.
Brian Deese, special adviser on climate change to President Obama said swift approval would keep efforts to curb emissions on track.
“The two largest economies and two largest emitters are saying we are not going to wait, not just sign on the first day, but join much more quickly than has been historical practice,” he told a press briefing.
Coming on the sidelines of a nuclear summit in Washington DC, the announcement also stated a commitment to clinch agreements to phase down super-warming gases and on aviation emissions.
A US-China deal struck in September 2014 is credited with igniting momentum on climate change in the build-up to Paris. China committed to peak its emissions “around 2030”, while the US pledged a 26-28% cut by 2025 compared with 2005 levels.
Deese dismissed concerns that the stalled nature of the US’ flagship climate policy, the clean power plan, would erode trust in its ability to meet its commitments.
And with a slew of climate records broken in recent months, outgoing US climate envoy Todd Stern said speed was now essential. “Paris gives us a chance, it puts us on the right path … There’s no time to lose,” he said.
Liz Gallagher, head of climate diplomacy at UK advocacy group E3G said the relationship was instrumental in securing a strong outcome in Paris.
“It’s fantastic that this relationship is continuing. They won’t be the first off the starting blocks, as Fiji, Palau and the Marshall Islands are off,” she said.
“But China and the US are certainly the biggest and it really gets us over the first hurdle, we now need others to limber up and come on in.”
Alden Meyer, director of policy and strategy at the US Union for Concerned Scientists said: “Their joint commitment to join the Paris agreement ‘as early as possible this year’ sends a strong signal to other countries, as does the mention of continuing efforts by both countries to steer investment flows away from carbon-intensive technologies like coal.
“Given China’s current leadership role in the G20, the call for “strong climate and clean energy outcomes” at the Hangzhou summit in September is also significant, though much work remains to be done to achieve those outcomes.”
Greenpeace China climate policy analyst Li Shuo welcomed the countries’ cooperation on efforts to regulate aviation emissions ahead of a crunch meeting in Montreal in September.
“Challenging questions in the Montreal process, ICAO’s effort to regulate emissions from international aviation, and the G20 can not be unlocked without close cooperation between China and the US. We look forward to see this bilateral relationship contributing to these processes in the same way it helped to achieve the successful outcome of the Paris agreement.”"

Or even vegan restaurants? Now it’s barely worth noting when there are so many other free-from options to trumpet. 
From chains such as Wahaca, which has announced that it is carbon-neutral, all the way to Michelin-starred restaurants, in the last few months an ever-growing number of places are accentuating the negatives – the things you won’t find at their restaurants – over what you will. 
Market researchers Mintel forecast sales of free-from foods to grow 13% to reach £521m in 2016, up from an estimated £470m in 2015. In part, this is because some of us don’t have a choice and have to find free-from ways to eat; the growing number of gluten-free restaurants is great news for those who are coeliac. But while we clearly need to do more to cater for different dietary requirements, is omission a virtue in and of itself?
Victoria Hall, the owner of gluten-free restaurant 2 Oxford Place in Leeds, has found that for many people, it is. “When we opened two years ago, our clientele was almost all coeliac diners. Now maybe 60% of our diners can eat gluten, but come because it’s more that the food just happens to be free-from, but is still great.”
Chef Dominic Teague found the same thing; last year he said that his restaurant Indigo had secretly gone both gluten- and dairy-free without anyone noticing. “There’s not been one negative comment,” he says. “Our sales have gone up 30% since December, which speaks for itself, really.” He believes this is because even if most people don’t have an intolerance, they know someone who does, and want to be able to eat without the hassle of having to ask. “People come because they know everyone can eat anything from the menu. People with an intolerance are saying they feel normal, which is wonderful.”
No one would suggest that Wahaca had made a bad move by being the first restaurant chain to go carbon-neutral, though it inevitably has had an impact on the food it is able to serve. “Where possible, we’ve found English equivalents,” says the group’s founder Thomasina Miers. This means English-grown Mexican vegetables such as poblano peppers and tomatillos, among others. “Of course, we can’t always find a carbon-neutral way to deliver all our Mexican favourites, and so there are some things, such as tuna and octopus, that are popular in traditional Mexican dishes that we aren’t able to add on to our menu. But people care more about where their food comes from, and the impact it has on the environment. Because of that, we’ve worked hard to minimise our carbon footprint.”
Tom Hunt, the owner and head chef of Poco in Bristol has also had to make changes to the kinds of food he serves to become impact-free on the environment. Along with restaurants such as Silo in Brighton, his restaurant is one of a growing number aiming to be 100% waste-free. “We recycle and compost 95% or more of all our products,” he says, “and we’re always trying to think of new ways to reduce our recycling and compost, working with suppliers and getting thriftier in the kitchen. We don’t really see it all as waste any more. To us, they’re vital resources.”
Though there’s clearly an environmental imperative for food that’s organic/pesticide-free, and for meat-free eating, what has galvanised some restaurants to offer more stripped-back menus perhaps has more to do with the current fashion for “clean eating”. “People want to know what they are eating is good for them, without having to second-guess what’s in their food,” says Lily Simpson, founder of the Detox Kitchen in London.
Noemi Takacsne opened Deserve, a gluten- and sugar-free restaurant in Aberdeen after losing 30kg over 18 months by cutting both out of her diet. “I felt so energised by it, and I thought people in Aberdeen deserved the chance to eat this way, too,” she says. “We get lots of people with intolerances, and diabetics, as well as athletes, and people who know we are different and want to try it.”
But if you strip back food to extremes, what’s left? Newly opened London dessert restaurant Yorica! is free from the main allergens, including dairy, lactose, gluten, nuts and eggs. “We wanted to offer treats both for people with dietary requirements and people looking for a healthier option without compromising on taste,” says the manager, Monika Jagielo.
But Yasmine Larizadeh, one of the founders of The Good Life Eatery, which has three branches across London, doesn’t believe you ought to exclude things from the menu or limiting people’s dining choices to be inclusive. “When we opened, we wanted to have places where you can eat vegan, gluten-free, paleo, or none of the above, and still eat something delicious and satisfying.”
So if it means small children can enjoy ice-cream, more of your friends can sit at a table and share a meal together without anxiety, and that careful sourcing makes our food more sustainable, is free-from dining better all round? Or is a “free-from” approach a kind of food propaganda that deprives us of choice? Let us know below the line. "

I needed some strong convincing from my wife when it came time for us to make it. Most of my reluctance was self-interested: I liked my life well enough, and I didn’t want to change it. My wife talked about feeling a biological imperative, which I had no answer for. Who was I to stand in the way of something like that? I signed on. 
But there is a whole other potential person to consider, too – the new life that you are bringing into the world without asking first.
It’s not really fair. For while the world is a wonderful place, one we humans have made nicer for ourselves with wonderful inventions like books and record players, penicillin and pizza, it’s also a really awful place, one we’ve ravaged with deforestation and smog, nuclear weapons and mountains of pizza delivery boxes and other garbage. 
The awfulness seems to be getting worse, especially now that climate change has sped up – sea level rise that was supposed to take centuries has recently been projected as taking just decades. This complicates the already difficult decision of whether to have a kid. 
We’re living through what scientists call the “Sixth Extinction”, an era of precipitous decline in the number of species able to live on the planet. The last mass extinction, the fifth, happened 66 million years ago, when a giant asteroid crashed into Earth and 76% of all the species on the planet perished.
This time, we’re doing it to ourselves. 
“Climate scientists agree that humanity is about to cause a sea level rise of 20 or 30ft, but they have tended to assume that such a large increase would take centuries, at least,” the New York Times’s Justin Gillis reported. But a recent study led by retired Nasa climate scientist James E Hansen, published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, indicates that the negative effects are happening a lot faster than we’d thought, perhaps feet of rise within the next 50 years.
“That would mean loss of all coastal cities, most of the world’s large cities and all their history,” Hansen told Gillis, adding, “We’re in danger of handing young people a situation that’s out of their control.” 
Imagine that: New York, Tokyo, Mumbai, Shanghai, Bangkok, Amsterdam, Miami would go first. Think about the implications. Global economic collapse, famine, border disputes, wars. Jesus, just the inland traffic. 
Thinking about the horrific future scientists predict hurts a very specific part of me, a part of me that I only first learned was there when I met my newborn son, 11 years ago, as he lay on the tray of the scale where the doctors had just weighed him and counted his fingers and toes.
The moment is wordless, and as mind-blowing as any drug trip I ever took. But my friend Dave, who had kids before me, came closest to capturing its essence while we were talking later that day: it was like having a door open in your brain and stepping through it and realizing that there’s this whole other part of your brain that you never knew was there before. A room, roughly the same size as the part of your brain that you’ve been using all your life, it was vast and mostly empty (like your old brain) but in it I found stuff, inside myself, that I had never known was in there before. 
This creature, this tiny newborn person, was half me. I felt a primordial bond that I’d never felt before, a connection different from anything I’d ever known. And I realized a deep, heavy responsibility: protecting him was instantly the most important job of all my jobs – to keep this thing alive, healthy, happy, thriving. 
Future climate meltdown was already a theoretical concern for future generations: what kind of world would my great-great-grandchildren inhabit? Now it all feels more pressing. How am I going to protect my kid? Was it fair for me to bring him into this world at all? Was it immoral? 
Was I complicit in the damage? I remember every extra paper towel I’ve ever unspooled from the roll, and think about a tree falling in the Amazon, and then think about my son growing up in a gray, dying world – walking towards Kansas on potholed highways. Maybe while trying to protect his own son, like the father in The Road. Will he decide to have a kid? I have foisted upon him a decision even more difficult than my own. It’s all very depressing.
Still, I come down on the side of advocating reproduction. It gets back to the power we have, we humans. Such devastating power, with which we’ve already changed our world so dramatically. Maybe we can change it back, or at least innovate to survive. What if, and this is obviously a huge “if”, some young person, perhaps a certain 11-year-old in a Black Sabbath T-shirt (I highly doubt it, he can rarely remember to take his lunchbox out of his knapsack at the end of the day), perhaps someone who is not yet born, perhaps not yet conceived, is the one super-genius to figure out the invention that could save the planet? 
The ultimate windmill system that can meet all our energy needs and somehow also cool the atmosphere while it works and also spread seeds to grow more trees as it does. And also make pizza. I don’t know. But that’s kind of the point: we don’t know. Maybe it could be something even better than that. 
There’s always maybe. And that’s enough to persevere for."

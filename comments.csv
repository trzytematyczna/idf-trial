I am aware of these ""artist expeditions"" - and I have much hope for them. Because we scientists tend to report back the changes we observe - and thus forget (or with few exceptions, are not able) to report the magnificence which is up there. To be lost. 
I do not quite know how to say the next. We got report for another tourist cruice - ending up with the killing of a polar bear. 
In a way I wish everyone the chance to go and see the beauty of pristine nature - even as it decays under our human actions. But on the other hand, the ""last chance to see"" tourism is also the excess lives we live that is a major reason for the polar bears now having to hunt on land instead on the sea-ice based seal hunting they adapted to. 
It is a double slam that we first melt the sea-ice due to our consumption at home, then see the potential for cruise-ship holidays on the recently de-iced Ocean (polar bear hunting ground) - then taking the light boats to shore - just to be attacked by starving land-locked polar bear - ending with shooting it to death to defend ourselves from the dangers of nature. 
If there is a heart-breaking story - it is this one. Also because it is so universal. 
I would also like to say that after the good walk-through of the history (up to mining) - Svalbard is now a international hub for Arctic research and education. Not only on ground monitoring, but also for global remote sensing data. 
And as architect, I would have liked to read about your take on the classical methods used even for modern buildings (like the University building) - with wood (not concrete) driven down into the permafrost as the most stable fundament). 
And the fact that the little town of Spitsbergen now has pretty much it's entire planning regime being rewritten. 
... Just having written this I notice my own professional bias and genes kicking in, and pretty much destroying what I opened with. 
Us scientists do not report how beautiful it is. We report on the losses and changes we observe. 
That is the reason I am so supportive of these ""artistic expedions"". Someone must remind us how amazing this planet is. This other perspective. 
Thank you for a lovely report from ""78""."

This is particularly noticeable at the outlet glaciers where the continental ice cap meets with the fjords in the Labrador Sea. The rate of ice loss that can be seen with the naked eye and primitive markers was the subject of a book by Alfred Wegener, who made a trek across Greenland in the 1920s. His plan was to set up permanent observing stations across southern Greenland to monitor seasonal ice growth and loss."

I am aware of these ""artist expeditions"" - and I have much hope for them. Because we scientists tend to report back the changes we observe - and thus forget (or with few exceptions, are not able) to report the magnificence which is up there. To be lost. 
I do not quite know how to say the next. We got report for another tourist cruice - ending up with the killing of a polar bear. 
In a way I wish everyone the chance to go and see the beauty of pristine nature - even as it decays under our human actions. But on the other hand, the ""last chance to see"" tourism is also the excess lives we live that is a major reason for the polar bears now having to hunt on land instead on the sea-ice based seal hunting they adapted to. 
It is a double slam that we first melt the sea-ice due to our consumption at home, then see the potential for cruise-ship holidays on the recently de-iced Ocean (polar bear hunting ground) - then taking the light boats to shore - just to be attacked by starving land-locked polar bear - ending with shooting it to death to defend ourselves from the dangers of nature. 
If there is a heart-breaking story - it is this one. Also because it is so universal. 
I would also like to say that after the good walk-through of the history (up to mining) - Svalbard is now a international hub for Arctic research and education. Not only on ground monitoring, but also for global remote sensing data. 
And as architect, I would have liked to read about your take on the classical methods used even for modern buildings (like the University building) - with wood (not concrete) driven down into the permafrost as the most stable fundament). 
And the fact that the little town of Spitsbergen now has pretty much it's entire planning regime being rewritten. 
... Just having written this I notice my own professional bias and genes kicking in, and pretty much destroying what I opened with. 
Us scientists do not report how beautiful it is. We report on the losses and changes we observe. 
That is the reason I am so supportive of these ""artistic expedions"". Someone must remind us how amazing this planet is. This other perspective. 
Thank you for a lovely report from ""78""."

Our guide in Pyramiden (you are not allowed to wander outside alone and he carried a rifle) told us that the previous winter a polar bear had broken into the hotel where they live. While they cowered upstairs it raided the bar eating all the snacks and drinking all the canned beer (which it opened by puncturing the cans with its claws). It then wandered out by the broken window it had got in by."

And Svalbard isn't the pole, it's quite a long way south, even as it's ludicrously far north.
I say stay away !
If we were meant to live on Svalbard, or even just travel there, well there would be supermarkets, football fields, and pubs. I believe there are none at all. The closest supermarket might be Iceland, in fact (I'll have to check a map)."

These journeys must be fascinating, and the author must have had a great old time. But I'll stay down here in the south and read articles like this. Going to the frozen north and dodging lone polar sounds edifying, sure, but not my idea of fun. I imagine the winters must be like Huis Clos, though Huis Clos is probably funnier.
Nevertheless, a facile thought here: as the planet continues to cook, Svalbard might be a good place to live in a few decades."
